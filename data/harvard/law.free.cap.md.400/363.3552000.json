Appellee, the Board of Education for Howard County, administers the How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ard County Public Schools (\u201cHOPS\u201d). During all times relevant to this litigation, A.A. qualified as a \u201cchild with a disability,\u201d pursuant to the IDEA, because she suffered from Bipolar Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d), and Sensory Integration Disorder. As a result, beginning in October 2002, A.A. received special education and certain related services from the HOPS in accordance with an IEP developed and implemented by A.A.\u2019s parents, a special education teacher, a psychologist, an occupational therapist, a behavior specialist, and the principal of Rockburn Elementary School (the IEP Team). The IEP applicable to A.A., under \u201cSpecial Education and Related Services,\u201d listed \u201cInstruction,\u201d \u201cPsychological Services,\u201d and \u201cOccupational Therapy\u201d as the services to be provided by the HOPS.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition to the IEP and the IEP \u201cTeam Meeting Summary\u201d documents, the parents signed a \u201cRequest for Records\u201d form consenting to the release of A.A.\u2019s confidential psychiatric records to the HOPS, expressly conditioned on the parents being informed before the HOPS or its agents and employees contacted A.A.\u2019s psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In accordance with an agreement with the HOPS signed by A.A.\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Harold Eist, the school nurse at Rockburn administered to A.A. two medications, Geodon and Neurontin, during the 2002-03 school year.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>school year, teachers and health room personnel at Rockburn observed A.A. as being lethargic and drowsy, sometimes falling asleep in class and in the health room.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In August 2003, Dr. Eist added another medication, Inderal, to the child\u2019s drug regimen to treat her ADHD and Bi-Polar Disorder. Shortly thereafter, in early October 2003, a school nurse wrote to Dr. Eist to inform him that, at the time A.A. was administered her medications, Rockburn staff observed that, prior to the administration of her medications, A.A. was lethargic and had fallen asleep in class, and that her apical pulse rate was between 110 and 142. The letter explained that, during classroom observations, school health personnel noticed that A.A.\u2019s eyes were closed several times, that she was lying sideways on her desk with her head resting on her arm, had a dazed or staring expression, and appeared not to be focusing on her lessons. As a result, the school nurse requested clarification from Dr. Eist concerning the administration of A.A.\u2019s medications when possible symptoms contraindicating further drug administration were noted and sought boundary standards as to when the medication should be withheld. A copy of this letter was sent to the parents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On 15 October 2003, A.A.\u2019s parents informed Dr. Eist that it was their understanding from the nurse\u2019s letter that the HOPS sought discretion to refrain from administering the child\u2019s medications based upon its physical observations. The parents expressed their disapproval of such a request and asked Dr. Eist to respect A.A.\u2019s right to privacy and provide no further information to the HOPS or its employees regarding A.A.\u2019s medical condition and treatment, absent their prior consent or in the case of a bona fide medical emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Accordingly, in response to the school nurse\u2019s letter, Dr. Eist\u2019s attorney advised her and the HOPS that Dr. Eist would not release A.A.\u2019s confidential medical information unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>there was parental consent or he otherwise was compelled by law to do so. The attorney explained that Dr. Eist would not change the medications prescribed for A.A., the nurse and the HCPS were expected to continue to administer the medications according to Dr. Eist\u2019s orders,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and A.A. should not be removed from class for pulse readings.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On 25 November 2003, Donna Heller, the HCPS\u2019s health services manager, wrote to Dr. Eist (with a copy to the parents) to make clear that neither the nurse nor the HCPS was asking the psychiatrist to change the prescribed medications and emphasizing that, in order to ensure the child\u2019s safety, the request simply was for clarification and standards for when the medications should be withheld based on symptoms noted at the time of administration. According to the health services manager, a registered nurse, she consulted the 2004 Nursing Drug Handbook which dictated that nurses should \u201calways check patient\u2019s apical pulse rate before giving [the] drug (Inderal)\u201d and, \u201cif extremes in pulse rates occur, withhold [the] drug and notify [the] presciber immediately.\u201d She informed Dr. Eist that she consulted with the Maryland Board of Nursing and that counsel for that Board advised that rote administration of the medications without the ability to communicate directly with the prescribing psychiatrist would be inappropriate. The health services manager concluded that, based on the symptoms observed by the nursing staff, combined with a lack of guidance from Dr. Eist and, in the absence of the ability to communicate with him directly, the HCPS\u2019s staff no longer would administer the medication to A.A., beginning on 2 December 2003. Ms. Heller suggested that either of A.A.\u2019s parents would be free to come to Rock-burn and administer the medications to their daughter during the school day.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In response to the HCPS\u2019s letter, A.A.\u2019s parents insisted that the HCPS abide by the psychiatrist\u2019s orders to administer the medications to A.A. during the school day at the prescribed time and in the prescribed dosages. The HCPS refused and reaffirmed to A.A.\u2019s parents that, because the HCPS and Rockburn staff would not administer the medications under the circumstances, they were welcome to come to A.A.\u2019s school to accomplish the tasks on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">On 9 June 2004, A.A.\u2019s parents filed a request for a due process hearing under the provisions of the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart, asserting that the HCPS\u2019s refusal to administer the three medications in accordance with Dr. Eist\u2019s instructions constituted a denial of A.A.\u2019s FAPE. They sought an administrative order requiring the HCPS to abide by Dr. Eist\u2019s medical directives and administer the medication to A.A. during the school day.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">At the outset of the due process hearing before the ALJ, the HCPS\u2019s attorney challenged the ALJ\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under the IDEA to consider the issues presented in the parents\u2019 hearing request. The ALJ ordered the HCPS to file its motion to dismiss in writing and continued the hearing. Shortly thereafter, the HCPS submitted a Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative Motion for Summary Decision for failure to state a claim under the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The HCPS argued that, under the IDEA and Maryland law, a due process hearing may be conducted only when the dispute pertains to the \u201cidentification, evaluation, or placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\u201d The parents\u2019 due process request, however, did not implicate any of the four categories of appropriate jurisdiction for the ALJ because the dispute did not concern A.A.\u2019s special education rights. Rather, the HCPS claimed that the only issue presented by the dispute was whether the HCPS\u2019s action exceeded the standard of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>applicable to the nursing profession when it insisted that the school employee designated to administer the drugs be allowed to consult with the treating physician in order to obtain clarification and boundaries for when the medication should be withheld based on symptoms noted at the time of administration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Conversely, A.A.\u2019s parents argued on her behalf that the issue was whether the HCPS acted reasonably in demanding that the parents waive their and A.A.\u2019s medical privacy rights<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in exchange for the continuation of the administration of medication to a child which, the HCPS conceded, generally would be considered a \u201crelated service\u201d under the IDEA. The parents maintained that they were prepared to disprove the factual predicate upon which the HCPS relied, namely, the effect of the medications on A.A. and the potential ramifications of discontinuing the medication regime.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In granting the HCPS\u2019s motion to dismiss, the ALJ emphasized that \u201cwhile the rights of parents and guardians are extensive, the scope of due process hearings is limited to \u2018complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the provision of a free, appropriate education to such child.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ALJ found that the complaint did not allege that there was any dispute as to the proper identification of A.A. as a \u201cchild with a disability,\u201d her evaluation, or her educational placement. Further, the ALJ found that the issue presented involved \u201cthe rights of the Parents to control the release of medical information about their child against the right of nurses to speak to the treating physician when administering medication the physician prescribed,\u201d rather than the \u201cprovision of a free appropriate public education.\u201d The ALJ determined that this issue raised a medical treatment, or ethical, question, rather than a special education one. Therefore, the dispute raised in the parent\u2019s complaint fell outside of the scope of the IDEA, depriving the ALJ of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the ALJ dismissed the parents\u2019 due process complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Upon the parents\u2019 petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order dismissing the parents\u2019 IDEA claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Circuit Court found that the issue was not whether A.A. requires medication to participate in her education but rather, whether the school has the right to request additional direction from the child\u2019s treating/prescribing physician. The court determined that this issue was not covered by the provisions of the IDEA and, thus, the ALJ correctly dismissed the parents\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">A.A.\u2019s parents noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Appellants, in their brief to the intermediate appellate court, posed the issue as whether the ALJ had subject matter jurisdiction under the IDEA or the Education Article to compel the HCPS to provide the medication as a \u201crelated service\u201d that had been arranged in conjunction with a negoti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ated IEP. We, <em>on our </em>initiative, issued a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals before it decided the appeal in this case. 397 Md. 107, 916 A.2d 256 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision according to the same statutory standards<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as did the circuit court. <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub.

Although we often will give considerable weight to the agency\u2019s experience in interpreting a statute that it administers, <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d at 1154, it is within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, and to remedy the situation if found to be wrong. <em>Schwartz, </em>385 Md. at 554, 870 A.2d at 180; <em>Christopher v.

They believe that the dispute in this case relates to the \u201cidentification, evaluation, or placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child,\u201d and thus falls within the class of issues to be addressed through the procedural protections provided by the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart. As a threshold issue, we must determine whether, as Appellee claims, the absence of an \u201cadministration of medication\u201d provision from the four corners of A.A.\u2019s IEP precludes necessarily any complaint based on provision of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>Omission of Administration of Medication from the IEP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The provision of a FAPE, which a state must satisfy with respect to all disabled children, necessarily includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>personalized instruction and such supportive services as are \u201creasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. v.

As discussed previously, the IEP serves as the blueprint for the special education services provided to disabled children to ensure their proper access to a FAPE.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Appellee relies heavily on the fact that \u201cadministration of medication\u201d is not enumerated in A.A.\u2019s IEP as a \u201crelated service\u201d to be provided by the HOPS. The HOPS claims that, while the IDEA contemplates generally the administration of medication as a potential \u201crelated service,\u201d not every disabled child is entitled to every potential \u201crelated service\u201d mentioned in the IDEA. Instead, it argues, the \u201crelated services\u201d due a child are restricted to those contained in his or her particular IEP, which presumably is tailored to his or her special circumstances, unless or until the child\u2019s parents petition to have an additional service added. Simply put, the HOPS contends that, because A.A.\u2019s IEP does not enumerate the administration of medication as a specific \u201crelated service\u201d in her case, she is not entitled to such a service under the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In response, A.A.\u2019s parents point to the October 2002 IEP Team Meeting, at which they signed forms<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that reflected the parties\u2019 agreement that the HOPS would administer Indural, Geodon, and Nurontin at 12:30 p.m. each school day. The parents argue that, by signing these forms, the HOPS was agreeing to provide the medications to A.A. as a service related to A.A.\u2019s special education plan, notwithstanding there being no mention of the administration of these medications in the IEP itself. Therefore, according to the parents, the provision of A.A.\u2019s medications should be considered effectively as part of A.A.\u2019s IEP. They also contend that, for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, the HOPS twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>conceded that it was obligated to administer the medications to A.A. as a \u201crelated service.\u201d Because we hold that a \u201crelated service\u201d need not be included necessarily in the child\u2019s IEP in order to form the basis for a due process complaint, we forgo a determination on this record whether the \u201cadministration of medication\u201d was included implicitly in A.A.\u2019s IEP. This conclusion comports not only with relevant case law, but with the overarching purpose of the IDEA to ensure that all disabled children have access to a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court supports our conclusion that the administration of medication constitutes a \u201crelated service,\u201d whether mentioned in an IEP or not. In <em>Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, </em>468 U.S. 883, 104 S.Ct. 3371, 82 L.Ed.2d 664 (1984), the Supreme Court considered whether a school board was required by the IDEA to provide clean intermittent catheterization (\u201cCIC\u201d) to a child with a disability, even though the service was not contained in her IEP. 468 U.S. at 885, 104 S.Ct. at 3373. The Court outlined a two-step process to determine whether the school must provide a \u201crelated service.\u201d The first step is to consider whether the service is a \u201csupportive service ... required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education,\u201d and the second step is to determine whether the service is excluded from this definition as a \u201cmedical service\u201d serving purposes other than diagnosis or evaluation. <em>Tatro, </em>468 U.S. at 890, 104 S.Ct. at 3375-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The <em>Tatro </em>Court concluded that the child required a CIC in order to remain in class and benefit from her special education program and that the service could be \u201cperformed in a few minutes by a layperson with less than an hour\u2019s training.\u201d <em>Tatro, </em>468 U.S. at 885-88, 104 S.Ct. at 3373-75. Therefore, the Court affirmed the order of the District Court, mandating that the board of education modify the child\u2019s IEP to include the provision of CIC during school hours. <em>Tatro, </em>468 U.S. at 888, 104 S.Ct. at 3375.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., </em>526 U.S. 66, 119 S.Ct. 992, 143 L.Ed.2d 154 (1999), the parents of a ventilator-dependent child, who required constant individual services throughout the school day, requested that the school district accept financial responsibility for the child\u2019s health care services. <em>Cedar Rapids, </em>526 U.S. at 69-70, 119 S.Ct. at 995-96. The district denied the request, claiming it was not legally obligated to provide continuous, one-on-one nursing services. <em>Cedar Rapids, </em>526 U.S. at 70, 119 S.Ct. at 996. Following its decision in <em>Tatro, </em>the Court held that the school district could only refuse to provide medical services which inherently must be performed by a physician. <em>Cedar Rapids, </em>526 U.S. at 74, 119 S.Ct. at 997 (citing <em>Tatro, </em>468 U.S. at 892-94, 104 S.Ct. at 3377-78). Although the child\u2019s IEP did not contain any reference to \u201cadministration of medication,\u201d the district was held to be required to provide the child\u2019s service because the individualized care requested did not demand the training, knowledge, and judgment of a licensed physician and was necessary for the child to access her FAPE. <em>Cedar Rapids, </em>526 U.S. at 74, 119 S.Ct. at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Tatro </em>and <em>Cedar Rapids </em>suggest that an IEP does not take the form of a strict contractual relationship between the parties and is not the be-all-end-all of those services, and only those services, which must be provided to a disabled child. The HCPS, in its brief, advances this very claim, relying on <em>Ms. K., Mother and Next Friend of S.B. v. City of South Portland, </em>407 F.Supp.2d 290, 301 (D.Me.2006), to explain that an IEP is not governed by the law of contracts and is not itself a legally binding contract. In this regard, it is entirely correct. Because an IEP is not evaluated as if it were a fully-integrated contract, an appropriate administrative body, here the ALJ, could order, based on a due process complaint, the IEP to be modified so that it is \u201creasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 207, 102 S.Ct. at 3051. While an IEP document may reflect the discussions and educational plan contemplated for a disabled child, a school district is nonetheless required to provide the child with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>FAPE, which includes personalized instruction and such supportive services as are necessary to fulfill the underlying purpose of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Thus, the fact that A.A.\u2019s IEP does not acknowledge explicitly A.A.\u2019s entitlement to the administration of medication is not determinative in this case. The absence of an administration of medication provision from A.A.\u2019s IEP does not portend that such a service is not required by the IDEA. Rather, <em>Tatro </em>and <em>Rowley </em>stand for the proposition that if. a particular service necessary for a disabled child to access their FAPE is absent from their IEP, such a shortcoming or oversight may not be used to defeat a disabled child\u2019s otherwise legitimate claim under the IDEA. We agree with A.A.\u2019s parents that the provision of a FAPE necessarily includes the provision of all \u201crelated services\u201d contemplated by the IDEA and others reasonably calculated to be necessary for the child to benefit from his or her specialized education. In both <em>Tatro </em>and <em>Cedar Rapids, </em>the related services were not outlined in the children\u2019s IEP\u2019s, yet the Supreme Court nonetheless required the school boards in those cases to provide the services and allowed claims for such unrecognized services to form the basis of IDEA due process complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We recognize that, generally, a court should not intervene in questions of educational policy so long as a school district has offered a program of specialized services reasonably calculated to enable a child to receive educational benefit. <em>Gill v. Columbia 93 Sch. Dist., </em>217 F.3d 1027, 1037 (8th Cir.2000). Here, it is undisputed that A.A. generally requires these medications (at some dosage strength) in order to have a chance to function more normally in the classroom setting and attain the benefits of her special education, thus meeting the definition of \u201csupportive services.\u201d Justifying withholding the medications from A.A. simply because the service is not enumerated in her IEP would be contrary to the principle that a school must provide the services that enable the child to benefit from special education. Additionally, the record here reflects that the medications easily can be provided by some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>one other than a trained physician, such as a school nurse, and therefore are not an excluded \u201cmedical service.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, under the apparent facts in this case, the administration of these medications to A.A. would be a \u201crelated service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\n<em>Application of the IDEA to the Parties\u2019 Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The parties\u2019 dispute consists essentially of whether school nurses who administer medications to A.A. should have the ability to communicate directly with the prescribing physician or whether her parents have the power to restrict access to the physician until they are contacted and approve of any specific contact with that physician. In determining whether the ALJ who heard this dispute under the IDEA erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we must explore the language and legislative intent of the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart in order to resolve whether the legislative schemes contemplate claims such as Appellants\u2019 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\n<em>Legislative Purpose of the IDEA and its Maryland Counterpart</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">In enacting the IDEA, Congress intended \u201cto open the door of public education\u201d to all qualified children and \u201crequire participating States to educate handicapped children with nonhandicapped children whenever possible.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 192, 202, 102 S.Ct. at 3043, 3049. The IDEA was meant to assist the large number of disabled children who were \u201ceither totally excluded from schools or sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \u2018drop out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schaffer v.

Accordingly, states must provide \u201can appropriate education designed to meet the specific needs of the handicapped child at no cost to that child\u2019s parent.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-168, at 10 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1425,1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The touchstone of the IDEA is the actual provision of a FAPE. <em>Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of Mannassas, </em>141 F.3d 524, 527 (4th Cir.1998). To advance this goal, Congress, in the IDEA, provided a panoply of procedural rights to parents to ensure their involvement in decisions about their disabled child\u2019s education. <em>Id. </em>At the apex of these procedural rights is an impartial due process hearing in which aggrieved parents may air their complaints, with respect to their disabled child\u2019s identification, evaluation, placement, and receipt of a FAPE. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction under the IDEA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Subject matter jurisdiction is the court\u2019s ability to adjudicate a controversy of a particular kind. <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 654, 671, 116 S.Ct. 1638, 1647, 134 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996). If, by the law that defines the authority of the court, a judicial body is given the power to render a judgment over that class of cases within which a particular case falls, the court has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Sec., </em>272 Md. 329, 335, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The powers of the OAH and its ALJ\u2019s are measured by the granting statute. <em>Boyd v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>57 Md.App. 603, 608, 471 A.2d 749, 751 (1984). An ALJ cannot enlarge agency jurisdiction, nor may subject matter jurisdiction be conferred upon the agency by the courts or the parties before the OAH. <em>Boyd, </em>57 Md.App. at 608, 471 A.2d at 751-52. The scope of an administrative hearing is limited to the matters contained in the \u201ccomplaint\u201d filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>triggering the hearing. <em>County of San Diego v. Cal. Special Educ. Hearing Office, </em>93 F.3d 1458, 1465 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In the instant case, the ALJ concluded \u201cas a matter of law, that the Parents\u2019 request for an administrative order requiring HOPS officials to administer the Child medication without the right of school officials to consult the physician in order to obtain clarification and parameters of when the medication should be withheld based on symptoms noted at the time of administration be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the IDEA or Maryland special education law,\u201d because the dispute was outside of his statutory jurisdiction to hear only special education complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">A.A.\u2019s parents maintain that the ALJ had subject matter jurisdiction under the IDEA and/or the Maryland Education Article to compel the HCPS to provide medication to A.A., on the terms dictated by them, because the administration of medication is a \u201crelated service.\u201d Accordingly, the HCPS\u2019s discontinuation of administration of A.A.\u2019s medications falls into the ALJ\u2019s jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning \u201cany matter relating to the ... provision of a free appropriate public education to [a] child.\u201d They argue that if the IDEA, or any of the regulations issued pursuant to it, encompass the administration of medication, then the OAH has the authority to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute. Referring to <em>Sellers, </em>the parents argue that, when a school system seeks to change a child\u2019s identification, evaluation, placement, or receipt of a free appropriate public education, the parents are entitled to \u201cair [those] complaints to an \u2018impartial due process hearing.\u2019 \u201d 141 F.3d at 527. The parents essentially contend that the HCPS\u2019s action constitutes a refusal or change of a related service, or the imposition of unjustified conditions on the delivery of such service, entitling them to a due process hearing under the IDEA to challenge that action. Were it otherwise, they claim the IDEA would be transformed from a cooperative process to a situation where a school board may dictate unilateral changes in the delivery of related services to disabled children.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Appellee insists that the ALJ\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is limited to the four categories outlined in the IDEA statute, namely, disputes concerning the identification, evaluation, and placement of a disabled child, or the provision of a FAPE to that child. Accordingly, it contends that this particular dispute, concerning the right of parents of a disabled child to require a school to contact them for approval before speaking to the child\u2019s treating psychiatrist regarding the consequences of administering medication, falls outside of that jurisdiction. The HOPS argues that its request for the nurse to contact the psychiatrist did not constitute the imposition of a change regarding the administration of medication, but instead was a request for clarification of how and when decisions may be arrived at for withholding medication should observed conditions warrant that. It claims that the simple fact that the IDEA deems the administration of medication potentially a related service does not mean necessarily that any dispute that is somehow related to the provision of that related service is within the jurisdiction of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We disagree with the parents\u2019 contention that the particular dispute in this case sufficiently touches and concerns a \u201crelated service\u201d within the contemplation of the regulatory scheme. The dispute in this case is not so much over the administration of medications to a child, which the HOPS concedes is deemed generally a \u201crelated service\u201d contemplated by the IDEA, but instead relates to the ability of a child\u2019s parents to regulate communications between the school personnel designated to administer the drugs and the child\u2019s treating/prescribing psychiatrist. The IDEA does not intend to address claims such as these, even had the ALJ concluded that the administration of medication inferentially was provided for as a \u201crelated service\u201d in A.A.\u2019s IEP. The dispute in this case involves a medical treatment issue, not a special education one. As a result, the controversy resides outside of the expertise and training of an ALJ who adjudicates disputes regarding the IDEA. Allowing parties to use the IDEA as the mechanism for trying such disputes would open the doors to lawsuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>under the IDEA for a multitude of matters unrelated to the proper scope of special education.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The HOPS, under normal circumstances, has not refused to administer A.A.\u2019s medication. It only refused to do so in the absence of the ability to consult directly and freely with A.A.\u2019s treating/prescribing psychiatrist where the school nursing staff observed what they believed were potentially harmful side effects of the medications or contraindications to the continued administration of the drugs. Had the HOPS refused flatly to administer the medications under any circumstances, and A.A. needed the medications to benefit from her special education, subject matter jurisdiction over such a dispute likely would exist. When the issue, as here, however, deals principally with medical and ethical concerns, rather than those touching on special education, the IDEA provides no jurisdiction to resolve disputes through the due process complaint process.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Appellee\u2019s position reflects its concern about potential liability if it administers blindly drugs to students without the ability to contact physicians regarding withholding the drugs if circumstances suggest it prudent to do so. The school nurse arguably sees A.A. as or more frequently than Dr. Eist and, therefore, also may have a valid opinion as to the matter of the administration of A.A.\u2019s medications. Unlike Dr. Eist, the nurse\u2019s assessments, with the added input of classroom observations from concerned teachers, are \u201cbased on daily and continuing observation within the classroom environment.\u201d <em>Christopher M. v. Corpus Christi Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>933 F.2d 1285, 1292 (5th Cir.1991). Based on the nurse\u2019s observations and the school system\u2019s arguably valid liability concerns, the HOPS decided that, in the face of the parents\u2019 concerns and demands, a more reasonable option, which would still allow A.A. to receive her FAPE, would be to have A.A.\u2019s parents administer her medications during the school day, according to Dr. Eist\u2019s orders. <em>See generally Davis v. Francis Howell Sch. Dist. </em>138 F.3d 754, 757 (8th Cir.1998) (holding, in a complaint based on alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>school district\u2019s \u201coffer to allow the [parents] ... to give [the child] his Ritalin during the school day is a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law\u201d because questions of liability could impose a large burden on the school system). These issues raise questions of what constitutes reasonable medical practice, not the provision of \u201crelated services\u201d to a child receiving special education.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Were we to adopt the logic of the parents\u2019 interpretation of the IDEA that a matter relating, however tangentially, to any related service may become the proper basis for an IDEA claim, then administrative proceedings before ALJs may become prolific precursors or parallel proceedings to wrongful death or other tort actions resulting from the improper administration of medication as a related service. Clearly, the IDEA was not meant to provide a forum for the advancement of such claims. <em>See, e.g., Hunter v. Bd. of Educ., </em>292 Md. 481, 484, 439 A.2d 582, 584 (1982) (\u201c[Decisions generally hold that a cause of action seeking damages for acts of negligence in the educational process is precluded by considerations of public policy, among them being the absence of a workable rule of care against which the defendant\u2019s conduct may be measured ... and the extreme burden which would be imposed on the already strained resources of the public school system\u201d); <em>Tabor v. Baltimore City Pub. Sch., </em>138 Md.App. 747, 751, 773 A.2d 628, 630 (2001) (\u201cMaryland does not recognize a tort action seeking damages based on negligent education.\u201d); <em>Sellers, </em>141 F.3d at 527 (holding that \u201cthe purpose of these procedural [due-process] mechanisms is to preserve the right to a free appropriate public education, not to provide a forum for tort-like claims of educational malpractice\u201d); <em>Brown v. Houston Sch. Dist., </em>704 So.2d 1325,1328 (Miss.1997) (holding no valid IDEA claim for failure to meet a child\u2019s educational needs where a special education student, who was sent to the principal\u2019s office for misbehaving, escaped the office, ran outside, and was subsequently found dead nearby the school); <em>Ortega v. Bibb County Sch. Dist., </em>397 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2005) (cataloguing U.S. Courts of Appeals\u2019 agreement on this general principle). In tort-sounding cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the connection to special education would be too attenuated to support a due process claim under the IDEA. Thus, we decline to adopt such a broad reading of the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart as would facilitate such tort-fraught claims being brought under these statutes. The dispute in this case does not touch truly on the provision of the administration of medications as a \u201crelated service,\u201d but is instead about an ethical issue, the need for school nurses to consult directly with prescribing physicians, which is associated only tangentially with a \u201crelated service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The parents argue that the HCPS\u2019s position infringes upon their right to privacy and their fundamental right and liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their child, relying on <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003), and <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 642 A.2d 201 (1994).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is telling that none of the parental autonomy issues addressed in those cases are cognizable as causes of action under the IDEA. The parents also urged that their dispute implicates other issues, such as the doctor-patient privilege and the relative role of doctor vis-a-vis nurse. Congress never intended that these issues would be resolved under the auspices of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finally, A.A.\u2019s parents contend that the ALJ ignored additional facts that they sought, and were prepared, to introduce at the hearing through expert and lay witnesses. For example, the parents claim that, at the hearing, they were prepared to disprove the factual predicate underlying the HCPS\u2019s demand for direct communication with Dr. Eist, namely to prove that A.A.\u2019s symptoms of lethargy were not caused by the medication and that, even if they were, did not merit an interruption in her medication regime. These facts, even viewed in a light most favorable to the parents, simply bolster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>our view that this dispute falls outside the scope of the IDEA as a medical treatment issue, and not a special education issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\n<em>Other Avenues of Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">As the ALJ suggested in this case, \u201credress is available in other forums in disputes of this nature, however, an administrative special education due process hearing is not the appropriate forum in which to resolve such an issue.\u201d Although the parents cannot proceed under the IDEA, other avenues of resolution may be available to them and others similarly situated. In <em>Davis v. Francis Howell School District, </em>a school that had been providing medication to a disabled child, eventually stopped providing the medication when the dosages became higher than the recommended amount. 104 F.3d 204, 205 (8th Cir.1997). The parents filed claims for injunctive relief under the ADA,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \u00a7 504,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and were unsuccessful because they failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Id. </em>While we offer no opinion as to whether A.A.\u2019s parents may fare any better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>than the parents in <em>Davis, </em>the causes of action pursued in that case conceptually are more appropriate avenues for relief than the IDEA. In fact, A.A.\u2019s parents pled these causes of action in the Circuit Court, which dismissed them, without prejudice, because they were original claims brought incorrectly in conjunction with the petition for judicial review.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We affirm the decision of the ALJ dismissing the parents\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the IDEA and its Maryland counterpart. In doing so, we hold first that it is not necessary for the related service to be included in the IEP to form the basis on which parents may bring a due process complaint. When, as here, however, the disputed question is a medical or ethical one, and not a special education issue, an ALJ has the power under the IDEA and related Maryland law to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as falling outside his or her power to decide matters \u201crelating to the identification, evaluation, or placement of a disabled child, or the provision of free appropriate public education to such child.\u201d The ALJ did not err here in dismissing Appellants\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\">.

The parents maintain that, during the October <em>2002 </em>IEP Team Meeting, the IEP Team noted that A.A.\u2019s tremors increased since the preceding school year and arranged for A.A. to receive her new prescription medications during the school day, as part of the IEP. They also claim that, on the day of the IEP Team Meeting, the parties executed an IEP and related documents, including a Team Meeting Summary, a Consent Form for the release of A.A.\u2019s psychiatric records, and a Medication Form, which contemplated the administration by Rockburn staff of medication to A.A. while at school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. According to the parents, these drugs serve to reduce A.A.\u2019s symptoms from her afflictions, which include restlessness, general inattention, and inability to follow through on tasks. The parents claim that these symptoms are health impairments that inhibit or disable A.A. from learning in the usual educational setting. Thus, A.A. requires specialized professionals, administration of medications, and psychiatric, counseling and therapy if she is to receive a FAPE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. It seems the nurse was concerned that A.A.\u2019s lethargy and related conditions might suggest that the strength of the dosages of the about-to-be-administered, or the previously administered dosages of, drugs were the cause of A.A.\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">.

In support of this position, HCPS offered Dr. Eist's attorney\u2019s letter stating that he believed it would not be unreasonable for the HCPS to refuse to administer medication in the absence of the unfettered ability to contact the prescribing physician directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">.

The parents proffer that Dr. Eist was present at the hearing, ready to testify that A.A.'s afflictions impair her educational performance, that these conditions cause cycles of extreme excitement and agitation and extreme sadness or irritability, that the symptoms impair A.A.\u2019s ability to learn in the usual educational setting, that A.A. requires a strict regimen of medications to control her symptoms, that disruption would affect adversely A.A.'s opportunity to receive an appropriate education, and that A.A.\u2019s fluctuations in pulse rate and lethargy were not caused by the medications and do not justify interrupting her medication regimen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. In a complaint intended to serve as a petition for judicial review of the ALJ's decision, A.A.\u2019s parents also brought claims against the HCPS under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Circuit Court dismissed, without prejudice, these other claims against the HCPS because they had been brought improperly as original claims in conjunction with the petition for judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, Repl.Vol.2004, Supp.2006), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-222.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">.
