Judge Martin held a hearing on January 4, 2007, and on February 13, 2007, issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated Rule 8.4(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201cThe following facts have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201c1. November 1995 through August 1996, Angela Floyd (\u2018Respondent\u2019) was employed as Office Manager for the \u2018Office of Attorney Frederick D. Iverson, Columbus, Ohio.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiH\">\u201c2. September 1996, Frederick D. Iverson (\u2018Iverson\u2019) moved to the District of Columbia to join Respondent, who had begun attendance at Georgetown University Law School</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201c3. Respondent and Iverson married each other in 1998 and Respondent chose to continue to use her maiden name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJB\">\u201c4. Iverson started his practice in the District of Columbia in 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201c5. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Maryland on December 14, 1999 after graduating from Georgetown University Law School in May 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201c6. The bulk of Iverson\u2019s clients during this time came from court-appointed Criminal Justice Act cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201c7. In 1998, Iverson\u2019s gross income from his law practice was $17,172 and his net income was $4,990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201c8. In 1999, Iverson\u2019s gross income from his law practice was $57,761 and his net income was $32,358.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201c9. In 2000, Iverson\u2019s gross income from his law practice was $152,010 and his net income was $101,182.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201c10. After Respondent graduated from law school, she assisted her husband, Frederick Iverson, Esquire (\u2018Iverson\u2019) in his solo criminal defense practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201c11. Respondent was not paid by Iverson for her work with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c12. Iverson practiced primarily from his office at his and Respondent\u2019s home located at 643 Pennsylvania Avenue, SE, Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201c13. Iverson reasonably used 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 1012, Washington, DC 20036, as a business address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201c14. Through it was Iverson\u2019s desire that Respondent would join Iverson in his practice of law on a permanent basis, early 2000, Respondent decided to apply for positions outside of Iverson\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u201c15. In February of 2000, Respondent applied for an entry level job at the Federal Trade Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) as an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u201c16. With her Commission application, Respondent submitted a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that listed her current employment as a position with the \u2018Law Office of Frederick Iverson, Washington, DC,\u2019 without disclosing that he was her husband. On the second page of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Respondent listed \u2018Attorney Frederick Iverson, 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 1012, Washington, DC 20036\u2019 as a reference, without disclosing that he was her husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\u201c17. In the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that was submitted to the Commission, Respondent did not disclose that she had worked for her husband in Columbus, Ohio during the period of November 1995 through August 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">\u201c18. Respondent\u2019s Ohio employment with Iverson was listed on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that she submitted to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission in 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201c19. Even though Respondent omitted her Ohio employment with Iverson in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 she submitted to the Commission, Respondent listed in that same r\u00e9sum\u00e9 jobs that she held before she had first worked for Iverson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">\u201c20. Respondent interviewed for the Commission job with Joni Lupovitz, Esquire (\u2018Lupovitz\u2019) and later with Elaine Kolish, Esquire, who was an associate director of the Commission\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement (\u2018Kolish\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">\u201c21. During the hiring process, March 13, 2000 Lupovitz called Iverson as part of a reference check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201c22. Iverson gave Respondent a strong recommendation, stating that he recommended her 100 percent\u2019 and that he wanted her to join his practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201c23. During his conversation with Lupovitz, Iverson did not disclose that he was Respondent\u2019s husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c24. Shortly after March 13, 2000, the Commission decided to offer Respondent a position as an attorney at a grade level of GS-11, step 1, which carried a salary of $42,724 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201c25. Lupovitz called Respondent to communicate the offer. During this conversation, Lupovitz advised Respondent that in order for consideration of hiring her at a salary higher than that for the grade level of GS-11, step 1, she would have to have a competing job offer, or be currently employed at a higher salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201c26. The Commission\u2019s decision to hire Respondent was based in part, but not exclusively on Iverson\u2019s reference on her behalf; however, it cannot be said that without his recommendation Respondent would not have been offered the position with the Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201c27. Respondent wanted to be paid a higher salary than $42,724 per year that accompanied that for grade level GS-11, step 1 and requested of Iverson that he put in writing his officer of employment with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\u201c28. On March 16, 2000, Iverson composed a letter on stationary displaying his 1025 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C., office address, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">Angela Floyd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">643 Pennsylvania Avenue, SE Washington, D.C. 20003</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9K\">Dear Ms. Floyd:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">This letter is written to memorialize the salary terms of my offer to you. Per our discussion, I am prepared to offer you a monthly salary of $4500 per month, or $54,000 per year. This salary is based on your completing a minimum average of six criminal misdemeanor cases per month. This arrangement would remain in effect for one year and, thereafter, be open to renegotiation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">Regardless of where your future employment decisions take you, I wish you the best of luck in your career. Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">/S/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">Frederick D. Iverson, Esq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201c29. Respondent was aware of the contents of Iverson\u2019s letter before she delivered it to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">\u201c30. Respondent delivered Iverson\u2019s letter to Lupovitz, who in turn gave it to Kolish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">\u201c31. On March 28, 2000, by memorandum, Kolish requested of the Commission\u2019s Director of Human Resources, authority to offer Respondent a position at GS-11, step 7 with the accompanying annual salary of $51,269.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">\u201c32. The subject of Kolish\u2019s March 28, 2000 memorandum was \u2018Justification for hiring Angela Floyd as a GS-11, step 7.\u2019 The memorandum begins,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">The Division of Enforcement seeks to hire Angela Floyd, a May 1999 graduate of Georgetown University Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Center, as a staff attorney. Since August 1998, Ms. Floyd has worked in the Law Office of Frederick Iverson, which has made an employment offer to her at a salary of $54,000 per year. A copy of the written offer letter is attached. Therefore, to compete with that offer and given Ms. Floyd\u2019s excellent credentials, we recommend that she be offered the grade of GS-11, step 7, at a salary of $51,269.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">\u201c33. Kolish received the requested authority. Respondent was offered a position at GS-11, step 7, and began work at the Commission shortly afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201c34. Respondent and Iverson elected not to disclose their marital relationship because they did not consider it relevant to the hiring decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201c35. In various employment documents, required to be completed for purposes unrelated to Respondent\u2019s actual hire, Respondent identified Iverson as her husband when that information was specifically requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201c36. Kolish and Lupovitz did not become aware of the relationship between Respondent and Iverson until 2004, when they were advised of the fact by the Commission\u2019s Office of General Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201c37. After the discovery that Respondent and Iverson were married, a meeting was held in Kolish\u2019s office between Kolish, Lupovitz, Respondent and John Graubert, Esquire of the Office of General Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201c38. At the meeting, Respondent was advised that Kolish and Lupovitz viewed her failure to disclose her marriage to Iverson as misleading and advised her to be more concerned about appearances in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201c39. No formal disciplinary action was taken; however, the matter was referred to the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201c40. For reasons that do not relate to the issues raised in the <em>Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, </em>Respondent is no longer employed by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u201cRule 8.4 (c) provides</p>\n<p id=\"ANk\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u201cPetitioner contends that Respondent\u2019s concealment of her marital relationship with Iverson was an implicit representation to the Commission that Iverson was someone with whom she had only a business relationship, and that this representation was deceitful and dishonest because it led the Commission to believe that Iverson\u2019s recommendation and competing job offer were made by someone who was unbiased and who had no financial stake in the amount of money offered to her by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cRespondent argues that \u00a7 720.901 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\u201cC.F.R.\u201d) prohibits the federal government from discriminating against her on the basis of her marital status. She then asserts that this regulation excused her from disclosing that the individual who was providing a job recommendation and a competing job offer was her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u201cC.F.R. \u00a7 720.901 provides</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Equal opportunity without regard to politics or marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">(a) <em>In appointments and position changes. </em>In determining the merit and fitness of a person for a competitive appointment or appointment by non-competitive action to a position in the competitive service, an appointing officer shall not discriminate on the basis of the person\u2019s political affiliations, except when required by statute, or on the basis of marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">(b) <em>In adverse actions and termination of probationers. </em>An agency may not take an adverse action against an employee covered by part 752 of this chapter, not effect the termination of a probationer under part 815 of this chapter, (1) for political reasons, except when required by statute, or (2) because of marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201cRespondent did not <em>explicitly </em>misstate any fact. However, the law recognizes that deceit can be based on concealment of material facts as well as on overt misrepresentations. <em>Levin v. Singer, </em>227 Md. 47, 64, 175 A.2d 423 (1961) (\u201cWhere concealment effectively suppresses material facts with the object of creating or continuing a false impression, a cause of action based on fraud may arise.\u201d) In <em>Brodsky v. Hull, </em>196 Md. 509, 515-16, 77 A.2d 156 (1950), the Court of Appeals said that \u201c[a] fact is material if its existence or nonexistence is a matter to which a reasonable man would attach importance in determining his choice of action in the transaction.... \u201d While Petitioner does not have to prove the elements of fraud to establish a violation of Rule 8.4(c), these principles are useful in assessing Respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u201cThe Court accepts Respondent and Iverson\u2019s explanation as to why <em>they elected not to advise the Commission that they were married. </em>However, acceptance of that explanation does not resolve the question of whether their marriage was a fact that would have been material to either the hiring of Respondent, or the salary at which she was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">\u201cThe letter written on Iverson\u2019s office stationary with his Connecticut Avenue address to Respondent at their home address was clearly intended to be relied on for the purpose of attaining a salary greater than that to which Respondent, as a new hire, would have otherwise been entitled to receive. It was intended to be relied on and failure to disclose the actual relationship between Respondent and Iverson deprived the Commission of the opportunity to explore the <em>bonafides </em>of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201cNo reasonable person would accept that a relationship of spouse and spouse would not be relevant to whether an offering is to be relied upon as the product of an arms length relationship between the objects of an inquiry. Iverson\u2019s letter begins \u2018Dear Ms. Floyd\u2019, as though addressed to someone with whom Iverson had only a business relationship. The letter states the basis for the salary offer and sets out a standard of six cases per month that Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>would be expected to handle to earn it. In the last sentence of the first paragraph, Iverson sets out that the salary will be subject to \u2018renegotiation\u2019 at the end of one year. The concept of negotiation clearly creates the impression that the relationship between Respondent and Iverson was arm\u2019s length.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u201cAn interesting feature of the letter is its concluding sentence, which states, \u201cRegardless of where your future employment decisions take you, I wish you the best of luck in your career.\u201d Whatever personal message Iverson may have intended to convey to Respondent, the only reasonable conclusion from this sentence is that the two would have no further day-to-day contact if Respondent decided to work for the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s removal of the first period of employment with Iverson from her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 concealed the fact that they had known each other for some time before 1998, the beginning year of Respondent\u2019s second period of employment with Iverson. A comparison of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 shows that on both r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, Respondent listed three jobs she had before her first employment with Iverson, none of which was in the legal field. Inclusion of the first period of employment would have alerted the careful r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reviewer to the fact that Respondent and Iverson had both moved to the District of Columbia from Columbus, Ohio, and would have led the careful r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reviewer to question Respondent or Iverson about the coincidence and, if answered honestly, either would have disclosed the relationship between employer and employee. While one has to acknowledge great discretion in marshalling information to be included in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, selective exclusion of information relevant to the weight to be given to various references is perilous when that which is excluded takes on more relevance with regard to benefits sought from the person from whom the information would be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cThe Court elects not to question whether Respondent\u2019s value as reflected in Iverson\u2019s letter to Respondent. Indeed, the Commission could have determined that Respondent\u2019s income-making capacity at that moment in her career was equivalent to that expressed in Iverson\u2019s letter. But it is clear that such an impression, alone, would not have allowed Respondent\u2019s hire at an above entry-level salary. The failure to disclose the relationship between Iverson and Respondent had the natural consequence of depriving the Commission of an independent determination of the <em>bona fides </em>of Iverson\u2019s offer and Respondent reaped the intended benefit of the letter, the higher salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u201cThe effect of Iverson\u2019s letter was to induce Kolish to seek authorization to offer Respondent a higher salary than that which was proposed in the original offer. While Kolish\u2019s March 28, 2000 memorandum refers to additional factors, all of them were in existence when the original offer was made. It is clear that Iverson\u2019s job offer was the principal motivating factor in Kolish\u2019s decision to seek a greater salary for Respondent. In short, Respondent knowingly concealed from the Commission that her job reference and her competing job offer came from her husband, knowing that the agency would assume that they came from someone who had no bias or ulterior motive. By suppressing a material fact, Respondent created a false impression and furthered it with the letter of March 16, 2000 to reap the benefit of a higher salary. <em>Levin v. Singer, </em>227 Md. at 64, 175 A.2d 423. This conduct was deceitful.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cThe Court is unable to see the connection urged by Respondent between her lack of disclosure and C.F.R. \u00a7 720.901. To disclose an intimate relationship between one who is identified as a person to be contacted to assess one\u2019s qualifications or one who has been identified as making a job offer to be honestly received as a basis for a salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>above that to which one might otherwise be qualified would not run afoul of the above-quoted regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u201cFully aware of the importance of references and the central role that a pending job offer would have on her starting salary, Respondent elected to involve her husband in her job application. Having done so, Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose that she and Iverson were married to each other, deprived the Commission of information material to its ability to make an appropriate assessment of Iverson\u2019s recommendation and job offer. C.F.R. \u00a7 720.901 cannot be read to shield Respondent from the prohibition of Rule 8.4(c) that she not engage in conduct involving deceit or misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u201cOn the basis of the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, the Court concludes that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct by engaging in conduct involving \u201cdeceit or misrepresentation\u201d. The deceit or misrepresentation was Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose to the Federal Trade Commission the fact that Frederick D. Iverson, Esquire was her husband. Respondent\u2019s failure to make this disclosure was exacerbated by her request to Iverson to produce a letter offering her a job at a salary above the entry-level for the position offered her by the Commission. This letter was necessary for Respondent to obtain a beginning salary of $51,269.00, rather than the $42,724.00, the Commission was otherwise authorized to offer Respondent. The relationship between Respondent and Iverson was material to the ability of the Commission to determine the <em>bona fides </em>of the job and salary offered in the letter provided by Iverson, an employer who had earlier given Respondent a \u201c100% recommendation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u201cIt is recommended that Respondent be reprimanded for violation of Rule 8.4(c), rather than suspended or disbarred, in light of the following mitigating circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u201c1) Respondent\u2019s husband actually desired at the time of the deceitful conduct that she would work with him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c2) Sufficient other bases existed for the decision of the Commission to hire Respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201c3) It was possible that, had Respondent disclosed her relationship with Iverson, the Commission may have determined that his job offer to Respondent was <em>bona fide </em>and sufficient to merit the salary at which Respondent was hired; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201c4) The Commission was sufficiently satisfied with her performance as an agency attorney that it elected to confront Respondent and to continue her employment with the agency upon discovery of the deceit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The hearing judge found that Respondent had violated Rule 8.4(c) by \u201cengaging in conduct involving \u2018deceit or misrepresentation\u2019.\u201d Neither Petitioner nor Respondent took exception to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Therefore, we accept the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, as established, for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction.

She excepts to Judge Martin\u2019s conclusion that \u201cher failure to inform the Federal Trade Commission of her marriage to Mr. Iverson constituted a deliberate omission of material fact in -violation of Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Respondent asserts that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)(E)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 720.901(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cspecifically, unequivocally and unqualifiedly\u201d prohibit a federal agency, during the employment process, from considering marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The sole question before us therefore, is whether Respondent, in proffering a letter from her husband, who did not share the same surname, in support of an increase in salary from that which she had been offered by the Commission, engaged in \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d Rule 8.4(c), when in so doing led the Commission to believe that she had \u201cpurely an employer-employee\u201d relationship with her husband, Mr. Iverson. We agree with Judge Martin that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>when she \u201cdeprived the Commission of information material to its ability to make an appropriate assessment of Mr. Iverson\u2019s recommendation and job offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the present case, as the hearing judge found, Respondent did not <em>\u201cexplicitly </em>\u201d misstate any fact but rather, concealed a material fact that she had a relationship of significance with the person who penned the letter that she intentionally submitted in support of her petition for a higher salary. The hearing judge found that the correspondence at issue, which was written on office stationary addressed to Respondent at her home address that she shared with her husband, included the appellation \u201cDear Ms. Floyd\u201d with language suggesting that the salary referenced therein would be subject to \u201crenegotiation,\u201d and concluded with the sentence stating, \u201cRegardless of where your future employment decisions take you, I wish you the best of luck in your career,\u201d was intended to conceal a relationship other than that of an employer and employee. Judge Martin cogently noted that Respondent also omitted from her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 any reference to her employment with Mr. Iverson before she and he relocated to the District of Columbia, although other non-legal employment prior to that time was included.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Respondent concealed her relationship with her husband in her attempt to secure a higher starting salary from the Commission than she otherwise would have received. As the hearing judge noted, deceit can be based not only on overt misrepresentation but on concealment of material facts. <em>See Hoffman v. Stamper, </em>385 Md. 1, 28 n. 12, 867 A.2d 276, 292 n. 12 (2005) (\u201cIt has long been clear that \u2018[fjraud may consist in a suppression of the truth as well as in the assertion of a falsehood.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Parish v. Md. &amp; Va. Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, </em>250 Md. 24, 72, 242 A.2d 512, 539 (1968) (\u201cIt is well established that actionable fraud may result from the concealment of material facts as well as from the false statement of material facts.\u201d); <em>Levin v. Singer, </em>227 Md. 47, 64, 175 A.2d 423, 432 (1961) (\u201cWhere [ ] concealment effectively suppresses material facts with the object of creating or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tinuing a false impression, a cause of action based on fraud may arise.\u201d). While it is true that Respondent did not lie in her quest to gain a higher salary, her concealment led to a perception that she and Mr. Iverson stood at arms-length from one another, rather than as husband and wife, and as such, she encouraged a less-than accurate representation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals when it noted in another case involving an inaccuracy in the application process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">In the first place Respondent had an ethical and professional obligation to furnish information that he knew to be accurate. The resume is usually the first significant information a prospective employer receives about a candidate; <em>its accuracy is essential.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>In re Hadzi-Antich, </em>497 A.2d 1062, 1065 (D.C.1985) (emphasis added). Further, the Supreme Court of Florida, when confronted with a situation in which a respondent concealed information about his criminal history on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, determined that the concealment reflected a lack of good moral character and constituted \u201cconduct which would cause a reasonable man to have substantial doubts about [his] honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of others and for the laws of the state and nation.\u201d <em>Florida Bar re Jahn, </em>559 So.2d 1089, 1090 (Fla.1990) (citation omitted). <em>See also In re Wolmer, </em>226 A.D.2d 77, 650 N.Y.S.2d 679, 680 (N.Y.App.Div.1996) (stating that submitting a false and misleading r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and reference letter to several prospective employers, including exaggerating the amount of time he worked at prior positions and omitting other positions all together, was \u201cserious\u201d misconduct); <em>In re Norwood, </em>80 A.D.2d 278, 438 N.Y.S.2d 788 (N.Y.App.Div.1981) (dishonest conduct for submitting false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and misleading r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to prospective employer); <em>In re Lavery, </em>90 Wash.2d 463, 587 P.2d 157 (1978) (misconduct involving dishonesty and misrepresentation when attorney falsified his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, transcript, and letters of recommendation).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The fact that the Commission could not discriminate against Respondent on account of her marital status, as codified in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 720.901(a) (\u201cIn determining the merit and fitness of a person for competitive appointment or appointment by noncompetitive action to a position in the competitive service, an appointing officer shall not discriminate on the basis of the person\u2019s political affiliations, except when required by statute, or on the basis of marital status[.]\u201d), is not in issue. Rather, regardless of whether Respondent and Mr. Iverson had been married, they enjoyed a close personal relationship, a material fact that Respondent should not have concealed when she voluntarily submitted the offer letter to the Commission. Her concealment of a close personal relationship with Mr. Iverson, in addition to that of employee and employer, impeded the ability of the Federal Trade Commission to question and evaluate the bona fides of what was proffered as a competing offer. Clearly, in an application for employment, the prospective employer is concerned about any potential bias of an author of a letter submitted by an applicant, whether such bias be social, intimate, or economic. In this case, Respondent engaged in \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4(c) when she concealed the nature of her relationship with Mr. Iverson in order to obtain a higher starting salary with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(c). Respondent asserts that because the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, no sanction is appropriate and the action should be dismissed. Petitioner, on the other hand, recommends that Respondent be suspended for a period of ninety days because she has been found to have engaged in dishonest conduct by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>concealing the fact that Mr. Iverson was not a disinterested reference. We agree with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">As a general rule, the appropriate sanction for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \u201cdepends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 375, 872 A.2d 693, 713 (2005), in furtherance of the purposes of attorney discipline: \u201c \u2018to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Awuah, </em>374 Md. at 526, 823 A.2d at 663) (citations omitted). In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 27, 741 A.2d 1143, 1157 (1999), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Because \u201can attorney\u2019s character <em>must remain beyond reproach\u201d </em>this \u201cCourt has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the <em>maintenance </em>of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary proceedings have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Deutsch, </em>294 Md. 353, 368-69, 450 A.2d 1265, 1273 (1982)) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). When imposing sanctions, we have enunciated that, \u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gore, </em>380 Md. 455, 472, 845 A.2d 1204, 1213 (2004). Therefore, in this case we consider the nature of the ethical duty violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 598-99, 911 A.2d 440, 447-48 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 844 A.2d 367 (2004), we considered what sanction was appropriate for an attorney who deleted client records from his office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>computer prior to leaving the firm\u2019s employ. We determined that Potter violated Rules 8.4(b), (c), and (d) and concluded that he should receive a ninety day suspension from the practice of law. We iterated that Potter had no prior disciplinary record, his misconduct was an isolated incident, and that his motive was to act in the best interests of his clients. <em>Potter, </em>380 Md. at 162-63, 844 A.2d at 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Maxwell, </em>307 Md. 600, 516 A.2d 570 (1986), Maxwell, while representing two individuals charged with drug trafficking in Florida, delivered a deed to his client\u2019s bail bondsman, purporting to convey land on the Eastern Shore from Jaxon and Associates, Inc. to the bail bondsman\u2019s principal; the deed contained the signature of \u201cRonald Jaxon,\u201d and was witnessed and notarized by Maxwell. In fact, there was no such person as \u201cRonald Jaxon,\u201d and Maxwell had witnessed one of his clients sign under that name. Based upon these facts, the hearing judge concluded that Maxwell had engaged in misconduct involving misrepresentation and false statements in violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(4),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the predecessor to Rule 8.4(e), as well as Rules 1-102(A)(1) and 7-102(A)(5).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For these indiscretions, we issued Maxwell a ninety day suspension. <em>Maxwell, </em>307 Md. at 605, 516 A.2d at 572. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that although we could not \u201ccondone deliberate falsification of a solemn document by an experienced attorney,\u201d Maxwell had an unblemished disciplinary record, expressed remorse for his actions, and his conduct did not result in any actual harm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201cIn cases where the improper conduct of the lawyer involved misrepresentation, the severity of the sanction to be imposed for the misconduct depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d We have given careful consideration to those facts and circumstances. We recognize Maxwell\u2019s prior good record and his remorse, as well as the lack of actual harm in this case. Yet we cannot condone deliberate falsification of a solemn document by an experienced attorney. That this action was done to assist a client in obtaining bail, rather than for the lawyer\u2019s personal gain, does not exempt Maxwell from discipline. The imposition of a suspension from the practice of law furthers \u201cthe primary purpose of protecting the public by demonstrating the type of misconduct which this Court and the legal profession will not tolerate.\u201d We conclude that in order to protect the public from misconduct of this sort, a 90-day suspension is the proper sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Haupt, </em>285 Md. 39, 399 A.2d 1350 (1979), we addressed what the appropriate sanction was for an attorney who violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4). During a visit with his client in lock-up, Haupt brought his client\u2019s fianc\u00e9e with him, who he represented as his assistant when queried by an officer with the Sheriffs Department; the fianc\u00e9e would not have been admitted to the lock-up if her true status had not been concealed. We determined that Haupt violated Rule 1-102(A)(4); given the dishonest nature of his misconduct and the fact that it constituted a second offense, we imposed a ninety day suspension. <em>Haupt, </em>285 Md. at 44, 399 A.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Prince George\u2019s County Bar Association v. Vance, </em>273 Md. 79, 327 A.2d 767 (1974), Vance forged a form indicating that he had been assigned to active military duty in order to give him access to a Post Exchange, where he made several purchases ranging from $12 to $14, which allowed him to save roughly $1.00. Vance conceded that his conduct reflected deceit in violation of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4). Addressing the appropriate sanction to impose, we noted that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Vance had expressed genuine remorse for his misconduct, which was an isolated instance and resulted in only minimal personal gain, the violation was still serious enough to warrant a ninety day suspension from the practice of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">Nor, however, is this properly a case for a bare reprimand, let alone an outright dismissal of these proceedings. Our earlier observations are largely dispositive here. However minimal the amount involved may have been, the inescapable fact remains that respondent\u2019s acts were the fruits of misrepresentation; moreover, they were studied, not impulsive. It is questionable whether conduct such as occurred here can ever be so lightly regarded as to result in no more than a mere reprimand. Though not committed in a professional capacity, the actions of respondent nevertheless reflect directly upon his fitness as an attorney[.] A reprimand, as the least severe sanction which may be imposed in a disciplinary proceeding, is clearly reserved for misconduct that is not affected with such deception as was exhibited here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">In our considered judgment, the proper sanction to be applied here is a suspension of 90 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Vance, </em>273 Md. at 84-85, 327 A.2d at 770 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Like in <em>Potter, Maxwell, Haupt </em>and <em>Vance, </em>Respondent\u2019s misconduct reflected dishonesty; she violated Rule 8.4(c) by intentionally concealing the nature of her relationship with Mr. Iverson from the Federal Trade Commission during her employment application process in order to obtain a higher salary. Moreover, we find it troubling that Respondent omitted from her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 any reference to her employment with Mr. Iverson before she and he relocated to the District of Columbia, although non-legal employment prior to this time was included. We also, however, consider any mitigating factors when determining the appropriate sanction, to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cabsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 599, 911 A.2d at 448 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (1996)). In this case, Respondent has no prior disciplinary record, and the instant violation is not part of a pattern of misconduct. Additionally, she acknowledged her error. Considering all of the circumstances, Respondent\u2019s deceitful conduct warrants a ninety day suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715(c), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\">.
