Thereupon, defendant moved the court to quash the writ of execution on the ground that since recovery of the judgment by default, defendant had been discharged in bankruptcy, and that the judgment was listed in the bankrupt schedule. This motion was by the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellant maintains that the discharge in bankruptcy had the effect of releasing him from the judgment, while respondent, on the other hand, contends that the judgment, being for a wilful and malicious injury to the personal property of another, is not released by the discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act provides as follows: <em>\u201cDebts not affected by a discharge.. </em>A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, <em>except such as .. . </em>(second) <em>are liabilities </em>for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or <em>for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of </em>another.\u201d (Sec. 35, tit. 11, Bankruptcy, U. S. Code Annotated, p. 150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The question now before this court is whether or not an unlawful conversion of certificates of stock by defendant to his own use, which resulted in damage to the plaintiff, constitutes a wilful and malicious injury. In <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 U. S. 138 [37 Sup. Ct. 38, 61 <em>L. </em>Ed. 205], where the unauthorized sale of certificates of stock held by a firm of brokers as collateral and the appropriation of the proceeds to their own use was held to be a wilful and malicious injury to property within the meaning of the exception outlined in section 17, <em>supra, </em>the court (at p. 207) quoting from <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>193 U. S. 473 [24 Sup. Ct. 505, 48 L. Ed. 754], said: \u201cA wilful disregard of what one knows to be his duty, an act which is against good morals and wrongful in and of itself, and which necessarily causes injury and is done intentionally, may be said to be done wilfully and maliciously, so as to come within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>It is urged that the malice referred to in the exception is malice towards the individual personally, such as is meant, for instance, in a statute for maliciously injuring or destroying property, or for malicious mischief, where mere intentional injury without special malice towards the individual has been held by some courts not to be sufficient. <em>(Com. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>110 Mass. 401.) We are not inclined to place such a narrow construction upon the language of the exception. We do not think the language used was intended to limit the exception in any such way. It was an honest debtor, and not a malicious wrongdoer, that was to be discharged.\u201d So, too, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ladrie, </em>(1925) 98 Vt. 529 [129 Atl. 302] (for conversion of flour), it was held: \u201cBut when the conversion is the result of a deliberate and intentional disregard of another\u2019s legal rights, it is a wilful and malicious injury to his property. It is wilful, because it is voluntary (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict.), and it is malicious, because it is intentional.\u201d (Citing cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Respondent in the case now before us did not see fit to interpose a defense to the action, thereby admitting that while in possession of the certificates of stock, he unlawfully converted and disposed of the stock to his own use, to the damage of the plaintiff! in the sum of $1700. In line Avith <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ladrie, supra, </em>we are of the opinion that such conversion was wilful, because it was voluntary, and malicious, because it was intentional, and that the judgment based upon such injury is not released by the discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The orders appealed from arc affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
