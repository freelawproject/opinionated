Indeed, the record would justify' the assertion that the evidence well supports the findings complained of. There is no occasion for us to discuss the points raised by appellant, as, under the circumstances, we are bound to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>This appeal is so devoid' of any merit that we are constrained to conclude that it was taken for the purpose of delay. It is therefore ordered that appellant pay to respondent the sum of $250 as damages, to be added to the costs as part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
