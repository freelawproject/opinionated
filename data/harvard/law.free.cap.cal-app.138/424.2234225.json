He was the sole witness before the referee and according to the uncontradicted' testimony given by him he sustained the injury about 4:30 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of Saturday, March 11, 1933, while handling a heavy ledger, weighing between forty and forty-five pounds. There were five such ledgers, each containing approximately 1800 separate accounts; and part of petitioner\u2019s duties required him to distribute the ledgers among girl accountants in the office for the purpose of having them work on the cards contained therein on which the accounts were entered; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>in order to transport the ledgers back and forth to said accountants it was necessary for petitioner to lift the ledgers and the trays upon which they rested from a small truck, the bed' of which stood about a foot and a half above the floor, to a larger truck, the bed of which was three and a half feet above the floor. On this particular occasion, while attempting so to transfer one of the ledgers from one truck to the other, the ledger slipped out of his grip and was about to fall to the floor. He stooped suddenly and caught it, and in doing so felt a sharp pain or kink, \u201cneedle-like\u201d as he described it, in the region of his hip. For a moment he was unable to straighten up; but shortly after-wards he \u201cbraced up\u201d and then sat down to his work. Ten or fifteen minutes later he was seized with pains and cramps in both groins, and in the \u201clower part of the stomach\u201d. He also \u201cfelt a bulge\u201d in his groin and pains in his leg. He mentioned the matter to the foreman in the office, but not realizing anything serious had happened to him he remained at his work the rest of the day. Upon reaching home that evening he felt sick. He was unable to eat, and felt \u201call jumpy and tired\u201d. He took a hot mustard bath and a physic and went to bed, applying a hot-water bottle to the left inguinal region. He remained in bed all the next day, Sunday. In applying the hot-water bottle he noticed the swelling on the left side. On Monday morning he was still suffering pain, but feeling somewhat better, went to work. He refrained, however, from doing any lifting. After arriving at the company\u2019s office he overheard the secretary arranging for medical care for another employee who had turned his ankle, which prompted petitioner to explain to the secretary the injury he received the Saturday previous; whereupon she instructed him to consult the insurance carrier\u2019s doctor, which he did during the noon hour, and was examined by Dr. Gilbert. The next day, Tuesday, March 14, 1933, he called' at the office of said commission and filed his application for compensation; and at 2:30 of the same day the referee proceeded with the hearing of the application. The insurance carrier, State Compensation Insurance Fund, was represented by its attorney; but petitioner appeared without counsel. He was informed by the referee that he was entitled to a continuance to obtain counsel if he so desired or could proceed at once and they would \u201cfind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>out all the facts\u201d. Petitioner stated he had no objections to proceeding, and thereupon he was sworn, examined by the referee and cross-examined by the attorney for the insurance carrier. At the conclusion of his testimony the matter was left \u201copen five days for filing of report of Dr. Gilbert\u201d, a copy of which was to be sent to petitioner and the matter was then to be submitted' for decision. However, following the hearing and on the same day thereof petitioner was examined also by Dr. Holmes, assistant medical director of the insurance carrier; and on March 17, 1933, his written report with the one prepared by Dr. Gilbert, both of which were addressed to the insurance carrier, were filed with the commission; and on March 22, 1933, the referee filed his adverse findings, which on the same day the commission adopted and denied petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The record further shows that on March 15, 1933, the day following the hearing before the referee, and prior to the filing of the written reports of the insurance carrier\u2019s doctors, petitioner of his own accord consulted Drs. Eloesser and Rogers, and on March 27, 1933, an operation was performed for the reduction of the hernia. Subsequently, and on April 10, 1933, petitioner filed a petition for a rehearing of his application based mainly on the written report of Dr. Rogers; but a rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is well settled, of course, that reviewing courts may not invade the field of the fact-finding body; and consequently where a conflict of evidence exists the findings of the trier of the facts are conclusive. But it is equally well established that the application of the foregoing rule is limited to cases where the conflict is substantial and real, and not fanciful or fictitious <em>(Thoreau </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>120 Cal. App. 67 [7 Pac. (2d) 1039] ; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Faget Engineering Co., </em>53 Cal. App. 762 [200 Pac. 818]), nor a mere pretense <em>(Houghton </em>v. <em>Loma Prieta Lumber Co., </em>152 Cal. 574 [93 Pac. 377]); and' in this regard it has been said that mere conclusions will not serve to meet the definition of substantial or any evidence as against positive, direct evidence of a fact <em>(Barton </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>108 Cal. App. 372 [291 Pac. 591]) ; also that the conclusions of an expert based upon an incorrect or faulty hypothetical case are of no practical value <em>(North Elk Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>81 Cal. App. 582 [254 Pac. 582]).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Nowhere is it claimed by respondents in the present proceeding that the incident relating to the falling and sudden grasping of the ledger which petitioner testified was the direct cause of the hernia did not happen; and an analysis of the reports of the insurance carrier\u2019s doctors shows that neither went so far as to venture the unqualified opinion, as expressed in the referee\u2019s findings, that petitioner\u2019s acute condition was not caused or \"exacerbated by the happening thereof. In this regard Dr. Holmes\u2019 summary was: \u201cI cannot believe that the so-called incident had any <em>particular </em>bearing upon his present condition\u201d (italics ours) ; and such statement was further qualified by the one preceding it wherein he said: \u201c ... it must be admitted that the catching of the 35 lb. tray did exert a mild strain upon his muscles\u201d. And although Dr. Gilbert in his report stated that in his opinion the hernia already existed, he went on to say: \u201cThe sudden effort of last Saturday forced additional intestinal contents into the pre-existing hernia calling it to the patient\u2019s attention.\u201d Furthermore, it is apparent that the qualified opinions thus expressed by the insurance carrier\u2019s doctors as to the improbability of the Saturday incident being the original cause of the hernia are based on the false assumption of certain material facts. For example Dr. Holmes states in his report that petitioner \u201cwas lifting a ledger tray off an adding machine truck to place it on a table\u201d, and Dr. Gilbert states in his report that petitioner is \u201ca carpenter\u201d and \u201cwas moving a steel ledger weighing about forty pounds from one desk to another\u201d'. It is also apparent that the findings made by Drs. Eloesser and Rogers after having operated on petitioner proved the diagnoses of the insurance carrier\u2019s doctors which were founded on external examinations to be unsound and incorrect. That is to say, Drs. Holmes and Gilbert diagnosed'the case as a \u201ccomplete\u201d left hernia; and in this connection Dr. Holmes stated: \u201cThe left external inguinal ring is found to be dilated, admitting two fingers with ease. The walls are relaxed and can be stretched without causing more than moderate discomfort\u201d and \u201cwith only moderate tenderness\u201d. And Dr. Gilbert stated that in his opinion the hernia had been in existence for \u201ca great many years and presents through yddely dilated rings\u201d; whereas the operating surgeons found an \u201cincomplete\u201d hernia \u201cprobably trau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>matic in origin\u201d; that it was \u201cvery tender on palpation, and the external ring is moderately enlarged, permitting the entrance of index finger\u201d; also that the \u201cperitoneal covering of the herniation appeared thin and of recent origin.\u201d Moreover, in clear negation of the theory of a pre-existing hernia, the evidence shows without dispute that during the nine years petitioner was employed by said firm he had never been sick a single day, and that \u201ca year or two\u201d before this accident happened he was given a thorough physical examination- by a doctor preliminary to taking out group insurance for his employer; and at that time no defects whatever were found in his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">For the reasons stated it is our opinion that when the written reports of the insurance carrier\u2019s doctors upon which are based the referee\u2019s findings and the commission\u2019s decision, are measured by the legal rules above set forth, the qualified opinions expressed in said reports do not raise a substantial conflict with the positive, undisputed, unimpeached testimony of petitioner that said incident did bring about the acute condition from which he was suffering when examined by said doctors three days after the incident happened, and which admittedly disabled him from work and required an operation for its correction. Accordingly the referee\u2019s finding that said hernia was not caused or exacerbated by an injury arising out of and in the course of said employment and the commission\u2019s decision denying petitioner any compensation whatever on that ground are annulled <em>(Singer </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>105 Cal. App. 374 [287 Pac. 567] ; <em>Winthrop </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>213 Cal. 351 [2 Pac. (2d) 142] ; <em>Thoreau </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra), </em>and the proceeding is remanded to said commission for further action in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Tyler,. P.
