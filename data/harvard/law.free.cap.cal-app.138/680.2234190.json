He has appealed from the final judgment of conviction and the order denying his motion' for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">. The transcript herein was filed on December 22, 1933, and the cause was regularly on the calendar on the nineteenth day of February, 1934. Counsel for appellant appeared at that time and requested further time for the filing of appellant\u2019s brief. Pursuant to said request appellant was granted fifteen days\u2019 time for said purpose. Although said time has long since expired and counsel for appellant has on several occasions been notified that appellant\u2019s brief was overdue, no brief has been filed. We would no doubt be justified in treating the appeal as abandoned, but we have nevertheless examined the transcript on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The evidence points unerringly to appellant\u2019s guilt and we find no prejudicial error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The judgment and order denying the motion for new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Nourse, P.
