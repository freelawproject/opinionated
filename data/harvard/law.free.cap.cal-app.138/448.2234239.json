A motion and demand for a change of venue to the city and county of San Francisco, and affidavits in support thereof, were filed. Petitioners appeared by demurrer to said complaint. During argument upon the motion, counsel interrupted the proceedings and moved that the same go off calendar and that the demurrer be overruled, which motion was granted. If the grounds of petitioners\u2019 motion for a change of venue were tenable, that is, that they are the only parties defendant who have any connection with or interest in the suit, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County is without jurisdiction thereof. (Code Civ. Proe., sees. 394, 395.) That it \u201chad no power to act upon the demurrer when it did <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., </em>106 Cal. 46 [39 Pac. 209]) and its order in that regard is a nullity\u201d has long been settled law. <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>125 Cal. 334 [58 Pac. 4].) Such an application operates as a <em>supersedeas </em>or stay of proceedings, and must be disposed of before any other steps can be taken. <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>44 Cal. App. 34 [185 Pac. 998].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">It is ordered that the writ issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Stephens, P. J., and Archbald, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on June 6, 1934, and an application by respondents to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on July 5, 1934.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
