Plaintiffs now ask judgment for $26,000 together with interest thereon by reason of the failure of the defendant to make this payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Several defenses are presented to this claim. The first is that this balance of $26,000 and more was paid to the creditors of the Indians in accordance with their request as shown by findings 4 and 6 and, as the use of this balance for the purpose shown was at the request of the plaintiff bands, the defendant argues that plaintiffs are thereby estopped to question its validity and that even if the use of the balance indicated had been improper, it was subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>quently ratified and confirmed by the Act of May 16,1874, as shown by finding 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Plaintiffs contend that under the provisions of Article 3 of the Treaty of 1858 not more than $70,000 could be paid ,out of their fund upon their debts to the traders and that, when and if that $70,000 was used up, the residue of $26,000 of the appropriation of $96,000 in 1861 (12 Stat. 221, 237), in payment for certain land, belonged to the plaintiffs and could not be used by the Secretary of the Interior to pay any debts of the plaintiff bands. We do not find it necessary to discuss or decide this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">By the Act of February 16,1863, Congress declared that the plaintiff bands of Indians and other bands of the Dakota or Sioux Indians had \u201cduring the past year * * * made an unprovoked, aggressive, and most savage war upon the United States and massacred a large number of men, women, and children within the State of Minnesota and destroyed and damaged a large amount of property\u201d and thereby forfeited all just claim to any money unpaid them; also, that all treaties purported to impose any further obligation on the United States and all lands and rights of occupancy within the State of Minnesota \u201care hereby declared to be abrogated and annulled,\u201d so far as they purport to impose any future obligation on the United States, and all lands and rights of occupancy within the State of Minnesota, and all annuities and claims heretofore accorded to said Indians, or any of them, to be forfeited to the United States. See finding 10 for the statute in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">It is quite clear that by the statute referred to. above, all claims of the plaintiffs are cancelled and forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Judgment must, therefore, be entered dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 petition and it is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-9\">MaddeN, <em>Judge; </em>Jones, <em>Judge; </em>Whitaker, <em>Judge; </em>and Littleton, <em>Judge, </em>concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
