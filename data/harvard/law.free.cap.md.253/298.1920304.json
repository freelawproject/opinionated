Pistorio (the Pistorios) are the owners of a tract of some 154 acres in Howard County which lies in the southeast quadrant of the U. S. Route 29\u2014Interstate 70-N interchange. The property is bounded on the north by Route 70-N, on the west by Route 29, on the south and southeast by garden-type apartments, and on the east has a frontage of some 250 feet on Rogers Avenue, Maryland Route 99. The Pistorios, as permitted by \u00a7 14.25 of the Zoning Regulations of Howard County (4th Ed. 1968)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition with the Zoning Commissioner of Howard County for the reclassification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the tract from an R-20 District (one and two family detached residences, minimum lot size 20,000 square feet) to an M-R District (manufacturing, restricted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Zoning Commissioner transmitted the petition to the Planning Commission, as provided by \u00a7\u00a7 14.252 and 33.02 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the Regulations, and the Commission recommended denial if action was to be taken prior to 1 June 1968, since the Commission proposed to draft a master plan for the area by that date. On 15 February 1968, after formal hearing, the Board of County Commissioners (the Board) granted the reclassification. Haldemaun, one of those who had opposed the rezoning before the Board, sought a declaration <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the Circuit Court for Howard County, sitting in equity, that the action of the Commissioners was \u201c* * * illegal, discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious,\u201d and therefore null and void. The Pistorios, on motion, were permitted to intervene and answered. From a decree dismissing the bill of complaint, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Haldemann contends first, that the lower court erred when it treated the M-R classification as if it were a non-Euclidean or floating zone, thus relieving the Pistorios of the necessity of showing that there had been a mistake in the original zoning or a change in the character of the neighborhood. Haldemann\u2019s second contention is that, regardless of whether an M-R zone is or is not a floating zone, the lower court erred in holding that the issue was fairly debatable and that the result involved no abuse of discretion by the Board. We think that this challenge must fail, and we will affirm the dismissal of Haldemann\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">More than a decade ago, this Court in <em>Huff v. Bd. of Zoning </em>Appeals, 214 Md. 48, 133 A. 2d 83 (1957) gave approval to the floating zone concept, by upholding that part of the zoning regulations adopted in 1955 by the County Commissioners of Baltimore County, which provided for the reclassification of tracts of not less than five acres as \u201cmanufacturing, restricted\u201d ; specified the procedure to be followed in creating M-R zones; detailed the permitted uses, and imposed certain limitations on development. <em>See </em>Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (2d Ed. 1964) \u00a7 240. On 16 May 1961, the County Commissioners of Howard County adopted zoning regulations for that county. \u00a7 14 of those regulations deals with M-R Districts. The statement of purpose is almost identical with that in the Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>County regulations; the permitted uses, quite similar; the limitations on development, more detailed. As the lower court observed, the Howard County regulations were \u201cdrafted carefully in the light of <em>Huff v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We think that <em>Huff, supra, </em>is clearly determinative of Haldemann\u2019s first contention. <em>See also, Hunter v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Carroll County, </em>252 Md. 305, 250 A. 2d 81 (1969); <em>Eschinger v. Bus, </em>250 Md. 112, 242 A. 2d 502 (1968); <em>Bigenho v. Montgomery County Council, </em>248 Md. 386, 237 A. 2d 53 (1968); <em>Kramer v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>248 Md. 27, 234 A. 2d 589 (1967); <em>Beall v. Montgomery County Council, </em>240 Md. 77, 212 A. 2d 751 (1965); <em>Costello v. Sieling, </em>223 Md. 24, 161 A. 2d 824 (1960). We have no hesitancy in holding that Howard County\u2019s M-R District, like Baltimore County\u2019s, is a non-Euclidean or floating zone to which the \u201cchange-mistake\u201d rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">With respect to Haldemann\u2019s second contention, we agree with the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the question presented to the Board was fairly debatable and that there was no abuse of discretion. The Howard County Planning Commission, to which the application was referred for a report and recommendation, recommended that the application be denied if action were taken on it before 1 June 1968. Its report to the Board reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201c1. The petitioner\u2019s request is not in accordance with the General Plan of Howard County, adopted July 20, 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">2. The subject property will only have one point of access, either existing Rogers Avenue or relocated Rogers Avenue, which will probably not be constructed until after 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">3. The requirements set forth in Section 14.252 should be shown clearly on the preliminary development plan, especially for screenings and planting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">4. There are 37 acres of M-R zoned land within 6,000 feet of the subject property which are undeveloped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>5. The Planning Commission believes that the M-R request is premature and that the Board of County Commissioners should defer action until June 1, 1968, so that the Planning Commission can prepare a Master Plan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the Second Election District which would include a specific proposal for an improved circulation system for this area. The proposed 154-acre M-R District needs an additional vehicle access to either Route 99 or Route 40 without funnelling traffic through the apartment area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On 4 January 1968, the Pistorios\u2019 application was the subject of a public hearing before the Board. Six neighborhood groups and a number of individuals, including Haldemann, appeared as protestants. The protestants produced two expert witnesses, Eugene J. Clifford, a traffic engineer and Arthur L. Hundermark, a realtor. Mr. Clifford testified that Rogers Avenue, which provides the only access to the Pistorio tract, has an average width of only 24 feet; that as presently laid out, it has a peak capacity of 850 cars per hour; that present peak volume is 300 cars per hour; and that it was his opinion that the Pistorio tract, when fully developed, would add 900 cars per hour during peak periods. There was also testimony at the hearing that the relocation and widening of Rogers Avenue was projected but had not been scheduled by the State Roads Commission. Mr. Hundermark testified that the granting of the application would cause a depreciation in the value of the private residences on Rogers Avenue. Campbell V. Helfrich, who testified for the Pistorios, maintained that any possible depreciation would be obviated by the relocation of Rogers Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On 15 February 1968, the Board adopted a resolution granting the requested reclassification and made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201c1. That there exists a need for a M-R District in the area of the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">2. That the industrial development of the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>property as a complete unit and according to the requirements of the M-R District in the Zoning Regulations will benefit the general public and will promote the general economic welfare of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">3. That substantial changes in the character of the neighborhood have occurred since the adoption of the comprehensive Zoning Map, especially the construction of the dual highways with large median strips and wide rights-of-way which surround and isolate the subject property on two sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">4. That the reclassification of the subject property to a M-R District is in harmony with the Howard County General Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">5. That the reclassification of the subject property to a M-R District is not incompatible with nor inconsistent with the uses of the surrounding properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">6. That the reclassification of the subject property from R-20 to M-R District will not adversely affect the surrounding properties, considering, among other things, the time required for full development and the scheduled relocation and improvement of Rogers Avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The court below (Macgill, J.) reviewed the Board\u2019s action, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201c* * * The potential increase in the volume of traffic on Rogers Avenue is, perhaps the most telling point made by the opponents of the reclassification. A traffic expert testified on behalf of the opponents that Rogers Avenue had a' present traffic capacity of some eight hundred and fifty vehicles per hour and he estimated that the proposed industrial park would lead, during the peak hour, to something in excess of twelve hundred vehicles per hour. It was the opinion of .the witness, therefore, that the proposed reclassification would lead to traffic congestion on this particular road. Certainly, the Board, in establishing zoning districts, was required to consider \u2018traffic problems and their relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>to the public safety and welfare\u2019. Section 2. (a) of the Zoning Regulations. By (1) of the same section, however, the Board was also to take into consideration \u2018The road building and road widening plans of the State and County\u2019. There was evidence before the Board that a relocation and dualization of Rogers Avenue was planned by the State Roads Commission but that no action on this plan was anticipated prior to 1970, at least. In this connection, the Board was entitled to consider, and evidently did consider, the probability that the full development of the \u2018industrial park\u2019,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which would cause the estimated volume of traffic, would be a process approximately as gradual as the development of the proj ected road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">\u201cIt is true that in <em>Hardesty v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>211 Md. 172 [126 A. 2d 621] (1956), and <em>Temmink v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>212 Md. 6 [128 A. 2d 256] (1956), it was held that where the evidence showed that the reclassifications would create congestion in the access streets, the action of the Board in granting the reclassifications was arbitrary. It was pointed out in both of these cases, however, that there was no evidence that the widening of the public highways in the vicinity of the properties in question was contemplated. In <em>St. Mark\u2019s Church v. Doub, </em>219 Md. 387 [149 A. 2d 779] (1959), it was said that traffic volume should not be confused with traffic congestion and that the increase in traffic volume which might result from a reclassification was not, in itself, grounds for denying the application. It may be assumed that when traffic volume exceeds a certain limit, it is transformed into traffic congestion. In the instant case, the Board, as has been observed, appeared to have considered this possibility along with the proposed widening or dual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ization of the access road and this Court finds itself unable to say, on the evidence, that its action in this respect was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Nelson v. Montgomery County, </em>214 Md. 587 [136 A. 2d 373] (1957); <em>Muhly v. County Council, </em>218 Md. 543 [147 A. 2d 735] (1958) and <em>Missouri Realty, Inc. v. Ramer, </em>216 Md. 442, 451 [140 A. 2d 655] (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cThe Planning Commission took a position on the application somewhat similar to that described as having been taken by the Planning Commission for Montgomery County in <em>Nelson v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>that is, it stated that the application was \u2018premature\u2019 and that action should be deferred until June 1, 1968, pending the preparation of a \u2018Master Plan\u2019 for the Second Election District. There has been no suggestion, one way or the other, that such a plan has been prepared as of this time. The recommendation of the Planning Commission was, of course, not binding-on the Board of County Commissioners. Cf. <em>Baylis v. City of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 164 [148 A. 2d 429] (1958), and <em>Pressman v. City of Baltimore, </em>222 Md. 330 [160 A. 2d 379] (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We adopt the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that the action of the Board of County Commissioners was, at least, fairly debatable. We have often repeated the principles here applicable: courts have no power to rezone and may not substitute their judgment for that of the expertise of the zoning authority. <em>Kirkman v. Montgomery County Council, </em>251 Md. 273, 247 A. 2d 255 (1968); <em>Bosley v. Hospital for Consumptives, </em>246 Md. 197, 227 A. 2d 746 (1967); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County v. Farr, </em>242 Md. 315, 218 A. 2d 923 (1966). It has long been settled that the zoning authority\u2019s determination is correct if there were such legally sufficient evidence as would make the question fairly debatable. <em>Ark Readi-Mix Concrete Corp. v. Smith, </em>251 Md. 1, 246 A. 2d 220 (1968)<em>; Mayor &amp; City Council of Greenbelt v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>247 Md. 670, 234 A. 2d 140 (1967); <em>Agneslane, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>247 Md. 612, 233 A. 2d 757 (1967). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Further, the one who attacks the determination made by the authority must show that it was arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious. <em>Kirkman v. Mongomery County Council, supra; Agneslane, Inc. v. Lucas, supra; Bosley v. Hospital for Consumptives, supra; Mayor &amp; City Council of Balto. v. Sapero, </em>230 Md. 291, 186 A. 2d 884 (1962). The appellant\u2019s proof falls short of establishing that the Board abused the discretion vested in it by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\">.
