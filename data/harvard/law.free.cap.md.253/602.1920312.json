Aware of GE\u2019s unwillingness to exercise its option to buy the 1,087 acre tract (the property) upon which it proposes to build a $250,000,000 plant unless and until the zoning is changed to ID (Industrial Development District), appellants fought the application for reclassification both before the County Commissioners and in the Circuit Court for Howard County. They lost both of those battles; here they lose the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">A proper understanding of this appeal requires a brief reference to the short history of the \u201cNew Town of Columbia.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>In August 1965 The Howard 'Research -andi Development Corporation, a Maryland corporation (HRD), had accomplished the acquisition of about 14,000 acres of land,in Howard County. On 10.August 1965 the Board of County Commissioners (the Copamissioners) designated the. entire tract as a \u2018[New Town .District\u201d .pursuant to existing zoning regulations. Under the direction of.-The Rouse Company which owns .50% of the stock of HRD (the other. 50% is owned by a life insurance company) the new town began to evolve. Early in- 1968 11RD .learned that GE had in mind building a major plant somewhere in the northeast. GE took a very hard look at proposals made by BIRD and in June 1968 it took an option to purchase the property at a price $1,700,000 less than BIRD had paid for it. GE, driving a hard bargain, insisted that the property he rezoned and ready for construction by early 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The property, which abuts the southern boundary of Columbia, is approximately square, about one and one-half miles on each side. Interstate Route 95, now under construction, is its eastern boundary; the north side is bounded by new Maryland Route 175, parts of which are under construction; the western boundary is New Berger Road, planned and engineered as a four-lane dual highway and to be constructed by BIRD at its expense; the southern boundary will be a spur of the C&amp;O-B&amp;O Railroad which' is b\u00e9ing extended from Annapolis Junction, through which the railroad\u2019s main line passes.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The northernmost 377 acre portion of the property is part \u2022of the 14,000 acres that were classified \u201cNew Town District\u201d in 1965. On the Preliminary Plan approved in connection with the 1965 rezoning- it was designated as an \u201cemployment uses\u201d area in which the regulations permit local and general business, motels, shopping centers, and light and restricted manufacturing. HRD -recently acquired the remaining 710 acres for 'the specific purpose-of meeting GE\u2019s requirements. All but 100 of the 710 acres had been owned by two sand and gravel companies and there is uncontradicted evidence that their mining \u25a0operations (a non-conforming use) had, been both active and extensive. All but 57 acres (zoned M-l [Heavy Industrial]) \u2022of the sand..and gravel companies\u2019 .property had been zoned R-20 (Residential-Half acre lots) in' the comprehensive zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of <em>1961. </em>The 100 acres acquired from others are also in the R-20 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">1 LRD and GE seem to have agreed that the county\u2019s existing zoning classifications were not compatible with GE\u2019s proposed use of the property. GE contemplates \u201cthe development of a production and distribution facility designed to supply the full range of major home appliances to the eastern seaboard of the country.\u201d The plant is to consist of buildings aggregating 4,500,000 sqitare feet of floor space, costing not less than $250,000,000. An annual payroll of $100,000,000 is expected to be distributed to a minimum of 12,000 employees. Having concluded that the creation of a new zoning classification would be necessary to accommodate GE\u2019s \u201cmodern complex of industrial facilities\u201d 1 f RD, on 18 September 1968, filed a petition to amend the zoning regulations by adding thereto new Section 14A creating the concept of the Industrial Development (ID) Zoning District and providing the procedure for establishing such districts. At the same time HRD filed another petition seeking the deletion of the 377 acre portion from the New Town District so that it could be made a part of the 1,087 acres under option to GE. HRD also represented to the Commissioners that reclassification of the 1,087 acres to ID would be sought, if and when the Commissioners enacted Section 14A.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Pursuant to a proper notice by publication the Commissioners held the scheduled hearing, in respect of proposed Section 14A, on 11 October 1968. Experts and employees of HRD and GE testified at length in support of the adoption of the new section. A number of residents testified that they favored its adoption. Mrs. Ella Mae Bowie was the only one of the appellants who testified at that hearing. She said she had \u201chad an opportunity to read and digest\u201d Section 14A; she said she was in favor of \u201corderly industrial development\u201d in Howard County; but she couldn\u2019t say whether she was for Section 14A or against it. The report of the Howard County Planning Commission recommended approval with some changes. On 15 October 1968 the Commissioners adopted Section 14A, after having included the changes' recommended by the Planning Commission. plus a few of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>On 11 October 1968, the Commissioners also heard (immediately following the Section 14A hearing) testimony in respect of HRD\u2019s petition to delete the 377 acre portion from the New Town District. Counsel for the protestants (appellants included) said he thought it was \u201cnecessary to agree to the deletion. We have no opposition to that,\u201d he said, adding that the protestants were \u201cnot going to raise any opposition.\u201d There followed then a lengthy colloquy between counsel and the Commissioners, after which, on motion of the protestants, the hearing was continued to 15 October at 1:3G p.m. Other than to introduce (by stipulation) the testimony offered in the hearing on Section 14A, the protestants presented nothing further when the hearing was resumed on 15 October.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On 16 October 1968, the day after the Commissioners enacted Section 14A, HRD filed its petition for the reclassification of the property to an ID district. Included, of course, were the 377 acres deleted from the New Town District. The hearing, of which proper notices had been given, was held on 1 November 1968. First off the protestants, now represented by new counsel, pressed for a postponement. It was denied, as was another request made at the close of petitioners\u2019 case. Employees of both HRD and GE testified at length in support of the reclassification to ID. There was also an abundance of testimony from experts in the field of real estate, planning and zoning' to the same effect. A number of citizens voiced support. The report of the Planning Commission recommending the reclassification and giving its reasons therefor was filed. The Howard County Metropolitan Commission offered no objection. Neither did the State Roads Commission. From the testimony, surveys, maps, plats, reports and studies before the Commissioners one could conclude without difficulty that in 1961, when the comprehensive zoning map was adopted, Howard County was distinctly rural in character. Nearly all of the property was classified R-20. Adjacent areas were classified either R-20 or R-40 (Residential \u20141 acre lots). A narrow, secondary road provided the only access to the property. No rail service was available. Other than farming, the sand and gravel operations constituted the only business activity in the area. One could also arrive at the following conclusions. The rezoning in 1965 of the adjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>14,000 acres (including the 377 acres of the property) to a New Town District resulted in the birth of Columbia and the beginning of its sturdy adolescence; its present population is said to be about 4,000. The increase in sand and gravel operations brought about the reclassification of 57 acres of the property to M-l. Interstate 95, in 1961 nothing but a dotted line on the maps, was, in 1968, under construction along the eastern boundary of the property. The interchange of the new four-lane Route 175 and Interstate 95 in the northeast corner of the property was being built in 1968 but it was unheard of in 1961. New Berger Road (North South Parkway) along the western boundary of the property had not been contemplated in 1961. No one gave rail service a thought in 1961 because there was no need for it, but a representative of the railroad\u2019s Industrial Development Department testified (in November 1968) that 37 men had been busy for nearly a year furthering the planned extension of trackage to Columbia by way of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Of the appellants only Airs. Bowie and the McMullens testified. In Mrs. Bowie\u2019s opinion, as she expressed it, while \u201cindustry is very important * * * the value of * * * [her] property was going to drop\u201d and the relocation of roads would cause some inconvenience. Mr. McMullen expressed some uneasiness about the effect of GE\u2019s activities on the value of his property. He thought \u201cproperty values would definitely go down.\u201d Mrs. McMullen expressed similar misgivings. Mr. McMullen returned to the witness chair later on and told of his investigation of GE\u2019s plant at Eouisville, Kentucky. Plis comment is of interest :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c* * * I would like to say that all the information that I obtained [from Eouisville] was most favorable. The people down there were only unhappy with General Electric because they weren\u2019t looking for more acreage down there and that they looked upon them as being first rate corporate citizens. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Mrs. Carroll E. Lonas (not an appellant), felt that the value of her property would be diminished. No expert testimony was produced on behalf of the appellants or other protestants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>nor was any effort made to support the anticipated decline in the. value of their properties. Indeed, there was considerable expert-testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On 4 November 1968 the Commissioners approved the deletion of the 377 acres from the New Town District and the reclassification of the property to ID. Their findings were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201c(a) That the Petitioner's preliminary plan introduced in evidence meets the requirements of Section 14-A of the Zoning Regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201c(b) That if the petition is granted, the subject property will be used as an industrial development under the ownership of The General Electric Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c(c) That the intent to develop the tract as an industrial development is bona fide and that the parties involved have the resources to develop it in accordance with the preliminary plan introduced in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201c(d) That the Petitioner and the parties involved in the proposed development of the subject property have the requisite intent and capability to fulfill their additional contractual requirements, if this rezoning is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201c(e) That the granting of this rezoning is in the public interest and will promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201c(f) That the granting of this rezoning and the industrial development of the subject tract is not inconsistent with and is compatible and harmonious with the comprehensive plan of development of Howard County, as evidenced by the report of the Planning Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">\u201c(g) That the granting of the rezoning and the development in accordance with the preliminary development plan submitted will not adversely affect the surrounding properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">\u201c(h) That the subject property is suitable for the development of a large industrial complex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>On 3 December 1968 the appellants filed their bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County. After reciting the facts they alleged that the \u201cact of the * * * Commissioners * * * was illegal, unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, invalid and void * * * [stating as] reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201c(a) That there was no substantial or sufficient evidence to support <em>the finding of said Board that said reclassification was warranted due to a change in the character of the neighborhood. </em>[Emphasis added. |</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c(b) That the zoning reclassification is not in accordance with the General Plan of Howard County as adopted July 20, 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201c(c) That there was not sufficient time allowed to acquire expert testimony to refute the recommendation of the Planning Commission of Howard County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201c(d) That said reclassification is strictly for the private interests of private individuals and will be a detriment to the residential areas in said neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">\u201c(e) That said reclassification will result in a congested and harmful traffic pattern within the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201c(f) That said reclassification will adversely affect the said properties of your Complainants and greatly depreciate the value thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The case came on for trial before the chancellor, Macgill, C. J., on 27 January 1969. The appellants repeated substantially the same testimony given before the Commissioners. No expert testimony was offered although on 2 January 1969 Judge Mac-gill, over the objection of HRD, had indicated that \u201che would hear additional testimony in open court should the Complainants desire to produce such.\u201d HRD offered additional testimony but it was concerned chiefly with appellants\u2019 alleged lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Judge Macgill filed his opinion on 31 January (four days later) ; he commented on his expedition in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">\u201cWhen the matter came on for hearing before the writer in open court, on January 27th, 1969, a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tain amount of additional testimony was put on by the Complainants and transcripts of the testimony taken in several hearings before the Board of County Commissioners were offered in evidence along with a quantity of exhibits which had been hied with and considered by the Board in arriving at its decisions. This Court has been asked to give its decision on or before January 31st and it has agreed to do so, but it is regrettable that the consideration of a matter so complicated and of such importance should be limited to such a short period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Judge Macgill concluded that the \u201ccircumstances are sufficient to show that Mr. and Mrs. McMullen, at least, have standing to maintain the action.\u201d In this Court HRD put it to&gt; us quite strongly that Judge Macgill erred in this regard and that the appeal should be dismissed. We shall not undertake analysis of the evidence relied upon by HRD to support its-contention. It suffices to say we are not persuaded that Judge Macgill\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">HRD insisted below, as it did here, that the ID district is in reality a \u201cfloating zone.\u201d We think Judge Macgill was correct in rejecting this concept of the ID district. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cThe Board, in making its findings, apparently was treating the I-D district as a floating zone and therefore deemed it unnecessary to make findings as to whether there had been a change in conditions since the adoption on May 11th, 1961, of the comprehensive zoning map or a mistake in zoning as to the property in question. The requirements of showing mistake or change are not applicable when a floating zone is involved. <em>Huff v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra [214 Md. 48 (1957)], <em>Costello v. Sieling, </em>223 Md. 24, <em>Beall v. Montgomery County Council, 240 </em>Md. 77, and <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Tipton, </em>244 Md. 77. If the I-D district be a floating zone, and it has many of the characteristics of one, then, on the evidence summarized, this Court would have no hesitation in finding that the action of the Board was, at. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>least, \u2018fairly debatable\u2019 and consequently must be allowed to stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201cThe I-D district is different in one important aspect from the floating zones described and discussed in the cases cited. It permits <em>all </em>manufacturing and industrial uses while the other floating zones <em>specify the uses permitted </em>and exclude all others. If the I-D district is valid as a floating zone, then it can only mean that industrial uses, indefinite as to number and unascertainable as to character, may be permitted to descend or be anchored in any use area dependent upon the factual findings in any particular case, a privilege which is presently denied to even the lightest of commercial uses. The Board, in approving the creation of the I-D district, did not specifically express an intention that it was planned to be compatible with residential uses or was to be \u2018superimposed upon property previously classified as residential on substantially the same basis that a particular use might be allowed in a residentially zoned area as a special exception.\u2019 <em>Overton v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>223 Md. 141, 150. A comparison of the restrictions imposed on the I-D district with those imposed on the various other non-residential districts in the zoning regulations of the County shows that the T-D restrictions are not materially more detailed or more stringent, particularly in view of the open-ended uses permitted. It is true that a greater setback is required but this is balanced by the fact that the unspecified uses of the I-D district may, potentially, have a greater impact on the surrounding area than those uses permitted in all except M-2 districts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201cThere is, in fact, no explicit mandate in the language providing for the district that <em>a site plan be approved * </em>* *. More importantly, there is no provision for a revocation of the classification if the restrictions imposed are not complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cIt is true that the I-D district has one of the fea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ttires; of a floating zone. It was not in the original zoning ordinance and was not designated on the comprehensive zoning map. This fact, alone, however, would not make it a floating zone. <em>Overton v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Compare Haldemanm v. Board, </em>253 Md. 298 (1969), holding M-R (Manufacturing-Restricted) to be a floating zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The chancellor went on to agree with the complainants (appellants) that the reclassification of the property to ID did not create a floating zone and \u201cthat mistake or change is the proper test to be applied.\u201d But, he said, he found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c* * * sufficient evidence of both to support the granting of the application and to rebut the contention that the action of the * * * [Commissioners] amounted to spot zoning. , \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201cThe evidence before the Board, and before this Court, shows that since the adoption of the comprehensive zoning map in 1961, a substantial amount of acreage in the subject property was reclassified, on November 13th, 1962, from R-20 to M-l northwest of Interstate 95 and that with the advent of Columbia, another substantial amount of acreage was preliminarily designated under the N-T zoning for \u2018employment center\u2019 uses, which, as it has been observed, comprehend both commercial and industrial uses. There was testimony that a railroad spur was planned along the southwesterly portion of the property and highways along the north and northeast boundaries. The southerly line of the property is bounded by 1-95. There is a reasonable prospect, therefore, that the land in question will be substantially\u2019 buffered from surrounding properties, whether they be residential or otherwise. Cf. <em>Beall v. Montgomery County, </em>supra, at page <em>97. </em>It is true,\u2019 as has been remarked, that only 1-95 is presently under construction but there was evidence before the Board sufficient to show that the railroad and the other roads'were \u2018reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future,\u2019 and the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>could take these prospects into consideration in deciding the question of reclassification. <em>Rohde v. County Board of Appeals, </em>234 Md. 259, 264, <em>Jobar Corporation v. Rodgers Forge, </em>236 Md. 106, 112. These evidences of change and of reasonably imminent change were sufficient, in the opinion of this Court, to make the action of the Board \u2018fairly debatable.\u2019 <em>Wakefield v. Kraft, </em>202 Md. 136, <em>Hyson v. Montgomery County, </em>242 Md. 55, <em>Kirkman v. Montgomery County Council, </em>251 Md. 273.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cAs to the question of mistake, the Board had before it the testimony of Air. Bock over as to the unsuitability of that portion of the property zoned R-20 for residential uses. An aerial photograph, offered in evidence, bears out his testimony. Substantial areas of the land appear to have been denuded and exploited for the purposes of quarrying sand and gravel. For a somewhat comparable situation, see <em>Ark Readi-Mix v. Smith, </em>251 Md. 1, where the Court of Appeals sustained the action of the zoning authorities in reclassifying property occupied by a sand and gravel plant as a non-conforming use, from a residential classification to a manufacturing classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Appellants contend that \u201csince mistake-change was not even considered, let alone \u2018debated,\u2019 \u2018fairly\u2019 or otherwise by the zoning board, it was an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power for the lower Court to substitute its judgment for the zoning board\u2019s and attempt to apply judicial expertise to an area of expertise reserved by constitutional law for the County Commissioners.\u201d The same contention was made before Judge Macgill who disposed of it in the paragraph of his opinion which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cAs it has been observed, the Board, in arriving at its conclusion, made no findings on the evidence before it as to change or mistake but acted on the theory of law that the I-D district was a floating zone. It is stated as a principle of law, however, that: \u2018The reviewing court has the right to consider grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>justifying the decision below, although the decision was not rested on such grounds and regardless of the fact that the theory advanced below is erroneous.\u2019 2 Am. Jur. 2d \u2018Administrative Law,\u2019 Section 756, citing <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, and <em>Union Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>(Ky.) 271 S.W.2d 361.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The authorities cited by Judge Macgill could be supplemented by our decisions in <em>Kirkman v. Montgomery County Council, </em>251 Md. 273 (1968), <em>Clark v. Wolman, </em>243 Md. 597 (1966), and <em>Serio v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>208 Md. 545 (1956), in which will be found solid support for the principle of law stated by him. In <em>Hoffman v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>187 Md. 593, 602 (1947), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cIn <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 374, 45 A. 2d 73, there was no evidence in the case to support the finding of the Board of Trustees, but in this case there is evidence to support the finding of the Board of Zoning Appeals. It is true that the reason set out in the resolution of the Zoning Board for refusing to grant this permit is not based on the reason pointed out in this opinion. Without deciding the question of whether the reason given by the Board is correct or not, it is none the less true that if its conclusion was correct it will not be set aside, even if the reason given therefor is wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">It is true, as appellants point out, that HRD\u2019s main effort before the Commissioners was directed to its claim that the ID district was in fact a floating zone. But, it seems, HRD did not intend to rely entirely on that theory because in its petition, after asserting that \u201cthe newly created \u2018floating\u2019 zone district\u201d did not require proof of mistake-change, it went on to state that \u201cas will be shown at the hearing there has in fact been a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood.\u201d Appellants must have been under the impression when their bill of complaint was filed that the Commissioners had made a finding of \u201cchange in the character of the neigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>borhood,\u201d because they complained that there was \u201cno substantial or sufficient evidence to support\u201d such a finding. They pointed out, also, that the \u201cmistake\u201d testimony came in \u201cby sheer accident\u201d but even if that is so its probative force is not thereby diminished. Incidentallly, it might be noted, the Commissioners did not use the expression \u201cfloating zone\u201d in their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Appellants argue at some length that the evidence is not sufficient to \u201cjustify the rezoning.\u201d We are not persuaded that this is so. We think there was quite enough evidence, virtually all of it undisputed, before the Commissioners to make the issues of change and mistake fairly debatable, even though the)\u2019 may not have been debated, fairly or otherwise, and we see no need to expand this opinion by discussing it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Early on we referred to the fact that GE had laid it down quite firmly that unless the property could be rezoned and ready for construction by early 1969 it would not go forward with the project. Expedition, if not haste, became necessary because of two impending events. The first was the submission to the voters in the election scheduled for 5 November 1968 of the proposed new charter for Howard County. If adopted by the voters the Commissioners, as provided in Section 1103(a) of the charter, would \u201ccontinue to hold office and exercise and perform their present powers and duties\u201d until 28 January 1969, the effective date of the new government, at which time they would become automatically three members of the new five member County Council. The second impending event was the zoning moratorium established by Chapter 181 of the Laws of Maryland of 1967. It was there provided, that \u201cif * * * [the] charter * * * shall be ratified,\u201d final action on any zoning shall be prohibited until the new government shall have assumed office. Appellants have striven to denigrate the action of the Commissioners with such expressions as \u201cthe last gasp\u201d of a \u201clame duck board * * * one day short of its lawful demise.\u201d While we deny no one the freedom of epithet we think the appellants, in this context, are somewhat out of line. Far from being \u201clame ducks\u201d the Commissioners were to become the majority of the new County Council upon the adoption of the charter. It was the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of the moratorium which made imperative the passage of the order of reclassification before 5 November. HRD surely was justified in being fearful that postponement until February 1969 might be fatal to the whole project. Without doubt the vigor and dash displayed by the Commissioners blunted the appellants\u2019 prime weapon but it does not follow that, in the process, any of their rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The reclassification is invalid, say appellants, because it is special legislation for a private corporation and not for the general welfare. \u201cIt is clear from the record [they continue] that from start to finish * * * [the Commissioners] acted as the handmaiden of Rouse [BIRD] and G.E. [GE] rather than as guardian of the public interest.\u201d It would have to be conceded that at some future tipie GE and perhaps BIRD may become the beneficiaries of this reclassification but appellants have not come near showing that the public interest and welfare may not also be served. Indeed, there are pages of testimony concerning benefits expected to inure to Howard County and its citizens. In <em>Pressman v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>222 Md. 330, 339 (1960), Chief Judge Brune, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cWe also find the appellants\u2019 contention that the rezoning .is invalid spot zoning because it is solely for the benefit of the proponents and hence is not in accordance with a comprehensive zoning plan or the general welfare, is not sustainable. Doubtless the proponents deemed it to their advantage to seek and obtain the rezoning, and it may very well be. Certainly, they would he unlikely to venture the large amounts of money required for the establishment of shopping centers unless they so believed.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Traffic congestion is \u201ccertain to be caused if this rezoning is granted\u201d argue appellants. It must be supposed, of course, that the volume of vehicular traffic will substantially be increased by GE\u2019s activities. But it must also be supposed that the proposed new roads (Interstate 95, new Route 175 and the New Berger Road) will be able to handle the increased volume well enough to avoid congestion. In any case there is uncontroverted testimony to that effect. In this regard, what we said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>in <em>Marcus v. Montgomery County Council, </em>235 Md. 535, 541 (1964), seems to be apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cAppellants draw attention to the claim that commercial and apartment zoning is likely to bring more people to a given area and that as a consequence the traffic and school population will increase, and that those members of the neighborhood using the local school and shopping area will suffer from the consequent traffic congestion and over-populated school facilities. These are inconveniences likely to be suffered by any member of the public, far or near, and do not require a denial of the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We have dealt with what we think are the most significant of the barrage of contentions made by the appellants. As to the remaining ones, we shall not undertake a discussion of them either because they present nothing new or substantial, or because they were not raised in the court below. Maryland Rule 885. Perhaps we should note that we are not unmindful of appellants\u2019 attack, in this Court, on the validity of the ordinance (Section 14A) establishing the ID zoning district. Since that question was not raised below we shall consider Section 14A as a valid enactment of law. <em>Board v.
