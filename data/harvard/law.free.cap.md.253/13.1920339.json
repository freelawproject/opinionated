In our recital of this extraordinary affair we shall be at all times mindful of the familiar rule that the evidence and all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered in a light most favorable to Ackerhalt. <em>Deremer v. Liston, </em>252 Md. 571, 250 A. 2d 622 (1969); <em>Finneran v. Wood, </em>249 Md. 643, 241 A. 2d 579 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Ackerhalt, 65 at the time, was employed by the appellee Han-line Brothers, Inc. (Hanline), as an \u201coutside paint salesman.\u201d Early in the forenoon of 24 March 1966 he visited a construction project near Riverdale to sell some paint. While looking for the paint foreman he tripped over a piece of building material. He broke his fall by extending his right arm. Later in the day, as he was homeward bound in his automobile, he was struck in the rear by another vehicle and \u201cjammed forward into the 1965 Ford\u201d ahead of him. He was thrown forward and his right hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>struck the \u201cdashboard.\u201d About four hours later his wrist began to swell causing him considerable pain. On the following day he went to see Dr. Isadore Shulman who found that he had sustained an \u201coblique fracture of [the] distal shaft of [thej ulna.\u201d Dr. Shulman, having applied temporary splints, referred him to Dr. Edward C. Wilson, Jr., who confirmed Dr. Shulman\u2019s diagnosis, adding that there was some \u201cseparation of the fragments.\u201d Dr. Wilson ordered X-rays and applied a plaster cast to his forearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The \u201cEmployee\u2019s Claim\u201d was prepared by the appellee Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (Liberty),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hanline\u2019s compensation carrier, in Liberty\u2019s Washington office. The claim recites, among other things, that Ackerhalt \u201cfell down on a piece of construction material\u201d on <em>Friday, 25 March 1966 </em>at 12 noon. The claim is dated 7 April 1966 and it appears to have been received in the Commission\u2019s office on 11 April. Although it was <em>not </em>signed by Ackerhalt it was signed by an agent of Liberty to signify consent to the passage of an award. The Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury, which also appears to have been prepared by Liberty, contains substantially the same information. It was received in the Commission\u2019s office on 4 April. The Commission\u2019s order finding accidental injury and awarding compensation was passed on 19 April 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">During the weeks following the award Liberty seems to have become aware of Ackerhalt\u2019s automobile accident of 24 March. It then succeeded in persuading the Commission to hold a hearing on the following two issues: (1) is Ackerhalt\u2019s disability the \u201cresult of an accidental personal injury rising out of and in the course of employment;\u201d and (2) should the 19 April 1966 award be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">At the hearing, which was held on 1 August 1966, Liberty appears to have persuaded the Commission that while Ackerhalt did sustain an accidental injury on 25 (24) March 1966, his disability \u201cis not the result of an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d and on 24 August the Commission rescinded its order of 19 April. At this point Ackerhalt retained counsel who, on 20 September, filed on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>behalf an appeal from the order of 24 August. During the week following the filing of the appeal, counsel for Ackerhalt and the Commission agreed that a rehearing would be scheduled upon the dismissal of the appeal. The appeal was dismissed on 28 September and the rehearing was scheduled for 3 October. At the hearing, which actually was held on 21 November, Liberty pressed, as it had at the 1 August hearing, for the denial of the claim on the ground that Ackerhalt\u2019s disability was the result of the automobile accident, not the fall. Counsel for Ackerhalt pointed out that it should not make any difference since he was in the course of his employment at the time of the collision. He was told by the Commission, he said, to file a new claim, asserting an injury in the automobile accident \u201cand then we [the Commission] will issue compensation.\u201d On 9 December the Commission passed an order in which it was stated that the Commission had \u201cconcluded to grant * * * [Ackerhalt\u2019s] mo-' tion for rehearing\u201d but at the same time it affirmed the order of 24 August rescinding the award of 19 April. There was no appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The new claim was filed on 19 December. The information contained therein was pretty much the same as that set forth in the earlier application except that the automobile accident was given as the cause of the injury. Liberty promptly demanded a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At the hearing, which was held on 23 January 1967, Liberty resisted the claim on the ground that Ackerhalt fractured his arm not in the automobile accident but when he fell earlier that day. The Commission found as a fact that he fell but that he did not injure himself, that he was injured in the automobile accident and that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The Commission\u2019s order was dated 2 February 1967. The appeal of Liberty was timely filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The case came on for trial on 2 April 1968. Liberty called Ackerhalt as an adverse witness and elicited from him testimony the relevant excerpts from which we have set out below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Ackerhalt, before the automobile accident on March 24, 1966, and after you had left Lando ver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Hills, you had stopped to buy groceries, and shopped on the way home, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That was my intention.

It is not clear in my mind, and it is not clear in my mind what the sequence of these injuries or accidents was, whether they both occurred the same day, one in the morning, one in the after<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>noon, different days, or what.

Ackerhalt introduced Dr. Shulman\u2019s report of 9 June 1966 and the Commission\u2019s order of 2 February 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-17\">In support of its motion for a directed verdict Liberty gave as its principal reason the lack of legally sufficient evidence to support a finding that Ackerhalt\u2019s disability \u201cto his right wrist * * * [was] the result of an automobile accident\u201d on 24 March. His \u201ctestimony [it went on to say] * * * [was] so contradictory that it * * * [had] no probative value\u201d requiring reliance by the jury on conjecture and speculation. That is also the thrust of its argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-18\">It will be helpful, perhaps, to give some thought to how the posture of Liberty in the court below may be affected by some of our recent decisions. In <em>Blake Constr. Co. v. Wells, </em>245 Md. 282, 286-87, 225 A. 2d 857 (1967), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-19\">\u201cThe decision of the Commission is, of course, prima facie correct and the burden of proof is upon the party attacking the same. Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (c). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>means nothing more than that, if the mind of the trier of facts is in equal balance on the evidence in the record, the finding of the Commission should be affirmed. <em>Greenwalt v. Brauns Bldg. Specialties Corp., </em>203 Md. 313, 318, 100 A. 2d 804 (1953). * * * In <em>Williams Constr. Co. v. Bohlen, </em>189 Md. 576, 580, 56 A. 2d 694 (1948) we held that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\u201c \u2019* * * where the Commission has considered evidence of essential facts, and has drawn one of two different permissible inferences, there may be imposed upon the party attacking the decision of the Commission merely a burden of persuasion, and not necessarily a burden of additional proof. He may rely upon identically the same evidence that was presented before the Commission. The provision of the Act placing the burden of proof upon the appellant means only that he must prove in the trial Court what he asserts. His burden is to convince the Court or the jury that the Commission decided incorrectly in interpreting the facts, or deducing the inference from the facts, or construing the law applicable to the facts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In <em>Richard B. Kline, Inc. v. Grosh, </em>245 Md. 236, 244, 226 A. 2d 147 (1967), Judge Finan, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law provides that an award of the Commission shall be presumed to be correct and that the party appealing from the award has the burden of proving that the Commission was in error. (Art. 101, \u00a7 56(c)). This Court has also on other occasions stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">\u201c \u2019The general rule in Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases is that where there is <em>any </em>evidence from which a rational conclusion may be drawn, as opposed to the theory of a prayer for a directed verdict, the trial court must leave to the jury all considerations as to the weight and value of such evidence.\u2019 <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Blamble, supra </em>[227 Md. 1], 4, 174 A. 2d 765.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>We said, in <em>County Comm'rs v. Cole, </em>237 Md. 362, 366, 206 A. 2d 553 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201cIf reasonable minds could not disagree about the conclusion resulting from a particular set of undisputed or conceded facts, the question becomes one of law to be decided by the court. <em>If reasonable persons could disagree as to what the facts are, or the inferences and conclusions to be drawn from undisputed facts, the question is one for the trier of the facts/</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It will be recalled that Liberty chose to meet its burden of proof with the testimony of Ackerhalt. We said in <em>P. Flanigan &amp; Sons v. Childs, </em>251 Md. 646, 652, 248 A. 2d 473 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cMaryland Code (1957, 1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 35, \u00a7 9 permits the calling of an adverse party as a witness. When an adverse party is called by an opposite party, the opposite party is bound by the testimony of the adverse party unless rebutted, contradicted or discredited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">To the same effect <em>see Crumpler v. Pierce, </em>252 Md. 545, 250 A. 2d 649 (1969); <em>Williams v. Wheeler, </em>252 Md. 75, 249 A. 2d 104 (1969); <em>Trusty v. Wooden, </em>251 Md. 294, 247 A. 2d 382 (1968). Since Ackerhalt\u2019s testimony has been neither rebutted nor contradicted we must determine whether it has been discredited. Liberty insists that the record is \u201creplete with admissions by * * * [Ackerhalt] that he injured and fractured his right wrist [in] the morning preceding the auto collision.\u201d Before considering whether any significance attaches to any such admissions, consideration must be given to those facts about which there seems to be no dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Ackerhalt tripped and fell around 8:30 a.m. on 24 March 1966. He used his right arm to break his fall. He felt no pain and he had no discomfort during the day. At 4:30 p.m. he was thrown up against the \u201cdashboard\u201d of his car, striking his right hand. Four hours later his wrist began to ache and to swell. He conceived the notion that his symptoms stemmed from the fall. Apparently that is what he told Dr. Shulman and the Lib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>erty agent who prepared the first Employee\u2019s Claim. He has been steadfast in his belief and he has said so on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">But Ackerhalt\u2019s belief that it is so does not make it so. Liberty, nevertheless, equates the fact that Ackerhalt <em>believes </em>he fractured his arm when he fell with its claim that it is a fact that he actually did fracture it at that time. A hundred years ago the world was full of people who believed that exposure to the night air was the cause of malaria and doubtless there were thousands who, upon request, would have given sworn testimony that it was indeed so. We now know, of course, that to acquire the disease one must be bitten by an infected female anopheles mosquito. It seems clear to us that Ackerhalt did not know when the fracture actually occurred even though he may have said it happened in the morning. In the circumstances then, we think he was stating not a fact but an opinion. It will be recalled also that Dr. Shulman referred Ackerhalt to Dr. Wilson for further treatment. Although Dr. Wilson\u2019s report is in the transcript of the record the parties apparently have chosen to ignore it. One should observe that Dr. Wilson saw Ackerhalt a week after his injury and that his report was dated 15 April. In the section of the report labeled \u201chistory as told by patient\u201d Dr. Wilson wrote, \u201cChain reaction automobile accident.\u201d We think perhaps this has a connotation of some significance. Reasonable minds could conclude that Ackerhalt related to Dr. Wilson the sequence of events on 24 March and that on the evidence before him Dr. Wilson concluded that the automobile accident caused the injury and that he might well have arrived at the same conclusion even if Ackerhalt had expressed to him his belief that the fall was the cause. The Commission, on the evidence before it, felt that \u201che hurt himself in the automobile accident\u201d because \u201che had no swelling, no immediate serious pain\u201d after the fall \u201cbut he did have it after the automobile accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Liberty has directed our attention to other \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in Ackerhalt\u2019s testimony and it must be acknowledged that there are a few, but any lawyer who is much in court knows that in any case where a witness gives testimony four times, once without counsel, over a period of 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>months, contradictions, inconsistencies and inaccuracies are bound to creep into the record. Indeed any witness who repeats testimony verbatim four times hand running is suspected of testifying by rote. We have examined the \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and \u201cinaccuracies\u201d poi\u00f1t\u00e9d out by Liberty but we see in them nothing of significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">An odd facet of this case is the apparent concession that Ackerhalt\u2019s injury is compensable whether it is the result of the. fall or of the automobile accident. Probably Liberty\u2019s change of heart after the first award was engendered by a notion that the injury, if sustained in the automobile accident, may not have arisen out of and in the course of Ackerhalt\u2019s employment. At some point, however', it must have become obvious to Liberty that Ackerhalt was, at the time of the collision, still in the course of his employment. It' is difficult to understand why it persisted thereafter in resisting the claim, particularly on the ground that the injury resulted from the fall.
