On February 26, 1968, the Governor of Maryland advised appellant\u2019s counsel that a hearing was scheduled for March 11, 1968, and further notified counsel to file \u201cwithin five days after receipt of the notice of hearing a statement, in writing setting forth the grounds of defenses upon which the extradition shall be contested.\u201d Haynes\u2019 counsel filed the requested statement by letter dated March 1, 1968, and asserted as grounds only defects in the indictment and the fact that Haynes was serving a suspended sentence imposed by the Circuit Court for Howard County in another matter. The March 11, 1968, hearing was postponed and rescheduled for April 18, 1968, at the request of appellant\u2019s attorney, who believed that the indictment was defective in that it stated merely that the alleged crime had occurred some time during the year 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">At the beginning of the hearing held on April 18, 1968, before the Governor\u2019s representative, Assistant Attorney General Buscher, the appellant and his counsel were advised that an amended indictment which alleged that the offense charged took place between May 19, 1966, and July 1, 1966, had been filed in the Loudoun County, Virginia, Court on April 11, 1968. At this time, counsel for Haynes requested another continuance which was not granted and the hearing proceeded. The record does not indicate that the appellant testified or even proffered any testimony indicating that he was absent from Virginia during the six week period in question or even during any portion of it. On April 18, the Governor of Maryland issued his warrant of extradition, directing the surrender of Haynes to the State of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>On April 19, 1968, the appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Washington County. After conducting a brief hearing on April 23, 1968, the lower court continued the proceeding and ordered that Haynes be released under bond. Two months after Haynes and his counsel had knowledge of the amended indictment, another hearing was held before the lower court on June 17, 1968. The sole evidence adduced by Haynes at this hearing was the testimony of Mr. Buscher as to the conduct of the extradition hearing before him. Appellant did not testify or adduce any evidence on his behalf as to his absence from Virginia between May 19 and July 1, 1966. After the hearing the lower court entered the order here appealed from denying Haynes\u2019 petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On appeal, Haynes argues that he was not afforded an opportunity to show either at the hearing before the governor\u2019s representative or at the hearing before the Circuit Court for Washington County that he was not in the Commonwealth of Virginia at the time of the alleged offense for which Virginia wishes to try him.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The hearing conducted before the governor\u2019s representative was pursuant to Code (1965 Repl. Vol.), Article 41, Section 19, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\u201cWhen a demand shall be made upon the Governor of this State by the executive authority of another state for the surrender of a person so charged with crime, the Governor may call upon the Attorney General or any prosecuting officer in this State to investigate or assist in investigating the demand, and to report to him the situation and circumstances of the person so demanded, and whether he ought to be surrendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">However, as conceded by the appellant\u2019s counsel at the habeas corpus proceedings, \u201cthe law is that the Governor is not required to grant an extradition hearing.\u201d As this Court stated in <em>Willin v. Sheriff, </em>201 Md. 667, 669, 95 A. 2d 87, 89: \u201cNo particular form of inquiry is prescribed. It has been held that the person demanded has no constitutional right to an executive hearing. <em>Ex parte Colier, </em>140 N.J.Eq. 469, 55 A. 2d 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>certiorari </em>denied, <em>Colier v. Meyer, </em>333 U. S. 829, 68 S. Ct. 416, 92 L. Ed. 1114.\u201d Appellant maintains that once he was granted a hearing that he was entitled to know with reasonable certainty when he was supposed to have committed the crime. Although it is correct that the extradition officers undertook to secure a particularization of the original indictment from the Virginia authorities, it is apparent that the original indictment which alleged that the act took place \u201cduring the year 1966\u201d was sufficient under Virginia law. Virginia Code (1960 Repl. Vol.), Sec. 19.1-172, provides in part: \u201cNo indictment or other accusation shall be quashed or deemed invalid: .... (6) For omitting to state, or stating imperfectly, the time at which the offense was committed when time is not the essence of the offense . . . .\u201d See <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 26, 37 S.E.2d 868; <em>Woods v. Commonwealth, </em>140 Va. 491, 124 S. E. 458; <em>Clopton v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 813, 63 S. E. 1022. The absence of a date in an indictment does not defeat the validity of a demand for extradition where the indictment is valid under the laws of the demanding state. See <em>People v. Doherty, </em>247 N.Y.S.2d 759, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>251 N.Y.S.2d 596, <em>State v. Phillips, </em>62 N.J.Super. 70, 162 A. 2d 113, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>34 N. J. 63, 167 A. 2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Appellant made no effort to testify or proffer any evidence to show that he was absent from Virginia during the six week period or even during a portion of it, and he cannot complain that he was wrongfully prevented from doing so since (1) he had no right to a hearing before the governor, (2) the indictment in its unelaborated form and at least in its amended form was a sufficient basis for the issuance of the extradition warrant, and (3) even if there were any irregularities, they could have been cured at the subsequent habeas corpus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">At the time of his habeas corpus hearing before the Circuit Court for Washington County, the appellant and his counsel had been aware of the dates alleged in the amended indictment for almost two months, yet not a scintilla of evidence was offered to show his absence from Virginia during any part of the six week period alleged in the amended indictment. The appellant\u2019s only explanation for such failure is that \u201cto require a man to show his absence from Virginia for so long a period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>flies in the face of both reason and equity.\u201d Even if this proposition were correct, Haynes would not be excused from coming forward with <em>some </em>evidence of absence from Virginia during some portion of the six weeks since the burden of showing non-presence was upon the appellant. See <em>Johnson v. Warden, </em>244 Md. 384, 223 A. 2d 584; <em>Koprivich v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 465, 200 A. 2d 49; <em>State v. Murphy, </em>202 Md. 650, 96 A. 2d 473, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U. S. 824; <em>Cohen v. Warden, Montgomery Co. v. Deten. Ctr., Rockville, Md., </em>252 F. Supp. 666 (D. Md.). However, we find that given the nature of the offense, an allegation that the act took place during a six week period was not improper. It is questionable that the removal of thirty-two head of cattle from Virginia was accomplished instantaneously or that their disappearance would be discovered as expeditiously as to allow the state to fix a date or dates with greater precision. In any event as this Court stated in <em>State v. Kriss, </em>191 Md. 568, 575-76, 62 A. 2d 568, 570: \u201cIn cases of fugitives from justice, under the Constitution of the United States, questions as to the sufficiency of the indictment are for the courts of the demanding state to determine. <em>Drew v. Thaw, </em>235 U. S. 432, 35 S. Ct. 137, 50 L. Ed. 302.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">For the above reasons the order of the Circuit Court for Washington County denying the writ of habeas corpus must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed; Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
