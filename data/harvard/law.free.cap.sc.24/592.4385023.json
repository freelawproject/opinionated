Plaintiff claimed that under a declaration of trust from one Lee, trustee, in favor of Polly and her daughter, Jeannette (wife of plaintiff), and the subsequent death, intestate, of said Jeannette, he was entitled to one-fourth interest, and the defendant, Polly Pickens, to three-fourths interest. The defendants claimed that Paul Pickens paid for the lot and all improvements'erected thereon; that Lee held as trustee for Paul; that the declaration of trust by Lee in favor of Polly and\u2019 Jeannette was made upon the procurement and false assertions of plaintiff, without the knowledge of defendants ; that Polly and Jeannette had paid nothing for the lot or its improvements, and that Lee was dead. Upon an issue submitted to the jury, they found that plaintiff bad no interest in this lot. The Circuit Judge (Wither-spoon) approved this finding, and dismissed the complaint.
