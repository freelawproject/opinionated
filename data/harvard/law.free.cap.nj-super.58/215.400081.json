A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation ease. The Deputy Director decided that the injury did not arise ont of and in the course of employment, and dismissed the petition. The County Court reversed, and awarded compensation. The employer, Ambassador Court, Inc., appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Petitioner was the superintendent of the employer's apartment building which contained 08 apartments and two stores. It is not denied that his duties included painting, plumbing, tile work, electrical repairs, removing wallpaper, tending the boilers and two incinerators, cleaning the stairways, hallways and basement, putting out the garbage, cleaning the sidewalk, and collecting rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Hayes testified without contradiction that he was required to wash the windows in vacant apartments, and that \u201call minor repairs\u201d were his responsibility. He also testified that he was instructed to wash the windows in occupied furnished apartments, but this the employer denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Petitioner sustained his injuries when he fell while attempting to pry open a window in one of the apartments which had become stuck with paint. He testified that the tenant, who had moved into the apartment a few weeks before, had asked him to wash the windows. The apartment was a furnished one (there were only three or four in the building), for which the tenant paid a good deal more rent than was paid for the unfurnished, and therefore when she said \u201cshe figured she was entitled to service,\u201d he agreed and undertook to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Hayes said no arrangement was made with the tenant for compensation. Although he acknowledged that he had anticipated a tip, he said that was because \u201cthey all gave me tips, regardless o\u00ed what I done, whether it was in the line of duty or not, they gave me a tip.\u201d He admitted also that the tenant had given him a tip when he moved some furniture for her, hut, on the other hand, he said that when he washed windows for a tenant of an unfurnished apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ment he agreed on a price beforehand, which he did not do here because he \u201cfigured that she was renting a furnished room and she was entitled to service.\u201d The occupants of the other furnished apartments never asked him to do their windows, he said, during the five months that he was superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">After washing three of the windows petitioner discovered that the fourth was stuck, apparently because of exterior painting. He then undertook to pry open the window with a screwdriver and fell when the window abruptly came free.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The tenant was not produced as a witness. Mr. Coggan, appellant\u2019s president, not only denied that he had instructed Hayes to wash windows in occupied furnished apartments but he went further and said on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cQ. Did you have any conversations with Mr. Hayes as regards doing work for tenants? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Q. What was that? A. He wasn\u2019t supposed to do nothing for tenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The appellant contended before the Deputy and in the County Court that the petitioner\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his duties because (1) he had been expressly instructed \u201cto do nothing for tenants,\u201d and (2) even if such a prohibition was not proved, washing the windows was a venture undertaken by Hayes on his own for his personal and exclusive benefit and private reward. Petitioner denied these contentions and, in addition, argued that they had no relevancy to the case at bar for he was injured not while washing windows hut while \u201cunsticking windows\u201d which was certainly within his authorized duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The Deputy Director made no finding upon the question of prohibition. He found against petitioner because (to quote from his opinion) \u201cwhen he went in to do the job in Mrs. Major\u2019s apartment he went in for the sole purpose of securing some reimbursement on his own, unconnected with his employment. He was washing the windows as a gesture or favor, if you will, to a Mrs. Major, for which he antici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>pated payment. Therefore, if in the course of that work he was injured, even though it was on the property of the respondent, it is my opinion it does not spell out liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The County Court, on the other hand, expressly held that the claimed prohibition liad not been proved. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The testimony of Mr. Coggan, quoted above, was the only evidence of such a prohibition. It is to be noted that, when asked to tell what conversations he had with Mr. ITayes \u201cas regards doing work for tenants,\u201d Mr. Coggan did not relate what had been said. Instead, his reply was \u201che wasn\u2019t to do nothing for tenants.\u201d Since there was no objection to this answer, we shall not comment upon its technical imperfection. However, even if we view this conclusion as being Mr. Coggan\u2019s impression of the substance of the conversation, it gives us nothing upon which we can say what this \u201cblanket interdiction,\u201d as the County Court called it, meant to Hayes in terms of the specific activities which necessarily take place in an apartment house. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Green v. De </em>Furia, 19 <em>N. J. </em>290, 299 (1955) \u201cIt is his understanding of the rule \u2014 and not his employer\u2019s \u2014 which controls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We think Mr. Coggan\u2019s words were not intended, even by him, to be accepted literally, for it is inconceivable that even the most arrogant of landlords would tell the superintendent of such a large apartment house never to do anything at all for any tenant. Consequently, since we have no way of deducing from this answer which specific activities were forbidden to Hayes and which permitted, we agree with the County Court\u2019s observation that \u201ca careful reading of the transcript below furnishes no testimony proving that washing a tenant\u2019s windows was specifically prohibited.\u201d In short, there was inadequate proof that Hayes was forbidden to wash windows in furnished apartments or told not to fix \u201cstuck\u201d windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">This brings us to the second question \u2014 whether in the absence of such a prohibition Hayes\u2019 activity was beyond the scope of his employment. The Deputy held that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>hurt while washing windows for pay, an errand of his own. The County Court, on the other hand, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201c* * * the facts of the instant case describe an accident that happened while the petitioner was attempting to release a defective window \u2014 not while he was washing windows, as the respondent assumes. There is no question but that the window washing was interrupted when petitioner was confronted by the window that refused to open. \u2022 Even if it be assumed that he was beyond the scope of his employment while washing the windows, petitioner stepped back into it when he undertook to release the paint-locked window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">A superintendent is defined as \u2018one who has the oversight and charge of some place, institution, department or the like.\u2019 A defective window conceivably could have come to the petitioner\u2019s attention on a routine inspection or as a result of a tenant\u2019s complaint. Or, as in the instant case, the superintendent could discover it while he was engaged in a different task in the apartment. In any case, it seems inconceivable to me that a superintendent, who admittedly did plumbing, electrical and other work for his employer, would be obliged to put his hands in his pockets when he came across a simple defect such as a stuck window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">I am satisfied, after an examination of the transcript of the proceedings below, that the petitioner sustained the burden of proving a compensable accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We agree with the County Court. <em>Cf. Miller v. C. F. Mueller </em>Co., 132 <em>N. J. L. </em>540, 546 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Moreover, even if we were to consider the freeing of the window as part and parcel of the operation of washing windows, we would arrive at the same result. Common experience tells us that janitors and superintendents do do things for tenants, and that, although they receive tips for it, the landlord benefits as well from the good will and the satisfaction of the tenants. <em>Cf. Britten v. </em>Berger, 18 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>215 <em>(Dept. Labor </em>1940). Certainly an apartment house containing 58 apartments and two stores would soon be in a disagreeable ferment if a superintendent absolutely refused to do anything for any tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Larson says (1 <em>Workmen\u2019s </em>Compensation, \u00a7 27.00, <em>p. </em>400):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201cAn act outside an employee\u2019s regular duties which is undertaken in good faith to advance the employer\u2019s interests, whether or not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>employee\u2019s own assigned work is thereby furthered, is within the course of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">See also \u00a7 <em>27.22(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In <em>Green v. De Furia, supra, </em>19 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages 295-296 </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cThe line which separates acts of an employee performed for his own personal benefit and those done in furtherance of Ms master\u2019s interests concededly is at times an illusive one, if it exists at all. Compare <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, </em>105 <em>Cal. App. </em>535, 288 <em>P. </em>129 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1930), and <em>Pawela v. Niagara From the Air, Inc., </em>204 <em>App. Div. </em>962, 37 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>66 <em>(App. Div. </em>1942), with <em>Ridler v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>224 <em>Minn. </em>256, 28 <em>N. W. 2d </em>859 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), and <em>Priglise v. Fonda, J. &amp; G. R. Co., </em>192 <em>App. Div. </em>776, 183 <em>N. Y. S. </em>414 <em>(App. Div. </em>1920). In deference to the broad and liberal interpretation to be accorded workmen\u2019s compensation laws, <em>Gargiulo v. Gargiulo, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>8, 13 (1953) ; <em>Spindler v. Universal Chain Corp., </em>11 <em>N. J. </em>34, 88 (1952), the courts have expanded the concept of \u2018arising out of the employment\u2019 to include acts normally outside the employment iierformed for the benefit of third persons but the effect of which is to foster public good will toward the master, <em>e. g., Yates v. Humphrey, </em>218 <em>Iowa </em>792, 255 <em>N. W. </em>639 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934) ; <em>Gross v. Davey Tree Expert Co., </em>248 <em>App. Div. </em>838, 290 <em>N. Y. S. </em>168 (1936) ; <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra; Pawela v. Niagara From the Air, Inc., supra; Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 27.22 (1952). * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Under the evidence in this case it cannot be said that either washing windows or freeing them was so clearly outside the range of Hayes\u2019 duties as to be outside his employment. The fact that he anticipated or expected a tip for his work did not make the undertaking one exclusively for his own benefit, or such an errand of his own as not to be compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
