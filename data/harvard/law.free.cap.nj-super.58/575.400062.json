A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AFz\">Plaintiff sued in the district court upon a series of promissory notes, alleging that he was a holder in due course. After trial without a jury judgment was entered in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Except for dates the notes were all in the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">\u201cTeal Corporation\u201d was typewritten. The signatures of Semar and Beling were, of course, handwritten.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Plaintiff introduced the notes in evidence and then rested. Defendant thereupon made an offer of proof that defendant Beling had signed as treasurer of Teal Corporation (Teal) with no intention to bind himself personally. Defendant argued that the typed name \u201cTeal Corporation\u201d followed by the two individual signatures created an ambiguity on the face of the note as to the capacity in which the individuals signed and, therefore, the proffered evidence was admissible because (to quote defendant\u2019s brief) \u201cthe existence of the ambiguity precludes the holder from becoming a holder in due course.\u201d Defendant offered nothing beyond the alleged ambiguity on the face of the notes to challenge plaintiff\u2019s status as a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">The trial judge agreed with defendant and admitted the evidence over plaintiff\u2019s objection. That evidence was to the effect that Semar was president and Beling treasurer of Teal; that the corporate by-laws required two officers to sign notes; that Semar and Beling intended to sign only as officers of the corporation and had no intention of binding themselves individually; and that the notes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>in payment for past due bills for accounting services rendered by the payee to Teal. There was no proof of any discussion with the payee about individual liability or non-liability. In fact the notes had been prepared by Teal and mailed to the payee. All notes of the series which had fallen due prior to April 1958 had been paid upon presentation at the National State Bank, out of Teal\u2019s account. Beling had no account at that bank. No demand had been made upon Beling for payment of any of the notes until after April 1958, when Teal filed a petition for reorganization in the federal court and thereafter failed to pay the remaining notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Upon this evidence the trial court found as a fact that defendant Beling had signed only as an officer of Teal, and that therefore, as a matter of law, Beling was not liable to the plaintiff individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Plaintiff argues first that, having placed his name upon the notes in the fashion indicated, Beling must be conclusively presumed to have signed as a co-maker. Plaintiff says that it has been so held in all cases in which the notes were signed exactly as here, even when the payee himself sued, citing <em>Betz v. Bank of Miami Beach, </em>95 <em>So. 2d </em>891 <em>(Fla. Sup. Ct. </em>1957); <em>Murphy v. Reimann Furniture Manufacturing Co., </em>183 <em>Or. </em>474, 193 <em>P. 2d </em>1000 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); <em>Way v. Lyric Theater Co., </em>79 <em>Wash. </em>275, 140 <em>P. </em>320 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914); <em>Toon v. McCaw, </em>74 <em>Wash. </em>335, 133 P. 469, <em>L. R. A. </em>1915 <em>A. </em>590 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913). See also <em>Lazarov v. Klyce, </em>195 <em>Tenn. </em>27, 255 <em>S. W. 2d </em>11 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1953); <em>Starley v. Deseret Foods Corp., </em>93 <em>Utah </em>577, 74 P. <em>2d </em>1221 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938); <em>Moore v. Webster, </em>191 <em>Wash. </em>394, 71 P. <em>2d </em>369 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937); <em>Coal River Collieries v. Eureka Coal &amp; Wood Co., </em>144 <em>Va. </em>263, 132 <em>S. E. </em>337, 46 <em>A. L. R. </em>485 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. </em>1926); <em>Farmers\u2019 State Bank of Newport v. Lamon, </em>132 <em>Wash. </em>369, 231 P. 952, 42 <em>A. L. R. </em>1072 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925); <em>Rudolph Wurlitzer Co. v. Rossmann, </em>196 <em>Mo. App. </em>78, 190 <em>S. W. </em>636 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1916); <em>Exchange </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>Bank of Marcus v. Schultz, </em>167 <em>Iowa </em>136, 149 <em>N. W. </em>99 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Furthermore, argues plaintiff, even assuming that the circumstances known to the payee when it received these notes should have raised a question in its mind as to the capacity in which Beling signed, that was not an ambiguity on the face of the notes as against plaintiff here, for he was a holder in due course. Defendant, on the other hand, contends that the very face of the notes \u2014 the typed corporate name followed by the two handwritten signatures \u2014 must raise a question in the minds of all (including those who would otherwise be holders in due course) as to the capacity in which the individuals signed, and, therefore, the parol evidence was properly received even against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The question is whether the <em>face </em>of these notes presents an ambiguity as to the capacity in which <em>Beling </em>signed. If it does not, the parol evidence was improperly received. <em>Britton, Bills and Notes </em>(1943), <em>pp. </em>788, 791; 8 <em>Am. Jur. Bills and Notes </em>\u00a7\u00a7 468-470, 477-480; Annotations, 42 <em>A. L. R. </em>1075, 111 <em>A. L. R. </em>650.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The parties agree that the precise question now before this court has not been decided in any reported New Jersey case. <em>Cf. Weinstein v. Bobker, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>187 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1935); <em>Phelps v. Weber, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>630 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913) ; <em>Simanton v. Vliet, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>595 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1898); <em>Reeve v. First National Bank of Glassboro, </em>54 <em>N. J. L. </em>208 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1891) ; <em>Kean v. Davis, </em>21 <em>N. J. L. </em>683 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1847) ; <em>Budelman v. White's Express &amp; Transfer Co., </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>511 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958). However, the able briefs of counsel have skillfully marshalled the authorities in other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Section 20 of the N. I. L. <em>(B. S. </em>7:2-20) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201cWhere the instrument contains or a person adds to his signature words indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if he was duly authorized; but the mere addition of words describing him as an agent, or as filling a representative character, without disclosing his principal, does not exempt him from personal liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>It will be observed that this section contemplates two methods whereby the agent may disclose his intention to bind his principal and not himself. The first is bjr adding to his signature words indicating that he signs for a principal. That is not involved in the case at bar. The second is by seeing to it that the instrument contains words indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal. <em>Of. Britton, supra, pp. </em>780-781.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">To determine whether the \u201cinstrument contains * * * words indicating that he signs for * * * a principal,\u201d we examine not only each word, name and signature within its four corners, but we take into consideration the position, style and arrangement of the component parts, their relation to each other, and whether they are written, typed, printed or lithographed. As <em>Britton, supra, </em>says at <em>p. </em>783:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cIn most of the cases where an agent is sued personally, the agent in a subjective sense no doubt has intended to bind his principal and has intended not to bind himself. Whether the law will carry out each of these two intentions depends upon the extent of his disclosure on the instrument of his principal\u2019s identity and the fact that he, himself, acted in his principal\u2019s behalf. The question is largely one involving the form of the signatures and of the relations between them, <em>for the intent which controls is the objective intent of the agent as disclosed on the instrument. </em>Hence an agent may very well be held liable personally, in many eases, where, in a subjective sense, he never intended to be so bound. Justifiable reliance by the adverse party on the objective evidence overrides the agent\u2019s subjective intent.\u201d (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">So viewed, \u201cwhenever the form of the paper is such as fairly to indicate to the eye of common sense that the maker signs as agent or in a representative capacity, he is relieved of personal liability if duly authorized\u201d <em>(New Georgia National Bank v. J. &amp; G. Lippmann, </em>249 <em>N. Y. </em>307, 164 <em>N. E. </em>108, 109, 60 <em>A. L. R. </em>1344 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1928)) and if the instrument does not so \u201cfairly * * * indicate,\u201d but is so ambiguous as to put a reasonably prudent man on inquiry as to whose obligation the instrument is, parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>evidence is admissible, even against an indorsee \u2014 \u201canother way of stating, perhaps, that an indorsee under these circumstances is not a holder in due course.\u201d <em>Britton, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>788; <em>Rood v. McCann, </em>103 <em>Ohio App. </em>55, 144 <em>N. E. 2d </em>263 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1951). In all other cases the agent is conclusively personally liable, regardless of his subjective intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Defendant argues that signing a corporate name always requires the hand of an agent, and that we should take judicial notice that when a corporate name is signed it is nearly always followed by the name or names of the corporate agent or agents who signed it. Therefore, says defendant, the court should conclude as a matter of law that the typed name of a corporation followed by two individual signatures creates an ambiguity as to the capacity in which the individuals signed, citing <em>Rood v. McCann, supra; Canton Provision Co. v. Chaney, </em>70 <em>N. E. 2d </em>687 <em>(Ohio Ct. App. </em>1945); <em>First State Bank of Denton v. Smoot-Curtis Co., </em>121 <em>S. W. 2d </em>661 <em>(Tex. Civ. App. </em>1938); <em>Austin Nichols &amp; Co., Inc. v. Gross, </em>98 <em>Conn. </em>782, 120 <em>A. </em>596 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1923); <em>Hoffstaedter v. Lichtenstein, </em>203 <em>App. Div. </em>494, 196 <em>N. Y. S. </em>577 <em>(App. Div. </em>1922). See also <em>Central Bank of Rochester v. Gleason, </em>206 <em>App. Div. </em>28, 200 <em>N. Y. S. </em>384 <em>(App. Div. </em>1923); <em>Baach v. Bank of Pocahontas, </em>151 <em>Va. </em>274, 160 <em>S. E. </em>68, 16 <em>A. L. R. </em>1324 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. </em>1931); <em>Germania National Bank of Milwaukee v. Mariner, </em>129 <em>Wis. </em>544, 109 <em>N. W. </em>574 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1906). For example, in <em>First State Bank of Denton v. Smoot-Curtis Co., supra, </em>the court said at <em>page </em>669 of 121 <em>S. </em>W. <em>2d:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cNo one haying signed the note as an official of the corporation, showing an intent to act for and bind the corporation, and Curtis\u2019 name appearing on the note, just under the corporation\u2019s name, the inquiry is presented \u2014 who is Homer S. Curtis and how and why does his name appear on the note?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\"><em>Cf. Britton, supra, pp. </em>782-783, 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>However, none of the eases cited by defendant involves the precise situation we have here, <em>i. e., </em>the liability of the <em>second </em>signer below the corporate name. Cases such as <em>Denton, supra, </em>which permit parol evidence where the signature is \u201cP. Co., A.,\u201d are based upon the assumption (which may be justified, a point which we do not need to decide here) that when business men see a typed corporation name followed by the signature of an individual who does not state the capacity in which he signs, they usually do believe that the individual is signing as agent for the corporation. But is it reasonable to assume that business men have the same belief as to the second (or third or subsequent) individual signer who signs in the style and at the place at which Beling signed? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><em>BeuteVs Brannan Negotiable Instruments Law (7th ed., </em>1948), \u00a7 20, <em>p. </em>413 cautions \u201ccourts to exercise a little common sense and to recognize mercantile usage,\u201d adding that \u201cmuch of the difficulty found in this subject is purely manufactured and would not trouble a business man for a moment.\u201d We think that a business man (unaware of the facts known to the payee) would assume that <em>this </em>signature of Beling\u2019s on <em>this </em>note is that of a co-maker. In <em>Lazarov v. Elyce, supra, </em>at <em>page </em>13 of 255 <em>S. W. 2d </em>it was said that a court may take judicial notice \u201cof the universal custom that the signature of an individual on the face of a note, at the bottom on the right, without limiting or descriptive words before or after it, is the universal method of signing a contract to assume a personal obligation.\u201d <em>Cf. Coal River Collieries v. Eureka Coal &amp; Wood Co., supra, </em>at <em>page </em>343 of 132 <em>S. E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In <em>Betz v. Bank of Miami Beach, supra, </em>at <em>page </em>894 of 95 <em>So. 2d, </em>the Florida Supreme Court said (emphasis ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201cIn the notes before us there is nothing other than the name of the corporation, typed above the signatures of Kaye and Betz to indicate that the payee and makers of the notes considered the instrument not to be binding on Betz as an individual maker. Betz signed, exactly as he would have if it had been his intention to bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>himself individually. His signature as written makes him personally liable as maker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">Not having availed himself of the opportunity, expressed in Sec. [20], <em>supra, </em>to escape personal liability we feel it clear that he is bound individually as a maker, that there is no ambiguity in the notes <em>as to Betz </em>and therefore it is unnecessary to consider whether parol evidence should be admitted to allow him to show his liability to be contrary to what it appears to be from the face of the notes as they were actually signed, as they were delivered to the Bank and as they were sued on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">The result of this decision may be considered to be harsh. Yet in view of the importance of negotiable instruments in business, banking and finance, the need for certainty and stability in the meaning of what appears on the face of such instruments and in view of what we believe the intention and meaning of the pertinent sections of the Negotiable Instruments Law to be we believe the rule we have adopted to be the better view. We believe this rule will cause less harm to commerce and result in less litigation than if we adopted the opposite view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that here there was no such ambiguity as to Beling\u2019s signature and obligation as would prevent plaintiff from being a holder in due course, and we hold that as against him the parol evidence should not have been admitted. We do not pass upon whether the evidence would have been admissible had the action been by the payee. The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to the district court for the entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
