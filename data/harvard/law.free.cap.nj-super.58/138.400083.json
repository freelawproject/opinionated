Defendant Thomas Iovino appeals from an order entered by the Chancery Division on January 26, 1959, vacating a judgment <em>nisi </em>dated October 8, 1958, dismissing without prejudice the divorce complaint upon which the judgment was entered, but requiring the payment of the counsel fee awarded to the plaintiff in that judgment. The notice of motion to vacate was made December 12, 1958, prior to the date when final judgment ordinarily would have been entered. <em>R. R. </em>4:98-7 provides that final judgment shall be entered by the clerk, \u201cas of course, immediately upon the expiration of 3 months from the entry of the judgment nisi, unless that judgment be appealed from or proceedings for review are pending, or the court, before the expiration of said period, for sufficient cause upon its own motion or upon the application of any party, whether interested or not, otherwise orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Tliis is the second suit between these parties. The plaintiff had previously instituted a maintenance action against the defendant in which she was awarded judgment on February 14, 1957. The complaint in this cause, for absolute divorce on the ground of desertion, was filed February 5, 1958. Defendant did not answer, but filed an appearance pursuant to <em>B. B. </em>4:98-3, asking to be heard on the issues of custody, alimony, counsel fees and costs. The judgment nisi, entered after the usual hearing, adjudged the defendant to be guilty of desertion and awarded custody of the two infant children to the plaintiff, directing that defendant pay plaintiff the sum of $40 per week for the support and maintenance of herself and the two children. A $300 counsel fee and costs were awarded to plaintiff\u2019s counsel. It should be noted that the award of alimony to the wife and maintenance for the children did not comply with <em>B. R. </em>4:98-9, which requires that the judgment set forth separately the amounts allowed for the wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The notice of motion requested only the vacating of the judgment <em>nisi, </em>not the dismissal of the complaint, and did not seek a vacating without prejudice. The defendant opposed the motion on three grounds: (1) that the judgment <em>nisi </em>should not he vacated, since he had filed an appearance and contested certain issues: (2) that the vacating of the judgment <em>nisi </em>should bn with prejudice; and (3) that upon the vacating the provision, for counsel fees contained therein shonld also be vacated. Only in the affidavit of the plaintiff which is annexed to the notice of motion is there any reference to a dismissal of the complaint without prejudice. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice and, while counsel fees on the motion were denied, the counsel fee awarded by the judgment <em>nisi </em>was permitted to stand, in addition to which plaintiff was allowed her actual disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> It is well established that the State has an interest in the marriage institution <em>(Sobel v. Sobe1, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>376, 378 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926)) and that public policy favors a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>continuation of marriage and a reconciliation between an estranged husband and wife. <em>Cole v. Cole, </em>30 <em>N. J. Super. </em>433, 438 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1954); <em>Ferrari v. Ferrari, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>384, 387 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>Sheehan v. Sheehan, </em>22 <em>N. J. Super. </em>326, 330 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Grant v. Grant, </em>84 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>81 <em>(Ch. </em>1914). It was in furtherance of this public policy that <em>R. R. </em>4:94.4 was adopted, requiring reconciliation proceedings in certain counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The practice of allowing a successful plaintiff in a divorce suit to dismiss the suit and vacate a judgment <em>nisi </em>at any time up to the entry of final judgment has had general acceptance in this State and in most other states. 151 <em>A. L. R. </em>849 <em>et seq.; </em>174 <em>A. L. R. </em>519 <em>et seq. </em>Generally, it is held that the guilty party in a divorce suit does not ' have the right to compel the entry of a final judgment of divorce where, after an interlocutory judgment, the successful party fails to enter the final judgment. See <em>Pickles v. Pickles, </em>70 <em>R. I. </em>13, 36 <em>A. 2d </em>110, 151 <em>A. L. R. </em>847 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944), where the wife was permitted to dismiss her suit for divorce after the entry of a judgment <em>nisi </em>and before the entry of final judgment, even though there had been a counterclaim filed in the original suit. <em>Cf. Mattson v. Mattson, </em>85 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>454 <em>(Ch. </em>1915). Some of the reasons which have been deemed \u201csufficient cause\u201d for vacating a judgment <em>nisi </em>are collected in 12 <em>New Jersey Practice (Herr, Marriage, Divorce and </em>Separation), <em>sec. </em>1510, <em>pp. </em>596 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">As to defendant\u2019s first point of appeal, we find no sound basis for making the right of the successful spouse to discontinue the action depend upon whether defendant has filed an appearance or answered. The <em>Ferrari </em>case, <em>supra, </em>relied upon by defendant for that position, does not sustain it. That decision, however, does support the general right of the successful spouse after judgment <em>nisi </em>to have the action abated if a timely application is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We do, however, agree with defendant that the dismissal should be with prejudice to the right to institute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>another suit in the future on the same cause of action. Otherwise, plaintiff could bring suits <em>ad infinitum, </em>except as limited by <em>B. B. </em>4:42-l <em>(a). </em>Where the plaintiff proceeds to try his or her cause of action on the merits and secures the entry of a judgment <em>nisi, </em>he or she should not be permitted, in the absence of a showing of good cause, to dismiss the suit and retain the cause of action. It seems obvious that <em>Ferrari </em>did not intend such a result. Good cause for entering this dismissal \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d is not shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Under a statute similar to <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:34-19 (which contains virtually the same provisions as <em>R. R. </em>4:98-7), the Superior Court of Delaware, in <em>Vinyard v. Vinyard, </em>4 <em>Terry </em>422, 43 <em>Del. </em>422, 48 <em>A. 2d </em>497 (1946), on an application to vacate a judgment <em>nisi </em>prior to final judgment, said, at <em>page </em>501 of 48 <em>A. 2d:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cTlie petitioner has had determined her right to a divorce. She has now solemnly declared to the Court that she does not want a divorce. She will now be assumed to have made her final election and the dismissal of her action will accordingly be with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">See also, <em>Boyer v. Boyer, </em>115 <em>Colo. </em>429, 175 <em>P. 2d </em>92 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The plaintiff now having elected to dismiss her action, the dismissal must be with prejudice, so that the cause of action sued upon may not be used in the institution of a subsequent suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> In our opinion, the allowance of counsel fees in the judgment <em>nisi </em>should also have been dismissed. The judgment <em>nisi </em>was vacated <em>in toio </em>and the counsel fee, being part of the judgment, of necessity must also be vacated. To permit the counsel fee to remain ignores entirely the purpose for which counsel fees are allowed in matrimonial proceedings. It has been repeatedly held that in this type of suit counsel fees are allowed to enable the wife either to prosecute her suit or to defend one brought against her by her husband. <em>Morrison v. Morrison, 122 N. J. Eq. </em>233 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>(Ch. </em>1937); <em>Hopson v. </em>Hopson, 95 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>540 <em>(Ch. </em>1924); <em>Oram v. </em>Oram, 77 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>1 <em>(Ch. </em>1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The usual reason for the allowance of counsel fees and costs is therefore not present here. While the cited cases and others hold that in marital litigation the wife is a favored suitor, she may not use this position to exploit the defendant by requiring him to pay her counsel fees in a suit which she thereafter dismisses. Had the Iovinos reconciled their differences and thereupon sought a dismissal of the suit before judgment nisi, counsel fees would not have survived their reunion. <em>Cole v. </em>Cole, supra, overruling <em>Morrison v. </em>Morrison, supra, on this issue. See also, <em>Borin v. </em>Borin, 343 <em>Ill. App. </em>649, 100 <em>N. E. 2d </em>333 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1951); <em>Rhein v. </em>Rhein, 244 <em>Minn. </em>260, 69 <em>N. W. 2d </em>657 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We conclude that the order of January 26, 1959 should be modified to provide for the vacating of the judgment nisi, but with a dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice, and for the disallowance of costs and counsel fees provided for in the judgment <em>nisi. </em>No costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
