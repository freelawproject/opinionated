A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ANO\">Plaintiff brought this action in lieu of prerogative writs in the Law Division to challenge the legality of his summary removal as senior clerk in the tax receiver\u2019s office of defendant municipality and for an order directing his reinstatement to that position. An honorably discharged veteran of World War II, he claims that his dismissal derogated his tenure protection under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>38:16-1, the Veteran\u2019s Tenure Act. Cross-motions for summary judgment were made, and defendant appeals from the granting of plaintiff\u2019s. The essential facts, revealed by the pleadings and affidavits, are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Plaintiff was originally appointed a clerk in the tax office by resolution of the municipal council in January 1952 and was promoted to senior clerk, also by resolution, in December 1957. He continued in that position until January 1, 1959, when, again by resolution, others were appointed in his place. The city attempted to justify its action and based the argument in its appellate brief on the ground that plaintiff held an office or position rather than an employment, and, therefore, since there was never an ordinance creating the position, it has no legal existence, and there is, consequently, no present position to which plaintiff has any right to be restored. <em>Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>509 (1951); <em>Handlon v. Town of Belleville, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>99 (1950); <em>Wagner v. Borough of Lodi, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>204 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959). Plaintiff contends that his duties are more properly classified as those of an employee, and hence no creative ordinance is necessary. Alternatively, even if his status were that of a position-holder or officer, no creative ordinance was necessary because of the general hiring authorization contained in the City Referendum Charter Act, <em>B. S. </em>40:107 \u2014 1, specifically subsection (84) (to be found in \u201cActs Saved from Repeal,\u201d a separate volume of <em>N. J. S. A.). </em>A final contention, raised for the first time on this appeal, is that even if he were the holder of a position not validly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>created, he would still be entitled to tenure protection because of his <em>de facto </em>status.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">It is well settled that a municipal office or position, if not provided for by statute, can be created only by ordinance. <em>R. S. </em>40:48-1 (The Home Eule Act); <em>Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, supra </em>(7 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>524); <em>Handlon v. Town of Belleville, supra </em>(4 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>108); <em>Wagner v. Borough of Lodi, supra </em>(56 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>206); <em>City of Orange v. Goldberg, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>73, 75 \u2014 76 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); <em>Serritella v. Water Commission, etc., of Garfield, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>259, 263 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); <em>Toomey v. McCaffrey, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>364, 366 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936). In this context the terms \u201cposition\u201d and \u201coffice\u201d are used interchangeably. See <em>Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, </em>57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>13, 28 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959) (hereafter cited as <em>Sapienza, </em>the name of the co-plaintiff, to distinguish it from the previous Supreme Court decision of the same name, cited above). The sole basis of the trial court\u2019s action in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion in the instant case was its holding, in effect, that the Charter Act, cited above, constitutes a statutory creation of Kovalycsik\u2019s public post, precluding the necessity for a specific creative ordinance. The relevant provision of that statute reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201cThe city council may employ from time to time such assistants and employees as the necessities of the city may require, and may pay such compensation to them as such services may be deemed reasonably worth * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><em>R. S. </em>40 :48-l provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201cThe governing body of every municipality may make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">* * * 3. Prescribe and define, except as otherwise provided by law, the duties and terms of office or employment, of all officers and employees; and to provide for the employment and compensation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>suck officials and employees, in addition to those provided for by statute, as may be deemed necessary for the efficient conduct of the affairs of the municipality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The effect of the Charter Act section may well be to provide authority for the appointment of <em>employees </em>by this particular municipality notwithstanding the absence of an ordinance creating the employment. See <em>Barkus v. Sadloch, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>551 (1956), construing the cited provision of the Charter Act, and implicitly so holding. But to extend the operative scope of the section to municipal officers or position holders as well as employees would be to transcend its language and subvert the purpose of <em>R. 8. </em>40:48 \u2014 1. As continually reiterated by our courts, that section of the Home Rule Act was meant to assure that the creation of new offices and positions, because of the additional public financial burden they occasion, should be preceded by the deliberative legislative process and the public notice attendant upon the passage of an ordinance. See, <em>e. g., Handlon v. Town of Belleville, supra </em>(4 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>108); <em>Nolan v. Witkowski, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>480, 495 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959) ; <em>Hale v. Council of Town of Kearny, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>334, 335 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"> Furthermore, the suggested extension of the Charter Act provision is clearly contra-indicated by its language. While its first sentence uses both the terms \u201cassistants and employees,\u201d it is obvious that \u201cassistants\u201d was not meant to include \u201cofficers\u201d or position holders. The only reference to \u201cofficers\u201d appearing elsewhere in that section (concerning consolidation of offices) expressly indicates municipal action by ordinance. As to position holders, the long history of technical differentiation in the cases between public employments, as such, and \u201cpositions,\u201d warrants the assumption that the Legislature used the term \u201cemployees\u201d discriminatingly in the Charter Act provision, not intending to include holders of \u201cpositions.\u201d Consequently, there being no other statutory provision creating the position of senior clerk in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the Garfield tax receiver\u2019s office, we hold that if such a place was a \u201cposition\u201d it was not validly created.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">At the argument the city was permitted to make the additional contention in support of the necessity of an ordinance in this situation, that, even assuming plaintiff was occupying an employment rather than a position, the case of <em>Bullock v. Jeffries, </em>117 <em>N. J. </em>L. 595 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>119 <em>N. J. </em>L. 27 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1937), construes the Home Rule act to bring employments as well as other public posts within the mandatory requirement of a creative ordinance. While that seems a sound construction of the cited decision, so far as it goes, the case does not decide that an ordinance is necessary to establish employments which are created by other legislation. Since <em>Barhus, supra, </em>authoritatively decides, in effect, that insofar as Garfield is concerned the Charter Act is the statutory fount of all employments in that municipality, this case must be decided on the question whether plaintiff was an employee, and therefore no occasion is presented to construe the <em>Bulloch </em>case in the respect mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thus, if Kovalycsik was an employee and not a position-holder of the defendant city, we would be constrained under the <em>Barhus </em>decision to affirm the action of the trial court, since the 1942 amendment to the Veteran\u2019s Tenure Act (A. 1942, <em>c. </em>83) extended its protection to employees as well as to officers and position-holders. Although this question was not passed upon below, it was raised there, has been briefed and argued by both sides on this appeal, and since it is dispositive of the appeal, an exercise of our original jurisdiction is warranted. The affidavits are sufficiently complete to permit our making the necessary factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit describes his duties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201c\u00ae * * collect tax moneys at the window; collect water bills; keeping all records in connection with tax bills; preparing bills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>forwarding the same to taxpayers; assist the Tax Collector or Receiver in connection with tax searches; run posting and billing machine; issue water permits; issue water tapping permits; issue sewer permits; issue moving permits; and generally assist the Tax Collector or Receiver who designates the various duties to the Senior Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"> A supplemental affidavit avers such additional tasks as answering the telephone, running errands, emptying pencil sharpeners and filling inkwells.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The criteria for determining the technical status of a public post set forth in <em>Fredericks v. Board of Health, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>200, 201-202 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1912), have been frequently resorted to in the cases. See, <em>e. g., Serritella, supra </em>(128 <em>N. J. L. </em>at <em>page </em>261); <em>Barkus, supra </em>(20 <em>N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>554); <em>Thorp v. Board of Trustees of Schools for Industrial Ed., </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>498, 506-507 (1950); <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson Co. v. Brenner, </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>557, 559, 563 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed o. b. 13 <em>N. J. </em>288 (1954). According to those precepts, an \u201coffice\u201d presupposes employment which is governmental in character and duties certain and permanent; in a position the duties, while certain and permanent, may or may not be governmental (and are not assigned to it by any public law of this State); in an employment, the duties are neither certain, permanent, nor governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Applying these tests to Kovalycsik\u2019s description of his duties we find they were not those of a mere employee, but rather characteristic of a position. <em>Cf. Barkus, supra </em>(a switchboard operator acting also as-receptionist and clerk is an employee); <em>Serritella, supra </em>(a \u201cpumping station operator\u201d who did menial maintenance work is an employee). The menial duties referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental affidavit are merely incidental details which do not change the essential character of plaintiff\u2019s status, which we hold to be determined by those responsible functions performed by him which are set out in the original affidavit. These responsibilities, and hence his position, were neither casual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>greatly varied nor subject to change. They were performed regularly and constituted a customary and usual work routine requiring skill, discretion and public confidence. In effect, it was the same work one would expect to be done by the tax collector himself or his assistant. Furthermore, the nub of his duties, the responsibility for collecting public moneys and issuing the various permits, clearly indicates an intimate connection with work of a governmental nature. Finally, the trend of the cases makes clear that the policy of the Home Kule Act, effectuated by requiring positions to be created by ordinance, is best served by a strict interpretation of the employee category. See, holding various functions to characterize a position or office, <em>Grunewald v. Township Comm. of Weehawken Tp., </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>401 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962) (clerk-stenographer); <em>Margerum v. Mayor and Common Council of Borough of Princeton, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>36 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938) (night clerk); <em>Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>509 (legal assistant) ; <em>Sapienza, supra </em>(administrative secretary); <em>Handlon, supra </em>(clerk of recorder\u2019s court); <em>Hale v. Council of Town of Kearny, supra </em>(assistant water purveyor); <em>Van Brookhoven v. Kennedy, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>178 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed o. b. 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>507 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1910) (assistant superintendent of weights and measures) ; <em>Davaillon v. City of Elizabeth, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>380 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938) (assistant city clerk).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Having determined that Kovalyesik was the holder of a position not legally created, we turn finally to his argument that his <em>de facto </em>status entitles him to tenure protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Belief has invariably been denied where a validly appointed municipal officer or position-holder complains of dismissal from an invalidiv created post, the rule being that there can be no <em>de facto </em>holder of an office which is itself not <em>de jure, </em>since if there is no valid post there is nothing to which to reinstate the claimant. <em>Jersey City v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Department of Civil Service, supra </em>(7 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>525); <em>Handlon v. Town of Belleville, supra </em>(4 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>109); <em>Van Brookhoven v. Kennedy, supra </em>(125 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>182); <em>City of Orange v. Goldberg, supra </em>(137 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>pages </em>76-77); <em>Serritella v. Water </em>Commission, <em>etc., of Garfield, supra </em>(128 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>263); <em>Moriarity v. Board of Education of Garfield, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>73, 76 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945), affirmed o. b. 134 <em>N. J. L. </em>356 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946); <em>Salter v. Burk, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>152, 158 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1912); <em>Toomey v. McCaffrey, supra </em>(116 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>367); <em>Wagner v. Borough of Lodi, supra </em>(56 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>206). In those cases where reinstatement of a <em>de facto </em>officer was allowed, the defect was in the nature of the appointment rather than in the legal existence of the office. See <em>Shibla v. Township Committee, Wall Township, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>692 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948); <em>Magner v. Yore, </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>198, 199 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The rule that a prerequisite to the application of legal sanctions for <em>de facto </em>office holding is a <em>de jure </em>office is not confined to situations in which employment rights are in issue but is a well-established element of the <em>de facto </em>office doctrine in general. See discussion in <em>Lang v. City of Bayonne, </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>455, 458-463 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1907); 67 <em>C. J. S. Officers </em>\u00a7 136, <em>p. </em>440; 43 <em>Am. Jur., Public Officers, </em>\u00a7 475, <em>p. </em>228; <em>Annotation, </em>99 <em>A. L. R. </em>294 (1935); 3 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed. </em>1949), \u00a7 12.104, <em>p. </em>383. <em>Cf. Sapienza, supra </em>(57 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pages </em>27-34). See also <em>Kirby v. State, </em>57 <em>N. J. L. </em>320, 322 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1894) (a charge of official misconduct will not lie where the office is not <em>de jure). </em>Therefore the statement in the <em>Barlcus </em>case (20 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>557) that \u201cThe tenure statutes extend alike to <em>de facto </em>officers and <em>de jure </em>officers * * *,\u201d seemingly inconsistent with the rule that <em>de facto </em>occupants of posts never created <em>de jure </em>have no status to complain of dismissal, is actually consistent with that rule, since, in the technical sense, the reference to a <em>de facto </em>officer presupposes a <em>de jure </em>office. This conclusion is sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ported by the circumstance that the <em>gravamen </em>of the assault on the status of the job-holder in that case was the method of her appointment rather than that of the lack of a legal creation of the post, generically considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Plaintiff argues, however, that the recent decision by this court in <em>Sapienza, supra </em>(57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>13), is authority for the principle that despite the <em>\u201cde jure </em>office\u201d rule, <em>de facto </em>position-holders appointed and serving in good faith will nevertheless be protected from summary dismissal on the grounds of public policy and convenience, notwithstanding the position was never legally created. This proposition constitutes too broad a reading of that case. That case basically holds no more than that one who has served for years in municipal emplojinent both before and after the passage of a municipal ordinance reclassifying all positions in the municipal service cannot be denied, after dismissal, the statutory right of preferential reemployment in a suitable position newly and validly created, on the asserted ground that the ordinance was defective (57 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>26). The opinion expressly recognizes the continued subsistence of the general rule of <em>Jersey City v. Department of Civil Service, supra </em>(7 <em>N. J. </em>509), recently reapplied in <em>Wagner v. Borough of Lodi, supra, </em>to the effect that one cannot ask for judicial restoration to the occupancy of a municipal position which was never legally created (57 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>25).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The judgment is reversed and judgment directed to be entered in favor of defendant. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
