The State appears convinced of the defendant's guilt but nevertheless claims it has convicted the wrong person and wants to correct that error. The person the State convicted-that is, the person who was sent to prison for the crime-opposes the State's efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 The district court rebuffed the State's attempt to fix the situation with a motion made under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), reasoning that the court had lost jurisdiction over the case and that the State needed to proceed under the Post-Conviction Remedies Act (PCRA). The State petitions us for extraordinary relief and asks that we direct the district court to \"exercise jurisdiction over the State's motion for relief under rule 60(b)... and vacate the judgment and conviction ... based upon the defendant's fraud.\" We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the State's motion and that rule 60(b), not the PCRA, provides the mechanism through which the State may bring its challenge. We grant the writ and direct the district court to entertain the State's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 The defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was driving a vehicle that appeared to be unregistered and uninsured when Salt Lake City police pulled him over. During the traffic stop, police searched the vehicle and discovered drugs, drug paraphernalia, and a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 The defendant allegedly identified himself as Bela Fritz. It is unclear what measures the State undertook to confirm the defendant's identity, but the State apparently followed his lead and believed he was Bela Fritz. The State charged and prosecuted the defendant under the name Bela Fritz.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant moved through the criminal justice proceedings as Bela Fritz, at all times representing himself to be that person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 The State charged Bela Fritz with several offenses: possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a first degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 58-37-8(1)(a)(iii) ; purchase, transfer, possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person, a third degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-10-503(3)(a); and possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37a-5(1). Following plea negotiations, the State reduced the first offense to attempted possession, a second degree felony. The second offense remained unchanged, and the State dismissed the third offense. The defendant pleaded guilty to the reduced charges. A presentence report was then prepared with respect to Bela Fritz, recommending that he be sentenced to imprisonment for the term directed by statute.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-3-203(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 At sentencing, the district court reduced the judgment of conviction on the first offense to a third degree felony, applying Utah Code section 76-3-402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court then ordered that Bela Fritz serve a term of imprisonment of up to five years for\n   each offense, with the sentences to run concurrently. The defendant was then transported to the Utah State Prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 When the defendant arrived at the Prison, a Department of Corrections officer allegedly discovered that the defendant was not who he claimed to be. The problem, according to the officer, was that the two men did not look enough alike. During the intake process, the officer viewed a photo of Bela Fritz that the Department had on file and observed that it \"did not resemble the person standing in [his] office.\" The officer then asked the defendant to confirm personal information regarding his identity, and the defendant allegedly confessed that he had used Bela Fritz's identity rather than his own. The officer ran the issue up the chain of command, and eventually the State was notified that the Prison believed the defendant was not, in fact, Bela Fritz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Less than a month after final judgment had been entered against Bela Fritz, the State returned to the district court claiming the defendant had misled it about his identity. The State moved under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) to vacate the conviction, sentence, and judgment. The State informed the district court that the defendant had allegedly \"assumed [the] name of another actual person\" for purposes of the criminal proceeding. Thus, the State argued, it had erroneously convicted the defendant as \"Bela Fritz,\" and the defendant had been sentenced against the backdrop of Bela Fritz's criminal background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 The State noted that the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure \"govern in any aspect of criminal proceedings where there is no other applicable statute or rule.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 81(e). Arguing that no other statute or rule governed these \"unusual circumstances,\" the State asserted that rule 60(b) filled the gap. Applying subsection (b)(3), the State asked the district court to vacate the conviction, sentence, and judgment based on the defendant's fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   60(b)(3). In the alternative, the State urged the district court to invoke subsection (b)(6), which authorizes a court to grant relief from a judgment, order, or proceeding for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   60(b)(6). The State also moved for a misplea, citing the fraud the defendant allegedly perpetrated on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The district court denied the motion. The court reasoned that following imposition of a valid sentence, a district court loses subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Accordingly, the court concluded it had no authority to \"consider and decide the issues presented.\" Even if it had jurisdiction, the court noted, \"a [r]ule 60(b) set aside and declaration of misplea [would not be] warranted.\" In the court's view, the PCRA \"establishe[d] the sole remedy\" for the State to challenge the conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-9-102(1)(a). In addition, the court's \"authority to rescind acceptance of a guilty plea [was] specifically limited to the window before sentencing and judgment\" and \"that window [had] closed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 The State moved the court to reconsider. The State pointed to language in the PCRA authorizing \"a person who has been convicted and sentenced for a criminal offense [to] file an action.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-9-104(1). The State asserted that because it had been neither convicted nor sentenced, the PCRA offered the State no avenue to relief. The State also claimed that if the sentence and judgment were vacated pursuant to its rule 60(b) motion, the court could also address the State's motion for a misplea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Again, the district court denied the motion, concluding that the State had neither asserted the court had jurisdiction nor directed the court to authority to support the exercise of jurisdiction. Undeterred, the State tried again, filing a motion to reconsider the denial of its motion to reconsider. The State asserted that rule 60(b) provided the court with jurisdiction to consider the issues the State had raised. And the State implored the court to act because \"the Defendant's fraudulent act of obtaining a conviction in the name of another, real person\" had resulted in an \"innocent person now ha[ving] a record of conviction for enhanceable crimes, including a violent felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The third time was not a charm. The district court again declined. Citing its earlier ruling, the court rejected rule 60(b) as a\n   basis for jurisdiction or relief. This time, however, the court refused to address whether the State might obtain relief through a PCRA petition, stating the issue was an \"abstract\" question \"not properly before\" it. The conviction, sentence, and judgment against Bela Fritz were thus left intact even though the State allegedly had reason to believe that Bela Fritz was not the person convicted and sent to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The State then filed a petition for extraordinary relief in this court, invoking Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 65B. The State asks that we direct the district court to \"exercise jurisdiction over the State's motion for relief under rule 60(b).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State also asks that we vacate the conviction, sentence, and judgment against Bela Fritz because of the defendant's alleged fraud. The State asserts that although such relief would usually be left to the district court on remand, \"this is a rare case in which all of the equities favor\" taking that course of action here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 An aggrieved person, or a person whose interests are threatened, may petition this court for relief if a lower court abuses its discretion or exceeds its jurisdiction and \"no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy is available.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 65B(a), (d). Unlike parties pursuing direct appeals, however, a petitioner who demonstrates such error \"has no right to receive a remedy that corrects [the] lower court's mishandling of [the] particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991550\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/127/682/\">\n    2005 UT 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991550\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/127/682/\">\n    127 P.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CIV . P. 65B(d)(4). The issue here concerns whether the district court regularly pursued its authority or abused its discretion in denying the State's motion for relief under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). \"A district court has broad discretion in ruling on a motion to set aside an order or judgment under rule 60(b).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Willey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339665\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/171/\">\n    2016 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339665\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/171/\">\n    391 P.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (cleaned up). Thus, we generally \"review a district court's denial of a 60(b) motion under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339665\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Before us, the district court asserts that a court does not abuse its discretion when it declines to apply a legal principle in a novel fashion. According to the district court, unprecedented applications of legal rules or principles would result in new law, and a court does not abuse its discretion when it refuses to create new law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 This misstates the discretion a district court possesses. Although we sympathize with a district court that finds itself ruling on a novel issue of law with little guidance, a district court's discretion does not extend to refusing to rule because the question presented is one of first impression. District courts are often called upon to play the role of legal frontiersmen and women. Such a role is undoubtedly a challenging one. But it is one district courts are constitutionally required to undertake. Full and fair adjudication of a matter necessitates that district courts wrestle with questions of first impression, identify the governing legal principles, and apply them to the facts of the case. Whether the court's conclusion would be reviewed deferentially or de novo in no way alters its responsibility to undertake that inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 Misapplication of the law constitutes an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The District Court Abused Its Discretion When It Declined to Exercise Jurisdiction over The State's Rule 60(b) Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 The State moved for relief under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3), which provides that \"[o]n motion and upon just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a judgment, order, or proceeding for ... fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct of an opposing party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court concluded that it\n   lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion, and even if it had jurisdiction, the PCRA provided the State's sole remedy for pursuing its challenge. Both of these conclusions present questions of law, and we review them for correctness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 The district court erred in both respects. The State could seek relief under rule 60(b) because neither the PCRA nor any other statute or rule governs this aspect of the criminal proceeding. And rule 60(b) provided the court with jurisdiction to consider the State's motion. This misapplication of the law infected the district court's rulings, and the court thus abused its discretion in denying the State's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    A. The State Properly Moved Under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) to Challenge the Defendant's Conviction, Sentence, and Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Criminal matters are governed primarily by the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure. But those rules are not comprehensive. When looking to fill the gaps between those rules, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure instruct that \"[t]hese rules of [civil] procedure shall also govern in any aspect of criminal proceedings where there is no other applicable statute or rule, provided, that any rule so applied does not conflict with any statutory or constitutional requirement.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 81(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 The question then is whether the State may avail itself of Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) in a criminal proceeding to challenge a conviction, sentence, and judgment allegedly entered against an innocent person because a defendant misrepresented his or her identity. In their responses to the petition, the district court and the defendant assert the State categorically may not. They claim that rule 60(b) applies only to a party who lost its case and that allowing the State to move under rule 60(b) would enable the State to seek otherwise impermissible relief. Additionally, in the proceeding below, the district court concluded that the State could raise its challenge only through the PCRA, not rule 60. We disagree. Relief is not available to the State under the PCRA. And the State may utilize rule 60(b) to bring the challenges it has asserted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Rule 60(b) provides that \"[o]n motion and upon just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a judgment, order, or proceeding\" for several reasons, including \"fraud ..., misrepresentation or other misconduct of an opposing party.\" UTAH R.

As part of that discussion, we noted that rule 60(b) provides a vehicle for relief for unsuccessful parties and emphasized that \"[t]he remedies provided by rule 60(b) should not be understood to be a substitute for appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Kell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982559\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/1133/\">\n    2012 UT 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982559\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/1133/\">\n    285 P.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).

And \"those unusual and exceptional circumstances would have to be circumstances that did not manipulate or circumvent the\" PCRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). We did not consider whether rule 60(b) could be used by a prevailing party, and we were not attempting to set any such limits on the rule's scope or application.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629\n   <em>\n    Kell\n   </em>\n   is nevertheless instructive to the question before us. In\n   <em>\n    Kell\n   </em>\n   , the district court read into rule 60(b) a requirement not present in the rule's text, namely, that a case must be \"pending\" at the time the motion is filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. We rejected that requirement after considering the rule's broader purpose: \"The rule seeks to strike a delicate balance between two countervailing impulses: the desire to preserve the finality of judgments and the incessant command of the court's conscience that justice be done in light of all the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rule 60(b) 's \"whole purpose is to make an exception to finality,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted), when the strong interest in the finality of judgments is outweighed by the paramount importance of preserving our courts as arbiters of just and equitable proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b630 Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Kell\n   </em>\n   , rule 60(b) does not support reading into it an additional, nontextual requirement-that only nonprevailing parties may invoke it. When, for example, the discovery of fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct undermines a court's confidence that a judgment resulted from a just and fair proceeding, the interest in preserving the judgment gives way, regardless of which party discovered the fraud and attempted to undo it. Accordingly, prevailing parties are not categorically barred from filing motions under rule 60(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 The district court and the defendant assert that by allowing the State to seek relief under rule 60(b) in this case, we are \"permit[ting] the State to seek relief from a judgment for other rule 60(b) reasons\" and \"arguably open[ing] the door for the State to challenge an acquittal.\" We are unpersuaded by the argument that if we permit the State to move under rule 60(b), we are opening Pandora's box. Our decision does not upend any existing limits on the State's ability to challenge a final judgment in a criminal case. And it should not be read so broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 By the civil rules' plain language, the State may invoke rule 60(b) to challenge a judgment only if \"there is no other applicable statute or rule, provided, that any rule so applied does not conflict with any statutory or constitutional requirement.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 81(e). We thus address whether any other rule of criminal procedure applies, as well as whether the PCRA precludes the State from moving under rule 60(b), as the district court concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Our rules of criminal procedure contain only one provision authorizing a postsentencing challenge on nonclerical grounds. Rule 22(e) permits a district court to correct a sentence that \"exceeds the statutorily authorized maximums;\" \"is less than statutorily required minimums;\" \"violates Double Jeopardy;\" \"is ambiguous as to the time and manner in which it is to be served;\" \"is internally contradictory;\" or \"omits a condition required by statute or includes a condition prohibited by statute.\" UTAH R. CRIM . P. 22(e). None of these circumstances are present here. And neither rule 22(e) nor any other rule of criminal procedure prohibits other postsentencing challenges to a conviction, sentence, or judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b634 Rule 60(b) may therefore fill that gap in our criminal rules and allow a challenge that falls within the rule's provisions, so long as application of the rule does not conflict with a statutory or constitutional requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R.

Under the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court may arrest judgment prior to entry of a sentence, correct a sentence if it embodies certain defects, stay a sentence pending appeal, and correct clerical mistakes. UTAH R. CRIM . P. 22, 23, 27, 30. Under the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court may correct clerical mistakes or relieve a party from a judgment under certain circumstances. UTAH R. CIV .

District courts may also entertain an independent action for relief from a judgment, order, or proceeding due to fraud on the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   60(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b640 In each of these circumstances, a district court is taking action in a proceeding that has otherwise concluded, when we might expect jurisdiction over the case to have expired. Moreover, from time to time, we alter our rules of procedure, changing the circumstances under which a district court may exercise jurisdiction post judgment or post sentencing. When we do so, and redefine the limits of district courts' jurisdiction based on the language of a particular rule, we are not referring to constitutional limits on judicial authority. We are using the term \"jurisdiction\" to refer to the principles, developed via rule-making procedures or embedded in our case law, through which we regulate the proceedings that take place in our courts. And we grant those rules \"jurisdictional\" status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
