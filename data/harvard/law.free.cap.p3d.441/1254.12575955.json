But the State did not pursue prosecution of that charge for over 38 years. Instead, the State allowed Ross to be extradited to Canada for trial on another murder charge without ensuring that he would be returned for trial in Clallam County. And then while Ross was incarcerated in Canada the State made no meaningful effort for decades to obtain his return to the United States for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 The trial court ruled that the State violated Ross's constitutional right to a speedy trial by not prosecuting the murder charge against him for over 38 years, and the court dismissed that charge. Applying the four-part balancing analysis set out in\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , we also conclude that the extraordinary delay in prosecuting Ross violated his speedy trial right. Accordingly, we are constrained to affirm the trial court's dismissal of the murder charges against Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Arrest, Removal to Canada, and Conviction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 On June 10, 1978, the State charged Ross in Clallam County with aggravated first degree murder, and the court issued a warrant for his arrest. Ross was accused of the April 24, 1978 killing of a woman in Port Angeles. Canadian authorities also had issued a warrant for Ross's arrest for the May 14 murder of a woman in Victoria, British Columbia. Law enforcement in Los Angeles arrested Ross in December 1978 on both warrants as well as on California attempted rape and burglary charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Clallam County prosecuting attorney Craig Ritchie left office on January 8, 1979 and was replaced by Grant Meiner. In a meeting before Meiner took office, Ritchie informed Meiner that \"under no circumstances, should he relinquish the County's jurisdiction over [Ross] and let him go to Canada to stand trial first\" on the Canadian murder charge. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 484-85. Ritchie gave Meiner all the reasons he could think of why Canada would never return Ross and advised Ritchie in strong terms that Clallam County should try Ross first before letting Canada take him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Detective Robert Vail of the Port Angeles police department interviewed Ross in jail in Los Angeles on January 10, 1979. Ross denied ever meeting the murdered woman. Vail did not ask Ross to waive extradition from California to Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The next day, an officer from the Victoria police department interviewed Ross in jail. Ross denied any involvement with the\n   Victoria murder and signed an extradition waiver stating that he would voluntarily agree to return to Canada to face prosecution. At the time of his waiver, Ross was illiterate and unrepresented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 On January 11, Victoria crown counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Richard Anthony called Meiner to inform him that Ross had agreed to waive extradition to Canada. Anthony stated that California authorities would not release Ross to Canada without Clallam County's consent. Meiner memorialized this conversation in a memorandum. The memorandum conveyed that Meiner had spoken with Anthony, who stated that Ross would be \"ejected\" from Canada after his trial there and that Anthony would obtain a waiver of extradition to Clallam County from Ross. CP at 208.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Anthony then telegraphed Meiner to inform him that Ross was deportable from Canada as a fugitive from justice on the Clallam County warrant. The telegraph added that Ross was detainable on a deportation warrant \"if charges in Victoria fail.\" CP at 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Later the same day, Meiner informed California authorities that Clallam County authorized them to release Ross to Canadian authorities. Ross was flown to Victoria the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Meiner later stated that he was \"open to allow the prosecution of Mr. Ross for murder in Victoria to precede the murder prosecution in Clallam County\" because he believed the evidence against Ross in the Victoria case was stronger. CP at 202. Meiner hoped that the evidence of a prior conviction of a very similar murder in Victoria would increase the chances of convicting Ross in Clallam County. Meiner \"concluded that the prosecution in the Port Angeles case would benefit by waiting until after the conclusion of the Victoria trial.\" CP at 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Ross ultimately was convicted of murder by a Canadian court on July 13, 1979. He was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum incarceration of 25 years before he was eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Appointment of Public Defender\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 In May 1979, Clallam County public defender Christopher Shea requested that his office be appointed on an interim basis to represent Ross in the Clallam County case. Shea attempted to obtain discovery from the State and gather other information about the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State refused to provide Shea with discovery because by rule the State was not required to produce discovery until the omnibus hearing, and no omnibus hearing had yet been held because Ross was still in Canada. The trial court declined to require discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Initial Attempts to Return Ross to Washington\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 In June 1979, Meiner wrote to crown counsel Richard Law and stated that Anthony had agreed to deliver Ross to Clallam County immediately after the conclusion of the Victoria trial. Meiner stated his understanding that Ross would be deported regardless of the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 J.W. Anderson, regional crown counsel, replied to Meiner's letter and informed him that Anthony no longer was employed by the Ministry of Attorney-General and that Anthony's apparent assessment of Ross's case \"seems to have been based upon an over-simplification of the situation and its ramifications.\" CP at 219. Anderson further stated that because Ross was convicted and sentenced in Canada, there were no legal means to return him to the United States while his sentence was being served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 Meiner wrote to crown counsel Law again in August, stating that he planned to request extradition of Ross. Meiner acknowledged the crown counsel's position that \"since Ross has been convicted in Canada, he\n   may not be extradited ... until he has served at least one-third of his sentence in Canada,\" but he set out his opinion that extradition treaties allowed for Ross's extradition to the United States. CP at 221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 In October, Meiner spoke on the telephone to Digby Kier, counsel with the Canada Department of Justice, and stated that he wanted to extradite Ross to Clallam County to face a murder charge. Kier responded that Ross was not eligible to be extradited until he had served the 25-year minimum of his sentence. Kier enclosed a decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court holding in a similar case that a prisoner serving a sentence could not be extradited until that sentence was completed. He noted that Ross might be deported to the United States once Canada paroled him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 In February 1980, Meiner wrote to Kier following up on the extradition issue. Kier said that immigration authorities had informed him that after a convicted person was released on parole he would be deported. In contrast, if Clallam County obtained an extradition order, \"he would have to serve the full term of the sentence in Canada\" before being transferred to the United States. CP at 242. Kier concluded, \"I feel that deportation rather than extradition would be the quickest way to have Ross received in your Country.\" CP at 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 Meiner later stated that his thinking was that if he obtained an extradition order, Ross would have to serve the full term of his sentence in Canada before being released to the United States. But he concluded that \"if my office did not seek extradition, Mr. Ross could possibly receive an earlier parole and would then be subject to deportation.\" CP at 205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 In April 1981, Port Angeles's police chief wrote to Meiner to inform him that a recent case holding that Washington's death penalty was unconstitutional seemed to remove one of the obstacles to obtaining Ross's return from Canada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He requested that all efforts be made to extradite Ross to prosecute him for the charged murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Meiner responded that if he obtained an extradition order, Ross would have to serve 25 years in Canada before he could be extradited. But if he did not obtain an extradition order, Ross could be paroled sooner. Meiner concluded that he was \"not presently inclined\" to seek extradition. CP at 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Subsequent Developments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 In May 1987, Ross applied for a transfer to a prison in the United States. Canadian authorities approved the transfer in December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 In response to Ross's apparent desire to return to the United States, the State moved in November 1987 to quash the outstanding warrant for his arrest in Clallam County and the warrant was quashed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Clallam County prosecuting attorney serving at that time was concerned that Ross's \"reappearance here may force a premature decision regarding the prosecution.\" CP at 246. He also stated that \"two material witnesses are not now available - one has disappeared, the other is dead, and the primary investigator from the Port Angeles Police Department is no longer with the police department.\" CP at 247.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 In June 1988, Ross appeared at a hearing in a Canadian prison before a United States magistrate judge regarding his transfer request. The magistrate judge advised Ross that he had charges pending against him in the United States. Ross said that he understood and recognized that he might have to address the charges if he returned to the United States. The judge stated that a van was available to take him to the United States that day. Ross stated that he wished to be transferred to a prison in California, but the judge cautioned that his wish likely would not be accommodated. Ross responded\n   that he might as well stay in Canada because he could not see his family either way. Ross decided not to proceed with the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 In March 1994, Ross wrote to the Port Angeles Police Department, requesting that the department inform him whether he had any outstanding charges in Clallam County. Ross also requested all information relating to the death of the murdered woman. The record does not include the response, if any, Ross received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 In 2002, Sylvie Bordelais, a Canadian lawyer representing Ross, wrote to the Port Angeles Police Department and asked \"whether there is a procedure to have [Ross] brought back to the United States to face the charges related to some outstanding arrest warrants in [Clallam] County.\" CP at 276. The police department referred Bordelais to the Clallam County prosecuting attorney in office at the time, Deborah Kelly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 Bordelais called Kelly sometime in 2003 to say that Ross would like to return to the United States if Kelly would take the death penalty \"off the table.\" CP at 274. Although Kelly was not certain whether the death penalty was a viable option in Ross's case due to recent changes in the law, she told Bordelais that if the death penalty was viable, she would not remove it. Kelly later stated, \"I was not enthusiastic about the idea of bringing back a cold twenty-five year old murder case\" because of recent budget cuts. CP at 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 In 2008, Ross's second application for a transfer to a prison in the United States again was approved. His attorney advised Ross against transferring because it was possible that upon return to the United States, Ross could be incarcerated in federal prison far away from his mother in California and because he would fare better seeking parole in Canada rather than in the United States. Ross ultimately withdrew the transfer request, stating that \"[m]y efforts now are focusing on that of realizing a full parole for deportation to the U.S.\" CP at 284.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b629 Nothing in the record shows that during his incarceration in Canada, Ross ever made a formal request that he be returned to Clallam County to face the first degree murder charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b630 In February 2014, the State moved to quash any existing arrest warrant for Ross on the murder charge because of the age of the case (at that time, 36 years) and the fact that \"witnesses and physical evidence may be difficult to pull together for trial.\" CP at 401. The trial court issued an order quashing the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b631 In 2016, the Canadian parole board scheduled a hearing to consider paroling Ross. Clallam County prosecutors sent a letter to the Canada corrections service with a copy to the parole board recommending against his release and encouraging Ross's continued confinement in Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Clallam County Prosecution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b632 The Canadian parole board released Ross from prison in November 2016 and Canada deported him on November 15. The same day, Ross was taken into custody at the United States border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b633 Ross first appeared in Clallam County Superior Court on November 16, and the trial court found probable cause for Ross's arrest and the filing of the information. The court set bail at $ 1.5 million. Ross's arraignment came approximately 38 and a half years after he was first charged with murder. In April 2017, the State amended Ross's information, charging one count of first degree murder, one count of second degree murder, and one count of first degree felony murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b634 Trial was continued several times on the motions of both parties. The first continuance moved the trial from January 30, 2017 to August 28, 2017 by agreement of the parties because of the extensive evidence in the case. In June, the State moved to continue trial again because it was awaiting the completion of DNA testing on crime scene evidence. The trial court set a new trial date of March 19, 2018. In February 2018, Ross moved to continue the trial, citing the Victoria Police Department's refusal to turn over\n   unredacted police reports, receipt of the recent DNA testing results, and the defense's desire to obtain police reports from the Whatcom County Sheriff related to Ross's arrest at the border. The trial was continued to October 1, 2018. On August 14, the trial was continued a fourth time from October 1 to March 19, 2019 to allow Ross's new second chair defense attorney to become familiar with the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b635 During this time, both parties filed numerous pretrial motions. These included motions to admit or exclude evidence, to request additional findings from CrR 3.5 hearings, perform DNA testing, to appoint experts, to remove restraints, to file an amended information, to dismiss the case based on governmental misconduct under CrR 8.3(b), to evaluate Ross for competency and provide him with psychiatric services, and to compel discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b636 On August 27, 2018, Ross moved to dismiss all charges on speedy trial grounds. The motion was filed over 21 months after Ross was arraigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b637 On October 17, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss in a memorandum opinion. The trial court concluded that the 38-year delay was \"extraordinary,\" and \"long enough to be considered presumptively prejudicial.\" CP at 55-56 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court rejected the State's argument that Ross failed to assert his speedy trial right by signing a waiver of extradition to Canada. The court also determined that the defense was greatly impaired by the passage of time, noting the loss of evidence and faded memories or deaths of witnesses in the intervening years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b638 Finally, the trial court found that the reason for the delay was that no Clallam County prosecuting attorney ever sought Ross's extradition from Canada, but instead hoped that Ross would return voluntarily. The court noted that treaties between the United States and Canada made Ross's extradition possible and concluded that the State did not exercise due diligence to pursue prosecution resulting in a violation of Ross's speedy trial right. The trial court stated, \"The reason for the delay in this case is that Clallam County through its prosecuting attorney chose to defer prosecution of Mr. Ross in favor of first sending him to a foreign country.\" CP at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b639 The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision. The court also signed an order dismissing all charges against Ross with prejudice based on a violation of Ross's speedy trial right. The State appeals the dismissal of Ross's murder charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b640 The State argues that Ross's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated by the 38-year delay in bringing him to trial on the murder charge because the delay was primarily attributable to Ross. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A.

But these arguments relate to the second\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor, the reason for the delay. That factor is discussed below. Regardless of the reason, we cannot ignore that a delay of 38 years is unprecedented in speedy trial cases. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   referred to an eight-year delay as \"extraordinary.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    505 U.S. at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State argues that this factor should weigh in its favor because it was not at fault for Canada's refusal to transfer Ross back to Clallam County and for Ross's lengthy incarceration in Canada. The State claims that the primary reasons for the 38-year delay were Ross's commission of crimes in different jurisdictions, Canada's refusal to return Ross to the United States, and Ross's decision not to transfer to a United States prison. The State also claims that it was not negligent in releasing Ross to Canada and failing to secure his return.

Prosecuting Attorney Allowing Release of Ross to Canada\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b654 Meiner's decision to release Ross to Canada was the root cause of the speedy trial issue. California would not have released Ross to Canada without Clallam County's consent. And California was willing to drop its charges and send Ross to Clallam County for trial on the murder charge. Therefore, but for Meiner's decision, Ross would have been available in Clallam County for a speedy trial. The question here is whether that decision was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b655 Standing alone, Meiner's decision was not necessarily unreasonable. But Meiner's predecessor had cautioned him before taking office not to relinquish custody of Ross to Canada because they would never return him. In a similar situation, one court stated, \"[E]ven if acting under the mistaken belief that defendant's presence could be obtained in [the United States] promptly after the Canadian trial, the [State] still knew or should have known that there was no guarantee that defendant would be brought back to [the United States] in a timely manner.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

But Meiner never obtained a formal agreement to return Ross. Anthony did send a telegram, which Meiner interpreted to mean that Ross would be returned to the United States regardless of the outcome of his trial. But in fact, the telegram stated that Ross could be deported from Canada \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   charges in Victoria fail.\" CP at 210 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b658 Further, Meiner was dealing with the equivalent of a deputy prosecutor who was handling the Victoria murder case. He did not obtain assurances from crown counsel that he had authority to bind the Canadian government or attempt to talk with people in the Canadian government who might have greater authority over extradition matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b659 Second, Meiner failed to confirm that Canadian law even allowed Ross to be returned\n   to the United States after he was convicted and sentenced. After Ross was convicted, Canadian authorities informed Meiner that under a British Columbia Supreme Court decision, Ross could not be returned to the United States until he had served 25 years of his sentence. Meiner should have researched Canadian law before agreeing to release Ross to Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b660 We conclude that Meiner's decision to release Ross to Canada without obtaining an enforceable agreement to return him to Clallam County was negligent and weighs against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   b. State Failing to Request Extradition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b661 Ross argues that the State was negligent in failing to request extradition once Ross was incarcerated in Canada, particularly after the extradition laws changed. The State claims that any request for extradition would have been futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b662 The general rule is that when a defendant is incarcerated outside of the country, the State has a constitutional obligation for speedy trial purposes to make a good faith, diligent effort to secure his or her return to the United States for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

This failure is significant because the extradition\n   treaties between the United States and Canada were amended in 1991 to give the country incarcerating a person the discretion to extradite the person before expiration of his or her sentence. And in 2003 the treaties were amended to allow a person already convicted in one country to be temporarily surrendered to the other country for prosecution and then returned to the first country for the person to serve the remainder of his or her sentence.

But we conclude that the State's failure after 1980 to seek extradition or even inquire about obtaining Ross's transfer to Clallam County weighs against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   c. State's Disinterest in Prosecuting Ross\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b668 The record shows that the State had little interest in prosecuting Ross at all, much less in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b669 As noted above, in 1987 the State asked the court to withdraw Ross's arrest warrant when the State learned that Ross might be transferred to the United States. The record indicates that the State was not prepared to try Ross even eight years after charges were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b670 In 2003, an attorney representing Ross suggested that Ross might be interested in returning to Clallam County for trial if the death penalty was not an option. The Clallam County prosecuting attorney refused to commit to not pursuing the death penalty. She later admitted that she was \"not enthusiastic\" about prosecuting this now 25-year-old case because of recent budget cuts. CP at 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b671 In 2014, Clallam County moved to quash the outstanding warrant for Ross's arrest because of the age of the case (at that time, 36 years) and the fact that \"witnesses and physical evidence may be difficult to pull together for trial.\" CP at 401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b672 Finally, when Ross was being considered for parole in 2016, Clallam County prosecutors sent a letter to the Correctional Service of Canada that was copied to the parole board recommending against his release. The State points out that this opposition to parole did not cause any delay because Canada released Ross anyway. But the State's position suggests that even at this late date it was content to leave Ross in Canada rather than prosecuting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b673 The combination of these actions show that the State did not diligently seek to prosecute Ross. We conclude that this disinterest in prosecuting Ross weighs against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   d. Ross's Commission of Criminal Acts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b674 The State argues that Ross's commission of a criminal act in Canada and his resulting incarceration there contributed to the delay in bringing him to trial in Clallam County. The State is correct; the speedy trial problem would not have arisen if Ross had not committed a crime in Canada. The State quotes from\n   <em>\n    Beavers v. Haubert\n   </em>\n   , where the court noted that when a defendant is charged with more than one crime he might not be able to be tried on all the charges at the same time.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499425\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/77/#p86\">\n    198 U.S. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499425\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/198/77/#p86\">\n    25 S.

Ross Declining Transfer to United States Prison\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b676 The State argues that Ross's 1988 and 2008 decisions not to accept approved transfers\n   to a prison in the United States caused the delay in prosecuting him. Ross responds that his reasons for declining to transfer had nothing to do with the Clallam County murder charge and did not cause the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b677 If Ross had transferred to a United States prison, the State would have been in a better position to bring him to trial in Clallam County because no extradition from Canada would have been necessary. In that sense, Ross's two decisions not to transfer were a cause of at least a portion of the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b678 However, three considerations lessen the impact of Ross's conduct. First, Ross's decision not to return to the United States was not a response to any Clallam County attempt to seek his return. The transfer requests were initiated by Ross for personal reasons. In 1988, his goal was to obtain a transfer to a California prison, but he was told that such a transfer was unlikely. And in 2008 he again wanted to be closer to his family in California, but counsel told him that a transfer to a United States prison could affect his ability to obtain parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b679 Second, when Ross first requested a transfer in 1987, the State demonstrated that it was not interested in bringing Ross to trial at that time even if he was transferred to the United States. The State moved to quash the outstanding warrant for his arrest in Clallam County because the prosecutor was concerned that Ross's transfer might force a premature prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b680 Third, when Ross decided in 2008 not to transfer, 29 years already had passed since the murder charge was filed. Even if Ross had transferred at that time, the same speedy trial issues would have been present. Further, when the State had last addressed the issue in 2003, the prosecuting attorney was not enthusiastic about prosecuting the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b681 We conclude that regarding the reason for delay factor, Ross's decision not to transfer to the United States only slightly weighs against Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   f. Delay Following Ross's Return\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b682 The State argues that Ross's multiple unsuccessful motions to dismiss or suppress evidence and acquiescence in multiple continuances caused almost two years of additional delay once Ross was returned to Clallam County to face the murder charge. The State claims that this delay should be attributed to Ross and should weigh against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b683 Here, a period of 21 months elapsed between Ross's arraignment in Clallam County and his motion to dismiss based on the speedy trial right. A number factors contributed to the delays in Ross's case at this stage. Of the four continuances the trial court granted, the State requested or joined at least two for the sake of being better prepared for trial. Both parties filed extensive motions. Although Ross filed multiple motions to suppress or dismiss, the State also filed numerous motions to admit and exclude evidence, to compel discovery, to permit consumptive DNA testing, to perpetuate testimony, to file an amended information, and to continue trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b684 Ross arguably could have done more to bring the case to trial sooner. But by that time, 40 years already had passed. And given the case's nearly 40-year history and the multiple pretrial issues, a delay of 21 months was not excessive. The parties and the trial court required this time to sort through the extensive amount of evidence in the case, file and oppose motions, and otherwise prepare for trial. We conclude that the 21-month delay in bringing the case to trial does not weigh against Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   g. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b685 The State's arguments that Ross was the most significant cause of the delay are not persuasive. Ross's conduct did contribute to some extent to the delay. But the primary cause of the delay was the State's decision to release Ross to Canada without obtaining a formal, enforceable agreement to return him and the State's failure to determine whether Canadian law even allowed a transfer after a\n   conviction and sentence. And the State failed to request extradition or even inquire about the possibility of transferring Ross to the United States for 36 years after Meiner's unsuccessful efforts, even when changes in the applicable treaties made the possibility of a successful extradition more probable. Accordingly, we conclude that the reason for delay factor weighs against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   4. Assertion of Speedy Trial Right\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b686 The third\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor is the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right.\n   <em>\n    Ollivier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4298405\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/178/813/#p826\">\n    178 Wash.2d at 827, 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20P.3d%201\">\n    312 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argues that this factor should weigh against Ross because he never asserted his speedy trial right until 2018 and decided to remain in Canada rather than accept transfer to the United States and face trial in Clallam County. We agree that this factor weighs against Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b687 \"Although a defendant has no obligation to bring himself to trial, he does bear some responsibility in asserting his right.\"\n   <em>\n    Sterling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461842\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/23/171/#p173\">\n    23 Wash.

If the defendant is aware that charges are pending against him and he fails to make any effort to secure a timely trial on said charges, this factor will be weighed against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tchibassa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455695\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us-app-dc/371/542/#p550\">\n    371 U.S. App. D.C. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046864,3455695\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/918/\">\n    452 F.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (stating that a defendant's \"failure to make any effort to secure a timely trial\" when he knows that charges are pending against him \"manifests a total disregard for his speedy trial right\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   a. Arrest and Transfer to Canada\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b688 Ross did not demand to be returned to Clallam County for trial after his arrest in Los Angeles and instead waived extradition to Canada to stand trial for his crime. The trial court focused exclusively on this fact in evaluating the assertion of right factor and concluded that Ross's conduct at this time did not waive his speedy trial right. But on appeal the State does not rely on Ross's conduct in California in discussing this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b689 At the time Port Angeles and Victoria police officers came to speak with Ross in the Los Angeles jail, he was illiterate and not represented by counsel. And he apparently was given only the option to waive extradition to Canada; extradition to Clallam County was not discussed. Under these circumstances, Ross's failure to request a trial in Clallam County before being transferred to Canada does not weigh against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   b. Ross's Conduct During Incarceration in Canada\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b690 Nothing in the record shows that during his incarceration in Canada, Ross ever made a formal request that he be returned to Clallam County to face the first degree murder charge. And there is no question that Ross was aware of the murder charge pending against him because he made several inquiries about the charge during his incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b691 The State argues that the record demonstrates that Ross did not want a speedy trial. The State emphasizes that Ross had two opportunities to return to the United States and face trial in Clallam County and declined. Before deciding to remain in Canada in 1988, Ross acknowledged that he likely would have to address his pending charges if he returned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that Ross was content to stay in Canada without addressing the murder charges and claims that Ross's lack of desire to face a trial in Clallam County should be fatal to his speedy trial claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b692 Ross argues that he never had an opportunity while incarcerated to formally\n   assert his speedy trial claim. He emphasizes that although he had attorneys that assisted him on some matters, he never consulted with an attorney who was appointed to represent him on the Clallam County charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Ross never appeared in court until 2016 and therefore could not have asserted his claim in court until then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b693 The fact that Ross was unrepresented on the murder charge and never appeared in court during the 38-year delay distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ollivier\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Iniguez\n   </em>\n   . In those cases, the delays occurred while the defendants were represented and had the opportunity to make multiple court appearances. Ross's inability to consult with counsel about his speedy trial right and the lack of an opportunity to raise the issue in court does mitigate to some extent his failure to assert the right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b694 However, we cannot ignore the fact that during the time he was incarcerated in Canada, Ross made no effort to facilitate a trial on the murder charge. He never demanded that the State bring him to trial or that the State figure out a way to remove him to the United States. He did not waive extradition or request that Canada transfer him to Clallam County for trial. And when given opportunities to return to the United States and face the murder charge, Ross declined and decided to remain in Canada. This conduct is inconsistent with an assertion of the right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b695 Based on Ross's failure to assert his speedy trial right while incarcerated in Canada, we conclude that the assertion of the right factor weighs against Ross even though his failure is mitigated to some extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   c. Litigation After 2016\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b696 The State notes that even after Ross returned to Clallam County, he waited to assert his speedy trial claim for almost two years. The State claims that this is further evidence that Ross did not want a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b697 Ross responds that he was unable to assert his speedy trial right for over 21 months because when he finally secured an attorney on the Clallam County charges, his attorney needed time to become familiar with the 38-year history of the case and investigate the cause of the extraordinary delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b698 Ross could have asserted his speedy trial right sooner than August 2018. But his attorney certainly needed some time to familiarize himself with the speedy trial evidence and issues while at the same time investigating and defending against the murder charges.

In addition, the 38-year length of the delay is significant, as is the very strong presumption of prejudice resulting from that lengthy delay. These three factors outweigh Ross's failure to assert his speedy trial right, which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that he was unrepresented and had no opportunity to assert his right in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6112 Considering all the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors, we are constrained to conclude that the balancing test weighs against the State.
