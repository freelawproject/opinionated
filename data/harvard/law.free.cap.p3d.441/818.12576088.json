We must decide if that protection applies here, where the insured has gained the status of insured by statute, rather than by contract. We hold it does. We affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On October 30, 2013, Consuelo Prieto Mariscal was driving her minivan in Pasco, Washington, with her daughter. There were vehicles, including an orange pickup truck and a van, on the right side of the road. As Prieto passed the orange pickup truck, she heard a noise, felt her van jump a little, and saw a boy, Brayan, lying on the ground. Realizing Brayan was seriously hurt, her daughter called 911. Brayan was taken to a nearby hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 A police officer spoke with Prieto and her daughter but not Brayan or his mother, Monica Diaz Barriga Figueroa. Prieto and her daughter both told the officer they did not see how the accident happened. Although there were no other eyewitnesses, and although the officer spoke only with Prieto and her daughter, he wrote in the police report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   On 10/30/13 at 1456 VI was traveling S/N 400 block of North Cedar when an 8 YOA age child on a bicycle rode into the roadway and directly in front of VI. There were two parked vehicles on the shou[ld]er of the roadway that created a blind spot for the driver of V1. When the bicyclist pulled into the roadway the rider was struck on the left side and fell to the ground. The passenger side front tire then drove over the child['s] right front leg. The child was [transported to] an area hosp[it]al via ambulance for treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Clerk's Papers at 305. Brayan gave a number of statements about the accident. Brayan's most detailed version of the accident is that his right shoelace got stuck in the spokes of his bike and his right leg was run over when he leaned over to untangle the shoelace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Three weeks after the accident, Diaz went to a local law firm to seek help. Diaz was asked to sign a blank personal injury protection (PIP) application form, so she did. Diaz is a monolingual Spanish speaker, and the legal assistant who met with her is a monolingual English speaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This presigned PIP form was filled out later by the legal assistant based on the police report. Section five of the form asked for a brief description of the accident. Mirroring the police report, the legal assistant wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   Vehicle was traveling on North Cedar when child on a bike rode into road. There were 2 parked cars on the road creating a blind[ ] spot for the driver. Child was struck &amp; had right leg ran over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Def.'s Ex. 101, at 1. In addition to seeking PIP coverage, Diaz also sued Prieto on behalf of Brayan. The significant difference between the PIP form and Brayan's testimony became a central issue at trial. Prieto's counsel stressed the differences between Diaz's and Brayan's testimony and the PIP form; Diaz's counsel stressed that the PIP form was based on accounts from people who did not see the accident.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 5 During opening statements, Prieto's counsel referenced the PIP form over Diaz's counsel's objection. After opening, out of the presence of the jury, Diaz's counsel addressed Prieto's counsel's use of the PIP form in opening and moved to exclude any further reference to it:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    Your Honor, in anticipation of today's trial, in defendant's opening he brought up some piece of evidence that I think he might try to bring up again.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    One was a Personal Injury Protection application. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    It's a first-party application and privilege is not waived when you submit something to first-party insurance. And, in fact, first-party insurance is not supposed to share the PIP file with defense without permission of plaintiff.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    In this case, he somehow got a copy of the PIP application. This raises a number of concerns. The PIP application is a\n    no-fault insurance application, meaning that the description of the accident has no bearing on whether or not you get benefits in a PIP application.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    He wants to use this PIP application as a statement against interest of [Diaz]. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    ... [Because this is a privileged document,] even though he already referenced it in his opening, and I objected to it then, I would move to exclude any further reference to this Personal Injury Protection application.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    1 Report of Proceedings (RP) (June 2, 2016) at 119-21. Prieto's counsel responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    First of all, this document is not privileged. ... This is an application form for Personal Injury Protection benefits for Brayan's treatment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    There is no law that the PIP application is not to be shared with defense counsel. Plaintiff has not cited to you any authority. That's important to keep in mind.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    The PIP insurance coverage is, in essence, a no fault benefit provided on the insurance policy insuring Ms. Prieto. Okay?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    So it's her insurance company that's providing this benefit of medical coverage to Brayan. There is no law that certainly the plaintiff has cited that prevents that information to be shared with me or Ms. Prieto's insurance company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 121-22. The court then took a voir dire examination of Diaz to establish her knowledge of the PIP form and who filled it out.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 6 After voir dire, and after argument by counsel for both sides, the court concluded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    Well, it's sort of odd this particular statement ... we have a statement signed by a party and yet, so arguably, it's a statement by the party versus the agent speaking on her behalf, which what we have here is this statement on its face doesn't show that it was the agent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    Now, we have testimony that does show that it was an agent who spoke essentially or had the party's authority to write it, because she essentially signed it and handed it over.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    So the Court is going to find, first, that it's not a privileged document. That in redacted form, it doesn't violate the motion in limine as to collateral source. I do find it's an admission against interest under the rule as cited.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    It will be allowed and that's my ruling.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 134-35. A redacted version of the PIP application was admitted into evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Ex. 101. Prieto's counsel then used the application to cross-examine Diaz:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    Q. And three weeks after [speaking with Brayan about the accident at the hospital], you signed what's been admitted as Exhibit 101, with a description of the accident. Correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    A. I signed it when it was blank.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Q. Okay. And the description reads, \"Vehicle was traveling on North Cedar when child on bike rode into road. There were two parked cars on the road, creating a blind spot for the driver. Child was struck and had right leg ran over.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    Correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    A. I didn't know - I didn't know about that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    Q. But that's what the description states. Correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    A. Yes. But I guess they got that from the police report because if I would have known that they were going to write that on it, I would not have signed it because I'm not in agreement with that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    2 RP (June 3, 2016) at 298-99. Prieto's counsel also used the application to cross-examine Diaz's accident reconstructionist, to support Prieto's reconstructionist's expert opinion, and, in closing argument, to question Diaz's credibility. Use of the PIP form was extensive, and the PIP form was the primary exhibit in the case because the police report\n    was excluded as substantive evidence at trial as hearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 7 The jury returned a defense verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the PIP application was work\n    product and its admission was prejudicial, requiring a new trial.\n    <em>\n     Barriga Figueroa v.

Prieto argues, \"\n    <em>\n     Before\n    </em>\n    the PIP application was admitted, the expert testified as to Brayan's 'explanation of how he rode that day, prior to being hit.' Therefore, the record at trial contains undisputed evidence that Brayan himself told his expert he rode into the street prior to being hit.\" Suppl. Br. of Pet'r at 19 (quoting 1 RP (June 2, 2016) at 167). We are not persuaded by this characterization of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    \u00b6 20 Prieto is correct that the expert stated Brayan rode\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    the street \"prior to being hit,\" i.e.,\n    <em>\n     earlier that day,\n    </em>\n    but that is not at issue. 1 RP (June 2, 2016) at 167. At issue is what happened\n    <em>\n     immediately before\n    </em>\n    Brayan was hit. Regarding that issue, the PIP form says \"child on a bike\n    <em>\n     rode into road\n    </em>\n    \" and due to a blind spot \"was struck,\" which Prieto used to attack Diaz's version of the events. Def.'s Ex. 101, at 1 (emphasis added). Diaz said\n    <em>\n     immediately before being hit\n    </em>\n    Brayan was not riding, he was leaned over untangling his shoelace. The PIP form was not cumulative as Diaz's evidence strikingly differed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b6 21 Admission of the PIP form prejudiced Diaz.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    It was used extensively by Prieto's counsel throughout trial. It was used in opening; it was used to cross-examine Diaz and Diaz's accident reconstructionist; it was used to form opinions of the accident by an accident reconstructionist retained on behalf of Prieto; and it was used in closing argument to question Diaz's credibility. Further, when\n    Prieto's counsel used the PIP form, he almost always emphasized\n    the fact that it was signed by Diaz, thereby attributing the statements to her. Diaz did not make these statements; the legal assistant filled out the PIP form based on the police report. Crucially, the speculative statements in the police report were hearsay and the police report was inadmissible at trial for this reason.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b6 22 Prieto's counsel repeatedly claimed throughout trial that Brayan was hit after he rode his bicycle between two parked cars and into the road. Prieto asserts Diaz's accident reconstructionist's testimony supports this claim but, as discussed above, it does not-the PIP form served as the basis for the claim, and the PIP form was therefore not cumulative. The trial court erroneously admitted the PIP form, and its admission prejudiced Diaz.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \u00b6 23 The PIP form was work product in light of the specific parties and their expectations, and its admission prejudiced Diaz.

In other words, courts should avoid applying work product protections except where necessary \"to ensure just and fair resolutions of disputes.\"\n    <em>\n     Heidebrink,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1201346\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/104/392/#p396\">\n     104 Wash.2d at 400\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20P.2d%20212\">\n     706 P.2d 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \u00b6 26 The majority recognizes that\n    <em>\n     Heidebrink\n    </em>\n    is the controlling case here and purports to engage in an analysis of\n    these parties and their expectations. However, despite a record that is devoid of any indication the plaintiff, Monica Diaz Barriga Figueroa,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    anticipated litigation, the majority determines work product protection should apply to her PIP application form. What is in the record regarding the application is: (a) it was for no-fault insurance, which here requires no assertion of liability and is, therefore, nonadversarial, (b) Diaz signed it while it was blank, (c) it was completed and submitted before a complaint had been filed against the alleged at-fault driver, Prieto, and (d) a law office helped complete it, including filling in the accident description, using the description from the police report. What is not in the record is any indication that Diaz or her attorney felt this document might be utilized in a lawsuit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \u00b6 27 The majority asserts that \"it cannot be seriously contended\" that Diaz \"sought legal assistance merely to have help filling out forms\" and then concludes that she signed the PIP application in anticipation of litigation. Majority at 824. But there is nothing in the record to support such a finding; it is pure speculation by the majority. The majority also relies on the \"dual relationship\" between Diaz and the insurer, arguing that \"[a]s a tort plaintiff against the named insured, Diaz and Brayan's relationship with the insurer is adversarial.\" Majority at 823. This argument ignores that we should be focusing on the expectations of the parties\n    <em>\n     at the time the PIP application was prepared.\n    </em>\n    At that time, no lawsuit had been filed; therefore, the majority's assertion that Diaz was an adversarial tort plaintiff is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \u00b6 28 As we indicated in\n    <em>\n     Harris,\n    </em>\n    the relationship between an insured and an insurer is complicated. This relationship \"is sometimes adversarial, while at other times the interests of the insured and insurer are aligned,\" thus, the need for \"close examination.\"\n    <em>\n     Harris,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217436\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/152/480/#p490\">\n     152 Wash.2d at 489\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20P.3d%20872\">\n     99 P.3d 872\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Such an examination here reveals no indication of an adversarial\n    relationship between Diaz and the insurer at the time she completed the application form. Only two conditions must exist to qualify for PIP benefits: (1) that a person meets the definition of an \"insured\" and (2) that a motor vehicle accident occurred that caused the person injury. Because fault plays no factor in coverage, PIP claims are, by nature, nonadversarial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    \u00b6 29 The record simply does not indicate that Diaz anticipated litigation when she signed the PIP application; it indicates only that she employed an attorney who assisted her with filing a PIP claim. By extending work product protections to this application, the majority seemingly, but without expressly stating so, abandons our fact-specific analysis in favor of broad protection for any materials prepared in the insurance context. If we properly apply what our prior cases established and recognize the underlying policy of CR 26(b)(4) favoring broad discovery, work product protections do not apply here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \u00b6 30 But even if we were inclined to find that work product protection extended to the PIP application form and it was error to use it at trial, error without prejudice is not grounds for reversing the jury verdict.\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

In doing so, the majority ignores the record, failing to acknowledge that the PIP application form was not important to the issue before the jury, was not the only evidence in front of the jury, and was not the only means by which defense counsel impeached Diaz and Stadler.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \u00b6 31 During cross-examination of Diaz, defense counsel sought to impeach her testimony on multiple points and overwhelmingly did so using statements other than those in the PIP application.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    2 Report of Proceedings (RP) (June 2, 2016) at 283-86 (using Diaz's earlier deposition testimony to impeach her inconsistent testimony regarding how Brayan was positioned when she arrived at the scene); 2 RP (June 3, 2016) at 299-303 (using the initial complaint to impeach Diaz's description of Brayan's conduct leading up to the accident), 304 (using Diaz's deposition testimony to impeach her description of Brayan's conduct leading up to the accident). As to the majority's assertion that the application was used by defense counsel to impeach Stadler, this is entirely unsupported by the record. The application was first brought up during redirect by plaintiff's counsel, and defense counsel questioned him on recross as to whether the description on the application was consistent with the idea that Brayan had been in a blind spot and with the description given in the police report. However, while this form was not used to impeach Stadler, defense counsel did impeach him through other means.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    1 RP (June 2, 2016) at 165-69 (impeaching Stadler using a diagram he drew that was consistent with the defense counsel's theory of the accident), 169-71 (using Stadler's deposition testimony to impeach his assertion that he had not considered the defense's theory of the accident), 171-72 (using Stadler's deposition testimony to impeach him after he avoided answering whether the defense's theory could result in Brayan's injuries).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    \u00b6 32 Significantly, defense counsel illustrated the differing accounts of how the accident occurred using deposition\n    testimony from both Diaz and Stadler, as well as the initial complaint. The majority mischaracterizes the entirety of the trial records by asserting that only the PIP application supported the defense's theory of how the accident occurred. Majority at 824-25. The PIP application was arguably cumulative both as a means of impeachment and as a means of establishing the defense's theory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \u00b6 33 It is highly unlikely the jury considered the PIP application form convincing as substantive evidence. At trial, when defense counsel sought to impeach Diaz with the application, she countered by testifying that she signed the application when it was blank and would not have done so if she had known her attorney would use the description from the police report. During recross, Stadler described the accident description in the application and the police report as inconsistent with the physical evidence. Finally, during rebuttal, an employee of Diaz's attorney testified and explained that he, not Diaz, had inserted the description of the accident. Despite all of the evidence and testimony, the majority never explains, and cannot explain, how the de minimis use of the prior inconsistent statement in the PIP application form, made by a nonwitness to the accident, could have possibly had a material effect on the jury's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \u00b6 34 The Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-98\">\n     For the sake of consistency, we follow the majority's lead in referring to the respondent as Diaz and the petitioner driver, Consuelo Prieto Mariscal, as Prieto.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-99\">\n     The majority cites\n     <em>\n      Driggs v.
