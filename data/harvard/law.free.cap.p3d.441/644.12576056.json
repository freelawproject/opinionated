He raises 13 assignments of error. We reject the first assignment of error without discussion. In his second through fourth assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that there were multiple victims of defendant's crimes and, as a result, imposing consecutive sentences. In his remaining assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to merge the 10 guilty verdicts into a single conviction.

Each of the 10 counts tracked the language of ORS 163.684.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counts two through 10 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"The defendant, on or about June 11, 2015, in Lane County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly possess a record in visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, separate and distinct from all others alleged in this Information, with the intent to disseminate the record in visual recording while knowing or being aware of and consciously disregarding the fact that creation of the visual recording of sexually explicitly conduct involved child abuse[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Count one differed only in that it did not include the phrase \"separate and distinct from all others alleged in this Information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant did not demur to, or otherwise challenge, the information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 135.630 (providing for demurrer to charging instrument). He did not move the court either to require the state to elect specific visual recordings to support each count or to otherwise provide more specific information. He waived his right to a preliminary hearing and indictment by grand jury and pleaded guilty to all 10 counts. Defendant's plea petition stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Defendant knows and understands that this will be an open sentencing where his attorney and the State are both free to argue with no upfront agreement as to the sentence that should be imposed. Defendant knows and understands that he is an 8-D on at least the first Count, and that he may be subject to consecutive counts and potentially different and higher sentencing grid blocks * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both parties filed sentencing memorandums. Attached to the state's supplemental sentencing memorandum was an affidavit from the investigating detective asserting that defendant possessed \"5000 videos and 5000 images of pornography, the majority of which was child pornography.\" The affidavit described 10 specific videos that defendant possessed on June 11, 2015, corresponding to the 10 counts in the information. The affidavit asserted that each of the 10 videos depicted a different child victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant moved to strike the affidavit on the ground that its admission would, in effect, improperly amend the charges of the information after his guilty plea by referring to 10 separate victims instead of what defendant described as the single \"generic victim\" in the charging instrument. Defendant also argued that the trial court was required to merge each of the 10 guilty verdicts into a single conviction under ORS 161.067 or, alternatively, that concurrent sentences were required. The trial court denied defendant's motions, found that each of the 10 convictions involved a different victim, and sentenced defendant consecutively for each conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 137.123(5)(b) (authorizing\n   consecutive sentences where there are multiple victims). On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in both respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We address the merger issue first. ORS 161.067 sets out the circumstances in which trial courts must enter separate convictions for multiple offenses arising out of the same conduct or criminal episode. The state contends that ORS 161.067(2) operates to prohibit merger here because defendant pleaded guilty to criminal conduct against 10 different victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 161.067(2) (\"When the same conduct or criminal episode, though violating only one statutory provision involves two or more victims, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are victims.\"). Defendant argues that that provision does not apply and that the trial court was therefore required to merge defendant's 10 guilty verdicts into a single conviction because the charging instrument did not specify that there were multiple victims and defendant consequently pleaded guilty to committing crimes against just one \"generic victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's argument fails. The district attorney's information broadly alleges that defendant possessed 10 \"visual recording[s] of sexually explicit conduct involving\n   <em>\n    a child\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) and does not specify whether each recording depicts the same child or different children.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake Oswego Preservation Society v.

We have held that, where a defendant pleads guilty or no contest to committing crimes \"on or between\" a range of dates as alleged in the charging\n   instrument, the state can prove that the defendant committed the offenses on any of the dates alleged because the defendant, \"by failing to limit or qualify his pleas, * * * assent[s] to the broadest construction of his pleas.\"\n   <em>\n    Hibbard v.

Consequently, the trial court could enter 10 separate convictions under ORS 161.067(2). We reject defendant's fifth through thirteenth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We turn to defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the detective's affidavit, in finding that there were multiple victims (a finding for which the affidavit was the only supporting evidence), and in imposing consecutive sentences. As to the motion to strike, defendant's central argument, as we understand it, is that the affidavit-which identifies at least 10 different victims to defendant's crimes-relies on a different \"factual basis\" than the information-which purportedly identifies only a single \"generic victim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to defendant, the trial court should not have relied on the affidavit to impose consecutive sentences because the inconsistent \"factual bases\" on which defendant's sentence is based retroactively compromises the constitutional notice, double jeopardy, and judicial review functions of the charging instrument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted, the information can reasonably be read to allege that there were 10 different victims of defendant's crimes. Therefore, defendant's assertion that the affidavit rests on a different \"factual basis\" than the information is incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to the remaining assignments of error, the sentencing court could rely on the detective's affidavit to find that the counts involved separate victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 137.090(1)(c) (in determining aggravation or mitigation at sentencing, \"the court shall consider * * * [a]ny other evidence relevant to aggravation or mitigation that the court finds trustworthy and reliable.\"); OEC 101(4)(d) (the rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing proceedings, except in aggravated murder or death penalty proceedings);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, defendant acknowledged in his plea petition that he understood that the court could sentence him to consecutive sentences.
