These two ballot propositions aimed to require any land use proposal in the City of Tacoma requesting a daily consumption of at least one million gallons of water be submitted to a public vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The defendants filed a declaratory judgment action against the STW ballot propositions, seeking a judicial directive preventing the STW ballot propositions from being placed on the local ballot. The defendants\n   argued that the STW ballot propositions were beyond the scope of the City's initiative power. Prior to filing the petition, the Port's commissioners, at a public meeting, voted to ratify the Port's decision to file a declaratory judgment action. Ultimately, the declaratory judgment action successfully blocked the provisions from being placed on the ballot.\n   <em>\n    Port of Tacoma v. Save Tacoma Water\n   </em>\n   , 4 Wash.

At the request of the attorney general, the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) staff reviewed the complaint against the defendants. PDC staff concluded that the EDB and the Chamber made independent expenditures as defined in RCW 42.17A.255. PDC staff also concluded that the Port did not violate RCW 42.17A.555. The PDC returned the matter to the attorney general with \"no recommendation for legal action.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 451. The PDC mentioned the need for additional rulemaking to provide greater clarity regarding these provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Despite the PDC making no recommendation, the State, through the attorney general, filed this action against the defendants, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief under the FCPA, chapter 42.17A RCW. The State alleged that the defendants failed to properly report independent expenditures made in opposition to the STW ballot propositions in violation of RCW 42.17A.255. Additionally, the State alleged that the Port, through its chief executive officer and its commissioners, impermissibly used public facilities to oppose the STW ballot propositions in violation of RCW 42.17A.555.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The defendants filed summary judgment motions to dismiss.

The Port argues that because it is often involved in litigation, this litigation contesting the STW ballot propositions was within its normal and regular conduct. The Port supports its broad interpretation of the exception by listing a number of initiative challenge cases with municipalities as parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b649 However, the \"normal and regular conduct\" exception is not so broad as to encompass any type of a party's litigation simply because that party has been involved in litigation in the past. In\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   , the court did not consider whether teachers generally e-mailed each other, but instead considered whether school e-mail was regularly used in the distribution of political materials.\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5586583\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/136/249/#p256\">\n    136 Wash.

Here, then, our focus is not whether the Port has generally engaged in litigation. Rather, we consider whether the Port through its \"normal and regular conduct\" litigates the scope of the initiative power for ballot propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b650 The Port is authorized by statute to manage the port, its lands, and its employees, and to engage in economic endeavors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 53.08.047 ; RCW 53.57.030 ;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   chapter 53.08 RCW. However, the Port does not point to any statute separately authorizing it to oppose ballot propositions as required by WAC 390-05-273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b651 The Port also cites to cases where municipalities have challenged the scope of ballot propositions or sought a declaratory judgment to determine the legality of some governmental action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those cases are distinguishable. None of those cases involved an interpretation of RCW 42.17A.555. Instead, they were concerned with justiciability of the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b652 We can find no evidence that the Port's opposition to the STW ballot propositions was either usual or specifically authorized in an appropriate enactment. Accordingly, we hold that the Port was not acting within the \"normal and regular conduct\" exception to RCW 42.17A.555 when it opposed the STW ballot propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Action Taken at an Open Public Meeting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b653 The Port also argues that its litigation expenditures were proper action according to a vote taken at an open public meeting. We disagree with the Port's interpretation of the statutory exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b654 RCW 42.17A.555(1) lists an exception to using public funds to oppose a ballot proposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Action taken at an open public meeting by members of ... port districts ... to express a collective decision, or to actually vote ... to support or oppose a ballot proposition so long as (a) any required notice of the meeting includes the title and number of the ballot proposition, and (b) members ... or commission of the special purpose district, or members of the public are afforded an approximately equal opportunity for the expression of an opposing view.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b655 The Port argues that because it took a vote to \" 'ratify the Port's action of filing a Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive challenge of ... Charter Amendment 5 and Code Initiative 6,' \" the actual filing and prosecution of the declaratory judgment action fell within the statutory exception. Br. of Resp't (Port) at 23-24 (quoting CP at 269). But by the statute's plain language, this exception permits Port commissioners to vote to oppose a ballot proposition at a public meeting, assuming the notice and opportunity to be heard requirements are met. This provision authorizes the use of public facilities to \"express a collective decision\" or to \"actually vote\" on an expression of support or opposition to a ballot proposition. The exception does not go so far as to authorize the Port to bring litigation in furtherance of its opposition to a ballot proposition. Accordingly, we hold that this exception did not permit the Port to expend public funds to oppose the STW ballot propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Port's Remaining Arguments Are Unpersuasive\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b656 Finally, the Port argues that the State impermissibly ignored the PDC's recommendation,\n   that the Port was protecting the integrity of our elections by keeping an invalid initiative off the ballot, and that different rules govern local and state initiatives. We hold that none of these arguments have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b657 First, when the attorney general brought this enforcement action in 2016, the PDC's recommendation was not binding on the State. Former RCW 41.17A.765(1) (2010). The State, through the attorney general, had independent authority to bring this enforcement action. Former RCW 42.17A.765(1). Second, the Port is not charged with protecting the integrity of elections. The Port's duties are explained in chapter 53.08 RCW and do not include an electoral gatekeeping function. Third, although state and local initiative processes may vary in certain circumstances, the Port fails to address how that difference is dispositive here. Neither RCW 42.17A.255 nor RCW 42.17A.555 address differing standards for independent expenditures or public facilities for local as opposed to state initiatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b658 The Port's lawsuit in opposition to the STW ballot propositions was neither \"normal and regular conduct\" of the Port, nor merely a vote to express collective disapproval of the ballot propositions. As a result, the trial court erred by summarily dismissing the State's complaint regarding the Port's use of public funds to oppose the ballot propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   ATTORNEY FEES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b659 The State requests attorney fees and costs on appeal under former RCW 42.17A.765(5). Although the State is entitled to costs subject to filing a cost bill, RAP 14.4, we do not rule on the State's request for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b660 A party may recover attorney fees only when authorized by private contract, statute, or equity.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
