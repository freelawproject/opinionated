R. Evid., evidence of his juvenile delinquency adjudication for child molestation. The state contends that the evidence was properly admitted. The sole issue on appeal is whether the court erred because Rule 404(c) does not permit the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts committed by a juvenile as evidence of a character trait giving rise to an aberrant sexual propensity to commit a criminal sexual offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 We view the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the trial court's rulings and jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rose was indicted on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the age of fifteen, a class two felony and dangerous\n   crime against children in the first degree. Between December 2015 and August 2017, when Rose was thirty-six to thirty-eight years old, he engaged in the charged acts with the son of his then-girlfriend. The boy was between the ages of three and five at the time of the crimes. At trial, the state sought to introduce evidence under Rule 404(c) of Rose's prior juvenile delinquency adjudication for child molestation as evidence of Rose's aberrant sexual propensity to commit the acts charged in this case. In that matter, Rose, then fourteen, was found to have molested a five- to six-year-old boy in a similar manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Rose opposed the admission of the evidence arguing that expert witness testimony was necessary to demonstrate that he had a \"continuing emotional propensity\" to commit the crime, that the acts were dissimilar to the current charged offenses and remote in time, and that their admission would be unduly prejudicial. The trial court found the 1994 adjudication admissible under Rule 404(c). At the conclusion of the three-day trial, Rose was convicted on both counts, and the jury found the aggravating factor that the victim was age twelve or under at the time of each crime. Rose was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, and he timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Rose did not assert below the ground he now asserts on appeal-that his 1994 adjudication was inadmissible by virtue of its being a juvenile adjudication. Consequently, he did not preserve the issue for harmless error review. As he must, he argues that the trial court's error in admitting this other-acts evidence was fundamental and prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R. Evid. (\"unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence\"). Ariz. R. Evid. 404(c). On its face, Rule 404(c) makes no distinction between\n   the admission of evidence of another crime, wrong, or act the defendant committed as a juvenile and one he committed as an adult.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1357282\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/209/40/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, Rose would have this court add to the rule, by judicial fiat, an additional restriction on the admission of such other-acts evidence, namely, that no evidence of an act committed when the defendant was a juvenile may be admitted under Rule 404(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Rose argues that any admission of other-acts evidence otherwise allowable under the plain reading of Rule 404(c) is impermissible and reversible fundamental error because \"juvenile offenders are far different from adult offenders,\" and, as shown by other rules of evidence, juvenile adjudications must be treated differently from adult convictions. Rose also argues that the admission of such evidence under Rule 404(c) violates a criminal defendant's Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, and his rights under article 2, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 24 of the Arizona Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argues principally that Rose has failed to show fundamental error-including prejudice-because under its plain language, Rule 404(c) does not prohibit the use of juvenile crimes as other-acts evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Initially, Rose argues that Rules 608 and 609, Ariz. R. Evid., are \"instructive\" on this question. Those rules, read together, do not permit the admission of evidence of a defendant's juvenile delinquency adjudication as impeachment evidence bearing on his credibility-that is, to prove his character trait for \"truthfulness or untruthfulness.\" Because these rules treat juvenile delinquency adjudications differently from adult convictions for credibility determinations, Rose argues that such adjudications and convictions ought to be treated differently under Rule 404(c) for propensity determinations. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Rose is, in effect, asking us to apply the reasoning of a rule on impeachment to a question of propensity and then, having done so, read into Rule 404(c) a limitation not expressly put there by the supreme court or, at any time since its adoption in 1997, imposed otherwise statutorily by the legislature. That the supreme court distinguished juvenile delinquency adjudications from adult convictions in Rules 608 and 609, but made no corresponding distinction between juvenile other-acts evidence and adult other-acts evidence in Rule 404(c), supports the conclusion that it intended that there be none. Moreover, the legislature in A.R.S. \u00a7 8-207(B) provided that \"[t]he disposition of a juvenile in the juvenile court may not be used against the juvenile in any case or proceeding\n   <em>\n    other than a criminal or juvenile case\n   </em>\n   in any court.\" (Emphasis added.) By expressly allowing the use of juvenile adjudications in criminal cases, this statute does not betray any public policy against using them for the purposes of Rule 404(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Rose then asks us to apply here the principles of\n   <em>\n    Miller v.
