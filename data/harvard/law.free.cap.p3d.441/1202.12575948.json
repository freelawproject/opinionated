The Department unanimously agreed that in light of 2018 amendments to the statutes governing legal financial obligations and this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State of Washington v. David Angel Ramirez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    191 Wn.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    426 P.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), the trial court may not require an indigent defendant to pay the $ 200 criminal filing fee. In addition, RCW 43.43.7541 precludes the imposition of the DNA collection fee if the defendant's DNA has already been collected in connection with a prior conviction. The Department therefore unanimously agreed that the petition for review should be granted as to the $ 200 filing fee issue and the DNA fee. The Department also unanimously agreed that the petition for review raises no other issue that merits this court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b62 IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b63 That the petition for review is granted only on the issue of the challenge to the legal financial obligations. In light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State of Washington v. David Angel Ramirez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    191 Wn.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    426 P.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and the 2018 amendment to the legal financial obligations statutes, this case is remanded to the trial court to strike the requirement to pay the $ 200 criminal filing fee and to reconsider the imposition of the requirement to pay the DNA fee.\n  </p>\n  <pre class=\"author\" id=\"p-9\">For the Court <em>/s/ Fairhurst, C.J.</em> CHIEF JUSTICE</pre>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
