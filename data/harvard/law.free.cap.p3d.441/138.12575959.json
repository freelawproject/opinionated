The purpose of the legislation was to provide affordable and quality primary universal services to all despite the challenges of its accessibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 In an effort to defray the costs of delivering phone service in rural, more remote areas, the federal and state Acts each established a fund to help support eligible service providers. Within Oklahoma's Act, the Legislature created the OUSF to help pay for reasonable investments and expenses incurred by \"eligible local exchange telecommunications service providers\" in providing primary universal services to customers in rural and high-cost areas \"at rates that are reasonable and affordable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (A), (B), and (G). The OUSF generally provides that an eligible provider \"may request funding from the OUSF as necessary to maintain rates for primary universal services that are reasonable and affordable.\" 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (G). The OUSF is funded by a charge paid by certain telecommunications carriers that have revenues as defined in Section 139.107.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7\u00a7 139.106 (D) and 139.107.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The Commission's rules governing the process for obtaining funding from the OUSF are set out in OAC 165:59, Part 9 and are overseen by the Administrator of the Commission's Public Utilities Division (\"PUD\"). Under the rules, upon receipt of a request for OUSF funding, the OUSF Administrator reviews the request and, if appropriate, reimburses the provider consistent with the Act. OAC 165:59-7-1(d) and OAC 165:59-3-62(g). Requests for Subsection (G)'s \"as necessary\" distributions are evaluated through a detailed study and analysis of the \"costs of providing primary universal services\" as well as potential revenue. 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (H). The review process for claims submitted under Subsection (G) can be time-consuming and tedious, often resulting in a significant delay in receipt of any funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Legislature provided a mechanism within the Act that would allow providers in the rural areas quicker access to mandatory payments in certain, limited circumstances. See 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106(K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Subsection (K)(1)(a) mandates that, if \"a Federal Communications Commission order, rule or policy\" has the effect of \"decreas[ing] the federal universal service fund revenues of an eligible local exchange telecommunications service provider,\" that provider \"shall recover the decreases in revenues from the OUSF.\" 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (K)(1)(a). Similarly, Subsection (K)(1)(b) provides that, if changes required by \"federal or state regulatory rules, orders, or policies\" reduce the revenues or increase the costs to an eligible local exchange telecommunications service provider, then that provider \"shall recover the revenue reductions or cost increases from the OUSF.\" 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (K)(1)(b). Under Subsection (K), distributions from the OUSF \"shall not be conditioned upon any rate case or earnings investigation by the Commission,\" but, instead, should be paid in an amount equal to the increase in costs or reduction in revenues. 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106 (K)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The Commissioners are free to approve or reject any determination by the OUSF Administrator. Under the rules, if no one objects to the Administrator's determination, an order approving the funding request is issued by the Commission. OAC 165:59-3-62(j). If, however, a party is not satisfied with the OUSF Administrator's determination, the party may file a request for reconsideration by the Commission and the matter is set for hearing. OAC 165:59-3-62(h) and (i). The Commission is the ultimate arbiter of the issues.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cameron v.

She dissented to the denial of Medicine Park's request stating that because she didn't believe the majority decision \"comports with the Oklahoma Legislature's intent to, in part, provide support to small, rural carriers who have experienced increases in costs as a result of changes required by governmental acts and with the Legislative policy to preserve and advance universal services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 In 2014, the Commission denied a request for OUSF funding from Dobson Telephone Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dobson Telephone Co. v.

Dobson sought reimbursement, under Subsection (K)(1)(b) of the OUSF, for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the city of Oklahoma City for a street-widening project.

This Court approved the case for publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 Dobson provides telecommunications services to customers in rural areas of Oklahoma, serving fewer than 75,000 access lines. On October 17, 2011, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) sent a letter to Dobson ordering the relocation of certain telephone lines within a public right-of-way of an ODOT, highway construction project along State Highway 62, in Lincoln County. Dobson moved the lines as requested for a net total of $95,430.46, after accounting for limited ODOT funding in the amount of $7,606.13. Dobson then filed an application with the Commission, under Subsection (K)(1)(b), for reimbursement of this amount from the OUSF using a form created by the Commission and following the same process as other companies when seeking an OUSF refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Dobson made detailed, confidential information regarding the project's costs available for inspection to the Commission's OUSF Administrator. This included information regarding the costs incurred, invoices for engineering, equipment and supplies, and internal employee timesheets and wages. The Administrator reviewed Dobson's application, inspected the confidential information during multiple on-site visits, and ultimately approved a reimbursement for Dobson in the amount of $95,417.92. A nominal amount of $12.54 was disallowed due to a lack of supporting invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Various competitor telephone companies, collectively known as Sprint for purposes of this appeal, objected and filed a Request for Reconsideration on March 8, 2017. A hearing was held before an ALJ, where the evidence was briefed and summarized, additional testimony was taken, and the objecting parties were permitted to cross-examine witnesses-including the Administrator-and present evidence or argument to the contrary. The ALJ agreed that Dobson was an eligible provider,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the\n   facilities in question were used in the provision of primary universal services, and that the expenses incurred by Dobson were as a result of a state government mandate. On April 13, 2017 the ALJ found that the Administrator correctly determined the reasonable and just amount for the facility relocations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 Thereafter, the Commission voted, 2-1, to deny Dobson's request. The two-person majority found that Dobson's request was not sufficiently supported by evidence as the confidential information reviewed by its Administrator was not included in the record before the Commission. The Commission further determined that Dobson failed to prove that the expenditures at issue were necessary to provide primary universal services at a reasonable and affordable rate. Finally, the Commission stated that it was without sufficient information to determine whether the expenses were incurred only for primary universal services.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Section 139.107 provides, in part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    A.

Hudson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20OK%2026\">\n     1997 OK 26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12008871\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/934/1082/#p1086\">\n     934 P.2d 1082\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1086. Thus, under the express provisions of the Act, Dobson was entitled to receive reimbursement from the OUSF for these cost increases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b620 In support of its decision to deny Dobson's requested funding, the Commission's majority found that Dobson failed to produce sufficient evidence into the record. Despite acknowledging that its \"Administrator was afforded, and took advantage of, the opportunity to perform a 'review of the Application, contractor's invoices, internal invoices, construction drawings, pre-engineering plans, work orders, plans and maps, timesheets, reimbursement checks, contracts, responses to data requests, relevant Oklahoma Statutes,' its own administrative rules regarding the OUSF,\" the Commission ignored both the Administrator's and the ALJ's findings that the documents provided by Dobson supported its request for funding. The Commission complained that it was limited to a mathematical review as many of the documents relied on, and reviewed by, the Administrator occurred on site at Dobson's place of business and were not made publicly available due to the confidential nature of the documents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b621 Dobson points out that up until the filing of these companion cases, the Commission had for years always accepted the Administrator's review of confidential documents on site. Dobson maintains that they should not be penalized for the Commission's option not to take advantage of the opportunity to review, or even request to review, any of the confidentially-redacted documents. Dobson also cites cases supporting the proposition\n    that long-standing actions or interpretations by an agency will not be idly cast aside without proper notice to affected parties.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Oral Roberts Univ. v.

This occurred not only in OUSF cases, but in numerous other Commission matters. We find the Commission was not entitled to disregard Dobson's application merely because the documents the Administrator inspected and relied upon for his approval were not publicly filed of record before the Commission.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b623 Dobson argues, and the Commission does not dispute, that the Commission's own rules and long-standing practices encouraged applicants to retain confidential supporting materials on site, making such materials available for review and inspection as needed to support an application. In fact, Commission rule, OAC 165:59-3-72(d), specifically contemplates that \"documentation not contained in the public record and not filed in the cause\" may nevertheless be \"relied upon by the OUSF Administrator in approving or denying an application.\" The Administrator disclosed that the Commission does not even have procedures in place that would allow it to handle \"the responsibility or liability\" of receiving such confidential materials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b624 Dobson filed an application, completed by using a Commission-issued form, which certified that as a result of an ODOT mandate to relocate its facilities it incurred an increase in costs in the amount of $95,430.46, after subtracting the ODOT reimbursements. The company presented the testimony of a company witness who reviewed all of Dobson's pertinent, confidential materials, and who confirmed the validity of the requested amounts. The Administrator also reviewed the confidential materials and agreed that Dobson's application and documentation supported the relief requested, as nominally modified by the Administrator to a lump sum of $95,417.92. The ALJ agreed with the Administrator that Dobson's application and offered materials supported approval thereof. Despite these findings, the Commission unexpectedly faulted Dobson for failing to publicly submit its confidential materials when documents of such a nature have not been typically filed with the Commission, nor required. Such flawed reasoning should not support a denial of the application herein.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b625 Additionally, for the first time in these companion cases, the Commission interpreted Subsection (K) to impose a finding that Dobson's rates for primary universal services are reasonable and affordable pursuant to Subsection (B) and that the requested funding is necessary to maintain such reasonable and affordable rates. As mentioned,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 139.106(K)(1)(b) plainly provides that where a provider incurs increased costs due to a state law, order or policy, the provider SHALL recover the cost increase from the OUSF.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106(K)(1)(b). There is no mention of a condition that the applicant must prove that its rates are reasonable and affordable nor is there a requirement to find the reimbursement necessary to maintain such rates. To the contrary, \u00a7 139.106(K)(2) specifically states that an application's approval \"shall not be conditioned upon any rate case or earnings investigation by the Commission.\" 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106(K)(1)(b). We are not inclined to add requirements to a statute that the Legislature chose not to impose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pentagon Acad., Inc. v. Indep. Sch. Dist.

We agree. The Commission ignores the plain language of the Act and attempts to impose new conditions not required by the Act, nor supportive of its purpose. Generally, applicants who filed under Subsection (K) could expect a quick reimbursement after approval by the Administrator that the application had followed the statutory process. The Commission's in-depth review of a Subsection (K) application would only arise if an outside entity filed a Request for Reconsideration of the Administrator's determination. Where no such reconsideration request is filed, the Administrator's approval, after a proper statutory review, would typically trigger a Commission order granting the applicant's request.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b627 The Commission also criticized the fact that the relocated lines were used for services not related to primary universal services. The Commission maintains that Dobson should have allocated the cost of the project between such services. Dobson argues that a request for reimbursement under Subsection (K) does not require any such cost allocation nor has the Commission ever required one in previous Subsection (K) matters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b628 Subsection (K) plainly provides that where a provider incurs cost increases due to a state law or order, the provider SHALL recover the cost increase from the OUSF. 17 O.S.Supp.2016, \u00a7 139.106(K)(1)(b). There is no mention of a requirement for cost allocation and we are not inclined to impose such requirement now. The Commission again ignores the plain language of the Act and attempts to impose new conditions not required by the Act, nor supportive of its purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b629 Dobson contends that the Commission's complete denial of funding disregards the very purpose of the OUSF to ensure the availability of affordable telephone service to customers in rural and high cost areas where, absent the subsidies, their provision would be cost-prohibitive. We agree. The Commission majority's disapproval of the policy behind the OUSF legislation has no bearing on the validity of an applicant's request for funding. We agree with the dissenting Commissioner that it is our duty to uphold legislation as it is enacted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b630 Although the Commission is not bound by the Administrator's recommendation, we find that the record reflects ample evidence with which to support the Administrator's determination. The Administrator, the ALJ, and the dissenting Commissioner, all agreed Dobson was entitled to reimbursement of the increased costs it incurred as a result of ODOT's mandate to relocate the telephone lines. The Commission's wholesale denial of Dobson's request was in error. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Commission and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDER OF THE OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION VACATED AND REMANDED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    CONCUR: GURICH, C.J., KAUGER, WINCHESTER, EDMONDSON, and DARBY, JJ.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    CONCURRING SPECIALLY (by separate writing): COMBS, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    NOT PARTICIPATING: COLBERT, AND REIF, JJ.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-59\">\n     The Oklahoma Constitution, art. 9, Section 18 specifies that the Commission has:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n     the power and authority and [is] charged with the duty of supervising, regulating and controlling all transportation and transmission companies doing business in this State, in all matters relating to the performance of their public duties and their charges therefor, and of correcting abuses and preventing unjust discrimination and extortion by such companies; and to that end the Commission shall, from time to time, prescribe and enforce against such companies, in the manner hereinafter authorized, such rates, charges, classifications of traffic, and rules and regulations, and shall require them to establish and maintain all such public service, facilities, and conveniences as may be reasonable and just, which said rates, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, and requirements, the Commission may, from time to time, alter or amend.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-61\">\n     Subsection 139.106 (K) of the Act provides in toto:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n     K. 1.
