Bednar (Respondent) is a member of the Oklahoma Bar Association (Bar) and is licensed to practice law in Oklahoma. The Bar initiated this action under Rule 6 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings (RGDP), 5 O.S.2011, ch.1, app. 1-A, by filing an eleven-count Complaint on December 21, 2017. Respondent did not respond to the Complaint or to the Bar's Motion to Deem Allegations Admitted. The Professional Responsibility Tribunal (Trial Panel) deemed the allegations admitted and after a two-week trial found Respondent violated the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct (ORPC) 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16(d), 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, 8.1(b), 8.2(a), 8.4(c)-(d), 5 O.S.2011, ch. 1, app. 3-A, and RGDP 1.3 and 5.2.

CURRENT DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Allegations Deemed Admitted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In response to grievances filed by former clients, the Bar investigated Respondent and on December 21, 2017, filed a formal Complaint setting forth eleven (11) counts of professional misconduct. In substance, these counts allege Respondent engaged in abusive discovery tactics, misrepresentations to courts, forgery of court documents, misappropriation of client funds, unauthorized contacts with opposing parties, a pattern of missing deadlines, untimely and improper motions for recusal, and retaliatory and frivolous lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Bar submitted evidence that Respondent was properly served with notice of the Complaint. On December 21, 2017, the Bar mailed copies of the formal Complaint to Respondent's official roster address and residence; Respondent signed for one copy on January 6, 2018. The Bar also hired a process server who served Respondent with the\n   Complaint on January 10, 2018. In each of these notices, the Bar included a letter advising Respondent that RGDP 6.4 \"requires an answer to be filed on your behalf with the Chief Justice within twenty (20) days of today's date[, and i]n the event you do not answer within twenty (20) days, the charges shall be deemed admitted.\" The Bar also enclosed copies of relevant documents serving as the bases for the grievances so that Respondent could review and address them in his response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Respondent did not file an answer to the Complaint. Instead, he filed numerous \"special appearance[s],\" requests for recusal, subpoenas duces tecum, and other motions. With no timely answer from Respondent, the Bar filed a Motion to Deem Allegations Admitted on January 31, 2018. At the Scheduling Conference the same day, the Trial Panel said it would take the motion under advisement, explaining to Respondent that although he was out of time, it still believed an answer to the allegations would be \"of great value to the Court.\" Sched. Conf. Tr. 116-17, Jan. 31, 2018. Although Respondent appeared at the Scheduling Conference and filed many motions, at no time did he file an answer to the Complaint or to the Motion to Deem Allegations Admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After taking the motion under advisement for over two months, the Trial Panel issued an order on April 3, 2018, deeming the allegations of the Complaint admitted, pursuant to RGDP 6.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the Pre-Trial Conference Hearing on April 16, 2018, the Trial Panel reiterated to Respondent that the allegations had been deemed admitted. There, and many times throughout the proceedings, the Trial Panel explained that it would hear evidence regarding the material elements of the Complaint and then, assuming those elements were established, evidence regarding appropriate discipline. Despite these notices, the transcripts reveal that Respondent spent much of the evidentiary hearing re-litigating already decided or irrelevant issues, such as his 2013 discipline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the hearing, the Trial Panel found clear and convincing evidence for ten (10) of the eleven (11) counts and concluded, \"without the slightest reservation or hesitation[,] Respondent is unfit in all respects to be licensed as an attorney.\" Trial Panel Rep. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Due Process Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Respondent alleges the investigative process was \"fraught with procedural and substantive due process violations,\" claiming: the grievances lacked specificity; the Bar was biased against him; and the Trial Panel improperly deemed the allegations admitted, quashed subpoenas, refused to issue a new Scheduling Order, and declined to recuse its Presiding Master. Resp't's Br. 7-10. The Bar contends that Respondent was afforded \"every opportunity to participate\" in the fact-finding stages of the proceedings, yet chose not to fully avail himself of those opportunities - as evidenced by his failure to respond to the Complaint or Motion to Deem Allegations Admitted, refusal to submit an exhibit or witness list even after being granted extensions, and decision to wait seven weeks after the Scheduling Order to issue over thirty (30) subpoenas, almost all of which were improperly served and sought primarily privileged or protected information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Respondent claims \"trial by ambush,\" arguing that the Bar had years to investigate and prepare its case-in-chief while he was afforded insufficient time. Under the Scheduling\n   Order, Respondent was to submit his exhibit list by March 30, 2018 and complete discovery by April 6, 2018. The day before his exhibit list was due, Respondent requested an extension of time, to which the Bar agreed. Respondent also requested an extension of the discovery deadline, to which the Bar also agreed. Respondent, however, failed to comply with either extended deadline, and the Bar moved to preclude any documents Respondent sought to introduce at trial. Despite the Bar's motion, the Trial Panel permitted Respondent to submit an exhibit list as well as any documentary evidence by April 20, the Friday before the hearing was scheduled to begin on Monday, April 23. When the Trial Panel ordered him to respond to the many motions to quash filed by the witnesses he subpoenaed, Respondent complained that he could not possibly respond in the time allotted, which was the same amount of time he allowed for his intended witnesses to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Additionally, Respondent claims the Bar's exhibits were not adequately identified. The record reveals that the Bar made its exhibits available to Respondent on April 6, 2018, in accordance with the Scheduling Order. Respondent, however, did not retrieve them until April 10; then at the hearing nearly two weeks later, the Bar had to assist Respondent in cutting open the exhibit boxes for the first time. Hr'g Tr. vol. 1, 88-90, Apr. 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Bar states that Respondent had ample time to prepare a defense against the allegations of the Complaint, and he \"engaged in every possible action to subvert the truth and delay the proceedings.\" The Trial Panel reports that despite receiving sufficient notice and opportunity, Respondent spent much of the hearing giving \"frequent soliloquies advancing his theories of extraordinary persecution of him and bias by the bench and [B]ar.\" Trial Panel Rep. 5. Compliance with due process simply requires that the Bar allege facts sufficient to put the attorney on notice of the charges and allow an opportunity to respond to the allegations.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Failures to Respond to Requests for Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 In the following four counts, we address Respondent's refusals to provide requested information to the Bar - in two instances reasonably, and in two others in violation of the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count IX: Failure to Cooperate with Bar's Request for Medical Information\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 Investigating grievances filed against Respondent that appeared to be similar to his misconduct in the prior discipline, the Bar e-mailed Respondent on March 30, 2016, requesting that he provide any and all information regarding current medications, prescribed medications, healthcare providers, and mental and physical diagnoses. Bar Ex. 139C. The Bar explained in this correspondence that it sought this information based on a concern that Respondent's physical and/or mental health might again be affecting his practice of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11417122\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/51/570/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Over the next year, Respondent refused to provide the requested information, asserting that those records were confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 After opening a formal investigation, the Bar deposed Respondent on March 22, 2017, wherein Respondent agreed to answer questions regarding his health status and produce the requested documentation if the Bar would agree to a protective order limiting the use and disclosure of that information. The Professional Responsibility Commission denied Respondent's request on September 22, 2017. Bar Ex. 142. The Bar submits that Respondent's request and noncompliance were unreasonable because Bar investigations remain confidential under RGDP 5.7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trial Panel concluded that Respondent's demand for a protective order was properly refused because \"Respondent himself had raised the issue\" as mitigation in the 2013 discipline, and because the prior and current grievances were so similar. Trial Panel Rep. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Although Respondent originally inserted his health diagnosis as mitigation in the prior discipline and attested he would continue treatment, we believe those statements were in line with a conditional waiver and relate only to those proceedings. Under title 43A, section 1-109 of the Oklahoma Statutes, mental health treatment information is considered confidential and privileged. The Bar notes the confidentiality of investigations under RGDP 5.7, but seems to ignore that formal complaints and all filings with respect thereto are public records under RGDP 6.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, while proceedings under RGDP 10 typically remain confidential, RGDP 10.12\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   makes an exception where disciplinary proceedings are involved. Further, we do not believe RGDP 10.4\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   applies because Respondent did not interject his mental health as mitigation here. Accordingly, while Respondent's refusal to submit medical records foreclosed the possibility of the Bar proceeding\n   under Rule 10,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we do not find that such a refusal amounts to professional misconduct under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count I: Pike Grievance\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 In December 2014, Dorothy Pike hired Respondent to represent her great-grandson (Client) in a first-degree murder case and paid Respondent a $15,000 retainer fee. Pike terminated Respondent in March 2015, and hired new counsel. On March 25, 2015, Respondent faxed Pike's replacement counsel, stating that he would like to meet and go over the work performed in Client's case and that he was \"[h]appy to write a check.\" Bar Ex. 14. The next day, replacement counsel responded that he did not believe it was necessary to meet with Respondent or to discuss any work performed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Five days later, replacement counsel followed up, asking Respondent about the status of a refund check.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Pike filed a grievance against Respondent on June 3, 2015, alleging Respondent had promised yet failed to refund $10,000 of her retainer fee. On June 10, the Bar notified Respondent of the grievance and requested a written response within twenty (20) days, pursuant to RGDP 5.2. Respondent timely replied on June 26, 2015, stating that he did not recall ever agreeing to refund $10,000, but would be willing to return a reasonable amount as a good-faith courtesy since Pike was related to his former wife. Bar Ex. 4. Respondent claimed that he had earned more than the $15,000 retainer prior to his termination, and he included a partial billing record for December 3 through December 29, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In this partial record, Respondent showed he had worked 67.5 hours at a rate of $250.00/hour and incurred costs of $77.00 in mileage to visit Client in jail. Based on these records, Respondent claimed Pike actually owed him $1,450.39. Respondent also claimed that the $15,000 was only a partial payment of an originally agreed upon retainer fee of $30,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 The Bar then made multiple requests for a copy of the case file and a full accounting of work performed for the remainder of his representation. Respondent did not provide the additional information, repeatedly asserting that he was unable to comply due to his computer being broken and undergoing repair. Neither Respondent nor Pike provided a copy of any billing agreement, and at the hearing Pike testified that one did not exist. Pike further testified that although she had paid Respondent $15,000, he was handling the case\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   and charging only for things that cost him money, such as a lie detector test and a rehabilitation program for Client. Hr'g Tr. vol. 2, 418-19, Apr. 24, 2018. Pike admitted that after she terminated Respondent, he never told her an exact amount for the refund he allegedly promised. The Bar's investigator testified that this Count was pursued because he didn't believe that Respondent did the work reflected in his submitted bill. Hr'g Tr. vol. 1, 177-78, Apr. 23, 2018. The Trial Panel found clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to respond to the Bar's requests for a full accounting of work performed and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 RGDP 1.4(b) provides that controversies regarding fee amounts shall not be a basis for disciplinary charges unless the fee \"is extortionate or fraudulent.\" 5 O.S.2011, ch. 1, app. 1-A. Respondent timely responded to the Bar with a partial accounting of work performed, showing that no refund was due. Despite the allegations, the Trial Panel did not permit Respondent to put on evidence supporting the reasonableness of his fee or the time he billed. Further, after his termination, Respondent offered to meet with replacement counsel and go over the work he performed. It is not apparent in the record that after turning down Respondent's offer, replacement counsel ever asked Respondent for a copy of the file. The record suggests confusion surrounding Respondent's willingness to issue a good-faith refund - a refund which does not actually appear to be required. Accordingly, we do not find clear and convincing evidence of professional misconduct regarding the fee disagreement or Respondent's\n   failure to provide additional requested information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count VI: Withdrawn Grievance\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25 In May 2016, the Bar received a client grievance alleging that Respondent had accepted a $3,000 retainer fee to set up a trust for the client, yet Respondent failed to perform any services and soon ceased all communication with him. The Bar informed Respondent of the grievance by letter on May 18, 2016, detailing the allegations and requesting his written response within twenty (20) days. Respondent failed to provide a timely response, and the Bar made numerous additional requests for information via certified mail, e-mail, and telephone. Bar Ex. 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 26 It was not until September 21, 2016, four months after the Bar's initial inquiry, that Respondent sent a letter stating his computer was broken, and he was therefore unable to retrieve the requested information. He then stated that he had \"worked extremely hard on a myriad of issues,\" and what existed was a fee dispute. Bar Ex. 96. Before the Bar filed its formal Complaint, the client informed the Bar that the concern had been resolved, and he no longer wished to pursue the grievance against Respondent. The Trial Panel did not find sufficient evidence to support Count VI. We agree as to the underlying grievance but disagree as to Respondent's failure to timely respond. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to respond to the Bar's lawful demand for information in Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count XII: Misconduct in a Deprived Child Case\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Count XII arises from a juvenile proceeding in which Respondent represented the foster parents of a young child. In March 2017, Respondent filed pleadings wherein he attached confidential medical reports containing protected information about the biological parents and the child, plus a confidential report from the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, which was addressed to the District Attorney's Office. Finding that neither the foster parents nor Respondent should have ever had access to said reports, the district court ordered that all such confidential information contained in Respondent's pleading be immediately \"removed and sealed.\" Bar Ex. 153G;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. vol. 7, 1768, May 1, 2018. The court further ordered that Respondent turn in all records that he or his clients \"obtained through unknown sources.\" Bar Ex. 153G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 Despite repeated requests during the Bar's investigation, Respondent failed to address how he obtained these confidential documents. Instead, he requested recusal of Bar counsel, alleging \"flagrant constitutional violations and knowing purposeful harassment.\" Bar Ex. 152. Respondent claimed the grievance should be dismissed because \"no sanctions were imposed by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . At the Trial Panel hearing, both the presiding juvenile court judge and the trial judge testified that Respondent's possession and use of these reports were improper. Hr'g Tr. vol. 7, 1768, 1772-76, May 1, 2018. No authority, however, was cited for that position. The Trial Panel stated that the \"real issue in this Count\" was how Respondent came into possession of the documents. At no point has Respondent answered that question. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to respond to requests for information in Count XII. Overall, Respondent did not commit professional misconduct in Counts I or IX; however, he failed to respond to the Bar's investigation in Counts VI and XII in violation of ORPC 8.1(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and RGDP 5.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lack of Candor, Frivolous Filings, and Dilatory Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count III: Goodwin &amp; Lee Grievance\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 29 Count III relates to Respondent's conduct in\n   <em>\n    RCB Bank v. Bednar\n   </em>\n   , No. CJ-2015-192 (Okla. Cty. Dist. Ct.), a foreclosure action which arose from a delinquent loan that Respondent and his former wife executed with RCB Bank. The bank filed its petition on January 13, 2015, seeking judgment for breach of contract, foreclosure on a mortgage, and fraudulent inducement - alleging Respondent made knowingly false statements regarding his income and suspended status as a lawyer at the time of his loan application. Respondent failed to answer the petition until nearly two months later on March 11, 2015. He sought additional time from the court to answer, yet violated that allowance as well. On the day the bank's motion for summary judgment was scheduled, almost eight (8) months after filing his answer, Respondent filed counterclaims without receiving leave to do so. On that same day, Respondent sought the recusal of Judge Prince in open court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   failing to comply with District Court Rule 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30 Following this request for recusal, attorneys for the bank, Kyle Goodwin and Edward Lee, filed a grievance against Respondent on November 30, 2015. In whole, the grievance alleges Respondent's: (1) routine failure to remit copies of pleadings he filed; (2) abusive discovery tactics; (3) failure to follow elementary rules of civil procedure; (4) bad-faith strategy of seeking recusal of judges on the eve of court dates; and (5) general unfitness to practice law. After being notified of the grievance in June 2016, Respondent failed to respond timely. In his response over three (3) months later, Respondent did not disclose relevant facts surrounding the incident; instead he pointed to the conduct and personality of his accuser, Goodwin. The Bar notified Respondent that his response did not comply with RGDP 5.2, and Respondent later filed an untimely supplemental response in which he continued to lodge personal attacks and shift the blame for the drawn out litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 31 Judge Prince ultimately agreed to recuse, and the case was reassigned to Judge Andrews. The bank filed an Application for Writ of Assistance to remove Respondent from the foreclosure property, and a hearing was set for February 2, 2017. Just two days before the hearing, Respondent filed a motion for recusal of Judge Andrews as well. Judge Andrews overruled Respondent's motion, and a week later Respondent filed yet another motion for recusal, raising essentially the same arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 32 The record reveals that Respondent conducted abusive and harassing discovery in the proceeding. He demanded production of, among other things, a comprehensive list of the bank's assets; insurance policies for the bank; personal insurance policies for the bank president and its attorneys; and all e-mails and text messages that referenced Respondent\n   in any way,\n   <em>\n    including those Goodwin had with his client, RCB Bank.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Respondent sued RCB Bank, its president, other bank employees, and its attorneys personally in\n   <em>\n    Bednar v. RCB Bank\n   </em>\n   , No. CJ-2016-4321 (Okla. Cty. Dist. Ct.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 Respondent provided Goodwin with documents he purports are \"exculpatory e-mails\" in which he accurately disclosed his income and suspension. He claims unfairness based on lack of discovery of these e-mails and Goodwin's failure to investigate them. Lodging these claims, Respondent makes virtually no citation to the record. Testimony and exhibits presented at the hearing clearly demonstrate these contentions are false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 34 The bank did in fact investigate Respondent's fraud in failing to disclose his true income and suspension. Goodwin testified that the copies of \"e-mails\" that Respondent provided to him lacked the time and date stamp automatically generated in every e-mail sent from an RCB e-mail account. Likewise, after searching, Goodwin found no record of the purported e-mails outside the copies Respondent provided him. Goodwin stated it was his belief that Respondent manufactured the documents in a \"Hail Mary\" effort to conceal his fraud on the bank. The Trial Panel concluded that the purported e-mails lacked authenticity. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35 Further, in his briefing to this Court, Respondent misrepresents the testimony of Judge Andrews at the evidentiary hearing. Respondent claims Judge Andrews admitted to error justifying his recusal request when in fact Judge Andrews testified that he believed there was no good-faith basis for Respondent's request and that it was generally a delay tactic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trial Panel concluded that Respondent \"used every trick in the book, and some not in the book, to stall and prevent the action.\" Trial Panel Rep. 7. Exhibits presented, as well as the testimony of Goodwin and Judges Prince and Andrews, convince us that Respondent intentionally delayed the lawful foreclosure of his home. The record is replete with examples of Respondent's lack of candor, abusive discovery tactics, bad-faith delay attempts, and strategy of improperly seeking the recusal of judges. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed professional misconduct in Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 36 The remainder of Counts addressed in this section - Counts IV, V, VIII, and XI - came about as a result of the Bar's investigation into other allegations of misconduct. Respondent disputes the legitimacy of these grievances, arguing they did not arise from any \"identified human being.\" Under RGDP 5.1(a), however, the Bar may \"in [its] discretion, institute an investigation on the basis of facts or allegations ... brought to their attention in any manner whatsoever.\" 5 O.S.2011, ch. 1, app. 1-A. Throughout the proceedings, Respondent requested that counsel for the Bar recuse herself, claiming she was conspiring with other attorneys and subtly encouraging Bar complaints against him. Evidence of Respondent's actions in these cases and comprehensive review of the Bar's investigation into them demonstrate these Counts are not the product of an antagonistic prosecutor as Respondent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count VIII: Frivolous Lawsuits Against Judges\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37 On April 13, 2016, Respondent filed a petition in Oklahoma County District Court against Judges Barbara Swinton, Aletia Timmons, and Thomas Prince for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Bednar v. Hon. Barbara Swinton\n   </em>\n   , No. CJ-2016-1923 (Okla. Cty. Dist. Ct.). Respondent alleged the judges abused their offices and violated judicial canons by \"targeting\" and \"publicly humiliating\" Respondent. After filing his petition, Respondent failed to serve any of the three judges as defendants. Learning about the lawsuit on their own, each of the judges moved to dismiss the case on June 8, 2016, through private counsel and the Attorney General's Office, based on failure to state a claim and judicial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 38 Respondent was mailed a copy of these motions and notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing on the motions, which was set for July 14, 2016. Respondent failed to file any timely response to the motions to dismiss. On the date of the hearing,\n   <em>\n    Respondent failed to appear or to provide the court with any notice or explanation for his lack of appearance\n   </em>\n   . Granting the judges' motions to dismiss with prejudice on July 14, 2016, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Respondent] has shown a complete lack of respect to this court by failing to appear without any communication with the court whatsoever. The Court Clerk of Oklahoma County is hereby ordered to contact by certified mail [Respondent] and order him to appear before this court within thirty days and explain why he should not be sanctioned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Bar Ex. 138M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 39 Then on August 15, 2016, Respondent filed a Motion to Set Aside Dismissal With Prejudice, claiming that dismissal was premature because he \"had not commenced his case and had not served the petition.\" Denying the motion on October 20, 2016, the district court plainly held: \"In a single sentence\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202003\">\n    12 O.S. 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   says otherwise.\" Bar Ex. 138U. The court then cited the statute directly: \"A civil action is commenced by filing a petition with the court.\" 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 40 On October 10, 2016, Respondent filed an Amended Petition in which he tried to add an additional judge-defendant\n   <em>\n    after the lawsuit had been dismissed with prejudice\n   </em>\n   . On November 23, 2016, Respondent filed a Motion to Reconsider. The court denied both by letter, stating that all pleadings by Respondent were improperly filed, and his attempt to revive the litigation by \"changing the Heading and adding an additional Defendant\" was done \"without permission of this Court.\" Bar Ex. 138X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41 The Bar opened its investigation by letter on January 13, 2017, and Respondent failed to comply with multiple requests for information. On February 13, 2017, the Bar subpoenaed Respondent for deposition on March 2, 2017. One day before the deposition, Respondent e-mailed the Bar investigator, claiming that the case against the judges was \"on-going\" and it was wrong for the Bar to punish him for \"exercising his right to access the courts.\" Respondent was eventually deposed on March 22 and June 7, 2017. The Trial Panel summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Perhaps the most telling fact in this grievance, though there are many, is Respondent's refusal, when deposed, to provide information as to the allegedly meritorious nature of his claims of slander. He refused to answer based on attorney-client privilege even though he is\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Trial Panel Rep. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 42 Respondent's actions stemming from Count VIII \"show the continued abuse of process, ... disregard for court rules and orders, renaming pleadings requesting the same relief, [and] filing pleadings after a case has been dismissed.\" Trial Panel Rep. 9. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed professional misconduct in Count VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count IV: Improperly Seeking Recusal, Impugning the Integrity of the Judiciary, Attempting to Disguise Same Legal Requests with Different Titles &amp; Count V: Abusive Discovery Tactics and Unauthorized Contacts\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 43 Counts IV and V arise from several cases in various district courts. In support of these counts, the Bar submitted numerous exhibits as well as the testimony of Judges Bernard Jones, Aletia Timmons, Barbara Swinton, Thomas Prince, Don Andrews, Martha Oakes, Howard Haralson, Retired Judge Gary Miller, and attorneys Chris Harper and Kyle Goodwin. Testimony of these individuals as well as a bevy of court pleadings demonstrate that Respondent routinely\n   engaged in a continuous pattern of filing frivolous motions and improperly seeking the recusal of judges on the eve of, or directly after, adverse rulings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Case by case, the Complaint shows how Respondent utilized this strategy as a \"procedural weapon designed to run up litigation costs and delay the effect of judgments entered.\" Complaint \u00b6 67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 44 The record confirms that on over thirty (30) occasions in the five (5) cases presented by the Bar, Respondent filed essentially the same motions for reconsideration, motions to vacate, or requests for recusal after a ruling had already been made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Court filings and the testimony regarding each of these cases illustrate Respondent's efforts to saturate the court dockets, frustrate the litigation, and prolong the proceedings. At the evidentiary hearing, Judge Haralson concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The way it continued on and on and on ... it wasn't anything that happened by accident[;] it wasn't anything that happened by mistake; it was a very calculated and very continued way of behavior that is absolutely inappropriate for a licensed attorney in the state of Oklahoma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Hr'g Tr. vol. 7, 1837, May 1, 2018. Respondent's attempts to take a second, third, or fourth bite at the proverbial apple imposed burdensome costs on courts, opposing parties, and his clients. His pattern of misconduct impugns public confidence in an impartial judiciary. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed professional misconduct in Counts IV and V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count XI: Misrepresentations to Judge Parrish\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 45 Count XI stems from Respondent's representation of a family in a wrongful death suit in Oklahoma County. The merits of this lawsuit purportedly turned on the medical opinion of Dr. Chestnut, who had since retired and moved to Norway. After Respondent represented that he had no way of contacting this key witness, opposing counsel spent thousands of dollars locating and serving Dr. Chestnut in Norway to obtain his deposition. Bar Ex. 146. After much discussion and difficulty among the parties, the district court ordered that Dr. Chestnut's deposition would take place on December 8, 2015, when Dr. Chestnut was scheduled to return to Oklahoma for a medical procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 46 On the day the witness was to be deposed, however, Respondent filed a motion to quash, wherein he misrepresented to the district court that he had never received notice of the deposition from opposing counsel, and based on this lack of notice he was unable to attend. Relying on Respondent's statements, the court struck the deposition.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It was later established that Respondent had in fact been notified of the deposition and had even exchanged several e-mails with opposing counsel attempting to reschedule it. After the witness did not appear for deposition, opposing counsel filed a motion for sanctions against Respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 47 During this time period, two separate purported orders quashing the deposition came to light. Bar Ex. 149G, 189. The first merely struck the deposition, whereas the second bore additional language regarding another witness. Calvin Sharpe, attorney for Dr. Chestnut, testified at the Trial Panel hearing that Respondent had shown up at his law firm on the day the deposition was quashed, while Sharpe was in court, and instructed Sharpe's legal assistant to fax the nonconforming, second order to all other parties. Hr'g Tr. vol. 7, 1714, 1718-19, May 1, 2018. Respondent later admitted that he created the second order. Bar Ex. 149L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 48 In February 2015, the district court, Judge Parrish presiding, found that Respondent had intentionally misrepresented facts and withheld information from the court. Based on these misrepresentations, Judge Parrish ultimately recused herself permanently from any future cases with Respondent, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   I do not trust what you have told me and what you failed to tell me in your motion to quash. My ruling is going to be, Mr. Bednar, I will not hear any cases of yours from this point forward, because it would not be fair to your client because I will not take at face value anything you tell me. ...

Previously, Client employed another attorney, Shannon Taylor, in a separate guardianship case regarding another grandchild. Not having sufficient funds to rehire Taylor, Client hired Respondent and gave him copies of the Waiver of Notice and Consent for Guardianship forms that Taylor had prepared in the previous case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 52 On November 2, 2015, Respondent returned the forms to Client, indicating that he had completed them for the next steps in\n   the guardianship action. Immediately noticing Respondent had not even changed the name of the child from the previous case, Client requested that Respondent make the correction. After Respondent made the necessary alterations, the mother and putative father then signed the forms. As required, the mother had her form notarized, but the father, not having a valid form of identification required for notarization, did not. Respondent communicated that the father should simply return the signed form without notarization. The mother's attorney e-mailed the forms to Respondent from Washington, specifically noting that the father's form was signed but had not been notarized. Respondent filed the guardianship petition that same day and filed the waiver and consent forms the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 53 After being awarded guardianship, Client hired her former attorney, Taylor, to handle the adoption proceedings. While working on the adoption, Taylor noticed that her copy of the waiver and consent from the guardianship was not file-stamped. After obtaining the file-stamped copy, Taylor was surprised to find that the father's consent form was purportedly notarized by Taylor's own legal assistant. Taylor showed the document to her assistant, who denied notarizing the form and confirmed that her seal was safely stored in her office. Taylor surmised that the image of the seal appeared to have been cut and pasted from the waiver and consent forms prepared by Taylor in the previous case - the same forms which Client had given to Respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 54 On December 1, 2015, Taylor filed a grievance against Respondent, attaching sworn affidavits from Client and Taylor's legal assistant denying any knowledge of or participation in the notarization. In an untimely response, Respondent denied altering the document and claimed instead that it was Client who had perpetrated the fraud. The Trial Panel stated that despite the \"inordinate amount of time\" that Respondent spent at the hearing blaming his client, he failed to ever address why he would have submitted the documents \"when he knew, and had to know, that one of them could not possibly have been signed and notarized in Oklahoma that very day when the person who signed it was physically in Washington State.\" Trial Panel Rep. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 55 The Trial Panel summarized Respondent's conduct as \"obfuscatory and deceptive,\" stating it was \"of the opinion that the only perjury was that perpetrated by Respondent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We are unconvinced by Respondent's attempts to blame his client.

George Keeney, a certified public accountant and financial and forensics fraud examiner, was appointed co-guardian of Ward's estate and substitute trustee of Ward's trust. As one of his first actions in the case, Respondent called Keeney and attempted to interrogate him about Ward's finances. Declining to discuss the matter, Keeney informed Respondent he was represented by an attorney, James Shaw, and that Respondent should direct all questions to him. Keeney informed his attorney of the interaction, who then called Respondent directly and advised that he represented Keeney and all future communications should be directed to him, not his client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 57 A few weeks later, Respondent appeared unexpectedly in a conference call with co-guardians of Ward and the Ward's health care provider, Synergy. During this call, Respondent again tried to question Keeney and others regarding Ward's finances and other health care issues. Then, on May 6, 2016, Respondent telephoned Keeney again, this time falsely representing that Shaw had agreed to their communications. Hr'g Tr. vol. 6, 1321-22, 1324-25, Apr. 30, 2018. Shaw later e-mailed Respondent the following: \"Mr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Bednar, I represent George Keeney, which you know. Do not communicate with him. Any communication for him should be directed to me as his counsel.\" Bar Ex. 108B.

Bar Ex. 133M.\n   <em>\n    The next day, Respondent and his clients violated the district court's order\n   </em>\n   and terminated Synergy, leaving Ward in a medically vulnerable position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 59 After terminating Synergy, Respondent demanded that Keeney issue a check for $3,500 to pay for a replacement health care company. Shaw advised Respondent by e-mail that \"Keeney had no input into the termination of Synergy\" and would agree to provide the payment \"based solely on his concern that without providing the payment, Ward would be without necessary care due.\" Respondent then falsely represented to the district court that Keeney had approved the replacement health care company. The same day that Respondent demanded payment from Keeney, Shaw again e-mailed Respondent requesting that all communications between lawyers for the parties be restricted to counsel. Bar Ex. 116. Despite this reiterated request, Respondent continued to e-mail Keeney - threatening defamation suits and claiming Keeney had no authority to perform the work he was hired to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 60 On May 25, 2016, Keeney filed a grievance against Respondent, and on May 31, 2016, Shaw filed a separate grievance. On May 27, 2016, Respondent filed a civil suit against Keeney, Murphy, and Synergy on behalf of his clients and Ward's estate. Bar Ex. 134A-B. The Bar advised Respondent of Keeney's and Shaw's grievances by letter dated June 15, 2016, and requested his written response within twenty (20) days. Respondent failed to respond to either grievance for nearly three (3) months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 61 In his response, Respondent stated that he had \"not violated any ethical duties or statutes\" and asked the Bar to dismiss both complaints based on \"lack of standing.\" Bar Ex. 103. Regarding Keeney's grievance, Respondent denied any wrongdoing and suggested the complaint was likely just a result of his attorney advising him to do so. Respondent lodged accusations of embezzlement and mismanagement of funds; he claimed Keeney \"dubbed\" a report from DHS and \"admitted to numerous violations of his fiduciary and ethical duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regarding Shaw's grievance, Respondent denied any wrongdoing and claimed Shaw's complaint was \"childish, likely due to conversations he had with the unscrupulous firm Kyle Goodwin belongs to.\" He continued name-calling, stating that Shaw was \"childish\" and \"unprofessional\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   and \"has received large sums of money from billing [Ward]'s estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 62 At the hearing, the Bar presented e-mail records and testimony from Keeney, Shaw, Murphy, and Judge Welch. The testimony of these individuals demonstrates consistently how Respondent's involvement in the case imposed great financial harm on Ward and elevated the cost of litigation from \"modest\" to \"through the roof.\" Hr'g Tr. vol. 6, 1337, 1345, Apr. 30, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent submitted an hour-and-forty-minute audio recording which he claims disproves the testimony of Keeney and Murphy.

In both the conduct leading to the grievances as well as in the conduct of Respondent during this part of the PRT hearing, the Respondent is the embodiment of unscrupulous.

Instead, he shirks all responsibility for the financial and personal harm inflicted on Ward, attempts to justify his unauthorized communications, and continues to argue that the Order he disobeyed was wrong. We find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed professional misconduct in Count VII. We find that Respondent's professional misconduct in Counts II and VII violates ORPC 3.3, 3.4, 8.1(b), 8.4(c)-(d) and RGDP 1.3 and 5.2.

Respondent failed to uphold his obligations to cooperate in the grievance process or properly respond to inquires throughout the disciplinary proceeding. He has repeatedly failed to act in good faith, asserted frivolous claims and issues, and demanded irrelevant and oppressive discovery. He has failed to competently represent his clients or to exercise due diligence in verifying the truth of pleadings he submitted. Respondent continually persisted in unauthorized communications with a person represented by counsel after reiterated requests to desist. He lacked candor with the court and failed to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation or notify defendants in actions he filed. Finally, Respondent submitted fraudulent filings, directly and intentionally misrepresented facts, and knowingly disobeyed a court order. Respondent's behavior is prejudicial to the administration of justice and has caused numerous parties unnecessary pecuniary loss and personal harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

We stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   For the extensive violations of the rules governing lawyers' conduct and for ignoring these proceedings, we find that disbarment is necessary to stop the abuse of the system hailed on it by Godlove's frivolous, multiple, duplicate filings and to end the disservice to her clients, to opposing parties, to opposing counsel, and to judges presiding over cases in which she is involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   There is a fine line between zealous advocacy and harassing, frivolous litigation. Godlove has not only overstepped the line, she has trampled it. We have a duty to protect against the type of frivolous litigation undertaken by Godlove.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271478\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1086/\">\n    318 P.3d at 1094-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Today we carry out this same duty. As in\n   <em>\n    Godlove\n   </em>\n   , Respondent's patterned behavior \"has shown a total lack of respect for this Court and the process and rules that protect the public from errant lawyers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271478\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1086/\">\n    318 P.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zealous advocacy does not necessitate, nor does it prompt, intimidation or harassment; Respondent has exhibited both in his practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 71 We are convinced, under a clear and convincing standard, of Respondent's sustained abuse of the legal system and retaliatory harassment of opposing counsel and the courts. We see no real evidence that Respondent appreciates the seriousness of his fraud and deceit, examples of which saturate the record. He adamantly denies his wrongdoing and attempts to justify some of the most maligning and egregious behaviors the Court has encountered. Our promulgated rules governing licensed attorneys require much more, and in fact, were fashioned to protect the public from this type of delinquency. Anything less than disbarment would invite further victimization and greater disintegration of public confidence in the legal system of this State. Likewise, to avoid disparate treatment, consistency requires that we disbar Respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. ASSESSMENT OF COSTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 72 The Bar has asked this Court to assess costs in the amount of $28,298.13. RGDP 6.16 provides that where violations are proven, the costs shall be surcharged against the disciplined lawyer unless remitted in whole or in part by the Supreme Court for good cause shown. We have previously held that costs assessed against an attorney may be reduced in part where the Bar fails to prevail on all of the counts charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 73 Here, Respondent prevailed fully on two of the eleven counts, and in two others, we found violations only in his failure to respond. On the other hand, by filing frivolous, redundant pleadings, attempting to relitigate his prior discipline, and failing to respond to grievances as they were submitted, Respondent's behavior ballooned the costs of the proceedings exponentially. Accordingly,\n   we reduce the costs assessed against Respondent to $20,580.48, which shall be paid within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this opinion. RGDP 6.16\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

We order that he be disbarred from the practice of law, his name be stricken from the roll of attorneys, and he pay the costs of this proceeding in the amount of $20,580.48. Pursuant to RGDP 9.1, Respondent is required within twenty (20) days to notify all clients, via certified mail, of his inability to represent them and the necessity to promptly retain new counsel. Respondent is also required to withdraw from all pending cases and file an affidavit stating his compliance with RGDP 9.1 and a list of clients notified with both the Clerk of the Supreme Court and the Professional Responsibility Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    RESPONDENT IS DISBARRED AND ORDERED TO PAY COSTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Wyrick, V.C.J., Winchester, Edmondson, Reif, Darby, JJ., concur;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Gurich, C.J., Combs, J., recused;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Kauger, Colbert, JJ., not participating.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    In this order, the Trial Panel specifically considered our analysis of RGDP 6.4 in\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
