We hold that Encanto is not a \"manager\" of land used for recreational purposes and therefore it is not immune from liability under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Encanto operates an amusement park in an area of Encanto Park known as Picnic Island. In 1991, the City of Phoenix (the \"City\") and Encanto's predecessor executed a concessionaire agreement (the \"Agreement\") to establish the amusement park wherein the City licensed certain exclusive rights to construct, maintain, and operate children's rides within a fenced-in area of Picnic Island known as Enchanted Island. The Agreement also allowed Encanto's predecessor to use an unfenced portion of Picnic Island adjacent to Enchanted Island known as the \"pi\u00f1ata area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 There is no dispute that the Agreement governs Encanto's relationship with the City. Encanto's owner testified in a deposition that for twenty-five years, pursuant to the Agreement, he maintained Picnic Island, including the pi\u00f1ata area, by patrolling, maintaining, inspecting, preparing, and grooming the grounds. Although Encanto has been responsible for the pi\u00f1ata area's maintenance, it does not have exclusive rights to use the pi\u00f1ata area, nor does it otherwise control public access to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Normandin paid Encanto $287 for a \"Pete's Package\" to host her daughter's first birthday party at Enchanted Island. Pete's Package included all-day-ride wristbands for partygoers, as well as tables and a four-hour pavilion reservation. Although Encanto allowed customers to bring a pi\u00f1ata to their party if they broke it outside the fenced-in Enchanted Park, the package agreement explicitly stated that Encanto would not provide a pi\u00f1ata for the party and that no portion of Normandin's payment would be refunded if she declined to participate in a pi\u00f1ata activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Normandin brought a pi\u00f1ata to the party and Encanto accommodated her, as it did its other customers, by directing her to the public pi\u00f1ata area adjacent to the fenced-in Enchanted Park. An Encanto employee also led Normandin to the pi\u00f1ata area, hung the pi\u00f1ata for her from a tree outfitted for such purpose, and raised and lowered the pi\u00f1ata as the partygoers tried to break it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 While walking through the pi\u00f1ata area, Normandin fell, breaking her ankle and injuring her arm. She alleged she fell because she stepped into a sprinkler-head divot or depression covered by grass. In her complaint, Normandin pleaded a single count of premises liability, a simple negligence claim, against the City and Encanto. Encanto and the City moved for summary judgment based on the recreational use immunity provided by \u00a7 33-1551(A). The trial court granted the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the City and Encanto, concluding that (1) Encanto is immune as a \"manager\" under \u00a7 33-1551(A) ; (2) Normandin was a \"recreational user\" under \u00a7 33-1551(A) ; (3) the statute does not violate the anti-abrogation clause of\n   article 18, section 6 of the Arizona Constitution (as applied to Encanto); (4) the statute does not violate the equal privileges and immunities clause of article 2, section 13 of the Arizona Constitution (as applied to Encanto); and (5) the statute is not an unconstitutional special law as applied to managers of defined land in compliance with article 4, part 2, section 19(13), (20) of the Arizona Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Normandin v.

We are unpersuaded by Encanto's reasoning that its mere maintenance of the pi\u00f1ata area qualifies it as a \"manager\" under \u00a7 33-1551(A), and we also find the court of appeals' reliance on a dictionary definition of \"manager\" insufficient to discern its proper statutory meaning.\n   <em>\n    Normandin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=245%20Ariz.%2067\">\n    245 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   72-73 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569725\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/243/\">\n    425 P.3d at 248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

State Senate Fact Sheet for S.B. 1229, 50th Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Apr. 14, 2011)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (stating that the amendment \"[c]larifies that tenants and managers of public and private land are among those landowners and lessees that are not liable to a recreational or educational user who engages in prescribed activities on their premises\"). The 2011 amendments also modified the statutory definition of \"recreational user\" to include \"persons engaging in off-highway vehicle, off-road recreational motor vehicle, all-terrain vehicle, other outdoor recreational pursuits and operation of aircraft\" (each of which often occur on state land) and clarified that the State Land Department's issuance of recreational permits or \"off-highway vehicle indicia\" to recreational users for such purposes did not impact the statute's immunity provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1484229\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/179/283/#p286\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, to the extent the legislative history analogizes \"managers\" to \"landowners\" and \"lessees\" and otherwise associates the term with the State Land Department's management of state lands, it refutes any notion that \"manager\" was included to extend recreational use immunity to someone who lacks authority to open land for recreational use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Here, applying our definition of \"manager,\" we conclude that Encanto does not qualify as such under the recreational use statute. Encanto contends that it is a \"manager\" because it patrols, maintains, inspects, prepares, and grooms the pi\u00f1ata area. But Encanto's relationship with the City belies Encanto's claim to any managerial status; it merely maintains the pi\u00f1ata area and pays the City as part of its concession. It is also clear from paragraph 41 of the Agreement that Encanto is an independent contractor-a licensee and not a lessee-and the parties have no other relationship beyond the contours of the Agreement. Indeed, \"manager\" is never mentioned in the Agreement. More importantly, although Encanto is required to maintain the premises, including the pi\u00f1ata area, as noted above, it lacks any authority to open or close the pi\u00f1ata area for recreational use. The City, not Encanto, has this authority. Finally, if Encanto's broader definition of \"manager\" were correct, any independent contractor (e.g., landscaper, sprinkler repairer, tree-trimmer, or groundskeeper) would be a \"manager,\" thus enlarging the class of persons granted immunity beyond the purpose of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 The text, purpose, and legislative history of \u00a7 33-1551, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , and our imperative to narrowly construe the statute, support our conclusion that a person or entity does not qualify as a \"manager\" in the absence of authority to open or close land for recreational use. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Encanto and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We vacate paragraphs 1 and 11 through 42 of the court of appeals' opinion pertaining to Encanto but leave intact the part of the opinion affirming summary judgment for the City of Phoenix.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
