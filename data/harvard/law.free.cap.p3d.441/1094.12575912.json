FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   \u00b61 On October 29, 2017, the defendant/appellee, Jake Watkins, was driving under the influence of alcohol and rear-ended a vehicle owned and operated by the plaintiff/appellant, Lee McIntosh. Mr. McIntosh's vehicle was damaged and he and the former co-plaintiff, Anthony McIntosh, were injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both vehicles pulled over to the shoulder of the road and the parties exited their vehicles to discuss the accident and to inspect the damage. At some point Mr. McIntosh stated he needed to call the police to report the accident. When Mr. Watkins heard this he returned to his vehicle and fled the scene without providing Mr. McIntosh the information required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    47 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 10-104 (name, address, vehicle registration number and, upon request, show a driver license and security verification form). Mr. Watkins was later arrested and charged with two counts: 1) driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol; and 2) leaving the scene of an accident involving damage in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    47 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 10-103. He pled no contest to the two counts and received a deferred judgment and sentence on March 9, 2018, in Case No. CM-2017-902, Pottawatomie County, State of Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b62 On June 15, 2018, Mr. McIntosh signed a settlement agreement which settled all of his bodily injury claims for the sum of $25,000.00. Mr. McIntosh was also paid $17,545.66 to fully repair his vehicle and an additional $7,000.00 for the diminution of value claim. The only remaining issue left to be decided by the trial court was whether Mr. McIntosh was entitled to receive treble damages for the damage sustained to his vehicle. Mr. Watkins filed a motion for partial summary judgment which was later converted to a motion for summary judgment considering there was only one remaining issue to be decided. On August 16, 2018, a hearing was held and the trial court ruled Mr. McIntosh was not entitled to treble damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    47 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 10-103, due to the fact he had incurred not only property damage to his vehicle but he also sustained a nonfatal injury.

In Mr. McIntosh's response to the motion for summary judgment he denied Mr. Watkin's statement of undisputed material facts that Mr. McIntosh had sustained and was treated for bodily injury. However, he limited this denial only as to the relevancy of that fact to the issue presented. Both his petition and amended petition clearly stated the automobile accident caused him bodily injury. There remain no genuine issues of material fact in dispute that would prohibit summary judgment. The issue before this Court is purely a question of law concerning what damages a plaintiff is entitled to receive when he or she is involved in a hit-and-run accident involving both property damage and bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Mr. McIntosh seeks treble property damage.

The obvious public policy behind the treble damages provision is to provide an added level of deterrence against hit-and-run drivers who damage attended vehicles. The term \"nonfatal injury\" is also not defined in Chapter 10. This deterrence would ring hollow if a victim was prevented from bringing a civil action for treble damages just because they also suffered an injury, no matter how minor the injury. Our interpretation avoids the absurd result of barring an award of treble damages for a hit-and-run accident involving an attended vehicle when the victim was also injured.

It plainly says that treble damages may be sought against \"any person violating the provisions of\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    section.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    It says nothing about violations of other sections, and those other sections say nothing about treble damages. The only relevant question is thus whether Jake Watkins violated section 10-103.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b62 The majority never answers that question.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    It instead assumes that Watkins violated a different section, but concludes that despite what the Legislature said, it actually meant that the treble-damages provision applies to \"any person violating the provisions of this section\n    <em>\n     or any other section\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b63 The majority arrives at this counter-textual conclusion by employing an all-too-familiar interpretive device: when a statute doesn't say what the Court thinks it ought to say, it declares the statute ambiguous and then, under the guise of ascertaining \"legislative intent,\" resolves the so-called ambiguity by assigning to the statute whatever meaning aligns with the Court's policy preferences.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b64 This isn't the interpretation of a statute; it's the drafting and codifying of a statute. This conflation of judicial and legislative roles raises serious separation-of-powers concerns that ought to give us pause. I respectfully dissent, and write separately to urge the Court to abandon its atextual interpretive approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b65 The majority declares that \" \u00a7 10-103 is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and is therefore ambiguous,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    but it never quite explains how this is so, other than to point to Mr. McIntosh's entirely unsubstantiated claim that the Legislature probably intended for treble damages to be available for all hit-and-run accidents. That claim, however, tells us nothing about the clarity of the text. It is instead made in an attempt to avoid the plain text, which is neither unclear nor susceptible to more than one meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \u00b66 The first sentences of sections 10-102, 10-102.1, and 10-103 describe the sort of accident to which each section applies. Section 10-102 applies to \"accident[s] resulting in a nonfatal injury to any person.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Section 10-102.1 applies to \"accident[s] resulting in the death of any person.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Section 10-103 applies to \"accident[s] resulting only in damage to a vehicle which is driven or attended by any person.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    \u00b67 Each section then imposes certain duties upon a driver involved in such an accident and describes the criminal penalties available for failure to comply with those duties. Violators of section 10-103 can be charged with a misdemeanor, while violators of sections 10-102 and 10-102.1 can be charged with a felony.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    \u00b68 Section 10-103 then contains a civil remedy provision that the other two sections lack: \"In addition to the criminal penalties imposed by\n    <em>\n     this section\n    </em>\n    , any person violating the provisions of\n    <em>\n     this section\n    </em>\n    shall be subject to liability for damages in an amount equal to three times the value of the damage caused by the accident. Said damages shall be recoverable in a civil action.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Legislature was quite clear with the words they chose for this treble-damages provision. It applies to \"any person violating the provisions of\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    section,\" and as explained above, \"this section\" is the section that applies to accidents \"resulting only in damage to a vehicle,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    as opposed to accidents resulting in only personal injury or resulting in both damage to a vehicle and personal injury.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Legislature's decision to omit this treble-damages provision from the sections governing accidents resulting in personal injury leaves no doubt that the Legislature intended it to apply only to violations of section 10-103.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    \u00b69 Again, the majority never explains how this text is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation, nor can I imagine any reasonable way to read \"this section\" as actually saying \"this section\n    <em>\n     or any other section\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    The majority offers a recitation of the statute's history, but everything about that history undermines, rather than strengthens, the majority's claim of ambiguity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    It is true that the relevant sections of law were once combined into a single section of law that the Legislature later split into separate sections, each governing a particular type of accident-i.e., accidents \"resulting only in damage to a vehicle which is driven or attended by any person\" ( section 10-103 ), accidents \"resulting in a nonfatal injury\" ( section 10-102 ), and accidents \"resulting in the death of any person\" ( section 10-102.1 ). The fact, however, that the Legislature added the treble damages\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    splitting the sections apart, and added the treble damages to only one section while specifying that it applied to that section only, is slam-dunk evidence that the Legislature intended treble damages to be available exclusively for violations of section 10-103.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    \u00b610 Because section 10-103 is not ambiguous, our duty is to put aside any concerns we may have with the policy articulated by the text and to apply the statute precisely as drafted and enacted by the Legislature and as approved by the Governor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    If the Legislature wishes to rethink its treble-damages policy, it can do so through the procedures for making new law that are mandated by our Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    II.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    \u00b611 The majority next seeks to avoid the plain meaning of section 10-103 by declaring that the plain meaning is \"absurd,\" a finding that the majority believes goes hand in hand with its finding of ambiguity. But it should go without saying that the text of a statute cannot simultaneously be ambiguous and absurd. An ambiguous statute, after all, is one that is susceptible to more than one\n    <em>\n     reasonable\n    </em>\n    meaning.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    If a statute can be read one way that is quite reasonable, but another way that is quite absurd, then by definition it is not ambiguous. That is why the absurdity canon \"should not be confused with a useful technique for resolving ambiguities in statutory language\" because it \"properly 'applies to\n    <em>\n     unambiguous\n    </em>\n    statutes.' \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    \u00b612 Even when applicable, the absurdity canon provides a very narrow exception to our duty to apply the plain meaning of a statute, \"where the result of applying the plain language would be, in a genuine sense, absurd,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    where it is quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended the result\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    -conditions that are not met here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    As Chief Justice John Marshall explained almost two centuries ago, \"if, in any case, the plain meaning of a provision, ... is to be disregarded, because we believe the framers of that instrument could not intend what they say, it must be one in which the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case, would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \u00b613 The absurdity canon is thus an escape hatch to be opened only in the rarest of cases where the text leads to \" 'patently absurd consequences' that [the Legislature] could not\n    <em>\n     possibly\n    </em>\n    have intended,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    rather than in cases where the Court merely thinks a policy embodied in a statute is unwise. An oft-cited example of a statute that would fit the bill is one that provides that the \"winning party\" rather than the \"losing party\" must pay the other side's reasonable attorney's fees.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    As the Tenth Circuit has put it, in such a case:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    the error in the statute is so \"unthinkable\" that any reasonable reader would know immediately both (1) that it contains a \"technical or ministerial\" mistake, and (2) the correct meaning of the text. When these demanding conditions are met, a court may invoke the [absurdity] doctrine to enforce the statute's plain meaning, much as it might in cases where a modifier is misplaced or the grammar otherwise mangled but the meaning plain to any reasonable reader. Cabined in this way, the absurdity doctrine seeks to serve a \"linguistic rather than substantive\" function, and does not depend nearly as much on doubtful claims about legislative intentions, risk nearly as much interference with the separation of powers, or pose anything like the same sort of fair notice problems as its more virulent cousin. Instead, it aims only to enforce a meaning reasonable parties would have thought plain all along.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \u00b614 Nothing about this case fits that bill. As its basis for declaring absurdity, the majority merely concludes that it makes sense to have treble damages available in all cases and that, as such, the Legislature could not possibly have intended to enact a statute that did anything else:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    The obvious public policy behind the treble damages provision is to provide an added level of deterrence against hit-and-run drivers who damage attended vehicles.... This deterrence would ring hollow if a victim was prevented from bringing a civil action for treble damages just because they also suffered an injury, no matter how minor the injury. Our interpretation avoids the absurd result of barring an award of treble damages for a hit-and-run accident involving an attended vehicle when the victim was also injured. We do not believe the legislative intent behind the later enacted treble damages provision was to limit this provision to accidents where there are no injuries.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Not only is this conclusion not remotely sufficient as a basis for invoking the absurdity canon, it is also incorrect. The treble damages provision may well provide a theoretical\n    level of deterrence to hit-and-run drivers who damage attended vehicles, and that may well be why the Legislature added the provision. But it is not true that deterrence would ring hollow if treble damages were not permitted in personal injury cases. First, the deterrent effect in property damage cases is not diminished by the unavailability of treble damages in other cases. Second, whatever deterrent effect that exists likely carries over to those other cases because a fleeing hit-and-run driver cannot know for certain whether anyone was injured. So in the world imagined by the majority where potential hit-and-run drivers are actually aware of the treble-damages provision such that it might deter them from fleeing, a rational driver would have to assume that he will be subject to treble damages until he knows for certain that he will not be. And the only way to know that is to stop, rather than run.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \u00b615 Nor is it true there is no rational explanation for omitting the treble-damages provision from the personal-injury sections. It is certainly possible that the Legislature declined to add the treble-damages provision to the personal-injury-accident sections because more than adequate financial deterrents are available in the personal-injury context, where the negligent driver can be sued for non-economic and punitive damages. So the deterrence wouldn't \"ring hollow\" in the personal injury context if treble property damages were unavailable, but rather would flow from\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    civil remedies that are available to the injured party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    \u00b616 In sum, because the majority believes that section 10-103 is ambiguous, the absurdity canon has no place in this case. But even if it did, the majority simply disagrees with the policy choice embodied by the plain language of section 10-103, and that sort of disagreement does not come close to triggering the absurdity canon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b617 These misapplications of the ambiguity and absurdity doctrines are symptomatic of an atextual interpretive approach that repeatedly rears its head in cases where the plain meaning of a statute strikes a majority of this Court as unwise. I fear that this atextual approach invites criticism that the Court has lost its way as an institution devoted to merely saying what the law is, rather than what it ought to be.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b618 No doubt, the Court sometimes properly emphasizes that determining the meaning of a statute \"begins with the text of the statute and-absent unresolvable ambiguity-ends with the text\" and that its job \"is to determine the ordinary meaning of the words that the Legislature chose in the provisions of law at issue.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    But in cases where the plain meaning of the text leads to a result the Court does not like, the Court changes the question from \"What did the Legislature enact?\" to \"What did the Legislature intend?\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    -a shift in interpretive approach that opens the door to the Court injecting its policy\n    preferences under the guise of ascertaining the Legislature's intent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    \u00b619 The hodgepodge interpretive standard invoked by the majority demonstrates how this is so. The majority first declares that \"the primary goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and to apply the\n    <em>\n     intent\n    </em>\n    of the Legislature that enacted the statute,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    thus shifting the inquiry away from ascertaining what law the Legislature actually enacted, in favor of ascertaining what law the Legislature intended to require. This might be less problematic if the Court simply undertook to cold-bloodedly ascertain the Legislature's intent, letting the chips fall where they may. But that is not what the Court does. It instead seeks to ascertain an intent that is \"reasonable and sensible\" (or not \"absurd\"),\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    which transforms the inquiry away from determining the\n    <em>\n     Legislature's\n    </em>\n    intent and toward determining what the\n    <em>\n     Court\n    </em>\n    would have intended were it the lawmaker.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    And because the majority views the text of the statute as merely one of many pieces of evidence-and a piece that can seemingly be discarded altogether once a declaration of ambiguity is made-the Court finds itself entirely unconstrained in assigning to the Legislature the intent of its choosing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \u00b620 None of this would be possible if the Court properly focused on the text. The text is what was read aloud and debated on the legislative floor, approved by majority vote, and sent to the Governor for executive approval, all per the \"single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\" our Constitution commands.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    The text of the statute isn't mere evidence of what the law is, it\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    the law, and it is the sole legitimate expression of the\n    <em>\n     Legislature's\n    </em>\n    intent. If the law is not the words that the Legislature enacted, but rather whatever intent resided in the minds of this legislator or that, then we need not bother with statute books because the law resides elsewhere, perhaps up in the clouds where if only we stare long enough we will see the law we want to see. But fundamental to due process is notice of what the law is. Our citizens must know where to look to find the law, and they should be able to expect that the law means what it plainly says. A system of laws that requires our citizens to read the minds of legislators (or judges) in order to know the law is a system of laws that is fundamentally incompatible with American notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    \u00b621 Today's decision is a three-card-monte-like application of ambiguity, absurdity, and intentionalism to reach a result that was fully baked: treble damages for everyone. What this case demonstrates is that it is all too easy to craft perfectly logical and sound policies from the isolation of judicial chambers. Legislators, however, labor in protester-filled hallways, lobbyist-filled offices, and legislator-filled\n    chamber floors, where \"often and by design it is 'hard-fought compromise[ ],' not cold logic, that supplies the solvent needed for a bill to survive the legislative process.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    As such, \"[i]f courts felt free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal, we would risk failing to 'tak[e] ... account of' legislative compromises essential to a law's passage and, in that way, thwart rather than honor 'the effectuation of [legislative] intent.' \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     30\n    </footnotemark>\n    Today's majority has done just that.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    \u00b622 For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-83\">\n     See supra note 2.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-84\">\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n      47 O.S. 2011\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , \u00a7 10-102.1 :\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n     A.

This seems unusual, given that in his criminal case Watkins was convicted of violating section 10-103 pursuant to his plea of no contest. Watkins, however, is not precluded from litigating the issue in this subsequent civil suit because section 513 of Oklahoma's Code of Criminal Procedure directs that nolo contendere (\"no-contest\") pleas \"not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.\" 22 O.S.2011 \u00a7 513. Because he is free to do so, Watkins now argues that section 10-103 is not violated when an accident involves personal injury because section 10-103 governs only \"accident[s] resulting only in damage to a vehicle.\" In Watkins's view, his accident didn't involve \"only\" damage to a vehicle; therefore he cannot have violated section 10-103. This is correct. Section 10-103 is a separate and distinct offense from the offenses found in sections 102 and 102.1. The State of Oklahoma has previously argued as much with respect to this offense,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Palmer v.
