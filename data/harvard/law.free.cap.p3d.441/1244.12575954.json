Against this backdrop, we decide whether, given the particulars of this case, equitable tolling applies to FELA's limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2012 and 2014, Karl Langlois suffered injuries while working for BNSF Railway Company in Washington State. Langlois, a Washington resident, filed suit against\n   BNSF, a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Texas. He did so in Oregon state court, claiming negligence under FELA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   BNSF moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Oregon trial court denied the motion. Later, the Oregon Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court issued rulings under which it became clear that Oregon courts lacked personal jurisdiction over BNSF in Langlois's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Langlois then filed an action in Washington with the same allegations. BNSF moved for summary judgment, arguing that FELA's three-year limitations period had expired. Langlois conceded that the period had expired, but argued for the court to apply equitable tolling. The trial court accepted his argument and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Because the policy considerations underlying FELA support equitable tolling\n   here and Langlois meets the diligence and extraordinary circumstance elements of the doctrine, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A. Oregon Complaint\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On December 30, 2014, Langlois filed a FELA action against BNSF in Oregon state court. The complaint alleged negligence arising from two injuries Langlois suffered while working for BNSF in Washington. The injuries occurred on January 25, 2012 and February 24, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 BNSF moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction on April 10, 2015. It argued an Oregon court could not exercise general personal jurisdiction consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause because its contacts with Oregon did not render it \"at home\" in the state. Langlois opposed\n   the motion, contending that section 56 of FELA\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   conferred personal jurisdiction over BNSF. On June 5, 2015, the Oregon trial court denied the motion to dismiss, determining BNSF's \"uniquely long history of operations within the state\" allowed general jurisdiction over it in accordance with the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 BNSF then petitioned the Oregon Supreme Court for an alternative writ of mandamus, claiming the trial court erred in denying its motion. The court denied the petition on August 6, 2015. BNSF then filed its answer to Langlois's complaint and the parties proceeded toward trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 On May 5, 2016, in a separate case,\n   <em>\n    Barrett v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Oregon Supreme Court issued an alternative writ of mandamus to address the same issue raised by BNSF's earlier petition-whether, in a FELA case, an Oregon court could exercise general jurisdiction over a railroad in connection with out-of-state activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20Or.%20526\">\n    359 Or. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=379%20P.3d%20521\">\n    379 P.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   I ).

And I think\n   that the court denied their motion for summary judgment and had been for some time because that was sort of the practice. And I think it was an unusual or extraordinary circumstance when all of a sudden the court reversed itself and decided that section, I think it's 65,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   is not -- is a venue statute, it doesn't confer personal jurisdiction and it did change -- it did change the case law with regard to whether or not you could bring cases in states where the injury didn't occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I think balancing the equities, I believe that equitable tolling should apply here, and I am going to deny the motion to dismiss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 BNSF then moved for certification under RAP 2.3(b)(4), which motion the trial\n   court granted.

Langlois had a reasonable basis for believing Oregon courts had jurisdiction over BNSF at the time he filed his complaint. As stated above, the Oregon trial court in Langlois's case and other courts found jurisdiction when considering similar situations.

First, it considered a situation where the plaintiff made a clear mistake of law as opposed to a situation where the law lacked clarity at the time the plaintiff filed their lawsuit. Second, the case concerned a\n   defective class, not a defective pleading-such as a complaint filed in the wrong venue or jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v.

While a defective class raises issues regarding class tolling, a defective pleading relates to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    Menominee\n   </em>\n   I,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222075\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/99/#p108\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Menominee\n   </em>\n   I, because of a mistake of law, failed to file a complaint or take any other legal action before the limitations period expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222075\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/99/#p108\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a mistake amounts to no more than garden variety excusable neglect. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Menominee\n   </em>\n   II differs significantly from Langlois's situation, as he was not neglectful but rather, due to a lack of legal clarity, reasonably\n   filed his complaint in the wrong forum within the limitations period. Thus, the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Menominee\n   </em>\n   II does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 35 Instead, Langlois's case more closely resembles\n   <em>\n    Burnett\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court held that equitable tolling applied during the pendency of a FELA action brought in an improper venue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525353\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/424/#p427\">\n    380 U.S. at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525353\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/424/#p427\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
