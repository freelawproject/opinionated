Without notifying the lawyer who was representing defendant on the pending charges, the officers arranged for the other inmate to secretly record defendant in a conversation about his new criminal activity, and the state later charged defendant with multiple new offenses arising out of that new criminal activity. The Court of Appeals held that the recorded questioning violated defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\" and precludes the state from using defendant's incriminating statements to convict him of the new offenses. We disagree. We conclude that defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel, which arose because of the initially pending charges, was not a right to limited police scrutiny of new criminal activity in which defendant was engaging to illegally undermine the pending charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of the recorded conversation, defendant was represented by counsel on multiple pending charges arising out of an earlier incident in which he engaged in a shootout with police at an Astoria motel,\n   followed by an extended, high-speed car chase. When defendant's fellow inmate reported that defendant had offered him money and weapons to assault the prosecutor and to murder two of the state's witnesses, law enforcement officers used the information to obtain sealed,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   court orders that authorized them to record the conversations between defendant and the informant. During those recorded conversations, defendant discussed his plans for the new criminal activity, but he also discussed the pending case.\n   A grand jury later amended defendant's existing indictment to add charges for offenses arising out of the new criminal activity, including two counts of conspiracy to commit murder of \"another human being who was a witness in a criminal proceeding, *** related to the performance of official duties of [the witness] in the justice system,\" and one count of conspiracy to commit first degree assault against the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence that the state obtained through the recorded conversations, arguing that the questioning violated his Article I, section 11, right to counsel because the officers had failed to notify defendant's attorney before directing the informant to question him. The trial court granted defendant's motion with respect to statements that defendant made about \"anything related to\" the original charges, on which he had been represented by counsel at the time of the questioning, but the court refused to suppress defendant's statements about the new criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The new and original charges were tried together, and the state relied on defendant's statements about the new criminal activity as evidence that he was guilty of all of the charged offenses. The jury convicted defendant of the charges arising out of the original criminal activity as well as the conspiracy charges arising out of the new criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, defendant assigned error to the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress, renewing his argument that the state obtained his statements about the new criminal activity in violation of his Article I, section 11, right to counsel. While defendant's appeal was pending, this court decided\n   <em>\n    State v. Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    359 Or. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), which held that the defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel protected him during\n   police questioning about other, uncharged criminal activity because it was \"objectively reasonably foreseeable that the questioning [would] lead to incriminating evidence concerning the offense for which the defendant has obtained counsel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals agreed with defendant that the questioning violated his Article I, section 11, right to counsel, and concluded that the trial court's failure to suppress the resulting statements required reversal of defendant's convictions for both the new charges and some of the original charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We allowed the state's petition for review to consider whether the Court of Appeals correctly reversed defendant's convictions on the charges arising out of his new criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On review, the state does not dispute that \"it was reasonably foreseeable that questioning\n   about defendant's new conspiracy crimes would incriminate him for the originally charged crimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that concession, defendant understandably argues that\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   supports the Court of Appeals' conclusions that the state violated defendant's right to counsel and that the resulting evidence must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, the question we ultimately must answer is whether Article I, section 11, guarantees a right to counsel during police questioning about the kind of new, uncharged\n   criminal activity in which defendant was engaged. Answering that question is more complicated than simply asking if the test that we articulated in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   can be applied to the police questioning in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , we were not called upon to consider whether Article I, section 11, protects a defendant from police inquiry into new criminal activity in progress, and we now conclude that the right does not extend that far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When construing a provision of the original Oregon Constitution, which includes the Article I, section 11, right to counsel, we consider \"the text in its context, the historical circumstances of the adoption of the provision, and the case law that has construed it[,]\" with the goal of identifying \"the meaning most likely understood by those who adopted the provision\" and, in light of that meaning, identifying \"relevant underlying principles that may inform our application of the constitutional text to modern circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Given the principles that underlie our modern understanding of the Article I, section 11, right to counsel, and given the nature of defendant's new criminal activity, we conclude that police were not required to provide notice to the attorney representing defendant on the pending charges before inquiring about his new, uncharged and ongoing conspiracy to illegally undermine the pending charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Text and Evolving Construction of the Article I, section 11, Right to Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   extensively considered the historical circumstances surrounding the adoption of Article I, section 11, and the case law construing it. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , the Article I, section 11, guarantee of counsel \"-like its federal counterpart, the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution-was originally understood to apply only to the conduct of criminal trials.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    359 Or. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That focus on protecting a defendant's right to counsel at trial produces important limits on the protection that Article I, section 11, affords, as\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   highlights. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   was involved in an incident in Portland in which Mansell was beaten and had his automobile and credit cards stolen. Initially, however, the defendant was arrested in Eugene after using one of Mansell's stolen credit cards and was charged only for that offense.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    672 P.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without notice to the attorney representing defendant on the credit-card offense, detectives in Portland interrogated the defendant about an unrelated murder and robbery of a different victim, Davidson, as well as about the assault on Mansell.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the defendant was later prosecuted for the offenses against Davidson, he sought to suppress evidence from the interrogation as obtained in violation of his right to counsel under Article I, section 11.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    672 P.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However,\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   's holding with respect to the Davidson offenses clarified that a defendant's right to the assistance of counsel in the prosecution of pending criminal charges is not so broad that it covers questions about all uncharged criminal activity. Finally, the court's ability to harmonize the two propositions illustrates that, in a single interrogation, the right to counsel may extend protection for some purposes but not others, depending on the extent to which the question will lead to \"incriminating evidence or statements for use in the prosecution\" of the offense to which the right to counsel has attached.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 93,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    672 P.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The issue in dispute is whether defendant's new criminal activity is the kind of uncharged criminal activity that falls beyond the boundary of Article I, section 11, protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   was this court's first attempt to identify the location of the line between questions about uncharged offenses to which the protection of Article I, section 11, extends and questions about other uncharged offenses to which Article I, section 11, extends no protection.

But there is a fundamental difference between preserving counsel's effectiveness in defending against the charged offenses and erecting barriers to police inquiry into a new, uncharged and ongoing conspiracy to illegally undermine the pending charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the purpose of Article I, section 11, right to counsel, nor the concerns that\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   emphasized in fashioning\n   a test to protect that right, support the dissent's rule that defendant's right to counsel on pending charges included a right to be assisted by counsel in his conspiracy to defeat the pending charges by committing murder and assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We, thus, conclude that the Article I, section 11, right to counsel on pending charges does not guarantee that the state will provide notice to a defendant's attorney before questioning the defendant about a new, uncharged and ongoing conspiracy to harm witnesses to a pending prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the dissent expresses concern that this will be construed as a test dependent on the subjective intent of the questioning officer, it is not a subjective test. 364 Or. at 829-30, 441 P.3d at ---- (Duncan, J., dissenting). Rather, the subject matter of the questions, not the subjective intent of the officer, determines whether the officer is permissibly\n   questioning a defendant about details of a new, ongoing conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Application of the Rule to this Case.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court of Appeals followed the test that we articulated in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   to conclude that the police violated defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel when they used an informant to question him about his conspiracy to harm the prosecutor and witnesses against him on the pending charges, because that is the kind of criminal activity that tends to incriminate a defendant with respect to pending charges. But we have concluded that the scope of the protection guaranteed by Article I, section 11, does not reach so broadly. Thus, the trial court did not err in allowing the state to use defendant's statements to prosecute him for the new criminal activity. On that issue, we disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court of Appeals also reversed and remanded some of defendant's convictions on the original charges, because the trial court allowed the state to use defendant's uncounseled statements about the new crimes to prosecute him for those original offenses. The premise of the court's ruling was that the statements were obtained in violation of defendant's right to counsel and, thus, must\n   be excluded. This court declined to review the issue that the state raised in challenge to that ruling. However, a different issue arises from our conclusion that police did not violate defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel when they questioned him about the new criminal activity. Because that conclusion rejects the premise of the Court of Appeals' ruling that the statements must be excluded, we expect that questions about that ruling almost certainly will arise in a retrial of the original charges, so we briefly address the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although defendant's right to counsel on the original, pending charges did not prevent the state from questioning him about his new criminal activity, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court erred in allowing the state to use defendant's statements to prosecute him for the original charges.

There is also no dispute that it was reasonably foreseeable that the questioning would lead to incriminating evidence concerning the pending charges. Indeed, the state expressly concedes the questioning \"violated the\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   rule, because it was reasonably foreseeable that questioning about defendant's new *** crimes would incriminate him for the originally charged crimes.\" Under this court's precedents, the questioning violated defendant's Article I, section 11, rights as to the pending charges. And, the state so concedes, stating that \"the questioning risked circumventing defendant's right to counsel in his pending prosecution and thus violated his right to counsel for the original charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nevertheless, the majority holds otherwise. 364 Or. at 819-20, 441 P.3d 557. It holds that the questioning did not violate defendant's Article I, section 11, rights. In doing so, it departs from this court's prior cases and the constitutional principles that underlie them in order reach its preferred result given the particular facts of this case. It offers no principled reason for its result. Instead, as explained below, it attempts to distinguish this case from this court's precedents based on differences that are irrelevant to the legal issue, which is whether the questioning could implicate the defendant in the charged crimes. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As the majority recounts, defendant was initially charged with crimes relating to a shootout and a car chase, and counsel was appointed to represent defendant on those charges. While defendant was in jail, the police-acting through an informant-questioned him. The questioning concerned defendant's offer to pay the informant to assault the prosecutor and murder witnesses in defendant's pending case. 364 Or. at 804-05, 441 P.3d at ----. Thus, the questioning was relevant to whether defendant was attempting to obstruct the prosecution of the charged crimes. That, in turn, was relevant to whether defendant committed the charged crimes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    State v. Barone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"126511\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/329/210/#p238\">\n    329 Or. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"126511\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/329/210/#p238\">\n    986 P.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (holding that a letter that could be construed as an attempt to tamper with a witness was relevant to the defendant's consciousness of guilt). The police knew that defendant's answers to the questions could incriminate him on the charged crimes. And, in fact, that is how the state used defendant's answers. After the police questioned defendant, the state obtained an amended indictment against defendant to include new charges relating to his efforts to interfere with the prosecution of the initial charges. All the charges were tried together, and the state used the evidence it obtained as a result of the questioning to prove both the initial charges and the subsequent charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the police and prosecutor recognized, the initially charged crimes and the subsequently charged crimes were related, because evidence that defendant was involved\n   in the latter would incriminate him on the former. Therefore, it is striking that the majority bases its result, in part, on the notion that the two sets of crimes are not sufficiently related. 364 Or. at 812-14, 441 P.3d at ----. That is not a view that anyone has, or reasonably could, take in this case. When a police officer questions a defendant about whether he has taken steps to conceal a\n   charged crime \"it is objectively reasonably foreseeable that the questioning will lead to incriminating evidence\" about the charged crime.\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , 359 Or. at 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the questioning, arguing that it violated his Article I, section 11, right to counsel. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the charges involving A were different than those involving K and L, noting that they involved \"different times and different victims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On review, this court reversed.

Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , the test for whether questioning violates a defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel is \"whether *** it is reasonably foreseeable to a person in the position of the questioner that questioning will elicit incriminating information involving the charged offense for which the defendant has obtained counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"That is an objective test that does not turn on the subjective impression of the questioner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Applying that test, this court held that the challenged questioning violated the defendant's Article I, section 11, rights because \"it was reasonably foreseeable to a person in [the detective's] position, that questioning about K and L would elicit incriminating information about the charged abuse of A.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The majority seems to posit that, because the uncharged crimes in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   were factually similar to the charged crimes, questions about the uncharged crimes violated the defendant's rights, but because the uncharged crimes in this case were not factually similar to the charged crimes, questions about the uncharged crimes did not violate defendant's rights. The majority states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The facts and circumstances of the charged crime in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   duplicated to a significant extent the earlier, uncharged crimes because, as this court emphasized, all the crimes were committed in the defendant's home, all involved similar types of physical conduct, and all involved child-victims who were members of the defendant's family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Here, by contrast, any duplication between the facts and circumstances of defendant's new criminal activity and the facts of his charged crimes is minimal: the new criminal activity occurred in a different setting, involved different conduct, and involved victims who were targeted for a very different reason.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 813, --- P.3d at ----. But those factual differences are irrelevant to whether the defendant has an interest in having counsel present. A defendant has an interest-which is protected by Article I, section 11-in having counsel present for questioning on subjects relevant to counsel's representation on charged crimes, including questioning about uncharged crimes that could incriminate the defendant on the charged crimes.

The majority bases its holding, in part, on the premise that the right to counsel under Article I, section 11, is a trial right. 364 Or. at 809, 441 P.3d at ----. It is true that Article I, section 11, guarantees an individual the right to counsel at trial. But that is not all that it does. The Article I, section 11, right to counsel is not a hollow right; it does more than merely guarantee a defendant that a lawyer will be present in court when a case is called for trial. As discussed above, it includes the right to have counsel present during adversarial investigative proceedings that are reasonably likely to elicit evidence that the state could use against the defendant in the prosecution of the charged crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    296 Or. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   92 n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    672 P.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There can be no question that the right to an attorney during the investigative stage is at least as important as the right to counsel during the trial itself.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority carves out an exception to that right, based on factual differences that, as explained above, are irrelevant. The majority does so simply because it does not like the effect of the right to counsel in this particular case. It states that defendant's right to counsel \"should not be understood to erect barriers to the police inquiry into defendant's new criminal activity.\" 364 Or. at 816, 441 P.3d at 565.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The majority's concern with the state's ability to investigate and prosecute crimes is understandable; the investigation and prosecution\n   of crimes are essential government functions. But there are limits-constitutional limits-on how the state can perform those functions. Violations of the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to remain silent, the right to counsel, and the right to a jury might be effective investigative and prosecutorial tools, but they are not permissible ones. The constitution guarantees individuals rights and those rights can-and were intended to-restrict the scope of government actions, including actions taken to investigate and prosecute crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Of course, that is not to say that the state cannot investigate and prosecute defendant in this case or a\n   defendant in any other case. The restriction Article I, section 11, imposes is limited. It does not prohibit the police from questioning a defendant. It requires only that, if it is reasonably foreseeable that the questioning will incriminate the defendant on a charge for which the defendant has counsel, that the police notify the defendant's counsel and afford counsel a reasonable opportunity to be present for the questioning. If it is not reasonably foreseeable that the questioning will incriminate the defendant on a charge for which the defendant has counsel, then the questioning can occur without such notice and opportunity to be present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The majority mentions the harm of a blanket prohibition of all questioning of a defendant who has counsel on pending charges. 364 Or. at 817-18, 441 P.3d at ----. But no one is advocating for a blanket prohibition in this case. This court rejected such a prohibition in\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   , the defendant did not argue for one in\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , and defendant is not arguing for one here. Instead, he is arguing for application of the\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That rule creates an objective test for determining whether questioning violates a defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel, which includes the right not to be questioned without counsel on subjects relevant to counsel's representation on charged crimes. Defense counsel's role is to protect the defendant's rights, which themselves are intended to ensure the fairness and integrity of criminal proceedings. Contrary to the suggestion in the majority opinion, defense counsel's role is not to assist a defendant in the commission of crimes. 364 Or. at 819, 441 P.3d at ----.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Article I, section 11, prohibition on questioning without counsel does not depend on an officer's motivation for asking the question. Nevertheless, the majority appears to hold that whether questioning violates a defendant's Article I, section 11, rights depends on the subjective intent of the officer. It reasons that the questioning in this case did not violate defendant's Article I, section 11, rights on the charged crimes because the state was seeking information from defendant to disrupt or prosecute his new criminal activity. 364 Or. at 814, 441 P.3d at ----. Thus, the majority appears to hold that whether a question violates a defendant's\n   Article I, section 11, rights depends on the purpose of the questioning. That approach is inconsistent with this court's precedent, which is concerned with the content, not the purpose of questioning.\n   <em>\n    Prieto-Rubio\n   </em>\n   , 359 Or. at 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n    376 P.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the test for whether questioning violates Article I, section 11, is an objective test).

As I understand it, the majority suggests that, if an officer asks a defendant questions relevant to whether the defendant has attempted to obstruct the prosecution on a charged crime for which the defendant has counsel, whether the questions violate the\n   defendant's Article I, section 11, rights will depend on whether the officer's motivation is to investigate the charged crime or the possible obstruction (or possibly both). Such a test, which permits the state to question a defendant without counsel about subjects that could incriminate him on charged crimes, is antithetical to a defendant's constitutional right to counsel. And, permitting such questioning encourages officers \"to undermine the suspect's decision to rely upon counsel,\" which not only leaves a defendant's rights unprotected, it \"subverts the attorney-client relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Sparklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    296 Or. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641761\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/85/#p93\">\n    672 P.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The state concedes that it should not have joined the initial charges and the subsequent charges in this case and should not do so in future similar cases.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    To be clear, the fact that a charged crime is similar to an uncharged crime is relevant to whether questioning about the latter is likely to incriminate a defendant on the former, as in\n    <em>\n     Prieto-Rubio\n    </em>\n    . But similarity between two crimes is not required for questioning about one to be incriminating about the other. As this court stated in\n    <em>\n     Prieto-Rubio\n    </em>\n    , there are a number of factors which are relevant to whether it is reasonably foreseeable that questioning about uncharged crimes will elicit incriminating information involving a charged crime, including \"temporal proximity, location, nature of defendant's conduct, and the nature of the investigation process itself and whether it involves the same or separate personnel.\" 359 Or. at 36-37,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165774\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/16/#p18\">\n     376 P.3d 255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
