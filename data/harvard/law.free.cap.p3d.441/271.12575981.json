She was 14 at the time of the events at issue. According to AS, on July 4, 2014, she spent the night at Mr. Spence's home. His girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Mickie Spence, was also present. According to AS, that evening the three of them sat around the apartment watching TV, listening to music, and drinking alcoholic beverages. At some point, Mr. Spence went into the bathroom and sent her a text message saying that she was \"so hot.\" AS texted Mr. Spence asking whether he had meant to send the message to Mickie, and he responded that he meant it for AS. Mr. Spence then sent her a picture of his penis and asked that she send him a nude photo of herself. AS initially refused, but Mr. Spence kept pushing the issue telling AS that if she didn't comply, \"something was going to happen.\" AS went into another room and sent him a photo of herself in her bra. She then went out on the porch for a cigarette and was\n   joined by Mr. Spence. The two went back inside, and Mickie went to bed. AS again went outside, and Mr. Spence joined her on the porch. They each had a cigarette and when AS turned to go back inside, Mr. Spence pulled her onto his lap, held her, and kissed her. When he stopped, AS went back inside and sat on the couch. A little later, Mr. Spence came in and sat next to her. He then put one of his hands inside her pants and inserted two fingers in her vagina. AS then got up and again went out on the porch. Mr. Spence did not follow her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] While on the porch, AS received a text from Lane Schmidt, who invited her to his apartment which was nearby. AS went to Mr. Schmidt's where she \"had a drink\" and the two \"had sex.\" AS did not tell Mr. Schmidt about the encounter with Mr. Spence. She stayed at Mr. Schmidt's for about an hour and then returned to the apartment where she went to sleep on the couch. Prior to going to sleep, she and Mr. Spence exchanged texts with AS telling Mr. Spence that he \"needed to go to bed.\" Early the next morning, she called her mother for a ride and left the apartment. She did not tell her mother about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] According to AS, the first person she told about the incident was one of her counselors, Kathryn Saltz. That conversation occurred on August 12, 2014, prior to a scheduled MDT meeting involving AS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the MDT meeting, Ms. Saltz advised the group that she had concerns about AS. Those concerns included \"destructive type behavior with herself,\" her relationship with an eighteen-year-old male (Lane Schmidt), and \"inappropriate sexual stuff between her and her uncle,\" Mr. Spence. Once those concerns were raised, the MDT meeting was terminated and law enforcement was notified. AS was then interviewed by Thermopolis police officer Melanie Kress, a Hot Springs County deputy, and DFS caseworker Christi Preuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] During that interview, AS was questioned about several matters, including her drug and alcohol use, possible involvement in a grass fire, lying to her mother about her whereabouts, association with adult males, self-harming by cutting, and having sex with Mr. Schmidt on July 4, 2014. When AS revealed she had sex with Mr. Schmidt, Officer Kress told her that Mr. Schmidt could be in trouble because he was eighteen years old. In response, AS explained she had sex with Mr. Schmidt because she was drunk and \"Uncle Justin tried to do shit with me.\" During the interview, AS told the officers that Mr. Spence had patted her on the \"butt\" outside her clothing. She denied that Mr. Spence had touched \"her private parts.\" AS was taken into protective custody at the end of the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] Law enforcement interviewed Mr. Spence on August 22, 2014. He told the officers that AS had spent the night at his apartment but denied serving AS alcohol, asking her to send him a nude picture, or touching her inappropriately. He also told the officers that AS had sneaked out of the apartment to have sex with a neighbor. No criminal charges were brought against Mr. Spence at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b68] After a brief period at a group home, AS was admitted to the Wyoming Behavioral Institute (WBI) in Casper for treatment of her emotional and behavioral issues. She was released from WBI in November 2014 and returned to live with her mother. According to one of her counselors, her condition and mindset did not improve and in less than two months AS was admitted to a residential psychiatric treatment facility in Utah. She stayed there for approximately six months. In March 2015, she returned to Thermopolis for a visit and Officer Kress and Ms. Preuit interviewed her again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69] During this interview, AS, for the first time, told the investigators that Mr. Spence had texted her a picture of his penis and demanded that she send him a nude photo of herself. She also told the officers about the kiss on the porch after Mickie went to bed and that, while on the couch, Mr. Spence put\n   his hand up her shorts and inserted his fingers in her vagina. She also stated that after she returned to the apartment, following her visit with Mr. Schmidt, she received a text from Mr. Spence asking why she had slept with Mr. Schmidt and not him. The next day, Mr. Spence told her to delete all of their text messages, and she did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b610] Approximately eight months later, the State initiated criminal proceedings against Mr. Spence, charging him with one count of incest for having sexual contact with his niece, AS, between July 4 and July 5, 2014, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-4-402\">\n    Wyo.

AS was called as a witness by the State early in the trial. She testified about the incident. She was also questioned by the State about her delay in reporting, the inconsistent statements, and various behavioral issues. Those same issues were addressed extensively during cross-examination by defense counsel. Following her testimony, the State called Phillip Archibald, a therapist who counseled AS, as an expert witness. Mr. Archibald testified that he had diagnosed AS with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and, over objection, opined that the PTSD was caused by \"the reported sexual abuse.\" The prosecutor emphasized this testimony during closing argument stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [W]e heard from Phil Archibald who said that that is what he diagnosed her as, and he told you what the symptoms would be. And one of the things that he told you was that the basis for that diagnosis was sexual abuse. And the sexual abuse that he determined was what took place on July 4, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict, and Mr. Spence was sentenced to three to five years in prison with credit for time served. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b611] Mr. Spence objected to admission of the evidence he challenges in this appeal.

Both the prosecutor and defense counsel addressed the issue of delayed reporting and differing statements from AS in their opening statements. AS was the second witness called by the State and the State inquired during direct examination about the prior statements. AS testified that she did not disclose the July 4, 2014 incident at Mr. Spence's apartment until August 12, 2014, which was 39 days after it occurred. Even then, she did not disclose the full extent of the alleged abuse. She did not tell the investigators that Mr. Spence had touched her genitals until March 2015, when she was home on a visit from treatment in Utah. AS testified that she had delayed reporting the full extent of Mr. Spence's abuse because she did not \"want it to blow up\" and \"ruin[ ]\" her family. She explained that, during her treatment in Utah, she learned she \"was allowed to let it out and not feel bad about it.\" During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned AS extensively about her delayed reporting, her emotional and social problems prior to July 4, 2014, and her relationship with Mr. Schmidt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b616] Mr. Archibald was the next witness called by the State. He testified that he counseled AS from October or November 2015 until August 2016. He diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mr. Archibald explained that the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis are: 1) a stressor, which can include physical, emotional, or sexual trauma; 2) intrusive thoughts about the stressor, including \"dreams, flashbacks, ... daily thoughts that can be ... delusional, ... [and] thoughts that take away time;\" and 3) the intrusive thoughts interrupt normal functioning. Mr. Archibald said the symptoms of PTSD can be different in children than in adults. Because children \"aren't able to express what [the] underlying anxiety is,\" they may exhibit behaviors that are not acceptable in school or public, or they may become socially isolated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b617] The following colloquy then occurred between the prosecutor and Mr. Archibald:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. And what specific symptoms of anxiety - of an anxiety or stress disorder would there be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Can it be child abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b618] Defense counsel objected, and the district court addressed the matter in chambers. Among other objections, defense counsel asserted that Mr. Archibald should not be permitted to vouch for AS's credibility. The State said the evidence was not offered to vouch for AS, but to explain her behavior:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: [M]y intention, Your Honor, is to have him ... establish the effects of trauma, which he has started to testify to, and specifically that he counseled and was the therapist for [AS], and what behaviors he saw, because we have had lots of testimony elicited from [AS] regarding her behaviors and her lack of credibility, and I think it goes to the potential reasons for that. And Mr. Archibald can testify, at least based upon his experience with her, as a function of being a therapist, what it is that he diagnosed her as, and the symptoms that that would have, that he saw, the basis of that, and whether sexual molestation can be a cause of a stress disorder, and what those symptoms would be, and how it would manifest itself. And we believe that this is not vouching, except that her credibility has been called into serious question by [defense counsel], and we believe that it is relevant to that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: What ultimate opinion, other than diagnosis, are you going to be asking him for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: I'm going to be asking him to testify as to the ... what his opinion of his - the specific symptoms of PTSD, and memory issues, as well as scattered thoughts, as well as the disclosure portion of that, and specifically he can testify to his knowledge of [AS's] reluctance to testify - or to disclose, and why she would not have, based upon his knowledge of her in counseling. And we believe that's relevant because much has been made about the 39 -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: What's the issue about memory? Where did that come from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, there [were] issues as to whether she remembered what happened in the various interviews, and\n   [defense counsel] made quite a bit about whether she remembered saying things or not remembered saying things, and whether she remembered them at one interview and then didn't remember them at another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: What about scattered thoughts, where did that come from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, the scattered thoughts were also part of the questioning of [AS] and the way in which she was disclosing both on the 12th of August as well as the 15th of March, 2016 (sic), and the - the scattered way in which she conveyed what happened.

The State's case largely depended on the credibility of AS, and it appears to be undisputed that there were significant concerns with her credibility. In general, those concerns provided the basis for admission of the PTSD evidence. According to the prosecutor, the evidence was relevant \"because we have had lots of testimony elicited from [AS] regarding her behaviors and her lack of credibility, and I think it goes to the potential reasons for that.\" She continued, \"her credibility has been called into serious question by [defense counsel], and we believe that it is relevant to that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b627] Additionally, the prosecutor emphasized this testimony during closing argument when she told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [W]e heard from Phil Archibald who said that that is what he diagnosed her as, and he told you what the symptoms would be.

However, in doing so, the State ignores the unmistakable fact that the only stressor that Mr. Archibald identified as the trauma that provided \"the underlying basis\" for his diagnosis of PTSD was the \"reported sexual abuse.\" The challenged testimony did more than \"incidentally bolster\" the credibility of AS.

Mr. Archibald simply did not provide any opinion which invaded the province of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses.

There are two reasons for this rule. First, \"the testimony of a psychologist or other expert on the issue of credibility does not assist (the jury) and therefore does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 702, W.R.E.\"\n   <em>\n    Seward v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095673\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/76/805/\">\n    2003 WY 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095673\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/76/805/\">\n    76 P.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (Wyo. 2003). Second, \"we do not need or want a parade of 'truth or falsehood' experts invading the jury's traditional function by offering expert opinions of credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095673\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/76/805/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

When considering these principles, however, we note that testimony assisting the jury \"in understanding some aspect of the testimony of another witness that does not comment directly on that witness'[s] credibility or veracity is not invasive of the role of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12039993\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/846/589/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    Saldana v.

The fact that the expert testimony may have incidentally bolstered the victim's credibility does not make the testimony improper.\n   <em>\n    Chapman,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127697\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1164/\">\n    18 P.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   [\u00b634] The reasons for the rule against vouching and for allowing proper expert testimony are tied to the basic requirement that evidence must be relevant to be admissible. Testimony which will not \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\" as required by W.R.E. 702 is not relevant under W.R.E. 401 and 402. Evidence which would invite a \"parade of truth or falsehood experts\" and shift the focus of the trial to them would not be sufficiently relevant to outweigh the problems of confusing the issues-making it inadmissible under W.R.E. 403. On the other hand, evidence relevant to something other than the credibility of a witness is admissible. In\n   <em>\n    Chapman,\n   </em>\n   we summarized the connection between relevance and admissibility of expert PTSD testimony: \"The pivotal question in determining the admissibility of PTSD testimony in sexual assault cases is the testimony's relevance to the issues in the case ....\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127697\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1164/\">\n    18 P.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   [\u00b635] There are at least two circumstances when testimony about the identified cause of a victim's PTSD would be admissible because it is relevant and helpful to a jury: First, it may be relevant when there is an issue of whether the victim had PTSD at all, and second, it is relevant when there is a claim that something other than the sexual assault caused the PTSD. The second circumstance exists in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b636] The defense made the source of AS's stress and difficulties an issue before Mr. Archibald testified and continued that approach through cross-examination and argument.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   1. Defense counsel cross-examined AS about moving early in her childhood, additional moving, her absent father who had drug issues, the loss of friends and her father resulting from moving back to Wyoming, and social difficulties and self-harm beginning before this incident. This questioning laid a foundation for the defense argument that other problems caused AS's PTSD symptoms, not the alleged incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   2. Mr. Spence's counsel then cross-examined Mr. Archibald about the other stressors that can cause PTSD, about his diagnosis based on what he \"gleaned\" from AS at first and then confirmed from her prior records, and about AS potentially experiencing other stressors from \"having to flee a biological father who has drug issues\" and \"abandonment.\" This questioning further implied other causes for PTSD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   3. In closing, defense counsel argued Mr. Archibald \"makes this conclusion that she has perhaps PTSD based on some trauma or a stressor.\" He then argued something other than the assault caused AS's problems, stating \"we know her family ... packed up in the middle of the night as they left an abusive situation in Arizona to come here,\" and \"we know she was cutting before July 4, 2014.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [\u00b637] The source of AS's PTSD, as diagnosed by Mr. Archibald, was an issue. The defense argued something else acted as the stressor or stressors causing PTSD, and that it existed before the alleged incident. Mr. Archibald gave his opinion as to the source of the stressors, without commenting that AS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   was or was not telling the truth. The trial judge properly allowed the testimony because it was relevant to an issue in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   [\u00b638] Mr. Archibald's testimony is not at all like the testimony found to be improper vouching in\n   <em>\n    Whiteplume v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380928\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/841/1332/#p1337\">\n    841 P.2d 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 1992). In\n   <em>\n    Whiteplume,\n   </em>\n   the deputy said he determined the victim had been raped. The only effect of allowing the deputy's opinion was to support the victim's claim. As such, the testimony was not relevant to any other issue in the case and did nothing but vouch for the victim's credibility-it was not helpful to the jury. Here, Mr. Archibald did not say he had determined that AS was the victim of incest or sexual abuse. He referred only to her \"report[ ]\" of sexual abuse in discussing the PTSD diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   [\u00b639] On the other hand, Mr. Archibald's testimony is similar to\n   <em>\n    Chapman,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127697\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1164/\">\n    18 P.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where we held the expert's statement that \"she was seeing the victim due to 'a report of molestation from a family friend' \" did not amount to an expression that the defendant was guilty or improper vouching. Mr. Archibald's statement is even less concerning than the expert's statement in\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   because he did not identify the alleged perpetrator of the \"reported sexual abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   and the cases it relied upon allow evidence of \"the existence of the disorder coupled with the absence of any triggering trauma, other than the evidence of [the charged crime], [to] aid the jury[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127697\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1164/\">\n    18 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1173-74 quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ct. App. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   [\u00b640]\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   established that testimony like Mr. Archibald's is not improper vouching. It concluded \"the expert's testimony here provided foundation for the expert's testimony and only indicates there had been a report of an assault.\n   <strong>\n    As such, it is not an opinion of guilt.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127697\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1164/\">\n    18 P.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That same situation exists in this case. Mr. Archibald's testimony provided a foundation for his other testimony, it was relevant and helpful to the finder of fact, and it was not an opinion of guilt or credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   [\u00b641] Having heard the evidence, with the issue of what caused AS's PTSD, the jury still had to evaluate the credibility of AS and of all other witnesses, including Mr. Archibald. It had to evaluate what weight, if any, to give his testimony. The trial judge instructed the jury that it was not required to accept any expert opinion. In context, Mr. Archibald's testimony was not vouching, but appropriate information the jury could consider in deciding the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   [\u00b642] The district court admitted Mr. Archibald's testimony in the context of the issues presented at trial. \"Evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court and include determinations of the adequacy of foundation and relevancy, competency, materiality, and remoteness of the evidence. This court will generally accede to the trial court's determination of the admissibility of evidence unless that court clearly abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Overson v.
