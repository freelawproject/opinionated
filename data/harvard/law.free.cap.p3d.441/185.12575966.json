After the trial court denied their motions to suppress that evidence, defendants were convicted on drug-related charges. The Court of Appeals affirmed those convictions, concluding that, although defendants retained protected possessory and privacy interests in the garbage while their bin rested at the curb, the police did not violate their interests by taking possession of the bin and searching its contents, because defendants had lost\n   their interests when the sanitation company picked up their garbage bin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On review, we hold that defendants retained protected privacy interests in their garbage under Article I, section 9, which the police invaded when they searched defendants' garbage bin without a warrant. Accordingly, the trial court erred by denying defendants' motions to suppress evidence, and we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and the judgments of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings before the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin with the facts concerning the retrieval and search of defendants' garbage bin, which are not disputed. While defendants lived together in Lebanon, Oregon, local police received information about possible drug activity at their house and decided to investigate. Lebanon Police Department Detective McCubbins contacted the sanitation company servicing the house, Republic Services. Republic is a private company that has a franchise agreement with the\n   City of Lebanon to pick up and haul garbage from private residences. Neither defendant had a separate written agreement with Republic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McCubbins asked Republic to collect the contents of defendants' garbage bin separately from the other private residences that Republic served so that defendants' garbage could be searched by police officers. A manager for Republic agreed to cooperate, obtaining defendants' garbage for the police before the regular garbage truck arrived at the house:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"On the day that defendants' garbage was usually picked up, the police parked down the street to observe Republic's collection of defendants' trash. The police arrived at 7:00 a.m. and noticed that defendants' garbage cart had already been placed by the sidewalk. On that morning, a manager for Republic drove to defendants' residence in a white pickup truck ahead of the larger mechanical sanitation truck that would normally collect defendants' garbage. The manager arrived outside defendants' residence around 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. The manager timed his drive to make sure that he showed up before the company's larger mechanical truck emptied the cart. The manager grabbed defendants' cart and placed it in his company pickup truck. The manager then provided defendants with an empty replacement cart from the back of his truck.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Lien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412094\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/334/#p337\">\n    283 Or.

The manager then handed control of the cart to the police, who searched it and found, among other things, evidence of illegal drugs, including drug bindles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412094\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/334/#p337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Using that evidence, the police sought and obtained a warrant to search the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants were both subsequently charged with a variety of drug-related offenses. Before trial, both moved to suppress the evidence discovered in their garbage bin, arguing that the warrantless search, not otherwise encompassed by any exception to the warrant requirement, had violated their rights against unreasonable search or seizure under Article I, section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the hearing on defendants' motions to suppress, McCubbins testified for the state and described how the police had obtained defendants' garbage bin and the chain of custody of the bin and its contents. McCubbins acknowledged that defendants' garbage bin was handled \"not in the normal manner\" but, rather, \"in a special manner\" at his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants called defendant Lien and Republic's manager as witnesses. They testified concerning Republic's residential garbage service in Lebanon and the sanitation company's usual practices when picking up that garbage. Lien testified that she had lived at her residence for approximately five years and that Republic was the company that picked up her household garbage. She testified that some of that garbage was private in nature and that she had expected the garbage in defendants' bin \"to be mixed with\n   other people's garbage and go out to the landfill.\" She explained that, while she had no written agreement with Republic, she nevertheless had expected that the sanitation company would process defendants' garbage in the same way that it processed everyone else's garbage, that is, without anyone going through it before it was commingled and taken to the landfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Republic's manager described the usual process of residential garbage collection and disposal: The garbage bins have lids, and customers must place their bins near the street within reach of the mechanical arm on the garbage truck. The company uses a large, automated side-load garbage truck to grab the bins and dump their contents into the opening at the top of the truck. The driver typically does not have to get out of the truck and does not see the contents of the individual garbage bins. A truck can hold the garbage of 350 to 400 households, and, once the truck is full, the driver takes it directly to the landfill and dumps the load of garbage out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Republic's manager also testified about agreements in place regarding Republic's residential services in Lebanon. He testified that Republic has a franchise agreement with the city to provide garbage service for city residents and that residents had no choice about which company collected their garbage. The sanitation company's franchise\n   agreement did not have a provision stating that it could provide a resident's garbage to law enforcement. Republic did not have a written agreement with its residential customers, nor did it tell customers that it may provide garbage to law enforcement officers at their request. The manager agreed that it was reasonable for Republic's customers to expect that their garbage would be picked up in the ordinary manner, that is, that the lid on the garbage bin would be closed and the bin then emptied into the mechanized garbage truck without the driver getting out and looking into the bin. He also testified that he collected defendants' garbage bin because the police asked him to do that, but he would not collect garbage from a customer for a private citizen because that would \"violate the customer's privacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court credited the witnesses' testimony. Its findings included the following: \"Defendants placed the garbage can at the curb,\" and \"they believed that some of its contents were personal or private in nature.\" \"No one provided any notice to defendants that their garbage was subject to search or examination.\" \"Republic [S]ervices will bring customer's garbage to the police when requested but will not deliver garbage collected from defendants to anyone else.\" \"Ordinarily when the garbage is picked up by Republic Services it is dumped at the Coffin Butte landfill,\" and \"a single garbage truck holds the refuse of 350-400 households.\" \"Republic's trucks are highly mechanized. In most instances the driver never touches the garbage cans-a mechanical arm picks up the cans and empties them into the truck. No employee ordinarily sees the garbage content.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court nevertheless denied defendants' motions to suppress. The trial court first concluded that Republic's manager, who had picked up and delivered defendant's garbage to the police, had \"acted exclusively at the request and direction of the police\" and \"was acting as an agent for the state.\" It followed, the trial court continued, that the manager's seizure of defendants' garbage constituted state action. The trial court nevertheless concluded that defendants already had abandoned their garbage, along with any \"reasonable expectation they would ever see their garbage again or have access to it,\" before the garbage had been picked up. The court concluded that, despite\n   defendants' subjective expectation of privacy, they retained no privacy interest in property that they had abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the trial court denied defendants' motions to suppress, defendants agreed to enter conditional guilty or no-contest pleas to some of the charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 135.335(3) (providing that criminal defendants may, with the court's consent, enter conditional pleas of guilty or no contest while reserving the right to appeal adverse determinations of specified pretrial motions; defendants who prevail on appeal may withdraw original pleas). Defendant Lien conditionally pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful delivery of\n   heroin, ORS 475.850, and no contest to one count of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine, ORS 475.890. Defendant Wilverding conditionally pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine, ORS 475.890. The remaining charges against both defendants were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the entry of judgments of conviction below, defendants appealed, arguing to the Court of Appeals that the trial court had erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence derived from the warrantless seizure and search of their garbage bin. Defendants asserted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[b]y asking the garbage company manager to collect defendants' garbage ahead of the regularly scheduled time and keep it separate for searching,\n   <em>\n    the police enlisted the garbage company manager as a police agent. Thus, what occurred here is legally indistinguishable from the police themselves removing defendants' garbage from the curb, replacing it with an empty cart, and searching it\n   </em>\n   . That is impermissible.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Defendants acknowledged that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    342 Or. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    157 P.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (where police went through the defendants' garbage after the sanitation company agreed to deliver it), appeared-at least on its face-to control the outcome of their appeal. Defendants nevertheless contended that\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   should be reexamined as either distinguishable in this instance or wrongly decided, arguing in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Farmers Insurance v. Mowry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674233\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/686/#p698\">\n    350 Or. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674233\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/686/#p698\">\n    261 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), that the factual context for the decision in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   regarding the relinquishment of\n   constitutionally protected interests in garbage was different than in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court of Appeals, however, was not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   was meaningfully different from this case, either factually or in the applicable legal analysis. The court concluded that defendants' possessory rights in their garbage-like those of the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   -were deemed to have been lost once the garbage was retrieved by the sanitation company on its regularly-scheduled pickup day.\n   <em>\n    Lien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412094\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/334/#p337\">\n    283 Or.

With respect to defendants' privacy interests, the Court of Appeals noted that the\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   defendants had raised similar privacy-based concerns before this court, which the court had rejected based on the rationale articulated in\n   <em>\n    State v. Purvis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    249 Or. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    438 P.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), that a person retains no constitutionally protected privacy interest in abandoned property.\n   <em>\n    Lien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412094\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/334/#p337\">\n    283 Or.

The Court of Appeals held that the trial court had properly denied defendants' motions to suppress and affirmed the judgments below.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In reaching that conclusion, however, the Court of Appeals did not discuss defendants' agency-related arguments concerning the role of Republic's manager as a police agent. We subsequently allowed and consolidated defendants' requests for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Issue on Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that they had protected possessory and privacy interests in their garbage while their closed garbage bin sat at the curb.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Galloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181033\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/198/585/\">\n    198 Or. App. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181033\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/198/585/\">\n    109 P.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (holding that the defendants retained possessory interests in contents of their closed garbage bins at curbside for collection and that they had not abandoned protected interests in garbage that the police had collected). The state does not engage with that argument and assumes,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that defendants had such interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state then proceeds directly to the pivot point\n   for the parties: whether defendants retained either their possessory or privacy interests once the sanitation company manager-acting at the behest of, and as an agent for, the police-specially picked up the bin and transferred it to the waiting police officers for their inspection.\n   On that issue, the parties respectively take \"all\" or \"nothing\" positions. Defendants argue that they retained both possessory and privacy interests in their garbage bin and its contents, and that those interests were violated when Republic's manager, acting in his role as an agent of the police, picked up their garbage bin and delivered it to the police. Thus, they argue, the police controlled the taking and delivery of their garbage bin, as well as the ensuing search of their garbage, all without a warrant and in violation of their rights under Article I, section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast, the state contends that, although Republic's manager was in fact an agent of the police, this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   stand for the proposition that individuals effectively abandon possessory and privacy interests in their curbside garbage once a sanitation company takes possession of it. Accordingly, in the state's view, by the time Republic's manager delivered defendants' garbage bin to the police, defendants had no constitutionally protected interests in their garbage. Thus, the state argues, the police were free to inspect defendants' garbage and did not violate Article I, section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In keeping with their respective legal positions, the parties initially address whether the police, acting through the sanitation company manager, seized defendants' garbage from the curb in violation of their protected possessory interests in that property. We choose not to decide that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Instead, we decide the other issue that the parties present: whether, after Republic's manager delivered defendants' garbage bin to the police, the police invaded defendants' privacy interests by searching defendants' garbage without a warrant, in violation of Article I, section 9. On that issue, the state bears the burden of establishing that the search \"did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   violate a protected interest of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107599\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/330/85/#p89\">\n    330 Or. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107599\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/330/85/#p89\">\n    997 P.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   ORS 133.693(4) (\"Where the motion to suppress challenges evidence seized as the result of a warrantless search, the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the validity of the search is on the prosecution.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ultimately, whether the police searched defendants' garbage bin and their garbage without a warrant in violation of their rights under Article I, section 9, turns on whether defendants had constitutionally protected privacy interests in the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We first address, and agree with, defendants' contention that they had privacy interests in their curbside garbage, before Republic's manager arrived. We then discuss the legal underpinnings of the conclusion that the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and the parties all reached: The sanitation company manager was a police agent when he took and delivered defendants' garbage bin to the police. Finally, we address whether-as defendants assert-the role of the manager as a police agent is determinative of whether defendants retained their privacy interests in their garbage when the police searched it, or whether-as the state asserts-this court's conclusions on abandonment of privacy interests in\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   are applicable to, and retain their viability in, the circumstances that this case presents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Privacy Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Among other rights, Article I, section 9, grants \"the people\" the right to be \"secure * * * against unreasonable search\" of their \"effects.\" Thus, Article I, section 9, protects people by forbidding \"certain\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   of the government.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In other words, this court has recognized, first, that privacy-freedom from government scrutiny-is a fundamental principle and value protected by Article I, section 9 and, second, that privacy is grounded in particular social contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, we determine whether defendants in this case had a protected privacy interest by first considering general social norms of behavior. Here, the relevant actors are the sanitation company manager, who, as a police agent, procured defendants' garbage bin and gave it to the police; defendants, who put out their opaque and closed garbage bin for trash collection, expecting that the sanitation company with an exclusive franchise in the city,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   would pick up their garbage, commingle it with the garbage of hundreds of other households on the garbage truck route, and take it to the landfill; and police officers, who arranged for the taking of the garbage and who searched it. In our view,\n   under those circumstances, most Oregonians would consider their garbage to be private and deem it highly improper for others-curious neighbors, ex-spouses, employers, opponents in a lawsuit, journalists, and government officials, to name a few-to take away their garbage bin and scrutinize its contents. In this case, the sanitation company's manager acknowledged that norm: He would not collect garbage from a customer at the request of a private citizen because that would \"violate the customer's privacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Indeed, defendants make exactly that point, suggesting that most Oregonians would be outraged were their garbage subject to such examination and citing as support an article first published on December 23, 2002, in the Portland publication\n   <em>\n    Willamette Week\n   </em>\n   . The article catalogued items that its reporters had found by collecting the curbside garbage or recycling of three government officials in Portland then serving in law enforcement roles: the city's police chief, the mayor and commissioner of police, and the Multnomah County District Attorney. The reporters described what they had done as a \"frontal assault\" on privacy and reported some of the officials' angry reactions to having their personal refuse removed from curbside and publicly examined, including the mayor's statement that she considered \"\n   <em>\n    Willamette Week's\n   </em>\n   actions in this matter to be potentially illegal and absolutely unscrupulous and reprehensible.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chris Lydgate &amp; Nick Budnick,\n   <em>\n    Rubbish!\n   </em>\n   , Willamette Week (December 11, 2017), http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-1616-rubbish.html-2 (last accessed May 1, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is not hard to understand why people would want to keep their garbage private and would respond with outrage to such an invasion. As the New Jersey Supreme Court explained, \"[c]lues to people's most private traits and affairs can be found in their garbage,\" and so it is common knowledge that most people are interested in keeping their garbage private.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Like the court in\n   <em>\n    Hinish\n   </em>\n   over three quarters of a century ago, we recognize, given the realities of living in modern society, which is experiencing its own significant social and technological changes, that privacy norms exist notwithstanding some limited public exposure of information, in this case, putting out garbage in a closed bin for pickup by the sanitation company at curbside, an area accessible to members of the public other than the sanitation company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nothing about the relationship among the actors in this case or the respective obligations of defendants and Republic with respect to the garbage at issue here suggests that defendants had left their garbage for police or other government officials to search. There is no evidence that defendants had interacted at all with the Lebanon police concerning their garbage, and so no words or conduct on their part expressed that they were abandoning their garbage to the police or allowing them to search it when they placed the garbage at curbside for pickup. Rather, defendants were obligated by city ordinance to remove waste from their home on at least a weekly basis. Under section 8.16.140(B) of the Lebanon Code of Ordinances, \"[e]very person who generates or produces solid waste or wastes shall remove or have removed all putrescible wastes at least every seven days.\" The required frequency of removal was \"to prevent health hazards, nuisances, or pollution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5035814\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/166/482/#p502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as mandated, defendants had weekly garbage collection through Republic, in the customary way for Lebanon residents. For its part, Republic was required by section 8.16.070(a) of the Lebanon Code of Ordinances to \"[d]ispose of solid waste collected at a DEQ approved site or recover resources from the solid waste, both in compliance with Chapters 459 and 459A, Oregon Revised Statutes, together with rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\" The city's Code of Ordinances, however, did not authorize Republic to transfer collected garbage to third parties for searches. At bottom, defendants, Republic, and the police all understood that, had Republic's manager not taken the garbage to the police at their request, defendants' garbage would have been commingled with the garbage of hundreds of other households\n   and dumped in a landfill, obscuring, as a practical matter, that defendants' garbage in particular contained evidence of drug possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We acknowledge that the United States Supreme Court has come to a different conclusion in applying the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209906\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/35/#p50\">\n    486 U.S. at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209906\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/35/#p50\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that there is no reasonable \"expectation of privacy in trash left for collection in an area accessible to the public\").

That, however, is not the factual posture present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this case, it is undisputed that the police solicited the sanitation company manager to specially pick up and bring defendants' garbage to them and the sanitation company manager obliged that request. There is no question, then, that there was mutual assent to the agency relationship. Under the common-law agency principles discussed in\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the police-the principals-and the sanitation company manager-their agent-entered into an agency relationship, the goal of which was to procure defendants' garbage bin for the police to conduct a search of its contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The trial court found that Republic's manager had \"acted exclusively at the request and direction of the police,\" and we are bound by that finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, it cannot be said that the sanitation company discovered suspicious evidence in the course of its regular operations and volunteered to give that evidence to the police, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   . Nor can it be said that the police happened\n   upon evidence lying in plain view or that the police obtained the sanitation company's consent to go through defendants' garbage once the sanitation company, as usual, had picked it up with its mechanized garbage truck. What can be said is that the police procured defendants' garbage bin, with its contents segregated from the garbage of hundreds of other households, by engaging the services of Republic's manager to act as its agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Did the Police Violate Defendants' Rights under Article I, Section 9 ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We are left with the key controversy at hand: whether defendants retained, and the police invaded, privacy interests in the contents of their garbage bin after the police received the bin from Republic's manager and went through its contents. There is no question that defendants did not know that the police would take their garbage bin away with the help of an agent and search it, nor\n   did they agree to such a search. And there is no question that defendants did not tell the police or the sanitation company that, by leaving their garbage bin at the curb for Republic's mechanized garbage truck to empty it and haul away the garbage, commingled with garbage from other households, they were intentionally relinquishing their privacy in the contents of their garbage bin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Having never agreed to nor authorized the transfer of their garbage to the police, defendants argue that they retained protected privacy interests in their garbage, which the police invaded when they searched it without a warrant. For its part, the state implicitly contends that it did not interfere with defendants' privacy interests when the police went through the garbage. In the state's view, defendants \"lost\" those interests when the sanitation company manager picked up defendants' garbage bin. For that proposition, the state relies on\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   . Defendants, however, argue that those cases are distinguishable and, alternatively, that we should overrule them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In light of the parties' arguments, we first examine\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   in detail. We acknowledge that it is possible to read those cases as broadly holding that, once a private actor takes possession of a person's garbage, that\n   person loses any privacy interests in the garbage. However, given our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   , and an earlier case involving police use of private actors,\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107599\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/330/85/#p89\">\n    330 Or. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107599\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/330/85/#p89\">\n    997 P.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we explicitly renounce such a broad reading. Indeed, as explained in greater detail below, we conclude that Oregonians do not \"lose\" privacy interests in their garbage when the police direct a private actor to facilitate the government's search by picking up garbage bins left at curbside for regular trash pick-up day. And, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   hold otherwise, we disavow those holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Purvis and Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   , decided in 1968, Eugene police had received a tip from employees at a local hotel who believed that one of the hotel's guests was using \"narcotics\" in his room, the suspected drug in question being marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    249 Or. at 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    438 P.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   , authorities had learned that one of the defendants had made substantial purchases of a precursor chemical used to manufacture methamphetamine. Armed with that information-but no warrant-police officers asked the sanitation company that collected the defendants' household garbage to pick it up at their home and convey it directly to them for inspection. The company complied with that request and, during two regularly scheduled pick-ups at the defendants' residence, collected their garbage container and its contents, replaced it with an empty container, and immediately turned the full container over to a police officer. Based on evidence gleaned from those searches, the police obtained a warrant to search the defendants' residence,\n   where they uncovered additional evidence of methamphetamine manufacture and use.

The sanitation company manager then acted as a police agent when he picked up defendants' garbage bin before the mechanized garbage truck arrived, replaced that bin with an empty one, and transported their garbage bin to the waiting police officers for a search. Because the police directed that private actor, Republic's manager, to segregate and then to bring their private information in their garbage to the police for exposure in a search, the police bear responsibility for invading defendants' privacy interests in their garbage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   does not remain viable in light of\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   .

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   , the court cited\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   \"retained no more right to control the disposition of the garbage once they turned it over to the sanitation company than they would had they abandoned it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . That observation, however, like similar observations in\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   , was premised on the unsupported notion that the government action implicating the protections of Article I, section 9-the agency relationship between the police and the garbage company-was somehow abrogated by the garbage company's preexisting authorization to pick up the defendant's garbage, police request or not. In\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   , this court assumed that, once the sanitation company manager-the private actor-took possession of the garbage, the defendants no longer had any \"right to control the disposition of the garbage\" and then assumed that, like people who had \"abandoned\" their property, the defendants had no rights with respect to the garbage whatsoever. This court then assumed that the private actor who had possession of the garbage could choose to do what he wanted with the defendants' garbage, including\n   exposing the garbage to third parties, even the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   But as explained above, common law agency principles now require us to view the police officers in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   as the principals who, through use of their agent, were vicariously responsible for segregating and procuring the contents of defendants' garbage bin for exposure to police search, thereby invading defendants' privacy rights without a warrant. Thus, our previous holding in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   that the defendants in that case had no privacy\n   rights in their garbage because the sanitation company had collected it under a privilege to do so can no longer be viewed as correct. Consequently, we overrule that part of\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   for the same reasons that we have overruled\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Having overruled those two cases, we reject the state's contention that the police officers in the case now before us did not \"search\" defendants' garbage under Article I, section 9. The state itself-not a private actor acting independently of the police-took defendants' garbage bin and then went through its contents. For reasons we have discussed above, including social norms reflected in cases from this and other courts and common law tort principles reflecting legal norms, that conduct plainly invaded defendants' constitutionally protected privacy interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"Subject to certain limited exceptions, a search or seizure is unreasonable and, therefore, unlawful under Article I, section 9, unless it is supported by probable cause and a warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This court held that an examination of the defendants' garbage in both\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   did not violate any privacy interests protected by Article I, section 9.

I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Ordinarily, a person who gives up all possessory interests in property retains no privacy interest in it. The majority, however, seeks to avoid that established principle in one of two ways. First the majority focuses on the privacy interest that defendants had in their garbage\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   it was collected.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lien/Wilverding\n   </em>\n   , 364 Or. 750, 766-67, 441 P.3d 185 (2019). This case, however, involves the examination of garbage\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it was collected-a quite different issue. On that issue, the majority does not appear to call into question or overrule\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   's holding that the lack of any possessory interest in property necessarily defeats a privacy interest in it. Second, the majority emphasizes that the garbage collector was acting as a police agent when he collected defendants' garbage. 364 Or. at 780, 441 P.3d at 194-95. In considering the latter point, the majority's reasoning conflates two questions that should be kept separate. The first is whether a private individual was acting as a government agent, which determines whether the restrictions of Article I, section 9, apply to a private individual's actions at all. The second question is whether the garbage collector's status as a police agent prevented defendants' possessory and ownership interests, along with any privacy interests, from being extinguished when their garbage was collected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On the question of defendants' privacy interests in their curbside garbage, the majority travels from Portland to Salem by way of Maine. Largely absent from that analysis are this court's two prior cases on privacy interests in garbage,\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Purvis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    249 Or. at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2093996\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/249/404/#p410\">\n    438 P.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the concept of abandoned property, upon which both turned. Instead, the majority focuses on a right to privacy derived from the cluster of torts that are often referred to as invasion of privacy. 364 Or. at 762, 441 P.3d at 192. But that conception of privacy is inapposite to that protected by Article I, section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   We have recognized that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \"[f]our separate theories comprise the 'umbrella' tort referred to as invasion of privacy: (1) intrusion upon seclusion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   (2) appropriation of another's name or likeness; (3) false light; and (4) publication of private facts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    Mauri v.

The latter three theories speak to different interests than those protected by Article I, section 9. All concern publicity and disclosure-but whether something is a search under Article I, section 9, never depends on who the government tells about\n   what it finds. And the torts of false light and publication of private facts provide protections regarding certain types of private or embarrassing\n   <em>\n    information,\n   </em>\n   yet \"[t]he constitutional provisions against unreasonable searches and seizures do not protect a right to keep any information, no matter how hidden or 'private,' secret from the government.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But if that tort started from similar premises, it has developed differently enough from our Article I, section 9, jurisprudence that it is not much help in articulating the latter. The tort requires intrusion into \"private areas or concerns\" and that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   \"the interference with the plaintiff's seclusion is a substantial one, of a kind that would be highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man, as the result of conduct to which the reasonable man would strongly object.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 652B comment d (1977). That suggests the adoption of a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" standard-albeit a fairly stringent one. Yet we have expressly rejected using a reasonable expectation of privacy test to determine the privacy protected by Article I, section 9. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \"The phrase becomes a formula for expressing a conclusion rather than a starting point for analysis, masking the various substantive considerations that are the real bases on which Fourth Amendment searches are defined. * * * Moreover, the privacy protected by Article I, section 9, is\n   not the privacy that one reasonably\n   <em>\n    expects\n   </em>\n   but the privacy to which one has a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205356\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/157/#p166\">\n    306 Or. at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205356\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/157/#p166\">\n    759 P.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the reasonable expectation of privacy test remains popular in other jurisdictions, the grass looks no greener on the other side than it did at the time of\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In any event, intrusion upon seclusion case law is unlikely to be much aid. In\n   <em>\n    McLain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123513\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/549/#p554\">\n    271 Or. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123513\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/549/#p554\">\n    533 P.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court held that trespassing onto the plaintiff's property in order to photograph him was not sufficient to make out a tort claim in part because the plaintiff had made a workers compensation claim and thereby \"waive[d] his right of privacy to the extent of a reasonable investigation,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123513\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/549/#p554\">\n    533 P.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the surveillance was \"done in such an unobtrusive manner that plaintiff was not aware that he was being watched and filmed,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 556,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123513\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/549/#p554\">\n    533 P.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"there was no evidence of intent to harm, harass or annoy the plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 557,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123513\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/271/549/#p554\">\n    533 P.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As that reasoning highlights, our limited intrusion upon seclusion jurisprudence does not draw a distinction between the question of whether a search occurred and whether that search was reasonable-both are collapsed into a single step and analyzed in a balancing inquiry. Factors such as whether the plaintiff was aware that he was being watched and the intent of the individual performing the search, properly irrelevant in the Article I, section 9, context, are given substantial weight. In other words, it does not seem that we can learn much from our invasion of privacy law, unless we wish radically to rethink our Article I, section 9, jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Fortunately, the majority does not take that approach; its reliance on the privacy torts seems largely figurative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But not much is left in its place. Some cursory testimony by witnesses in this case and a single newspaper article are taken to suggest social norms for the whole state. An analysis of whether defendants expected or expressly authorized\n   examination of their trash by law enforcement suffices to establish a legal norm\n   against examination of trash by law enforcement. The decision is driven more by judicial intuition than precedent or objective indicia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In any event, to the extent that the question in this case is whether there is a privacy interest in garbage placed for collection at the curb, which is the only question that the majority expressly answers, then that question could be resolved on much more straightforward grounds. We recognized in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   that, in this context, privacy interests are largely coextensive with ownership and possessory interests. As we held in that case, \"when defendants turned the garbage over to the sanitation company without any restriction on its disposition, they effectively abandoned that property * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    342 Or. at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    157 P.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case is decided on the assumption that defendants maintained possessory interests in their garbage until it was picked up by the garbage collector-as long as the garbage was still on the curb, it was not abandoned. --- Or. at ----, --- P.3d at ----. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , while not limiting searches to physical trespasses, this court held that \"the privacy interests that are protected by Article I, section 9, commonly are circumscribed by the space in which they exist and, more particularly, by the barriers to public entry (physical and sensory) that define that private space.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"701795\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/327/366/#p372\">\n    327 Or. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"701795\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/327/366/#p372\">\n    963 P.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' garbage was contained within a cart, and within that most of it was contained in opaque bags. Nor is there any other factor that would diminish that interest, such as the placement of that property in a communal or public place. The cart was either on or directly adjacent to defendants' property. Given that defendants held a possessory right to their garbage, that it was placed next to their property, and that any examination would require penetration of the \"barriers to public entry\" surrounding the garbage, I have no difficulty concluding that defendants possessed a privacy interest in the garbage that they placed at the curb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Of course, that is not the question in this case. No search occurred while defendants' garbage was placed at the curb. Instead, the garbage was collected by Republic\n   Services, which then turned the garbage over to the police, who then opened the bin and bags. The appropriate question, therefore, is whether defendants retained a privacy interest in garbage once it was collected-that is, once they forever gave up any right to control its disposition. That is the question that we answered in the negative in\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   . Defendants may have expected, however reasonably, that once their garbage was collected it would be quickly mixed with other garbage and taken forthwith to a landfill. But, as they completely and forever gave up control of that property, none of those expectations translated into the \"privacy to which one has a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205356\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/157/#p166\">\n    306 Or. at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2205356\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/306/157/#p166\">\n    759 P.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , protected by Article I, section 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    342 Or. at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    157 P.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The garbage collection company, at that point the rightful owner of the garbage, could, at will, decline to mix it, unmix it, have its own employees comb it for contraband, or hand the garbage over to the police. Investing such totally abandoned property with constitutional privacy rights would amount to a restriction upon the new owner-a denial of his right to authorize searches by the state. It should not be doubted that that right is valuable to many. The ability to consent to a search can, in some contexts, be a tool to prove one's innocence. And individuals often have reasonable desires to use their property to help the police conduct investigations. Republic understandably may be opposed to the use of its collection system to hide evidence of drug activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   To be sure, we have recognized, in two cases involving bailments,\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that regard, they are of a piece with\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   's holding that \"the legal\n   relationship between defendants and the sanitation company effectively controls the question whether defendants retained a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the garbage.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    342 Or. at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    157 P.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There would be no constitutional violation, that is, were police officers to approach the garbage collector, immediately after the trash was picked up but before it was mixed in with the rest, and at that point to conduct an examination of the garbage with the permission of its new owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   That is where the second branch of the majority's analysis comes into play.

The majority suggests that the garbage collector's status as a government agent turned his otherwise-permitted removal and transfer of defendants' trash into a search, but\n   does not spell out how. The majority reasons that it cannot be said\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \"that the police obtained the sanitation company's consent to go through defendants' garbage once the sanitation company, as usual, had picked it up with its mechanized garbage truck.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   --- Or. at ----, --- P.3d at ----. But most of that can and must be said-Republic did, as usual, pick up defendant's garbage, and then gave the police permission to search it. True, the collection was not accomplished through use of a mechanized ruck, but the majority offers no reason why that fact has constitutional significance. The majority does not contend that there is general constitutional privacy interest in the type of truck in which garbage is collected or in having one's garbage mixed. And Republic was not contractually obligated to mix defendants' garbage or to collect it in a specific type of vehicle. The record reveals that Republic used a large, mechanized truck for reasons of efficiency, not because that was how it agreed to provide collection services to its customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The majority's point, as I understand it, is that the police officers' use of the garbage collector as an agent effectively negated defendants' agreement with the collector, at least for constitutional purposes. The majority errs by relying on\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   to reach that conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   , looking to common law agency principles, we set out a test governing when a private individual acts as a government agent, for the purpose of determining\n   whether Article I, section 9, applies to the private actor's actions at all.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165792\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/41/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165792\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/41/#p50\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165792\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/41/#p50\">\n    379 P.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   , that threshold question proved dispositive; we ultimately concluded that the private actor in question was not acting as a government agent, and consequently that none of her actions could implicate Article I, section 9.\n   359 Or. at 62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165792\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/41/#p50\">\n    379 P.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   never considered the question of how the private actor's status as an agent would affect the subsequent analysis of whether her actions violated a possessory or privacy interest and thereby constituted a seizure or a search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   therefore offers no reason to conclude that the garbage collector's status as a government agent should affect the analysis of whether his actions interfered with defendants' possessory or privacy interests. There can be no dispute that if the garbage collector had not been acting as a government agent, he would have violated no possessory or ownership interest in collecting defendants' garbage. And, once he did so, any possessory, ownership, or privacy interests that defendants once had in their garbage were abandoned. The majority suggests, though, that the garbage collector's status as a police agent made the fact that defendants had left their property to him irrelevant to the evaluation of whether defendants' possessory or privacy interests were violated. More important, the majority suggests, is the fact that the police would have committed a seizure had they taken the garbage directly. --- Or. at ----, --- P.3d at ----. The common law agency principles that this court relied upon in\n   <em>\n    Sines\n   </em>\n   do not point in that direction. If the garbage collector\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   violated any possessory or privacy interest of defendants, while acting as a police agent, then that violation would appropriately be attributed to the state. But here, the state's agent obtained defendants' trash\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   any violation of possessory or privacy interests (or fraud, or trespass, or damages caused, or any other illegality) so there is no wrong to attribute to the state. Put another way, an agent does not forfeit her own rights merely because she acts on behalf of a principal. Many agency relationships arise precisely because the agent can do something that the principal cannot-and that the principal may be legally prohibited from doing. A lawyer is not forbidden from practicing law because his client is not a member of\n   the bar; a trucker is not prohibited from driving a semi-trailer because her employer lacks a commercial driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Establishing that an agent is bound by her own limitations, not her principal's, is a long way from holding that the state can use private agents to evade the strictures of Article I, section 9. As in all cases, the appropriate course is to examine whether the agent's actions violated a privacy or possessory interest. In general, that will not occur if the agent takes property or accesses places in a manner that the suspect has authorized, but typically will occur if the scope of that permission is exceeded.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \"A government agent, in the same manner as a private person, may accept an invitation to do business and may enter upon the premises for the very purposes contemplated by the occupant.

Sholedice/Smith\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   . In those cases, we examined situations where the defendants mailed\n   packages using the United States Postal Service, and evaluated whether various actions by postal inspectors-who were government employees-constituted seizures. We answered those questions by examining the scope of the defendants' possessory rights with respect to the packages, and whether the inspectors took actions inconsistent with those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sholedice/Smith\n   </em>\n   , 364 Or. at 160-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571935\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/431/386/#p163\">\n    431 P.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/#p413\">\n    360 Or. at 416-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/#p413\">\n    380 P.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, we necessarily recognized that the postal inspectors had special privileges, including possessory rights, with respect to those packages. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Sholedice/Smith\n   </em>\n   we noted that, under the terms of the bailment as articulated in the Domestic Mail Manual, the postal service's authority to possess the package-while not unlimited-included the right to move the package out of the mail hamper for a quick screening. 364 Or. at 160-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571935\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/431/386/#p163\">\n    431 P.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, when analyzing fact patterns involving actual government actors-not merely private individuals acting as government agents-we have taken into account the authorizations and privileges held by those actors when evaluating whether the defendants' possessory rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Put simply,\n   <em>\n    Sholedice/Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   teach that a state actor does not violate Article I, section 9, if it acts within the course and scope of its authority in dealing with another's property. That being so, it is difficult to see why we should not take the same course in evaluating whether actions by private actors acting as government agents constitute searches or seizures. There is no clear reason why the analysis of a fact pattern involving a package shipped through FedEx should be very different from one involving the United States Postal Service. To be sure, in any case involving private mail carriers we would first need to answer whether the employees in question were acting as government agents. But, assuming that they were, and that Article I, section 9, applied at all, we should then, as with USPS, examine whether the private carrier's actions violated any of the defendant's possessory or privacy rights, by looking at the term of the contract and other social expectations. In this case, Republic did nothing different than it was authorized to do when it collected defendants' trash and, having collected it, divested defendants of their possessory and privacy interests in their garbage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Government interference with private contractual arrangements may raise concerns of encroaching state power in ways that the government's direct operation of a postal service may not. But our ordinary approach to determining whether a search or seizure occurred, examining the privacy rights and possessory interests involved and whether they were violated, handily deals with that concern, because we have recognized the centrality of contractual rights to both of those inquiries.\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    342 Or. at 640-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561270\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/635/\">\n    157 P.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, actual violations of contractual rights at the government's behest will generally constitute searches or seizures. It is overly prophylactic, however, to hold unconstitutional all government involvement in private contractual arrangements, even where no actual interference occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Still, this is not a question that lends itself to absolutes in either direction. The fact that a private person is acting as a government agent, and is therefore acting according to a different set of motives, will in some circumstances be relevant to the analysis of whether a possessory or privacy interest was violated. But whether and when that action is a violation depends, as usual, on the nature of the privacy or possessory interest at issue. For example, a government mail carrier may\n   be permitted to open and to inspect packages for some purposes, such as the safety of the carrier's employees, but not for the purposes of criminal investigation. In such cases, the purpose of the search would matter a great deal to whether a possessory or privacy interest was invaded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sholedice/Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571935\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/431/386/#p163\">\n    364 Or. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571935\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/431/386/#p163\">\n    431 P.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing such a distinction);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Professional standards and privacy laws may be pertinent in determining when it would violate the constitution for the government to invade those relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   But most contractual relationships are not of that sort, and in the majority of cases it will be appropriate to recognize the necessary limitations on one's privacy and possessory interests that come with allowing another person to have access to one's possessions or space. In many cases, including this one, the possessory and privacy interests at issue will not be interfered with by the fact that the actor involved is also working for the police-defendants can point to no respect in which Republic failed to comply with its agreement with them, and they do not argue that they ordinarily retain any rights at all in their garbage after it is collected. It should not be overlooked that this case involves garbage-items characterized by the fact that defendants wanted Republic to take them away permanently. Most possessory and ownership interests are more robust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   How these agency questions are approached will have significance beyond this case. Use of agents to gather information that a police officer could not obtain directly is routine. One common example is a controlled drug buy, where an officer furthers an investigation by recruiting a confidential informant and directing that informant to purchase drugs from a suspected drug dealer. Quite often, that practice involves selecting a prior customer of the dealer as an informant-that prior customer, unlike the officer, may be known to or trusted by the dealer and may therefore be able to obtain an invitation into the dealer's house, or another private space, necessary to complete the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"[a] government agent, in the same manner as a private person, may accept an invitation to do business and may enter upon the premises for the very purposes contemplated by the occupant,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336196\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/206/#p211\">\n    385 U.S. at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336196\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/206/#p211\">\n    87 S.Ct. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a statement that we endorsed in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Yet if a garbage collector's status as a police agent invalidated defendants' unrestricted transfer of their garbage to the garbage collector, it remains to be seen how\n   controlled buys, and other appropriate uses of police agents, can be distinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   With respect to garbage-and any other property that an individual has asked a third party to take away forever without imposing conditions on its use-our constitution's protections will, appropriately, be at a low ebb. For reasons both logical and practical, that conclusion will be difficult to escape, regardless of how this court approaches the government's use of private agents. The majority's approach, however, raises more questions than it answers, both about the nature of privacy interests involved and the implications of an individual's status as a government agent. I fear that this case's most significant consequences will lie elsewhere, in cases involving third-party consent, confidential informants, or cooperating witnesses. As to this case, in the final analysis it is no different from\n   <em>\n    Howard/Dawson\n   </em>\n   . Defendants' garbage was collected as usual, by the company that defendants had authorized to take it, in full compliance with the procedures that they were entitled to expect. Once the garbage had been so collected, defendants gave up any privacy rights that they had. No interest of defendants' was substantially interfered with, so no search or seizure occurred. Therefore, the subsequent examination of the garbage by the police officers did not violate Article I, section 9. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    If the question in this case were whether the police committed the tort of intrusion upon seclusion, it would surely be relevant that the examination of defendants' garbage was unobtrusive (indeed, that the police took steps to ensure that defendants would remain unaware of their involvement); that the police conducted the search to enforce the law, not to harass or to annoy; and that defendants no doubt invited some degree of scrutiny, and thereby waived their right to privacy, by engaging in the unlawful delivery of heroin.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    Assuming, that is, that the transfer is unconditional.
