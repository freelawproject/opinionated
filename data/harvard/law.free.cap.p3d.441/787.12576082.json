He argues that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of other allegations of sexual assault made against him pursuant to rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence and by denying his motions for a mistrial. He also alleges that he received ineffective assistance when his trial counsel did not call expert witnesses\n   to corroborate his version of events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant and Victim married in August 2008. Soon after, Defendant began to verbally, physically, and sexually abuse Victim, culminating in the events of May 31, 2009, for which he was charged with, and convicted of, various crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 The day in question began \"as a fun, relaxing, playful day.\" The couple spent most of the day in their backyard cultivating their garden and target shooting with BB guns. Defendant began drinking around 10 a.m., and Victim had her first drink around noon. All was well until approximately 7:30 p.m. By then, both Victim and Defendant had consumed copious amounts of alcohol. Defendant received a text message from a woman whom Victim had previously caught flirting with him. Defendant's receipt of the text message infuriated Victim, and she began yelling at him. He responded by laughing at her. Exasperated, Victim left Defendant in the backyard and went to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Defendant later entered the bedroom and asked Victim if they could \"work this out.\" Victim returned with Defendant to the backyard, and the two started dancing. After dancing for a short while, Defendant began spinning Victim quickly around until she fell to the ground. Victim asked him to stop because he was hurting her. Defendant ignored her pleas, pulled her up from the ground, and tore off her shirt, bra, shorts, and underpants. Victim screamed for help, and Defendant told her to \"shut up\" and that \"[n]obody was coming to save [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Naked, Victim fled into the house. She ran upstairs to the second floor seeking to dress, retrieve her car keys, and leave the house. Defendant caught up with her when she reached the second floor and pushed her down the staircase. He then dragged her into the family room, repeatedly telling her, \"you'll remember me.\" In the family room, Defendant straddled Victim on the floor with both knees on her chest, constraining her breathing. In this position, he hit her multiple times in the face with his erect penis and repeated, \"[S]uck it. Suck it, bitch.\" Victim initially resisted but eventually gave in. \"Off and on\" for the next twenty minutes, Defendant forced Victim to perform oral sex on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Victim attempted to crawl away, but when she reached the hallway, Defendant lifted her up by the throat, pressed her against the wall, and strangled her. He told her, \"I'm going to kill you, bitch,\" and Victim passed out shortly thereafter. When she regained consciousness, she found herself soaked in her own urine. Defendant then dragged her into the upstairs bathroom, threw her into the bathtub, turned on the cold water, and ordered her to \"get cleaned up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 Victim's next memory was that of Defendant pushing her down the stairs for a second time after she attempted to escape through the back door. He then dragged her into the back bedroom, used his knees to pin her down by her shoulders, and again forced his penis into her mouth. Victim choked on his penis and lost consciousness for a second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 Sometime after midnight, Victim was finally able to escape when Defendant passed out due to his excessive alcohol consumption. Victim put on a robe, grabbed her car keys, and drove to her friends' house. They gave her a mild sedative, and Victim spent the night at their house. She woke the next day feeling like a \"punching bag,\" \"[e]verything hurt.\" Bruises had started forming on her face and on her chest, where Defendant had knelt on her while pinning her down. Her throat was extremely sore. She described that \"it felt like the worst case of strep throat [she] had ever had.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 Fearing the loss of her job, Victim insisted on going to work that day despite\n   her injuries. One of her friends accompanied her back to her house so that she could get ready. At the house, they found Defendant passed out on a couch. Victim quickly showered, dressed, and applied heavy makeup to cover the bruises on her face. Despite these efforts, her coworkers immediately noticed that her face was red, swollen, and covered in bruises. One coworker described Victim's face as \"grotesquely swollen.\" Victim, who usually had a gregarious personality, was also \"unnaturally subdued,\" \"not talkative,\" and attempted to hide her face from her coworkers. After much coaxing, Victim admitted to a coworker that she had been physically assaulted. Against Victim's wishes, her coworkers then contacted the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 The officer who responded to the call testified that Victim's face \"was very battered\" and that she was \"probably one of the worst victims [he] had seen.\" Her eye sockets and cheeks were swollen, her lip was cut, and there was redness around her neck, which appeared to be consistent with strangulation. The officer interviewed Victim and photographed her injuries. The next day, Victim visited a doctor. The doctor noted that her rib cage was \"very tender\" and that pain prevented her from being able to fully open her jaw. He also noted bruising on her upper chest, right leg, and lip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 A few days later, two police officers accompanied Victim on a walkthrough of her house to collect evidence. The police observed a handprint on the wall against which Defendant had strangled Victim. Directly underneath the handprint, where Victim had urinated, the officers noted that the carpet was discolored from an attempted cleaning. And in the laundry room, they found bedding with blood stains and torn clothing that matched Victim's description of what she had worn on the day of the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 The State charged Defendant with aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping, first-degree felonies; forcible sexual abuse, a second-degree felony; and aggravated assault, a third-degree felony. He was tried in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A jury found him guilty of all charges. He was sentenced to two consecutive fifteen-years-to-life sentences for his aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping convictions, and concurrent sentences of one-to-fifteen years and zero-to-five years for his forcible sexual abuse and aggravated assault convictions, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b613 Defendant raises six claims on appeal, three of which we do not address on the merits. First, he argues that the trial court erred in its application of rules 404(b) and 403 of the Utah Rules of Evidence when it admitted evidence of additional allegations of sexual assault made against him by other women. Due to a trial court's advantaged position over that of appellate courts \"to assess the avowed basis for evidence of prior misconduct-and to judge its likely effect in prejudicing or confusing the jury\"-we review a trial court's decision to admit evidence under rules 404(b) and 403 for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b614 Second, Defendant contends that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct when it made inappropriate comments during the rebuttal portion of its closing arguments. Generally, \"insofar as this issue was preserved, we will review the trial court's rulings on prosecutorial misconduct claims for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Fairbourn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345828\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/789/\">\n    2017 UT App 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345828\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/789/\">\n    405 P.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Otherwise, we typically review unpreserved issues only when a valid exception to the preservation rule applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, Defendant's counsel did not object to the allegedly inappropriate comments made by the State on the ground that they amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   And because Defendant has not argued that an exception to the preservation rule applies, we have no occasion to address the merits of this issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oseguera v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925440\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/332/963/\">\n    2014 UT 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925440\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/332/963/\">\n    332 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a party seeks review of an unpreserved objection, we require that the party articulate an appropriate justification for appellate review in the party's opening brief.\") (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 Third, Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial. We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion and reverse only if the court's decision \"is plainly wrong in that the incident so likely influenced the jury that the defendant cannot be said to have had a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But he focuses his argument on the merits of the claim and does not address this unpreserved issue through the lens of either of these exceptions. Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    True v.

However, as with his second and fourth claims, this issue is not preserved and we do not reach it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. 404(b) Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 In 2010, the State initially sought to admit 404(b) evidence that Defendant had similarly assaulted his then estranged-now ex-wife (GM). The State sought to have the evidence admitted for the non-character purpose of showing Defendant's intent and the absence of mistake. The trial court denied this motion. Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously granted the State's subsequent motion to admit evidence under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Specifically, he argues that it failed to sufficiently analyze the evidence under rule 403 before granting the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 The State filed its second motion to admit evidence under rule 404(b) in 2014. This time, in addition to the assault involving GM, the State sought to admit evidence of three other allegations of sexual assault made against Defendant by other women. The motion sought to have evidence concerning all four incidents admitted under the doctrine of chances to refute Defendant's claim that he acted in self-defense and that Victim had fabricated her account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 Concluding that the State sought to introduce the evidence for a proper non-character purpose, that the evidence was relevant, and that it would not unfairly prejudice Defendant, the trial court granted the State's motion to introduce evidence of the four instances of alleged misconduct. The allegations of sexual assault were made by four women in three different states over the span of sixteen years. In addition to GM, these witnesses were MM, AK, and AM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 MM accused Defendant of assaulting her while he was out on bond for attacking Victim. In 2013, MM met Defendant at a hotel in West Valley City, Utah, to give him a sensual massage that concluded with a \"hand job.\" Defendant had consumed alcohol that night, and while MM performed the latter portion of their arrangement, Defendant began pulling on her underwear. MM repeatedly told him \"no\" and pushed his hand away until Defendant, having become enraged, wrestled her to the floor. Defendant reacted to MM's screams by placing his hands around her neck with his thumbs in her mouth and strangling her. MM did not lose consciousness, but her vision \"went black,\" she saw \"stars,\" and she became \"dizzy.\" Defendant eventually let go of MM's throat and climbed off her, but he did not allow MM to get her phone. She was able to escape when the hotel's front desk attendant, responding to a noise complaint, interceded. Defendant was subsequently arrested and charged. Prior to trial in the instant case, but after the hearing on the State's second 404(b) motion, Defendant was convicted of assault and patronizing a prostitute in the case involving MM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 AK accused Defendant of sexually assaulting her in Kentucky in 2003. She and Defendant were friends and, on the night in question, the two went for a drive. AK drank whiskey and passed out during the drive. She did not remember whether Defendant also consumed alcohol. When she woke up, she found that her pants and underwear had been removed. Defendant then began insisting that she had promised \"to suck his penis\" and demanded that she make good on that promise. When AK refused, he hit her in the face with a folder and shoved her head down toward his penis, forcing it into her mouth. AK cried and begged him to let her go home. Defendant repeatedly hit her and, knowing\n   she had a phobia of water, threatened to drown her in a nearby creek if she did not stop crying. He forced her to sign a document stating that she consented to sex with him. He then laid her down in the front seat of the vehicle and vaginally raped her after unsuccessfully attempting to penetrate her anus. Following the rape, he drove AK to her mother's house. Defendant was not charged in connection with this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b624 AM accused Defendant of sexually assaulting her in Kentucky in 2001, when she was fifteen years old. She was the daughter of one of Defendant's friends. On the day of the assault, her father and Defendant returned from a bar \"pretty intoxicated\" and continued drinking in her house. Defendant attempted to dance with AM but, feeling uncomfortable, she refused. She later went to bed and was awakened by Defendant climbing on top of her. He inhibited her breathing by pressing his hand down hard against her face, fondled her breasts under her shirt, kissed her neck, and touched her genitals. AM eventually succeeded in freeing her mouth by biting Defendant's hand, and she screamed to her father for help. Her father ran into the room and pulled Defendant off her. She ran into another bedroom, but Defendant pursued, tackled, and touched her again. AM's father once more managed to pull him away from her. AM then ran to a neighbor's house. Defendant again pursued AM, attempted to break into the neighbor's house, and assaulted the neighbor's husband. Defendant was charged with sexual abuse of AM and with assault of the neighbor's husband. A jury convicted Defendant on the assault charge, but it could not reach a verdict on the sexual abuse charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b625 GM accused Defendant of assaulting her in Florida in 1997.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   She and Defendant were married but separated at the time of the alleged assault. One early morning in June, Defendant broke into her house. He smelled of alcohol and wanted to talk. When she refused, he grabbed her by the arm, said \"okay, no more talk,\" and dragged her into an unoccupied bedroom. During the hours-long sexual assault that ensued, Defendant twice vaginally raped GM, attempted anal penetration, and sat on her chest and forced his penis into her mouth. Defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault. Two months later, while out on bond, Defendant again broke into GM's house. This time, GM pulled a gun from underneath her pillow and shot him five times. The State of Florida entered into a plea deal with Defendant in which Defendant pled guilty to one count of second-degree burglary in exchange for the dismissal of the aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault charges. This generous deal-or so the Utah prosecutor suggested in the case before us-was the product of the five bullet holes that Defendant sustained in the course of the second intrusion into GM's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b626 In conjunction with the testimonies of MM, AK, and AM, the State called a statistician as an expert witness. The statistician testified that there is a 0.0004% chance of a person being arrested for rape or attempted rape in Utah. The probability of being twice accused of or arrested for rape or attempted rape was one in four million; thrice was one in eight billion; four times was one in sixteen trillion; and five times was one in thirty-two quadrillion. The odds of being falsely accused of rape or attempted rape on five separate occasions were further increased, according to the expert, when similar claims of alcohol consumption or strangulation were factored into the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b627 Rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence generally permits evidence of a defendant's other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts so long as the evidence has a \"probative value other than to show an evil propensity or criminal temperament.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mistrial Motions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b634 Defendant next appeals the trial court's denial of his motions for a mistrial. He contends that unfairly prejudicial information was presented to the jury, the trial court's curative measures were ineffective, and the court therefore abused its discretion in denying his motions. Defendant's trial counsel first moved for a mistrial after Victim testified that GM shot Defendant five times-evidence the trial court had previously ruled inadmissible unless Defendant first opened the door to it. The testimony in question was given on the second day of trial and was elicited in the following manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [The State]: At the time that you reported this assault to the Smithfield Police Department were you aware of any general allegation that [GM] had made against this defendant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Victim]: That they had filed for divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [The State]: Well, I'm talking about like a criminal accusation. Were you aware that she had accused him of any crimes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [Victim]: I understand she shot him five times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b635 Following this exchange, Defendant's counsel moved for a mistrial. The court ruled that although the State had not intentionally elicited Victim's improper response, the reference to GM having shot Defendant five times unfairly prejudiced his defense. Nevertheless, the trial court determined that the prejudice could be cured. As a remedial measure, the court precluded the State from presenting GM's testimony against Defendant, thereby reducing the number of prior assaults the jury would hear about from four to three. The court also struck from the record all questions and answers between the State and Victim regarding GM and instructed the jury to disregard the stricken exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b636 At the conclusion of that day of trial, one juror asked for the name of Defendant's ex-wife. After the court stated that it already provided the name in its curative instruction, the juror responded, \"We can remember her name. We just can't remember anything else.\" The court responded, \"No. You don't even need to remember her name. You don't even need to consider anything about [GM].\" Defendant's trial counsel subsequently renewed his motion for a mistrial asserting that, despite the court's curative instruction, the jury was still considering Victim's testimony regarding GM. The trial court denied the renewed motion, stating that the jury was \"trying to understand and follow [the court's] instruction.\" \"Really,\" according to the court, \"the question was 'do we forget her name?,' \" and the question \"didn't go to anything else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b637 Appellate courts accord great deference to a trial court's ruling on a motion for a mistrial given \"the advantaged position of the trial judge to determine the impact of events occurring in the courtroom on the total proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the State brought its second 404(b) motion, it sought to introduce evidence of three allegations in addition to that of GM for the purpose of rebutting Defendant's claim that Victim fabricated her account. When presented with the second motion, the trial court found that the new purpose-to rebut a charge of fabrication-and the increased number of roughly similar allegations of sexual misconduct made against Defendant greatly enhanced the probative value of the evidence.

In applying the Doctrine to rebut a defense of accident, it is often easy to discern what the \"rare misfortune\" is-for instance, the death of a bride in a bathtub, or the mistaken taking of a horse. In applying the Doctrine to rebut a defense of fabrication, however, it is not as easy to discern what the \"rare misfortune\" is that triggers application of the Doctrine. As near as I can tell, the \"rare misfortune\" in this context must be either (a) that the defendant has been\n   <em>\n    falsely\n   </em>\n   accused of nonconsensual sexual assault on multiple occasions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (describing the State's argument as that it is \"highly unlikely that three victims would independently fabricate similar accounts of unwanted sexual contact\"), or (b) that the defendant has merely been accused-whether falsely or accurately-of nonconsensual sexual assault on previous occasions,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (stating that the Doctrine might be applied \"based on the low probability that multiple victims would independently accuse the defendant of similar assaults\").

But I have yet to find a doctrine of chances case in which any evidence was put on that, in previous cases, the defendant was\n   <em>\n    falsely\n   </em>\n   accused of sexual assault. (No prosecutor in her right mind would want to do such a thing, presumably because jurors might think that, if it happened before, it might have happened again.)

As a matter of logic, then, if the State seeks to introduce evidence of previous\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   accusations of sexual assault pursuant to the Doctrine, the triggering event of \"rare misfortune\" cannot possibly be the fact that the defendant was\n   <em>\n    falsely\n   </em>\n   accused of sexual assault in previous cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b659 But using previous accusations-regardless of their truth or falsity-as the \"rare\" triggering event also suffers from logical problems. If one assumes that the accusations are true, and that the defendant actually committed the previous sexual assaults, it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish such evidence from straight-up propensity evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Melilli, at 1568 (pointing out that \"the explanation for the [Doctrine] in the multiple-accusers context is simply a convoluted explanation of the general propensity inference,\" because \"[e]ach separate accusation would have no bearing upon the accuracy of another allegation\n   but for the conclusion that the multiple accusations demonstrate a cross-situational pattern of behavior, which is but a variation on the taboo inference of a general propensity or character trait\"). And if one stops short of assuming that the accusations are true, and simply uses accusations-regardless of their truth or falsity-as the \"rare\" triggering event, that brings its own set of logical problems. As one commentator astutely points out, there is \"something awry with rules of evidence that permit the trier of fact in a rape case to infer guilt based merely on prior accusations of rape, but, at least in principle, ordinarily will not allow the trier of fact to infer guilt based on the fact that the accused is actually guilty of rape on prior occasions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b660 The other problem I see with application of the Doctrine to rebut a defense of fabrication is that such application allows the introduction of probability evidence for the avowed purpose of demonstrating that the complaining witness is more likely to be telling the truth. Our law allows such evidence in no other context, and it does not appear that our supreme court has ever examined the extent to which\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with its other jurisprudence around this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b661 Decades ago, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the Doctrine is used to rebut a defense of fabrication, the prior bad acts evidence is admitted precisely because that evidence makes it more likely, from a probability standpoint, that the complaining witness is telling the truth. I cannot see a principled way to reconcile\n   <em>\n    Rammel\n   </em>\n   's rule forbidding the introduction of probability-based evidence in this context with\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   's application of the Doctrine to allow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b664 In the case before us, the trial court allowed three witnesses to testify that Defendant sexually assaulted them on previous occasions and, in addition, the court allowed a statistician to testify that there is a 0.0004 percent chance of a person being arrested even once for rape or attempted rape in\n   Utah, and that the chances of such a thing happening to the same person four times was 1 in 16 trillion. The trial court admitted this evidence pursuant to the Doctrine, because the State offered it, in part, to rebut Defendant's claim that Victim had fabricated her account of the events in question. In this opinion, we affirm that decision, and I concur in that result because Defendant does not ask us to re-examine the applicability of the Doctrine in this context and, in any event, we are bound to follow the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b665 But I have reservations about employing the Doctrine, in a case like this, to admit evidence of Defendant's prior bad acts. For the reasons set forth, I wonder whether application of the Doctrine in this context might warrant re-examination, specifically regarding whether such application is at odds with the historical ban on propensity evidence as well as the longstanding rule against admission of probability evidence to speak to a witness's credibility. Decisions about whether to re-examine\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   , or to enact a version of rule 413 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -two very divergent pathways-will be made above my pay grade. But I have concerns about whether we can or should continue down our current path, in which we routinely \"allow[ ] character evidence to reach the jury while maintaining the pious fiction that we follow the character evidence rule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Melilli, at 1569.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    One case in point: the lead opinion in this case describes rule 404(b) as a rule of\n    <em>\n     inclusion\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 27 (stating that rule 404(b)\"generally permits evidence of a defendant's other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts so long as the evidence has a probative value other than to show an evil propensity or criminal temperament\" (quotation simplified)).
