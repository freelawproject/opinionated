A claimant cannot prove that an injury arose out of employment if the injury resulted solely from an idiopathic fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The distinction between an unexplained fall and an idiopathic fall frames the parties' dispute in this case. Claimant fell on her way to work while walking through the lobby of an office building where employer leased office space. As a result of the fall, claimant fractured a bone in her shoulder. Paramedics responded, and claimant told them that she had been \"walking and then her foot got caught and she tripped and fell.\" Claimant was transported by ambulance to a hospital, and she told an emergency room nurse that \"her foot rolled and she tripped and fell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claimant filed a workers' compensation claim, which employer denied. Claimant then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the hearing, claimant testified that she fell because she tripped over something. Claimant did not know what caused her to trip, but she suspected that her foot got caught on the lip of a floor tile because she was unable to identify any other hazards in the lobby that could have caused her fall. Claimant admitted that the tile lip was not \"real big.\" Employer's investigator determined that the tile had \"the slightest of a lip,\" probably around 1/16th of an inch, a measurement that sounded correct to claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Employer contended that claimant's injuries were not compensable because her fall could have been caused by idiopathic factors, specifically, claimant's diabetes and obesity. In support of its contention, employer submitted a letter opinion by a physician, Dr. Bell. Bell had reviewed claimant's medical records but had never examined claimant personally. Based on her review of claimant's records, Bell opined that claimant's diabetes was a \"potential contributing cause\" in her fall because diabetes\"is known to cause peripheral neuropathy\" and \"[p]eripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities *** affects sensation and reflexes.\" Bell also opined that claimant's obesity was \"a potential contributing factor\" in her fall because it \"most likely affected her balance and mobility.\" Bell concluded that \"symptomatic manifestations of diabetes and obesity could have caused [claimant] to fall.\" She further concluded that it was \"at least equally possible [claimant's] fall *** was caused by idiopathic problems associated with diabetes and/or obesity as it was due to risks associated with employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Claimant testified that she had never been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy. She admitted that she had experienced \"some tingling\" in her feet in the past, but she denied that that tingling had ever caused her to fall. Claimant testified that she had never experienced balance\n   or mobility problems because of her obesity. In addition, she reported that she had scored in the \"high 90 percent range\" in post-injury balance testing and was determined not to be at risk of falling. In her testimony, claimant also mentioned an additional medical condition; she reported that she had broken her ankle decades earlier and had experienced some intermittent weakness and swelling in that ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claimant submitted a letter opinion and testimony from her primary care physician, Dr. Kelly. Kelly had been claimant's primary care physician for 10 years before her fall. He stated that claimant had no history of problems with balance or mobility and that he had observed her walking without any impaired balance or mobility on numerous occasions. Kelly also stated that, although claimant was taking medication for hypertension\n   that can cause lightheadedness, she had never reported that the medication had caused her to feel lightheaded. Kelly acknowledged that claimant's diabetes, obesity, ankle weakness, and medication had the \"potential\" to have contributed to her fall. But he emphasized that he had \"no way of knowing\" either whether they actually contributed to the fall or whether it was \"equally possible\" that the fall was caused by personal risks as risks associated with employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the hearing, the ALJ issued a written opinion and order, noting that Bell had \"only suggested that it was 'possible' for claimant's medical conditions to have contributed to her fall,\" and that Kelly \"had no information from which to conclude\" that claimant's medical conditions were \"more than potential causes\" of her fall. Given that evidence, the ALJ concluded that the possibility that claimant's medical conditions caused her fall was \"speculative\" and, therefore, claimant had \"eliminated idiopathic causes\" of her fall. Specifically, the ALJ concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Since the alleged personal/idiopathic risks offered are speculative, they are less than equally likely to have caused the fall as Claimant's explanation of a tripping incident. I find therefore that Claimant has eliminated idiopathic causes for her fall.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ then turned to the question of whether claimant had established that her injury occurred \"in the course of\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   her employment, and concluded that she had not, because she had been on her way to work and employer did not have control over the lobby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the ALJ affirmed employer's denial of claimant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The board also affirmed employer's denial of the claim, but on a different ground. As an initial matter, the board noted that the fall was not the result of an employment risk both because claimant did not argue that an employment risk contributed to her injury and because the board \"found no such employment contribution,\" thus rejecting any suggestion that the 1/16th-inch lip on the lobby tile caused the fall.\n   <em>\n    Catherine A.

The positional-risk doctrine, according to a leading treatise, states that an injury resulting from a neutral risk is deemed to arise out of employment \" 'if the conditions of employment put claimant in a position to be injured.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Arthur Larson, 1A\n   <em>\n    Workmen's Compensation Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7.00, 3-11 (1978)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the positional-risk doctrine, the causal connection between the injury and the employment is established because, but for the claimant's employment, the claimant would not have encountered that neutral risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the other hand, the\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   decision appears to reason that unexplained falls may be deemed to arise out of employment because, when the cause of the fall is unknown, the fall might have been caused by an employment risk, rather than a neutral risk. The court described employment risks as the \"ordinary risk[s] of employment,\" and stated that \"where idiopathic causes for an unexplained fall have been eliminated, the inference arises that the fall was traceable to some ordinary risk, albeit unidentified, to which the employment premises exposed the employee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At any given time, an employment environment might expose an employee to both employment risks and neutral risks. But if \"ordinary risk\" refers to employment risk, rather than neutral risk, then that sentence in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   could be read as suggesting that injuries resulting from unexplained falls arise out of employment based on an inference\n   that some employment risk caused the injury. By treating an unexplained fall as being caused by an employment risk, that reasoning breaks down the distinction between employment risks and neutral risks, because unexplained falls are supposed to be treated as neutral risks. That reasoning is also inconsistent with the positional-risk doctrine. Under the positional-risk doctrine, there is no need for an inference that a neutral risk might have been an employment risk because the necessary causal connection is established by the fact that the claimant's employment put the claimant in a position to be injured by the neutral risk, regardless of whether that risk was distinctly associated with the employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Any confusion within\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   has been resolved by later decisions.

We therefore continue that line of cases and apply the positional-risk doctrine to determine whether injuries resulting from neutral risks may be deemed to arise out of employment. The positional-risk doctrine establishes the standard of proof\n   that a claimant must satisfy to prove that injuries resulting from an unexplained fall arose out of employment. As described above, a claimant may satisfy the positional-risk doctrine by proving that a fall is unexplained and that it occurred in the course of employment. Thus, a finding by the board that a fall is unexplained and that it occurred in the course of employment is a finding that a claimant has proved that an injury arose out of employment. In the same way, a finding by the board that a fall resulted from an employment risk is also a finding that a claimant has proved that an injury arose out\n   of employment, and a finding by the board that a fall resulted solely from a personal risk is a finding that a claimant has failed to prove that an injury arose out of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this case, however, the parties disagree about a threshold question that was not disputed in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   -namely, whether claimant's fall is unexplained and whether claimant has eliminated the idiopathic causes of her fall. And much of the parties' disagreement turns on attempting to understand what the\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   court meant by the phrase \"eliminate idiopathic causes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties' arguments on this point are difficult to decipher. It appears as though employer agrees with the version of the standard that the board applied, while claimant agrees with the version of the standard that the Court of Appeals applied. For the purpose of assessing standards, there are two separate issues: (1) which idiopathic causes does a claimant need to eliminate; and (2) what does it mean to eliminate those idiopathic causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the first issue, the phrase \"eliminate idiopathic causes\" raises the question of whether a claimant must eliminate all theoretically possible idiopathic causes or some smaller subset of idiopathic causes. In this case, the Court of Appeals was concerned that the board required claimant to eliminate all theoretically possible idiopathic causes.\n   <em>\n    Sheldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n    281 Or.

There is almost always going to be some theoretically possible explanation that cannot be disproven. So, if a factfinder were required to consider all theoretically possible explanations for an injury, then a factfinder would likely never conclude that an accident is unexplained. If a factfinder would likely never conclude that an accident is unexplained, then unexplained accidents would be, in effect, non-compensable. Such an approach is at odds with this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   , which recognized the compensability of unexplained accidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Despite its criticism of the board's order, the Court of Appeals did not attempt to identify some subset of idiopathic causes that a claimant is required to eliminate. Instead, the Court of Appeals addressed the second issue identified above-namely, what it means to eliminate those idiopathic causes that the claimant is required to eliminate. As to that issue, the Court of Appeals concluded that, for a claimant to eliminate idiopathic causes, the claimant must \"prove that idiopathic factors were less likely to have caused her fall than some other, unexplained factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n    281 Or.

Similarly, the court stated, \"In the context of an unexplained fall, that means that a claimant must establish that idiopathic factors are less than equally likely as work-related factors to have caused the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n    at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n    381 P.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   That standard appears to be based on this court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   that injuries resulting from a fall are not compensable \"where it is equally possible that its cause was idiopathic or work-related.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    296 Or. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statement makes sense when comparing identifiable idiopathic risk factors and identifiable employment risk factors or even identifiable neutral risk factors. Under those circumstances, one explanation can be weighed against the other. That is consistent with how we usually think about proving what caused an event. We often think about proof, in that context, as\n   establishing that one explanation for the event is more likely than another explanation or that one explanation is the likeliest explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But determining whether an event is explained or unexplained presents a different calculus. The very idea of proving that an event is unexplained is an awkward one. When an event is unexplained, it is because there is an absence of evidence supporting any explanation. Thus, because an unexplained fall is supported by an absence of evidence, there is no evidence to weigh against the evidence supporting an idiopathic explanation for a fall. In other words, determining the likelihood that a particular risk caused a particular event requires knowing something about the likelihood that the event could have been caused by some other risk. But when those other risks are unknown, there is no way to measure the likelihood of those risks exactly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In light of those considerations, we can construct a broader framework within which to understand both which idiopathic causes need to be eliminated and what it means to eliminate those idiopathic causes. Determining whether a fall is explained or unexplained is not a matter of determining which explanation is the best explanation or even which explanation is the likeliest explanation. Instead, determining whether a fall is explained or unexplained is a matter of determining whether there are any nonspeculative explanations. If there is a nonspeculative explanation, then that explanation prevents the claimant from establishing that the fall is unexplained. If there is no nonspeculative explanation available, then the fall is unexplained. Therefore, to prove that a fall is unexplained, the claimant must prove that there is no nonspeculative explanation for the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Within that framework, the phrase \"eliminate idiopathic causes\" has a more concrete meaning that is consistent with its use in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   . Ultimately, to establish an unexplained fall, a claimant must prove that there are no nonspeculative explanations for a fall. Eliminating idiopathic causes is an intermediate step that arises only when the record reveals facially nonspeculative idiopathic explanations for a fall. If there are no facially nonspeculative idiopathic causes for explaining a fall, then there are no idiopathic causes for a claimant to eliminate. But if there are some facially nonspeculative idiopathic causes for explaining a fall, then the claimant must offer countering evidence sufficient to convince the board that the proposed idiopathic cause is, in fact, speculative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, to address the two issues identified above, a claimant is required to eliminate facially nonspeculative idiopathic explanations for a fall. And a claimant eliminates those idiopathic explanations by providing sufficient countering evidence to demonstrate that those idiopathic explanations are speculative in light of all admissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   That is what happened in\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   . The record in that case revealed that the claimant suffered from vertigo. To the extent that the claimant's vertigo established a facially nonspeculative idiopathic explanation for the fall, both the board and the Court of Appeals concluded that the claimant satisfactorily countered that evidence with his own testimony that he did not experience any symptoms of vertigo immediately before his fall and with his physician's testimony \"discount[ing] any pre-existing condition or weakness that could have caused [the] claimant to fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Livesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    296 Or. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on \"the medical reports and lay testimony,\" the board and the Court of Appeals concluded that the claimant \"persuasively eliminated all idiopathic factors of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8641707\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/296/25/#p32\">\n    672 P.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, to determine that a fall is unexplained, the board must find that there is no nonspeculative explanation for the fall. Based on the record before us, it appears that the board did not apply that legal standard, which is needed to determine whether claimant's injury arose out of her employment. As a result, the board failed to properly determine whether claimant's injury is compensable, which requires both that the injury arose out of employment and that it occurred in the course of employment. We therefore vacate the board's order and remand to determine whether claimant's injury is compensable. That conclusion is consistent with the result reached by the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Sheldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190103\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/560/#p571\">\n    281 Or.
