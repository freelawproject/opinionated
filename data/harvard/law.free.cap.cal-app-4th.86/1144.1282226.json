Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">This is an appeal from a summary judgment entered below in favor of the defendant and respondent in a Marvin-type of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court held that the <em>Marvin </em>doctrine did not apply because, notwithstanding the fact that the parties cohabited and, indeed, later married, the alleged agreement regarding respondent\u2019s property also anticipated appellant \u201cbearing a child.\u201d The court concluded that the agreement thus necessarily involved sexual intercourse and was therefore unenforceable because \u201cdependent upon a meretricious consideration.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Joseph Della Zoppa (hereafter Joseph)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was a relatively wealthy 48-year-old man who, in 1988, was engaged in the garbage business in Solano and Contra Costa Counties. In that year, he met Celeste Concannon (later Celeste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>Della Zoppa, hereafter Celeste) who, at that time, was 22 years old. Both were single at the time; Joseph had been married twice before, but both marriages had ended in divorce and neither had produced any children.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Starting, apparently, in the fall of 1988, the couple began dating regularly. Among other things, they occasionally traveled together and, according to Celeste, they \u201cspent time together overnight a lot at his place . . . .\u201d During this year, Joseph importuned Celeste to move in with him permanently. She initially resisted, asserting that she \u201cdid not want to move in unless we were going to have a long range permanent husband and wife type of relationship.\u201d However, in October or November 1989, she did in fact move into Joseph\u2019s home and, in her words, the two \u201cstarted living together by mutual agreement as Husband and Wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">This included, Celeste set forth to the trial court, \u201cspending almost all of our time with each other, acquiring things together, entertaining, getting rid of things together, having the freedom to make decisions for the both of us, making plans for traveling together, discussing (and to the extent we could do so, implementing) hopes and dreams and fears and future plans, making joint decisions on a host of different things, etc. [ID \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Instead of just being a couple who dated, did not concentrate on the strengthening of each other, and had separate lives, we merged our lives, our activities, our plans, our hopes, our dreams, our work, our energies for the joint benefit of each of us and, more importantly, for our future together. flD We agreed that we were thereafter building our future together\u2014personal, family, social contacts, community activities, our joint assets, debts and everything else was thereafter being done as husband and wife\u2014not for Joe, not for Celeste, but for our joint benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Included in Celeste\u2019s agreed-upon responsibilities were such matters as preparing meals, managing the home generally, arranging for remodeling, including arranging for new carpeting, furniture, artwork and appliances in, and painting of, the home. Joseph, in addition to his employment, generally managed the investments of the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Celeste alleged that, in consideration of her moving in and commencing \u201cliving together ... as Husband and Wife,\u201d it was agreed between them, and understood, that \u201call property acquired [with either party\u2019s skills, efforts, labor or earnings] were to be treated as their joint property.\u201d She added, in answers to interrogatories: \u201cAs mentioned above, Joe and I in everything we did merged our skills, efforts, labor and earnings as our joint property. There was no reason for Joe to transfer title of any properties to my name as I trusted him completely to do what he said, that is to manage and control the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>assets we had for our joint benefit. It did not matter to Joe or to me in whose name an asset was held, we were committing our entire beings, our fiber, our energies, our assets, our time, our talents, to build our future together. . . . HQ . . .We just did what we had said we would do and built a life together and this included the assets that were being acquired during that period, primarily by and through Joe\u2019s actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">An integral part of the basic agreement, Celeste acknowledged in the trial court, was a commitment to try to \u201chave a family.\u201d \u201cJoe wanted me to get pregnant and have his children, to stop using birth control.\u201d And, indeed, they did: Celeste became pregnant in, apparently, late 1990; their first child, Joseph, Jr., was born in August 1991. During her pregnancy, she started using the surname Della Zoppa at certain times. The parties married in April 1992 and two more children, twin girls, were born to them in November 1996. Celeste apparently filed a dissolution action in January 1998 and, in the course of that action, Joseph asserted various separate property claims. As a result, Celeste filed this Marvin-style complaint in September 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The complaint alleged causes of action for, among other things, a constructive trust and a resulting trust covering all of Joseph\u2019s assets and an adjudication that Celeste held equitable title to an undivided 50 percent ownership interest in all of the real and personal property accumulated by the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Joseph filed a general demurrer and a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint. He argued, in support of both, that the parties\u2019 subsequent marriage vitiated any Marvin-type claim, and that any and all property accumulated during the marriage was subject to distribution under, and only under, the Family Law Act. The trial court denied Joseph\u2019s general demurrer, but granted his motion to strike. As a result, this action became limited to income and properties owned and received before the parties\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In November 1999, Joseph filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that, since the alleged <em>Marvin </em>agreement included the bearing of children, it was based upon an illicit, meretricious, sexual relationship, rendering the consideration unlawful under Civil Code section 1667.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Celeste, naturally, opposed the motion and also moved for leave to amend her complaint. The trial court denied the latter motion and granted Joseph\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It held: \u201cThe agreement between the parties to share ownership of property in exchange for bearing a child is an unenforceable contract. It is dependent upon meretricious consideration, as it is based upon sexual conduct, [^j In the alternative, if it is based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>promise to bear children, it is an unenforceable promise. [Citation.] As stated in <em>Marvin[, supra,] </em>18 Cal.3d 660, a contract between nonmarital partners is invalid only if sexual acts form an inseparable part of the consideration for this agreement. The undisputed evidence in this case shows that sexual conduct does indeed form an inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The trial court thereafter entered judgment in favor of Joseph and, later, denied motions for reconsideration and for a new trial. A timely notice of appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">\u201cSummary judgment is proper when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Barkley </em>v. <em>City of Blue Lake </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 309, 313 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 679].) \u201cSince a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, we independently review them on appeal, applying the same three-step analysis required of the trial court.\u201d <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203].) We must identify the issues framed by the pleadings, determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent\u2019s claims, and determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1064-1065.) \u201cOn appeal our review is limited to the facts shown in the documents presented to the trial judge in making our independent determination of their construction and effect as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Bonus-Bilt, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Grocers, Ltd. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 429, 442 [186 Cal.Rptr. 357].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">As noted above, the trial court granted summary judgment on two closely related bases. First, it ruled that the alleged agreement between Joseph and Celeste was \u201can unenforceable contract\u201d because it was dependent upon \u201cmeretricious consideration, as it is based upon sexual conduct.\u201d Alternatively, the court said, if the consideration was \u201ca promise to bear children, it is an unenforceable promise\u201d because \u201csexual conduct does indeed form an inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement.\u201d In addition to <em>Marvin, </em>the court cited in support of this conclusion <em>Hill v. Estate of Westbrook </em>(1950) 95 Cal.App.2d 599 [213 P.2d 727] <em>(Hill) </em>and excerpts from the deposition of Celeste that were filed in support of Joseph\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">We profoundly disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>The starting point is, of course, our Supreme Court\u2019s landmark holding in <em>Marvin </em>which, as almost all knowledgeable Californians know, held that \u201cnonmarital partners\u201d may enter into an enforceable agreement to share property. It stated: \u201c[W]e base our opinion on the principle that adults who voluntarily live together and engage in sexual relations are nonetheless as competent as any other persons to contract respecting their earnings and property rights. ... So long as the agreement does not rest upon illicit meretricious consideration, the parties may order their economic affairs as they choose . . . .\u201d <em>(Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">A key premise of the <em>Marvin </em>holding was the fact that the parties were cohabiting. Indeed, the most recent California authority to interpret and apply <em>Marvin </em>has commented: \u201cSince <em>Marvin, </em>case law has held recovery by an unmarried partner under <em>Marvin </em>requires a showing of a stable and significant relationship arising out of cohabitation.\u201d <em>(Bergen v. Wood </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 854, 857 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 75]; to the same effect, see <em>Taylor v. Fields </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 653, 663 [224 Cal.Rptr. 186] [cohabitation is a \u201cprerequisite\u201d] and <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Alderson </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 450, 456, 461 [225 Cal.Rptr. 610] (Alderson) [trial court\u2019s finding of an enforceable <em>Marvin-type </em>of relationship affirmed where the parties cohabited for 12 years and \u201cheld themselves out socially, as well as otherwise, as husband and wife. . . .\u201d].) Clearly, the parties here satisfied this paramount requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">But, as noted in the foregoing passage from that opinion, the <em>Marvin </em>court repeatedly noted that an exception may arise as and when the arrangement is expressly \u201cmeretricious.\u201d Indeed, this somewhat arcane term is used multiple times in the course of the majority opinion in that case. Fortunately, the court also suggested rather plainly what the term meant. Discussing the little prior California authority on the nonmarital partner issue, the court said: \u201c[T]he nonenforceability of agreements expressly providing for meretricious conduct rested upon the fact that such conduct, <em>as the word suggests, pertained to and encompassed prostitution.\u2019'\u2019 (Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 683, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Various dictionaries confirm that the term \u201cmeretricious\u201d does, indeed, refer to prostitution. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1965) at page 1413 defines it as \u201cof or relating to a prostitute; having a harlot\u2019s traits.\u201d Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1970) at page 530 defines it as \u201cof or relating to a prostitute.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary (2d college ed. 1982) at page 787 defines it as meaning \u201c[pjertaining to or resembling a prostitute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Several <em>post-Marvin </em>cases have confirmed that, in this state, the term relates to prostitution. Thus, in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Fields, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d 653, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>the court followed its use of the word with a footnote referencing this definition provided in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1942) at page 1539: \u201c \u2018Of, pert[aining] to, characteristic of, or being, a prostitute; having to do with harlots; . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Taylor v. Fields, supra, </em>at p. 658, fn. 2; see also, to the same effect, <em>Whorton </em>v. <em>Dillingham </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d. 447, 451 [248 Cal.Rptr. 405] <em>(Whorton).)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In attempting to tie the facts of the case before it to the \u201cmeretricious\u201d exception articulated in <em>Marvin, </em>the trial court cited <em>Hill, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 599. In that <em>pre-Marvin </em>case, the appellate court reversed a lower court judgment granting relief to a woman who first worked as a servant for a man, and later lived with him as man and wife and, indeed, bore him two children. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.) But <em>Marvin </em>itself carefully distinguished <em>Hill </em>and effectively refused to follow it. In its opinion in <em>Marvin, </em>the court first characterized <em>Hill </em>as a decision involving \u201ccontracts between nonmarital partners involving] consideration that <em>was </em>expressly founded upon illicit sexual services.\u201d <em>(Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 671.) It then went on to say that <em>Hill </em>and a similar case \u201cdemonstrate that a contract between nonmarital partners, even if expressly made in contemplation of a common living arrangement, is invalid only if sexual acts form an inseparable part of the consideration for the agreement. In sum, a court will not enforce a contract for the pooling of property and earnings if it is explicitly and inseparably based upon services as a paramour. The Court of Appeal opinion in <em>Hill, </em>however, indicates that even if sexual services are part of the contractual consideration, any <em>severable </em>portion of the contract supported by independent consideration will still be enforced.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Indeed, later in its opinion, the <em>Marvin </em>court made clear that its philosophy was quite different from that of the appellate court in <em>Hill. </em>Thus, in the sentence immediately following its semidefinition of \u201cmeretricious,\u201d it said: \u201cTo equate the nonmarital relationship of today to such a subject matter is to do violence to an accepted and wholly different practice.\u201d <em>(Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">To precisely the same effect is a decision from this appellate district which neither party cites, <em>Alderson, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 450. In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>Division Three of this district, through the late Justice Merrill, affirmed a judgment which had divided equally the property of a nonmarital couple who had cohabited for 12 years, had three children, and had acquired substantial investment property. Relying on and quoting substantially from <em>Marvin, </em>the appellate court affirmed this judgment. It first noted that there was clearly substantial evidence in the record to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding of a Marvin-type agreement, including \u201cJonne\u2019s [the plaintiff woman\u2019s] testimony to this effect; the fact that the parties held themselves out socially, as well as otherwise, as husband and wife; the fact that Jonne and the couple\u2019s three children, in fact, took Steve\u2019s surname; the fact that the pair pooled their financial resources and then drew upon the same to purchase the subject properties; the fact that the decision to purchase said properties was, in most cases, made jointly; the fact of Jonne\u2019s participation in the properties other than financial (she kept the books on the properties, helped repair and fix up the properties, paid the bills and collected the rents) . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 461.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The defendant obviously argued to the appellate court, as Joseph does here, that there was a significant \u201cmeretricious\u201d component to the relationship, which entitled him to reversal. The court flatly disagreed: \u201cEvidence that consideration for the implied agreement between the parties did not rest on meretricious sexual services includes the absence of any evidence to the contrary and Jonne\u2019s own testimony. Said testimony establishes that the implied agreement between Jonne and Steve was very general and nonspecific. The parties never bothered to actually spell out the terms of their agreement or the consideration therefor. Jonne testified that her part of the consideration was to be Steve\u2019s wife and to do \u2018whatever a wife does.\u2019 However, she also said, \u2018if you took one specific thing away, there [were] so many other things that we both did, one wouldn\u2019t make any difference, or two or three.\u2019 HQ Such an agreement can hardly be deemed the type disapproved in <em>Marvin. A </em>contract based on \u2018many . . . things,\u2019 no one of which is in itself crucial, is not the same as one based upon a consideration of meretricious sexual services. Before a nonmarital contract is to be deemed unenforceable under <em>Marvin, </em>it must be found to explicitly rest upon a consideration of meretricious sexual services and even then the contract will fail \u2018only to the extent\u2019 that it does so. Here, there is no evidence that the agreement between Jonne and Steve, or any part thereof, explicitly rests upon such a consideration. HQ Nor does the fact that the couple engaged in sexual relations and that Jonne perceived this as part of her \u2018role\u2019 alter this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>conclusion. As the <em>Marvin </em>court pointed out, the fact that a man and woman live together without marriage, and engage in a sexual relationship, does not in itself invalidate agreements between them relating to their earnings, property or expenses. [Citation.] <em>In today\u2019s society when so many couples are living together without the benefit of marriage vows, it would be illogical to deny them the ability to enter into enforceable agreements in respect to their property rights.\u201d (Alderson, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at pp. 462-463, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Essentially this same point was reiterated two years later by one of our sister courts in <em>Whorton, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d 447, a case involving a terminated same-sex relationship litigated under the <em>Marvin </em>doctrine. Again the appellate court held, citing to <em>Marvin, </em>that the fact that there is a sexual component of the overall relationship does not vitiate application of <em>Marvin </em>if the arrangement is not meretricious: \u201cAdults who voluntarily live together and engage in sexual relations are competent to contract respecting their earnings and property rights. Such contracts will be enforced \u2018unless expressly and inseparably based upon an illicit consideration of sexual services . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] One cannot lawfully contract to pay for the performance of sexual services since such an agreement is in essence a bargain for prostitution. [Citation.] [1Q A standard which inquires whether an agreement involves or contemplates a sexual relationship is vague and unworkable because virtually all agreements between nonmarital (and certainly, marital) cohabitors involve or contemplate a mutual sexual relationship. Further, a compact is not totally invalid merely because the parties may have contemplated creating or continuing a sexual relationship, but is invalid only to the extent it rests upon a consideration of sexual services. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Whorton, </em>at p. 451.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Resisting this reasoning, Joseph argues that the relationship between the parties in this case was meretricious because, \u201cunder the alleged agreement, [Joseph] agreed to provide [Celeste] with an ownership interest in assets and to share income in exchange for Celeste\u2019s agreement to become pregnant and bear his children. It is undisputed that the agreement to become pregnant was an essential term of the contract; that her rights to share in the property, income, and accumulations was dependent upon her agreement to become pregnant and to bear children; that agreement contemplated the rendition of sexual services; and, of particular importance, the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>agreement did not separate the consideration due to [Celeste] for her agreement to become pregnant and bear [Joseph\u2019s] children from any other consideration.\u201d (Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In support of this argument, Joseph relies principally on <em>Hill </em>and, secondarily, on Civil Code section 1667. That section, which commences title IV of the Civil Code (entitled \u201cUnlawful Contracts\u201d) provides: \u201cThat is not lawful which is: [\u00b6] 1. Contrary to an express provision of law; [\u00b6] ... or [\u00b6] 3. Otherwise contrary to good morals.\u201d Joseph argues that the agreement violates both subsections. He seems to suggest that the holding of our Supreme Court in <em>Marvin </em>is tantamount to \u201can express provision of law\u201d and that the arrangement between the parties involved here was \u201ccontrary to good morals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We categorically reject both contentions. The phrase \u201cexpress provision of law\u201d clearly refers to a statute and, in response to the \u201ccontrary to good morals\u201d assertion, we can only refer Joseph and his counsel again to the words of Justice Merrill: \u201cIn today\u2019s society when so many couples are living together without the benefit of marriage vows, it would be illogical to deny them the ability to enter into enforceable agreements in respect to their property rights.\" (Alderson, <em>supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 463; see also <em>Marvin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 683.) If this point had validity in 1986, as we think it clearly did, it is even more valid today.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Celeste\u2019s deposition testimony, which the trial court cited and which Joseph\u2019s counsel references in their brief to this court, makes no reference to \u201csexual services.\u201d In the portion of that testimony provided to the trial court, there is only one reference to \u201csexual intercourse\u201d (and that by Joseph\u2019s counsel in his question) and two references by Celeste to the fact that the couple had sex. Celeste\u2019s testimony was uniformly to the effect that, starting in 1989, Joseph wanted her to \u201cget pregnant and move in and start a family with him\u201d and that, ultimately, she agreed \u201c[t]hat I would do everything possible to conceive children.\u201d To that end, she testified, she stopped using birth control so that she could \u201cconceive his child.\u201d But, she was clear, this was only one aspect of their relationship; the overall relationship, she stressed repeatedly, was one of mutual commitment: \u201cIt became more unspoken as our lives intertwined more and more\u2014the time we spent together\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything that I wasn\u2019t gonna do for him, and there was nothing that Joe wasn\u2019t gonna do for me. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... I was committed to Joe for Joe. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The record in this case does not come close to establishing a meretricious relationship, either in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>IV.
