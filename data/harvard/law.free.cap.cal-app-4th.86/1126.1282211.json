(Pen. Code, \u00a7 496, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He admitted having suffered one prior \u201cstrike,\u201d a 1995 robbery conviction (\u00a7211) arising out of an attempted shoplifting. The court, pursuant to section 1385, denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the strike prior and sentenced him to the two-year prison midterm, doubled under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">At the time of sentencing, defendant was serving a sentence for a 1997 second degree burglary conviction (\u00a7 459) in El Dorado County, also arising out of an attempted shoplifting, and the court resentenced defendant on the El Dorado County offense to a consecutive term of 16 months, i.e., one-third the two-year prison midterm pursuant to section 1170.1, subdivision (a), doubled.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Both parties appealed. Defendant contends that in denying the motion to dismiss the strike prior, the court failed to take into account certain \u201cindividualized considerations\u201d pertaining to his background and the nature of the offense. The People assert the court erred by not ordering the sentence to run consecutive to the sentence previously imposed in El Dorado County. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">When defendant appeared for sentencing, he stood convicted in Placer County of receiving stolen property in May 1997 and of a June 1997 burglary in El Dorado County. He had already been sentenced to a term of 16 months, doubled to 32 months because of a strike prior. The trial court, based on section 1170.1, subdivision (a), undertook to impose an aggregate sentence embracing both offenses; the terms of confinement were to run consecutively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Section 1170.1, subdivision (a), applies \u201cwhen any person is convicted of two or more felonies ... in different proceedings or courts, and whether by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>judgment rendered by the same or by a different court, and a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170.\u201d As applied to an existing term of imprisonment, section 1170.1 provides that the aggregate term shall be the principal term (\u201cthe greatest term of imprisonment imposed ... for any of the crimes\u201d) plus the subordinate term (\u201cone-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other felony conviction\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The court selected the midterm of two years for receiving stolen property and one-third of the midterm for the previously adjudicated El Dorado burglary. Both terms were doubled under the \u201csecond strike\u201d provisions of section 1170.12, for an aggregate term of five years, four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The People contend the sentence violates section 1170.12, which provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions, as defined in subdivision (b), the court shall adhere to each of the following: \u00b6 . . . \u00b6 (8) Any sentence imposed pursuant to this section will be imposed consecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>According to the People, the phrase \u201cimposed consecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving\u201d reflects \u201can intent that the sentence for the current offense is to be served <em>after </em>completion of the sentence the defendant was serving at the time of sentencing.\u201d They reason that \u201c[i]f the initiative drafters intended for sentences pursuant to subdivision (a)(8) to be imposed consistent with section 1170.1, they would have specified that sentences for new convictions are to be served \u2018consecutively\u2019 with any sentence the defendant is currently serving rather than \u2018consecutive to\u2019 such a sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">This argument fails to give effect to the express exception set forth in section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(8), to wit, <em>\u201cunless otherwise provided by law.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The People say this language \u201clogically refers to laws which would prohibit the imposition of consecutive sentences altogether.\u201d We disagree. The \u201cunless\u201d clause is not addressed to consecutive sentencing generally. It applies only when the current sentence is to be served \u201cconsecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving.\u201d We are then directed to look to any other law that \u201cotherwise provide[s]\u201d for consecutive sentencing in that circumstance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a law is to be found in section 1170.1, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In <em>People v. Nguyen, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 197, the Supreme Court considered a case where \u201ca defendant is convicted in a single proceeding of more than one felony carrying a determinate sentence\u201d and the court elects to impose consecutive sentences. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 201.) As expressed by the court, \u201cThe issue presented here is how this consecutive sentence calculation is affected by the Three Strikes law, which provides that for a defendant with one prior conviction for a \u2018strike\u2019 (a violent or serious felony) \u2018the determinate term . . . shall be twice the term otherwise provided as punishment for the <em>current </em>felony conviction.\u2019 (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1).)\u201d (21 Cal.4th at p. 202, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The court concluded \u201cthe most natural reading of the provision at issue is that the sentencing court must designate principal and subordinate terms as required by section 1170.1, calculating the subordinate terms as one-third of the middle term (except when full-term consecutive sentences are otherwise permitted or required), and then double each of the resulting terms.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nguyen, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 203-204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number><em>Nguyen </em>involved a defendant convicted and sentenced in a single proceeding for more than one felony. In <em>Nguyen, </em>the People asserted the three strikes law totally abrogated the sentencing scheme established by section 1170.1. Their argument here is more circumscribed. They contend that where a two strike defendant has already been sentenced for an offense, the sentence cannot be modified pursuant to section 1170.1 upon a subsequent conviction because of the command of section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(8) that \u201c[a]ny sentence imposed pursuant to this section will be imposed consecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving.\u201d Under the People\u2019s reasoning, a defendant tried and convicted of multiple offenses in a single proceeding is sentenced under the sentencing parameters set forth in section 1170.1, while a defendant tried and convicted in separate proceedings is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">There is no reason to suspect the Legislature intended such disparate treatment. As the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Nguyen, </em>\u201cunless the Three Strikes law expressly abrogates the relevant provisions of section 1170.1,\u201d the statute should be applied according to its terms and the resulting sentence doubled, consistent with the language of section 1170.12. <em>(People v. Nguyen, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 203-204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The Legislature knows how to \u201cexpressly abrogate\u201d the provisions of section 1170.1. With respect to the penalties for escape, for example, the Legislature has provided the sentence is \u201cto be served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment, commencing from the time the person would otherwise have been released from imprisonment and the term shall not be subject to reduction pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 4532, subd. (b)(2); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1387 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 46].) The three strikes law does not expressly abrogate subdivision (a) of section 1170.1. To the contrary, section 1170.12 provides the sentence will be imposed consecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving, <em>\u201cunless otherwise provided by law.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (a)(8), italics added.) Section 1170.1 \u201cotherwise providefs].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Our dissenting colleague proposes a different form of disparate treatment for defendants convicted of multiple felonies in different proceedings. He would conclude the one-third-the-midterm sentencing provision of section 1170.1 applies but the doubling provision of the three strikes law applies only to convictions secured in the last proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Here, defendant committed the El Dorado County burglary after receiving stolen property in Placer County. Charges were pending in both counties, but the El Dorado prosecution proceeded to judgment first. Defendant was convicted of burglary and sentenced to a 16-month prison term, doubled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>because of a prior strike to 32 months. The Placer conviction for receiving stolen property followed thereafter. The dissent reasons that section 1170.1 applies but section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1) only permits the doubling \u201cas punishment for the current felony conviction.\u201d Defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent\u201d felony conviction, according to the dissent, is the conviction for receiving stolen property; the burglary conviction, being earlier in time, cannot be a \u201ccurrent\u201d conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Under the dissent\u2019s reasoning, defendant\u2019s 32-month burglary sentence should thus be vacated and defendant resentenced, without consideration of his prior strike, to an eight-month term. This term would be served consecutive to a second strike sentence of four years for receiving stolen property. The effect of the dissent\u2019s approach is to render the three strikes law inapplicable to earlier convictions where a defendant is later convicted in a separate proceeding and resentenced under the subordinate term provisions of section 1170.1, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Neither party advanced the dissent\u2019s position and we do not find it persuasive. The term \u201ccurrent,\u201d as used in 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1), distinguishes the convictions for which defendant is to be sentenced from the \u201cprior\u201d convictions which serve as strikes. The subdivision reads: \u201cIf a defendant has one <em>prior </em>felony conviction that has been pled and proved, the determinate term or minimum term for an indeterminate term shall be twice the term otherwise provided as punishment for the <em>current </em>felony conviction.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (c)(1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Here, all of the convictions for which defendant was sentenced were \u201ccurrent\u201d convictions, as they were offenses currently before the court for disposition, as distinguished from the \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d that served as a strike. The trial court correctly discerned this distinction and properly applied both the three strikes law and section 1170.1, subdivision (a) in arriving at an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-12\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b840-13\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-14\"> The version of section 1170.1 in effect at the time the crime was committed provided in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) and subject to Section 654, when any person is convicted of two or more felonies, whether in the same proceeding or court or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same or by a different court, and a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170, the aggregate term of imprisonment for all these convictions shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term, and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667, 667.5, 667.6, or 12022.1, and pursuant to Section 11370.2 of the Health and Safety Code. The principal term shall consist of the greatest term of imprisonment imposed by the court for any of the crimes, including any enhancements imposed pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 186.10 or Section 667.15, 667.8, 667.83, 667.85, 12022, 12022.2, 12022.3, 12022.4, 12022.5, 12022.55, 12022.6, 12022.7, 12022.75, 12022.8, or 12022.9 of this code, and an enhancement imposed pursuant to Section 11370.4 or 11379.8 of the Health and Safety Code. The subordinate term for each consecutive offense which is not a \u2018violent felony\u2019 as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other felony conviction for an offense that is not a violent felony for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall exclude any enhancements. In no case shall the total of subordinate terms for these consecutive offenses which are not \u2018violent felonies\u2019 as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 exceed five years. The subordinate term for each consecutive offense which is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, including those offenses described in paragraph (8), (9), or (17) of subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other felony conviction for an offense that is a violent felony for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall include one-third of any enhancements imposed pursuant to Section 667.15, 667.8, 667.83, 667.85, 12022, 12022.2, 12022.4, 12022.5, 12022.55, 12022.7, 12022.75, or 12022.9.\u201d (Stats. 1994, ch. 1188, \u00a7 12.7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> If the subordinate offense is a violent felony, as defined in section 667.5, an additional term must be added for any enhancements applicable to such term.

In the latter case, \u201cthe \u2018term otherwise provided as punishment\u2019 is determined by applying the consecutive sentencing scheme for determinate terms in section 1170.1.\u201d <em>(People v. Nguyen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 197, 205 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 980 P.2d 905].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b844-10\">BLEASE, Acting P. J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A8U\">I concur in the opinion insofar as it holds the phrase \u201cotherwise provided by law\u201d in Penal Code section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(8) invokes the subordinate term provisions of section 1170.1, subdivision (a). Pursuant to the latter provision the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>court correctly imposed an eight-month consecutive term on resentencing for the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the eight-month term for that <em>prior </em>conviction is a \u201cterm otherwise provided as punishment for the <em>current </em>felony conviction,\u201d which must be doubled under Penal Code section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). (Italics added.) The defendant\u2019s only <em>current conviction </em>is for receiving stolen property and the term of two years imposed for that offense was doubled under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). That subdivision is the governing law and its terms are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Penal Code section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1) provides that \u201c[i]f a defendant has one prior felony conviction . . . the . . . term [for that conviction] shall be twice the term otherwise provided as punishment for the <em>current felony </em>conviction.\u201d (Italics added.) This manifestly does not read \u201ctwice the term otherwise provided upon a current resentencing for a prior conviction pursuant to section 1170.1.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The majority opinion engages in an extensive policy argument that the term \u201ccurrent conviction\u201d should mean current resentence for a <em>prior conviction </em>because the sentence for the <em>prior </em>conviction had been enhanced pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.12 in the <em>prior </em>proceeding. With all due respect, that policy argument, however persuasive, should be addressed to the Legislature or to the People, whose initiative led to section 1170.12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We have no common law power to amend the plain terms of a statute, let alone the terms of a criminal statute. \u201cIn the construction of a statute . . . the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) \u201cIn California all crimes are statutory and there are no common law crimes. Only the Legislature and not the courts may make conduct criminal.\u201d <em>(In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612, 624 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">By what judicial alchemy a resentence imposed for a prior conviction becomes a current conviction I do not know. There is no support for that result to be found in the language of Penal Code section 1170.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">That the terms \u201cprior\u201d and \u201ccurrent\u201d distinguish between convictions in different proceedings is uniformly seen wherever the terms \u201cprior conviction\u201d and \u201ccurrent conviction\u201d are used in Penal Code section 1170.12. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>subds. (a)(3), (a)(6), (a)(7), (c)(1), (c)(2)(A).) Section 1170.12 implicates prior nonserious or nonviolent felonies only in the context of consecutive sentencing, at issue in this case. Subdivision (a)(8) provides that \u201c[a]ny sentence imposed pursuant to this section will be imposed consecutive to any other sentence which the defendant is already serving, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d It presupposes an enhanced sentence has already been \u201cimposed\u201d under section 1170.12 for the current conviction. In this case it was doubled.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The reference to \u201cotherwise provided by law,\u201d in Penal Code section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(8) has nothing to do with a further enhancement. It refers, as the majority opinion has concluded, to an <em>exception </em>to the requirement the current enhanced sentence be served consecutive to the sentence \u201cthe defendant is already serving . . . .\u201d The exception is found in Penal Code section 1170.1. It seems a simple matter of logic that an exception is not subject to that as to which it is an exception. Having got to section 1170.1 by means of section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(8), its terms and only its terms must be applied. Section 1170.1 says nothing about enhancing the defendant\u2019s sentence under section 1170.12. That we got to section 1170.1 by means of section 1170.12 may seem an anomaly to my colleagues, because the application of section 1170.1 undoes the prior enhancement imposed upon the defendant under section 1170.12. But it is an anomaly of the Legislature\u2019s making.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\"><em>People v. Nguyen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 197 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 980 P.2d 905] does not hold otherwise. The subordinate term provisions of Penal Code section 1170.1 apply \u201cwhen any person is convicted of two or more felonies, whether in the same proceeding . . . or in different proceedings.\u201d In <em>Nguyen, </em>the defendant was convicted of two felonies in the \u201csame\u201d proceeding. Accordingly, both felonies involved <em>current </em>convictions and both properly were doubled pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). <em>Nguyen </em>is not to be read to apply to the case, as here, of resentencing based upon two felonies arising from \u201cdifferent proceedings,\u201d a circumstance necessarily involving a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">I would apply the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\"> It is helpful when construing a statute to formulate the application of a perceived policy in the clearest terms possible and then compare the language thus conceived with the actual language of the statute. That will reveal what is being added or subtracted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-12\"> See the identical provisions in Penal Code section 667, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
