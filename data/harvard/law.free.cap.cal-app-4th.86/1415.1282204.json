In the specific factual context of this case, we answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Petitioner, Glenn Hightower (Hightower) seeks a writ of mandate compelling the superior court to either (1) vacate the \u201cpartial final award\u201d issued by the arbitrator or (2) confirm that award and enter judgment so that Hight-ower can proceed to attack on appeal the validity of that award and the superior court\u2019s refusal to vacate it. Daniel O\u2019Dowd (O\u2019Dowd), the real party in interest, opposes Hightower\u2019s petition and claims, inter alia, that the utilization of a \u201cpartial final award\u201d and the express reservation of jurisdiction to resolve any remaining issues was a procedurally proper way to handle this particular dispute involving enforcement of a corporate shareholder agreement and its reciprocal buy-sell provisions. Thus, O\u2019Dowd also urges that we direct the trial court to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">As we explain below, we agree with O\u2019Dowd and conclude that such incremental award process is within the \u201cbroad scope\u201d of an arbitrator\u2019s authority to fashion an appropriate remedy. It is not precluded by nor offensive to the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor is it prohibited by the rules which the parties agreed would govern the arbitration of their dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Parenthetically, it is relevant also to note that the use of interim awards is a proper means, under the Federal Arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.), of granting provisional relief such as was awarded in this matter. Finally, and most significantly, the very nature of the stock buy-sell dispute which the parties had agreed to submit to arbitration necessarily presented a reasonable likelihood that an interim award might be required, and thus we have no trouble concluding that the parties implicitly consented to such a process. For all of those reasons, we will conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cpartial final award\u201d was procedurally proper and was con-firmable <em>as such </em>by the superior court. Thus, we will issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to enter an order of confirmation and an interlocutory judgment and to refer the matter back to the arbitrator for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Factual and Procedural <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">This is the second time we have had occasion to address issues arising out of the shareholder dispute between Hightower and O\u2019Dowd.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we are already familiar with the factual context in which this dispute has arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">In 1982, Hightower and O\u2019Dowd jointly formed Green Hills Software, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (Green Hills). Until October 13, 2000, they each owned one-half of the stock<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and constituted the corporation\u2019s board of directors and officers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> O\u2019Dowd was active in the day to day business affairs of Green Hills, while Hightower was not, except for some recruiting and marketing activities beginning in about 1991. After 1991, the company enjoyed substantial growth and went from five to approximately 100 employees and achieved an annual growth rate of about 40 percent. By 1997, its annual revenues exceeded $20 million and its annual profits exceeded $8.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>O\u2019Dowd and Hightower are parties to a written agreement that defines their rights as shareholders (Shareholders Agreement).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It contains a buy-sell provision which allows either shareholder to offer to sell his shares to the other. The shareholder who makes the offer (the Offering Shareholder) sets a purchase price and deposits it with the company. The other party (the Designated Shareholder) then has 90 days in which either to sell his shares to the Offering Shareholder at the price offered or to buy the Offering Shareholder\u2019s shares at the same price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Once initiated, the buy-sell process is essentially self-executing. If the Designated Shareholder deposits the purchase price with the company within 90 days, the company must transfer the Offering Shareholder\u2019s stock to the Designated Shareholder and pay the Offering Shareholder the purchase price. If the Designated Shareholder does not make the deposit, the reverse occurs (i.e., the company will transfer the Designated Shareholder\u2019s stock to the Offering Shareholder and pay the Designated Shareholder the purchase price originally deposited by the Offering Shareholder). In addition, the Shareholders Agreement requires that the purchase price be at least 10 times Green Hills\u2019s per-share earnings for the four previous fiscal quarters. This provision, and the Shareholders Agreement\u2019s reciprocal nature, provide a check on one party making an unreasonably low offer for the other\u2019s stock. Obviously, a shareholder who offers too little runs the risk that he might have to sell his own stock at that price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Hightower and O\u2019Dowd had previously discussed taking Green Hills public when its revenues reached $40 million. In connection with those discussions, they adopted a stock option plan for the employees and issued options in 1997. Some additional options have been granted subsequently. Most of the employees hired before 1998 are participants in the stock option plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">O\u2019Dowd decided sometime in 1997 to make an offer to buy Hightower\u2019s shares. He informed Green Hills\u2019s top management (vice-presidents Craig Franklin, David Chandler and John Carbone) of his intent late in 1997 and announced his plan at a company-wide meeting on January 21, 1998. Hightower was informed the next day, on January 22, 1998, of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s intended buyout, although no formal offer to buy Hightower\u2019s shares was made until June 26, 1998. On January 21, 1998, O\u2019Dowd also announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>that he would turn day-to-day management of the company over to the three vice-presidents so that he could devote his attention to raising the funds necessary to buy out Hightower. O\u2019Dowd told the vice-presidents, and later told the employees of Green Hills at the January 21, 1998 meeting, that it was his intent, after he acquired Hightower\u2019s shares, to sell them back to the company for his cost; the effect of this transaction would be to make the employees\u2019 options worth almost twice as much as they otherwise would be, because approximately one-half of the 65,000,000 shares of Green Hills would have been retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">O\u2019Dowd succeeded in obtaining financing for his offer from Behrman Capital (equity financing) and Fleet Bank (debt financing) and made his formal offer to purchase Hightower\u2019s shares for $47 million on June 26, 1998. Hightower received the offer on June 29, 1998, and immediately set out to obtain his <em>own </em>financing sufficient to buy O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares for the $47 million price set by O\u2019Dowd\u2019s offer. He interested Safeguard Scientif-ics, Inc., and SCP Private Equity Partners, Inc. (Safeguard) in the possibility of investing in Green Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Safeguard personnel and consultants visited Green Hills, with Hightower, on August 6 and 7, 1998, for the purpose of conducting the necessary due diligence. Several key Green Hills employees were designated by Safeguard and were interviewed over a two-day period. O\u2019Dowd was interviewed separately. Counsel for Hightower and Green Hills attended most of the interviews, but they were not permitted to attend the O\u2019Dowd interview. During the course of the interviews, Safeguard representatives were informed that each of the vice-presidents intended to resign if Hightower succeeded in taking over Green Hills. Safeguard later learned that numerous other employees had stated in writing that they supported O\u2019Dowd and did not support Hightower; some also stated that they intended to resign if O\u2019Dowd no longer led the company or if Hightower succeeded in his buy-out. In addition, a petition was later sent to Safeguard signed by 60 employees, including the vice-presidents and most of senior management, indicating that the investment Safeguard proposed to make in Green Hills was ill-advised because of the likelihood of employee departures and High-tower\u2019s inability to manage Green Hills effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Apparently as a result of these events, Safeguard declined to participate with Hightower in the financing of his buyout of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares and he therefore was unable to do so. Hightower responded to these circumstances by making a written demand for arbitration on August 24, 1998, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>the arbitration clause in the Shareholders <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also initiated litigation for the purpose of obtaining a preliminary injunction to preclude O\u2019Dowd from going forward with the self-executing buyout of Hightower\u2019s shares pursuant to his $47 million offer of June 26, 1998.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hightower contended that O\u2019Dowd had improperly and unfairly created an atmosphere and environment which made it impossible for Hightower to obtain the financing needed to exercise his contractual right to purchase O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares. After some supplemental amendments to the arbitration demand, the filing of an answer and counterclaim by O\u2019Dowd and the conduct of document discovery, there was an extensive evidentiary hearing. It commenced on August 2, 1999, and extended until January 30, 2000, during which period there were 38 hearing days. This was followed by written briefs, oral argument and motions. The matter was finally submitted on April 14, 2000, and an award was issued on April 25, 2000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">Hightower raised a number of claims in the arbitration. His primary claim, however, was that O\u2019Dowd had, by all of the actions described above, violated his fiduciary duties to Hightower and had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing which was implied in the Shareholders Agreement and thereby had deprived Hightower of a fair opportunity to meet O\u2019Dowd\u2019s stock purchase offer. Hightower accused O\u2019Dowd of directly or indirectly inducing Green Hills employees (and particularly the three vice-presidents) to threaten Safeguard that they would quit if Hightower purchased O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares and acquired control of Green Hills. Additionally, he alleged that O\u2019Dowd induced the vice-presidents to cause those who reported to them to make such threats and to sign a petition intended to discourage Safeguard from financing Hightower\u2019s buyout of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Hightower also asserted that O\u2019Dowd misused corporate assets by securing the assistance of Green Hills employees in his efforts to find financing and in inducing or instructing Green Hills employees not to cooperate with Hightower and with Safeguard during its due diligence, while at the same time making extensive use of employee time and other Green Hills resources in aid of his own due diligence efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>Hightower also contended that he had been locked out of Green Hills in March of 1998 on the pretext of having entered the company premises over the March 14, 1998, weekend and accessing employee offices and personal information maintained in employee computer files without the employees\u2019 permission. Thereafter, Hightower\u2019s access to Green Hills and its documents and records was limited to requests made through corporate counsel while, at the same time, O\u2019Dowd had full, unrestricted, and immediate access to all Green Hills documents and employees. As already noted, Hightower contended that all of this was done to unfairly prevent him from effectively exercising his rights under the Shareholders Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Each of the claims and contentions raised by Hightower was considered and rejected by the arbitrator. As the arbitrator put it, \u201cIt is apparent that Hightower\u2019s failure to finance his purchase of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s shares was primarily caused by the actions of Green Hills employees which caused Safeguard not to finance the purchase. In a business whose principal asset is its intellectual property created, marketed and serviced by its employees, the threat that many employees would depart <em>en masse </em>in the event of a change of ownership, or anything resembling such an eventuality, justifiably caused Safeguard to rethink the wisdom of its proposed investment. If O\u2019Dowd caused or induced that conduct, he would have violated the Agreement and his fiduciary duties to Hightower.\u201d After considering the very substantial documentary and testimonial evidence that had been presented to him during the extensive arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator concluded that nothing O\u2019Dowd did or failed to do <em>improperly </em>contributed to Hightower\u2019s loss of his needed financial support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Specifically, the arbitrator concluded that O\u2019Dowd did nothing wrong in publicly announcing his plans to make an offer to Hightower and advising company officers and employees of his intention to share with corporate employees any profit which might result to employee pension plans from the purchase and cancellation of Hightower\u2019s shares. Nor did O\u2019Dowd <em>improperly </em>induce either his employees or the senior corporate officers to take action which had a negative impact on Hightower\u2019s efforts to obtain his own financing. As we have noted, the adverse statements made by the three Green Hills vice-presidents and several of the employees regarding High-tower and their refusal to remain with the company should he succeed in purchasing O\u2019Dowd\u2019s stock clearly had a negative and decisive impact on Hightower\u2019s attempt to obtain financing. However, the arbitrator concluded that O\u2019Dowd did nothing to induce such responses; rather they were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>product of honestly held and apparently justified beliefs of corporate officers and employees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">The arbitrator thus concluded that Hightower simply had not proven his claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the implied covenant, interference with contract or fraud and had proven no basis for either declaratory relief, an injunction or damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based upon this conclusion, the arbitrator determined that O\u2019Dowd had been legally entitled to complete the purchase of Hightower\u2019s shares on September 24, 1998 (i.e., 90 days after his June 26, 1998 offer) and that it was therefore necessary for the arbitrator to fashion a remedy that would give O\u2019Dowd the \u201cbenefit of his bargain under the Shareholder/Agreement.\u201d The arbitrator emphasized that O\u2019Dowd\u2019s original financing arrangements were no longer available and that it was unclear whether he would be able now or in the future to make a comparable deal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Therefore, the arbitrator stated, \u201cThe intent of this award is to provide [O\u2019Dowd] the benefit of the prior deal <em>as closely as that may now be </em>approximated.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">In pursuit of that goal, the arbitrator issued, on April 25, 2000, a \u201cPartial Final Award\u201d that provided:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">(1) O\u2019Dowd was entitled to have the preliminary injunction (that we previously affirmed\u2014see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>lifted immediately because Hightower had failed to prevail on the merits of his claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">(2) But for the breach by Hightower of the Shareholders Agreement, Hightower\u2019s legal or beneficial interest in Green Hills would have terminated on September 24, 1998; and after the retirement of Hightower\u2019s shares pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, O\u2019Dowd would have been the legal and beneficial owner of 100 percent of the shares of Green Hills as of that date. Hightower was obligated on September 24, 1998, to tender those shares for $47 million, and O\u2019Dowd was obligated as of September 24, 1998, to pay $47 million for those shares. Hightower\u2019s breach excused O\u2019Dowd from performing his reciprocal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">(3) O\u2019Dowd has the right, but not the obligation, to pay or cause Green Hills to pay to Hightower the consideration for the shares required as of September 24, 1998, or $47 million. O\u2019Dowd and Green Hills shall have the option to make that payment on certain specified conditions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">Of greatest significance to the resolution of the issue before us, the arbitrator specifically provided that: <em>\u201cThis award shall be deemed a Partial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number><em>Final Award as to those issues finally determined herein so that the parties may return to the Los Angeles Superior Court for the purpose of dissolving the injunction and so that this award may be confirmed and the option period may begin to run. The arbitrator reserves jurisdiction to determine additional issues as may arise between the parties during this period.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">In addition, the award specified that the arbitrator <em>reserved jurisdiction </em>to determine a number of specific additional issues likely to arise after O\u2019Dowd resubmitted his offer to purchase Hightower\u2019s shares. For example:</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">(1) O\u2019Dowd was awarded the costs that he would have to incur in order to obtain the new financing needed to make the purchase; those costs were obviously unknown as of the date of the partial final award (but could not exceed $1,276,843.07), and so the arbitrator reserved jurisdiction \u201cto determine the extent to which such costs shall constitute an offset to the purchase price on the basis that they are comparable to the costs previously incurred in connection with the September 24, 1998 offer to purchase transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">(2) If O\u2019Dowd failed to tender the required consideration for Hightower\u2019s shares, then O\u2019Dowd would nonetheless be entitled to an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>damages (attorney\u2019s fees and recoupment of financing charges) which would have to be determined by the arbitrator and included in the \u201cfinal\u201d award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">(3) In the event that the transfer of Hightower\u2019s stock and the payment of the purchase price did not take place within the time period specified in the partial final award, jurisdiction was reserved to determine the amount and procedures for payment to Hightower.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">(4) Although the arbitrator determined that O\u2019Dowd was the prevailing party and was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $2,512,338.87, as of April 25, 2000, he also held that O\u2019Dowd \u201cmay seek a supplemental award, to be included in the final award, for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses incurred in this proceeding through entry of the final award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">(5) Neither Hightower nor O\u2019Dowd would have any right to seek any damages for any injury occurring to either during the option period and relating to Green Hills or the Shareholders Agreement, other than as part of this arbitration, and jurisdiction was reserved for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Hightower\u2019s response to the publication of the arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award was to file, on May 16, 2000, a petition with the superior court to vacate the award pursuant to section 1286.2.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hightower urged, inter alia,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that (1) the arbitrator had exceeded his powers \u201cby retaining jurisdiction over potential future disputes that neither party has agreed to arbitrate\u201d and (2) the Partial Final Award was, by its own terms, not final and therefore was in violation of section 1283.4.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">This petition was denied by the trial court on June 27, 2000.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court reasoned that section 1283.4 did not preclude the arbitrator\u2019s utilization of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>partial final award because that award did determine all issues necessary to the \u201cdetermination of the controversy.\u201d As the trial court put it, \u201cThe Partial Final Award appears to meet this requirement that the controversy be determined. The fact that the Award does not provide the exact dollar figure for the price of Hightower\u2019s shares does not appear to render the issues undetermined. The Award provides a specific formula to determine the price.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">On August 29, 2000, Hightower filed his petition herein seeking a writ of mandate requiring the trial court to either (1) vacate its order denying Hightower\u2019s petition to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s partial final award and enter a new order granting it or (2) enter an order confirming the partial final award and entering judgment thereon.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We issued an order to show cause on September 27, 2000, and set this matter for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">O\u2019Dowd apparently thereafter obtained the new financing needed to purchase Hightower\u2019s Shares. The preliminary injunction previously having been lifted, he tendered the sum of $41,585,388 on October 13, 2000.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These sums were accepted by Hightower,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> albeit under a claimed protest.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On the same day, Hightower surrendered his stock certificates with stock powers in blank as specified in the arbitrator\u2019s partial final award. Those shares were transferred to Green Hills on that same day and cancelled. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>October 23, 2000, O\u2019Dowd\u2019s counsel wrote to the arbitrator and requested a hearing on the remaining issues so that a <em>final </em>award could be issued.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Hightower\u2019s counsel responded on October 25, 2000, with his own letter to the arbitrator objecting to any hearing pending a determination by this court as to whether the Partial Final Award is valid and the arbitrator properly reserved jurisdiction as to any additional issues.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">As should be obvious from the foregoing recitation, the issue before us is whether the arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award and his concurrent reservation of jurisdiction was proper. Hightower contends that the award is invalid as contrary to section 1283.4 and should have been vacated on that ground by the trial court. He argues that the purpose and effect of section 1283.4 is to mandate a <em>single </em>final award which resolves <em>all </em>issues placed in dispute by the parties and thus an arbitrator is without power to issue partial or \u201cpiecemeal\u201d awards; and any attempt to reserve jurisdiction as to other issues that have not yet arisen is an exercise of power that was not agreed to by the parties and therefore is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">O\u2019Dowd responds that the arbitrator, given the nature of the factual and legal issues presented, acted properly in issuing an initial partial award that effectively decided the basic dispute between the parties. The remaining or reserved issues were ones that necessarily could not be resolved until certain acts or conditions described in the partial award had occurred or had been satisfied. Thus, a writ of mandate should be granted, directing the trial court to confirm the partial final award and refer whatever issues remain to the arbitrator.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">1. <em>Limitations on Judicial Review of Arbitration Awards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">California has a long-established and well-settled policy favoring arbitration as a speedy and inexpensive means of settling disputes. <em>(Ericks en, Arbuthnot, McCarthy, Kearney &amp; Walsh, Inc. v. 100 Oak Street </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 312, 322 [197 Cal.Rptr. 581, 673 P.2d 251].) This policy is reflected in the comprehensive statutory scheme set out in the California Arbitration Act. (\u00a7 1280 et seq.) The purpose of the act is to promote <em>contractual arbitration, </em>in accordance with this policy, as a more expeditious and less expensive means of resolving disputes than by litigation in court. <em>(Mercury Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 342 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178].) \u201cTypically, those who enter into arbitration agreements expect that their dispute will be resolved without necessity for any contact with the courts.\u201d <em>(Blanton </em>v. <em>Womancare, Inc. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 396, 402, fn, 5 [212 Cal.Rptr. 151, 696 P.2d 645, 48 A.L.R.4th 109].),</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>Thus, it is clearly the expectation of the parties to an arbitration agreement that the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be both binding and final. <em>(Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899] <em>(Moncharsh).) </em>\u201cThis expectation of finality strongly informs the parties\u2019 choice of an arbitral forum over a judicial one. The arbitrator\u2019s decision should be the end not the beginning of the dispute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 10.) \u201cEnsuring arbitral finality thus requires that judicial intervention in the arbitration process be minimized. [Citations.] Because the decision to arbitrate grievances evinces the parties\u2019 intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels, arbitral finality is a core component of the parties\u2019 agreement to submit to arbitration. Thus, an arbitration decision is final and conclusive <em>because the parties have agreed that it be so. </em>By ensuring that an arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding, courts simply assure that the parties receive the benefit of their bargain.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 10, italics in original, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">This principle of arbitral finality results in a broad authority to the arbitrator to decide cases in a way that might not be justified in a court of law. \u201c \u2018[Arbitrators, unless specifically required to act in conformity with rules of law, may base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity, and in doing so may expressly or impliedly reject a claim that a party might successfully have asserted in a judicial action.\u2019 [Citations.] As early as 1852, this court recognized that, \u2018The arbitrators are not bound to award on principles of dry law, but may decide on principles of equity and good conscience, and make their award <em>ex aequo et bono </em>[according to what is just and good].\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018As a consequence, arbitration awards are generally immune from judicial review. \u201cParties who stipulate in an agreement that controversies that may arise out of it shall be settled by arbitration, may expect not only to reap the advantages that flow from the use of that nontechnical, summary procedure, but also to find themselves bound by an award reached by paths neither marked nor traceable and not subject to judicial review.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Based upon these legal authorities and principles, the <em>Moncharsh </em>court concluded that, with narrow exceptions not applicable here, \u201can arbitrator\u2019s decision cannot be reviewed for errors of fact or law. In reaffirming this general rule, we recognize there is a risk that the arbitrator will make a mistake. That risk, however, is acceptable for two reasons. First, by voluntarily submitting to arbitration, the parties have agreed to bear that risk in return for a quick, inexpensive, and conclusive resolution to their dispute. . . . [1Q . . . [1D A second reason why we tolerate the risk of an erroneous decision is because the Legislature has reduced the risk to the parties of such a decision by providing for judicial review in circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>involving serious problems with the award itself, or with the fairness of the arbitration process.\u201d <em>(,Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 11-12.) To put it another way, even \u201can award reached by an arbitrator pursuant to a contractual agreement to arbitrate is not subject to judicial review except on the grounds set forth in sections 1286.2 (to vacate) and 1286.6 (for correction).[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] Further, [even] the existence of an error of law apparent on the face of the award that causes substantial injustice does not provide grounds for judicial review.\u201d <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>at p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">Such principle of arbitral finality, however, does not preclude the arbitrator from making a <em>final </em>disposition of a submitted matter in more than one award. Nor does section 1283.4 (see fn. 18, <em>ante), </em>upon which Hight-ower so heavily relies, compel such a result. The cases relied upon by Hightower do not hold otherwise.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>What is mandated by statutory and case law is that the arbitrator decide <em>all </em>of the submitted issues and that such decision, once rendered, may be subject to judicial review, only upon certain limited conditions not here applicable. This does not come close to foreclosing the utilization of a multiple incremental or successive award process as a means, <em>in an appropriate case, </em>of finally deciding <em>all </em>submitted issues. As we now explain, the arbitrator\u2019s broad remedy power informs our understanding of the proper interpretation and application to be given to the principle of arbitral finality and the mandate of section 1283.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">2. <em>An Arbitrator Has Broad Power to Fashion an Appropriate Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">The limitations placed on judicial review and oversight of an arbitration award have resulted in a substantial deference to the arbitrator\u2019s own assessment of his or her authority to resolve an issue. <em>(Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. </em>v. <em>Intel Corp. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 362, 372-373 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 581, 885 P.2d 994] <em>(Advanced Micro).) </em>\u201c[C]ourts should generally defer to an arbitrator\u2019s finding that determination of a particular question is within the scope of his or her contractual authority.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 372.) Section 1283.4 states that an arbitrator\u2019s written award shall determine all submitted questions \u201cnecessary in order to determine the controversy.\u201d It is, however, for the arbitrator to determine what issues are \u201cnecessary\u201d to the ultimate decision. <em>(Morris v. Zuckerman </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 686, 690 [72 Cal.Rptr. 880, 446 P.2d 1000].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">The same deference extended to an arbitrator\u2019s determination as to the <em>scope </em>of his or her authority also applies to the arbitrator\u2019s <em>choice of a remedy. (Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 381.) \u201cIn providing for judicial vacation or correction of an award, our statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 1286.2, subd. (d), 1286.6, subd. (b)) do not distinguish between the arbitrators\u2019 power to decide an issue and their authority to choose an appropriate remedy; in either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>instance the test is whether the arbitrators have \u2018exceeded their powers.\u2019 Because determination of appropriate relief also constitutes decision on an issue, these two aspects of the arbitrators\u2019 authority are not always neatly separable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">In <em>Morris v. Zuckerman, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 686, the Supreme Court upheld an arbitrator\u2019s choice of relief against the argument that the relief granted exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s contractual authority. The plaintiff had argued that the arbitrator had no authority to add conditions to a contract for the sale of jointly owned land. The court held that the arbitrator could do so if equity and the parties\u2019 relationship, one to the other, required such relief. \u201cIn reaching this conclusion [Morris] applied a rule of substantial deference to the arbitrators\u2019 jurisdictional determinations. <em>(Morris v. Zuckerman, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 690.) <em>Morris </em>thus implies an arbitrator\u2019s discretion to determine the extent of remedies is as great as his or her discretion to determine the related question of what issues are necessary to the decision.\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">\u201cDeference to the arbitrator is also required by the character of the remedy decision itself. Fashioning remedies for a breach of contract or other injury is not always a simple matter of applying contractually specified relief to an easily measured injury. It may involve, as in the present case, providing relief for breach of implied covenants, as to which the parties have not specified contractual damages. It may require, also as in this case, finding a way of approximating the impact of a breach that cannot with any certainty be reduced to monetary terms. Passage of time and changed circumstances may have rendered any remedies suggested by the contract insufficient or excessive. As the United States Supreme Court explained in the leading case on review of arbitral remedies in the collective bargaining context, the arbitrator is required \u2018to bring his informed judgment to bear to reach a fair solution of a problem. . . . There the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations. The [drafters] may never have thought of what specific remedy should be awarded to meet a particular contingency.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">\u201cThe choice of remedy, then, may at times call on any decisionmaker\u2019s flexibility, creativity and sense of fairness. In private arbitrations, the parties have bargained for the relatively free exercise of those faculties. Arbitrators, unless specifically restricted by the agreement to following legal rules, \u2018 \u201cmay base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity . . . .\u201d [Citations.] Were courts to reevaluate independently the merits of a particular remedy, the parties\u2019 contractual expectation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>decision according to the arbitrators\u2019 best judgment would be defeated.\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 374-375, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Thus, the <em>Advanced Micro </em>court concluded, the \u201cprinciple of arbitral finality, the practical demands of deciding on an appropriate remedy for breach, and the prior holdings of this court all dictate that arbitrators, <em>unless expressly restricted by the agreement or the submission to arbitration, </em>have substantial discretion to determine the scope of their contractual authority to fashion remedies, and that judicial review of their awards must be correspondingly narrow and deferential.\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 376, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The question remained, however, as to the standard to be applied to such judicial review of a selected remedy. The <em>Advanced Micro </em>court noted that a number of California appellate cases have applied one of two tests. The arbitrator\u2019s remedy selection would be sustained <em>unless </em>that remedy constituted an (1) \u201carbitrary remaking\u201d or (2) a \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d construction of the contract. <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.) In addition, the <em>Advanced Micro </em>court looked to several federal cases (primarily involving collective bargaining contracts and disputes), that had concluded an award was legitimate only so long as it drew \u201cits <em>essence\u201d </em>from the agreement. (See <em>Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Corp. </em>(1960) 363 U.S. 593 [80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424].) \u201cJudicial review of remedies as outlined in the <em>Enterprise </em>decision thus looks not to whether the arbitrator correctly <em>interpreted </em>the agreement, but to whether the award is drawn from the agreement <em>as the arbitrator interpreted it </em>or derives from some extrinsic source. As the court explained in a later labor case, where an arbitrator is authorized to determine remedies for contract violations, \u2018courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect. . . . [A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 378, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">After reviewing these authorities, the <em>Advanced Micro </em>court distilled what it believed was \u201ca meaningful, workable and properly deferential framework for reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s choice of remedies. Arbitrators are not obliged to read contracts literally, and an award may not be vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>merely because the court is unable to find the relief granted was authorized by a specific term of the contract. [Citation.] <em>The remedy awarded, however, must bear some rational relationship to the contract and the breach. </em>The required link may be [1] to the contractual terms as actually interpreted by the arbitrator (if the arbitrator has made that interpretation known), [2] to an interpretation implied in the award itself, or [3] to a plausible theory of the contract\u2019s general subject matter, framework or intent. [Citation.] The award must be related in a rational manner to the breach (as expressly or <em>impliedly </em>found by the arbitrator). Where the damage is difficult to determine or measure, the arbitrator enjoys correspondingly broader discretion to fashion a remedy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 381, fn. omitted, italics added.) <em>\u201cIn close cases the arbitrator\u2019s decision must stand.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">Thus, \u201c[t]he award will be upheld so long as it [is] even arguably based on the contract; it may be vacated only if the reviewing court is <em>compelled </em>to infer the award was based on an extrinsic source.\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 381.) Unless expressly restricted by the parties\u2019 agreement, an arbitrator has the authority to fashion such relief as he or she considers just and fair under the circumstances existing at the time of the arbitration, <em>\u201cso long as the remedy may be rationally derived from the contract and the breach.\u201c (Id. </em>at p. 383, italics added.) As the Supreme Court later put it, \u201can arbitrator\u2019s choice of relief does not exceed his or her powers so long as it \u2018bears a rational relationship <em>to the underlying contract as interpreted, expressly or impliedly, by the arbitrator </em>and to the breach of the contract found, expressly or impliedly, by the arbitrator\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moshonov v. Walsh </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 771, <em>777 </em>[94 Cal.Rptr.2d 597, 996 P.2d 699], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">We now apply these principles to the Partial Final Award issued by the arbitrator in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">3. <em>The Arbitrator Had Authority to Issue a Partial or Interim Award and to Reserve Jurisdiction to Issue a Final Award on the Remaining Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">In this case, the parties agreed to arbitrate \u201cany dispute\u201d arising under the Shareholders Agreement. They also provided that the rules of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>AAA would apply.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Those rules, consistent with the principles articulated by <em>Moncharsh </em>and <em>Advance Micro, </em>stated that the \u201carbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties.\u201d (AAA, Commercial Arbitration Rules (1996) rule 43.) This rule has been described as a broad grant of authority and gives the arbitrator a <em>\u201cbroad scope\u201d </em>in his or her choice of relief. <em>(Moore v. First Bank of San Luis Obispo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 782, 786-787 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 996 P.2d 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">The arbitrator determined that Hightower had breached the Shareholders Agreement and had thereby frustrated O\u2019Dowd\u2019s attempt to complete the purchase of Hightower\u2019s shares in Green Hills pursuant to O\u2019Dowd\u2019s $47 million offer on June 26, 1998. Under the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, O\u2019Dowd was entitled to complete that purchase by September 24, 1998. The arbitrator found that he was unable to do so due to Hightower\u2019s breach. Thus, the arbitrator had to fashion a remedy that would give O\u2019Dowd the \u201cbenefit of his bargain.\u201d This was no simple matter because (1) the financing that O\u2019Dowd had arranged, and which was available in September 1998, was no longer available and (2) it was not at all clear that O\u2019Dowd would be able, nearly two years later, to make a comparable deal. Thus, in the arbitrator\u2019s words, it was his task to construct an award that would \u201cprovide [O\u2019Dowd] the benefit of the prior deal as closely <em>as that may now be approximated.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The arbitrator determined that O\u2019Dowd was entitled to a new opportunity to acquire Hightower\u2019s shares at the same price, less certain deductions for the costs of his new financing and his litigation expenses. In order to make this opportunity meaningful, O\u2019Dowd would necessarily have to be given a reasonable opportunity to obtain such new financing. To accomplish this, the arbitrator provided that O\u2019Dowd would have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase, upon certain designated conditions, Hightower\u2019s shares <em>within six months of the date of the confirmation </em>of the award (which, as already noted, the arbitrator designated as a Partial Final Award).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Obviously, this option would be of no value to O\u2019Dowd unless it were a firm and final right. Without assurance that O\u2019Dowd\u2019s legal right to make the purchase was finally resolved, it would be difficult to obtain the new financing, and enforcement of the option rights would be subject to continuing uncertainty. \u201c[A]n arbitration award is not a judgment having the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>force and effect as a judgment in a civil action until it is confirmed [citations] and . . . until it is confirmed it has only the same force and effect as a contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration [citations] . . . .\u201d <em>(Trollope v. Jeffries </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 816, 822 [128 Cal.Rptr. 115]; \u00a7 1287.6.) It was obviously for this reason that the arbitrator expressly provided that his Partial Final Award would be subject to confirmation while, at the same time, he reserved jurisdiction to make a final award settling all remaining issues not capable of resolution until <em>after </em>O\u2019Dowd had exercised his option and completed the necessary preparations to complete the purchase of Hightower\u2019s shares. A number of actual and potential unresolved issues were described in the Partial Final Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">We view this incremental process structured by the arbitrator as reasonably necessary, if not essential, to the effective establishment and enforcement of the remedy that the arbitrator has fashioned. We find no violation of section 1283.4, as argued by Hightower. The arbitrator has not improperly left undecided issues \u201cnecessary in order to determine the controversy.\u201d Rather, he has determined all issues that are necessary to the resolution of the essential dispute arising from Hightower\u2019s breach. The arbitrator\u2019s judgment on this point must be respected. <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 367, 372-374; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 690.) Nothing remains to be resolved except those potential and conditional issues that necessarily could not have been determined on April 25, 2000, when the Partial Final Award was issued.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s choice of a remedy must be viewed as including this incremental or multistep process involving an initial and a final award, both of which would be subject to confirmation by the court. In order to sustain the Partial Final Award, it is only necessary that we find a link between relief granted in the award and the contractual terms of the Shareholders Agreement as (1) actually interpreted by the arbitrator or (2) an interpretation implied in the award itself or (3) a plausible theory of the contract\u2019s general subject matter, framework or intent. <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 381.) We have no trouble finding the required link in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">The Shareholders Agreement contained reciprocal buy-sell provisions giving each party an opportunity to buy out the other under conditions that necessarily involved uncertainties as to who would ultimately succeed, the final sale price, how much time the sale would take to complete and what financing could be obtained: A breach by one party, as occurred here, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>only be effectively remedied by giving the injured party a fair opportunity to restructure the purchase that the other\u2019s wrongful conduct had aborted. To provide such fair opportunity it was, as we have said, reasonable and appropriate, if not essential, that the arbitrator adopt the incremental award process reflected in the partial final award. Because of the particular terms of the parties\u2019 contract and the conditional obligations assumed by them, it could be concluded that they impliedly consented to this remedial process produced by the arbitrator. In any event, it is certainly clear that such a remedy choice by the arbitrator \u201c \u2018bears a rational relationship to the underlying contract as interpreted, expressly or impliedly, by the arbitrator ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Moshonov v. Walsh, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. <em>777.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Hightower insists, however, that if we sanction such an incremental award process we necessarily will place him in a \u201cjudicial limbo\u201d where he would be unable to effectively seek appellate review of any determination made by an arbitrator in an initial or partial award and that as a result he would sustain substantial prejudice. We reject this argument since any partial award, as we have already noted, would be subject to confirmation. Upon such confirmation, it will be appropriate for the trial court to issue an interlocutory judgment establishing, in accordance with the terms of such award, the issues and matters resolved thereby and providing a basis and means for the judicial enforcement thereof. (See generally <em>Rubin v. Western Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1545-1548 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 648].) Appellate relief from such judgment, as is true with respect to interlocutory judgments generally, would be available by application for an extraordinary writ. The granting of appellate relief at this stage, however, would, as in all such cases, require a proper showing of justification for immediate appellate intervention; in other words, the aggrieved party would have to make a demonstration as to why an appeal from the judgment confirming the ultimate final award would not be adequate. (See generally Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 1999) ffl[ 15:1.2 to 15:6.5.) If such a showing is made, however, the appellate court could consider issues relating to the validity of any partial award under all relevant statutory and decisional authority. Thus, if Hight-ower can demonstrate the necessary prejudice arising from a delay in appellate review of any interlocutory judgment confirming the partial final award, he would be entitled to seek appropriate relief.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">We therefore hold that the arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award was entirely proper, even though there remained a number of potential and conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>issues that the arbitrator will have to address in a final order in order to give total and complete relief to O\u2019Dowd and to enforce Hightower\u2019s rights under the Partial Final Award. This process does not offend section 1283.4 or any other statutory provision; nor was it precluded by the terms of the Shareholders Agreement or the rules applicable to the arbitration.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Indeed, as we have suggested, it was impliedly authorized by that agreement (or at least the arbitrator could reasonably so conclude) and it is consistent with the \u201cbroad authority\u201d granted by the applicable rules.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">The order to show cause issued on September 27, 2000, is discharged. A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue directing the trial court, in accordance with section 1286 (see <em>Louise Gardens of Encino Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 658, 660), to supplement its order of June 27, 2000, which denied Hightower\u2019s petition to vacate the Partial Final Award by adding to such order a further order confirming that award. An appropriate interlocutory judgment should then be entered thereon and an order made sending the matter back to the arbitrator for such further proceedings as may be required to permit the issuance of a final award resolving all remaining issues. The motion of O\u2019Dowd, dated October 30, 2000, to dismiss Hightower\u2019s petition for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>of mandate, is denied as moot.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Each party shall bear their own costs in this writ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Klein, P.

Indeed, their decisions may not have been in their personal or financial best interest (loss of stock options, loss of sales commissions, necessity to find other work probably out of the area necessitating periods of unemployment and requiring them to uproot their families). Nevertheless each decided, independently of each other and of O\u2019Dowd, to quit if Hightower succeeded and O\u2019Dowd departed Green Hills. They did so not because of any indictment by O\u2019Dowd but because they each believed that they could not and would not work at a Green Hills run by Hightower, [f] Each Vice-President had a sizeable financial interest in O\u2019Dowd succeeding in his buy-out by virtue of the likely increased value of their options. It would be n\u00e1ive to think that O\u2019Dowd did not calculate the effect of his plan to sell Hightower\u2019s shares back to the Company if he succeeded in buying them nor that O\u2019Dowd was not pleased by the decisions of his top managers to support his plan. But these circumstances do not establish any conspiracy or agreement between those individuals and O\u2019Dowd to do what they did. Rather, Hightower and his history with the Company and with each of these individuals was the direct cause of their individual decisions. Hightower failed to prove that O\u2019Dowd\u2019s conduct caused the actions taken by the Vice-Presidents. . . . ftO . . . [With respect to the other corporate employees] the evidence credibly establishes that it was largely the reverence of those employees [for] O\u2019Dowd\u2019s leadership and their concern about a Hightower-led Green Hills which motivated their actions. They believed that the success of the Company had been and was largely the result of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s leadership and that the future prospects for Green Hills (and the value of their stock options) were at best uncertain under Hightower, In part this belief was derived from the employees\u2019 personal history with O\u2019Dowd and the obvious success the Company enjoyed. Many of the employees had had some exposure to Hightower over the years, some more than others, and in part their impressions were formed by this direct information. They were also undoubtedly influenced by the example of the Vice-Presidents, who made no secret of their intentions. The senior executives\u2019 announced intentions to depart Green Hills constituted an indictment of High-tower as well as a likely self-fulfilling prophesy about the future of Green Hills.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1075-6\"> There were several other derivative and/or peripheral claims asserted by Hightower that the arbitrator also expressly considered and rejected. For obvious reasons, we have no need to summarize or review them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1076-9\"> We here summarize and/or quote from the award to provide factual context for our subsequent discussion of the propriety of the making of a \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201cinterim\u201d award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1076-10\"> We are informed by the parties that the injunction was in fact lifted by the trial court sometime after April 25, 2000. This allowed O\u2019Dowd to go forward and attempt to complete the purchase of Hightower\u2019s shares. As we discuss below, the delivery of the purchase price ($47 million) and the transfer of Hightower\u2019s shares took place on October 13, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"Aq1\"> There were 10 such conditions, which the arbitrator described as follows: \u201c1. The purchase price of $47 million is established by the prior offer of [O\u2019Dowd] dated June 26, 1998. \u201c2. The purchase price shall be offset and reduced by all dividends paid to [Hightower] based on Green Hills\u2019 earnings for the Third Quarter of 1998 and thereafter until the date of purchase of [Hightower\u2019s] shares; said offset shall be reduced by the amount of ordinary taxable income of Green Hills (excluding long term capital gains) attributable to [Hightower] for the period September 24, 1998 until the purchase date multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is .1367 and the denominator of which is .7070. \u201c3. The purchase price shall be offset and reduced by all salary paid to [Hightower] for the period September 24, 1998 to the date of purchase of [Hightower\u2019s] shares; said offset shall be reduced by any amounts actually withheld from such salary. \u201c4. The purchase price shall also be offset and reduced by the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses found to be due to [O\u2019Dowd], in the amount of $2,512,338.87. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>\u201c5. Because the offsets in \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 above are necessarily based on estimates, either party may request readjustment of the purchase price after the transaction is completed and based on actual numbers. <em>The arbitrator reserves jurisdiction to order such adjustments. </em>\u201c6. The option to purchase [Hightower\u2019s] shares may be exercised by [O\u2019Dowd] at any time from the date of this award and until six months after confirmation of this award, including the final disposition of any appeals from such confirmation. The date of purchase of [Hightower\u2019s] shares for purposes of computing the purchase price and for all other purposes shall be the date [O\u2019Dowd] tenders the payment price to [Hightower], Tender shall be made by [O\u2019Dowd] or his agent presenting a check or checks aggregating the full amount of the purchase price made payable to [Hightower] drawn on good funds in United States banks at the offices of counsel for [Hightower] during regular business hours and after giving at least two hours telephonic or fax notice thereof. \u201c7. Simultaneously with and in exchange for the tender, [Hightower] or his agent shall deliver to [O\u2019Dowd] all of [Hightower\u2019s] share certificates in Green Hills with properly endorsed stock powers (\u2018Shares\u2019). \u201c8. In the event [Hightower] does not deliver his Shares to [O\u2019Dowd] simultaneously with the tender, [O\u2019Dowd] shall hold the check or checks for the purchase price for delivery to [Hightower] in exchange for Shares for five days. During such time, the exchange may be made by [Hightower] or his agent presenting the Shares at the offices of Green Hills or such other location as [O\u2019Dowd] may designate in writing, during business hours and after giving at least 12 hours telephonic or fax notice thereof. \u201c9. In the event the exchange does not take place within the foregoing five days, [O\u2019Dowd] may release the funds for the purchase price, and the amount and procedures for any payment to [Hightower] for the Shares <em>shall be determined by the arbitrator, who reserves jurisdiction for such purpose. </em>\u201c10. Notwithstanding the foregoing procedure for a delayed exchange and for further arbitral proceedings, [O\u2019Dowd\u2019s] purchase of [Hightower\u2019s] shares for all purposes shall be deemed to have occurred on the date [O\u2019Dowd] tenders the purchase price as provided herein.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1078-9\"> Section 1286.2 provides, in relevant part: \u201c[T]he count <em>shall </em>vacate the award if the court determines any of the following: [10 . . . [10 (d) The arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1078-10\"> Hightower advanced several other arguments in support of his petition to vacate the partial final award, but he does not advance them in his petition to this court and we therefore need not address them in this writ proceeding. <em>(Kim </em>v. <em>Sumitomo Bank </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 979 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 834].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1078-11\"> Section 1283.4 provides that: \u201cThe award shall be in writing and signed by the arbitrators concurring therein. It shall include <em>a determination of all the questions </em>submitted to the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1078-12\"> The trial court\u2019s order only denied Hightower\u2019s petition, it did not then go on to confirm the Partial Final Award as was required by section 1286. (See <em>Louise Gardens of Encino Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 648, 658, 660 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 378].) Hightower raised this issue with the trial court in a memorandum filed on August 11, 2000, but he did not actually file a petition for confirmation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1079-6\"> If it was the trial court\u2019s view that the partial final award did resolve all issues arising out of this stock buy-sell dispute, then we must disagree. In our view, and obviously in the arbitrator\u2019s, a number of potential, unresolved issues conditionally remained. That is why the arbitrator designated his award as a \u201cpartial\u201d award. As we explain, the trial court correctly denied Hightower\u2019s petition to vacate the award not because it in fact had resolved all issues, but rather because the use of a \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201cinterim\u201d order was proper in the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1079-7\"> This alternative relief was requested by Hightower so that he could then file an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition to vacate. From Hightower\u2019s perspective, this was simply a procedural request to permit him to attack on appeal the merits of the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition. He does not actually advance the proposition that the partial final award should be confirmed on its merits. O\u2019Dowd, on the other hand, also argues that the award should have been confirmed, but he does so because he contends the arbitrator was procedurally correct in making that award. We thus have the unusual circumstance of both parties seeking the same apparent relief, albeit for different purposes and for different reasons. As we explain below, we will grant the requested relief but we do so for the reasons urged by O\u2019Dowd.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1079-8\"> This sum is less than the $47 million specified in O\u2019Dowd\u2019s original June 26, 1998 offer, which was endorsed and enforced by the partial final award. It appears that O\u2019Dowd has taken the deductions from the amount to be paid to Hightower as specified or estimated in the partial final award. Whether any or all of such deductions are accurate or proper is not clear. However, that is not an issue before us in this matter, but rather it is a question properly addressed to the arbitrator following remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1079-9\"> These funds were paid in the form of two checks, which were immediately endorsed and deposited by Hightower. The checks cleared O\u2019Dowd\u2019s bank on October 16, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1079-10\"> Hightower\u2019s \u201cacceptance\u201d of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s payment was made under protest as described in his counsel\u2019s cover letter of October 13, 2000 to Frank Meredith, counsel for O\u2019Dowd: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>\u201cYou have tendered to us an amount which you have advised us is the sum called for in the arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award, a sum that Mr. Hightower is not able to verify, so as to obligate Mr. Hightower to deliver his Green Hills shares to Mr. O\u2019Dowd. \u201cIn response to your client\u2019s invocation of the Partial Final Award, which requires that Mr. Hightower deliver to Mr. O\u2019Dowd all of Mr. Hightower\u2019s share simultaneously with your tender of this sum, we are handing you herewith Mr. Hightower\u2019s shares of Green Hills, with stock assignment separate from certificate. \u201cPlease be advised that we do so under protest, and under compulsion of the Partial Final Award, and your invocation of it only, and without waiver of any rights or remedies of Mr. Hightower, including his right to seek to and [sic] vacate and/or modify the Partial Final Award, pursuant to the proceeding now pending in the Court of Appeal, or other proceedings which may occur with respect to this matter. \u201cMr. Hightower does not voluntarily acquiesce in or recognize the validity of the arbitrator\u2019s award. He takes the position that he is not entitled to the check you have delivered that Mr. O\u2019Dowd or Green Hills is not entitled to Mr. Hightower\u2019s shares, and that Mr. O\u2019Dowd or Green Hills will be holding such shares in trust for Mr. Hightower. He further takes the position that the award will be vacated and rendered a nullity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1080-8\"> The October 23, 2000, letter of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s counsel addressed to the arbitrator stated: \u201cThis is a request on behalf of Mr. O\u2019Dowd for an immediate hearing before Mr. Chemick on the following matters: \u201c1. Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s claim that his tender on October 13, 2000 of $41,585,388 which was accepted by Mr. Hightower was effective to terminate any interest of Mr. Hightower in Green Hills Software, Inc. Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s tender letter, the Declaration of Robert Hull respecting the purchase price pursuant to the award (which had not been disputed by Hightower) and the cancelled checks cashed by Mr. Hightower are attached hereto as Exhibits A, B and C, respectively. \u201c2. Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s claim that Mr. Hightower, who was terminated as an officer and director of Green Hills Software, Inc. on October 13, 2000, is obligated to return to Green Hills Software, Inc. all original minutes, shareholders records and other original records obtained or created by him in his capacity as Secretary of the corporation. A copy of Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s demand letter which has been ignored by Mr. Hightower is attached hereto as Exhibit D. \u201c3. Mr. O\u2019 Dowd\u2019s claim that Mr. Hightower must return to Green Hills Software, Inc. all propriety data, whether in written or electronic form that he obtained by reason of his position as a director and officer of that corporation. A copy of Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s demand letter which has been ignored by Mr. Hightower is attached hereto as Exhibit E. \u201c4. Mr. Hightower\u2019s claim set forth in the letter from his counsel dated October 13, 2000, attached hereto as Exhibit F, that Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s purchase of all of his shares in Green Hills Software, Inc. was under duress or some form of improper compulsion. \u201c5. Mr. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s claim for attorneys fees incurred after April 1, 2000. \u201c6. Upon resolution of the foregoing claims, a Final Award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1080-16\"> We have been advised that on December 29, 2000, the arbitrator issued a ruling setting a briefing schedule and a date for hearing on O\u2019Dowd\u2019s request for ruling on the remaining issues. That hearing has been scheduled, after one continuance, for March 26, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1081-9\"> 0\u2019Dowd also raises other arguments that we need not address in view of the conclusion which we reach in this matter. For example, we have no need to consider O\u2019Dowd\u2019s argument that Hightower\u2019s acceptance of the funds tendered on October 13, 2000, constituted an acceptance of benefits that compels dismissal of Hightower\u2019s writ petition. We therefore will deny as moot O\u2019Dowd\u2019s motion to dismiss filed herein on October 30, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1083-5\"> Section 1286.2 sets forth the grounds for vacation of an arbitrator\u2019s award. It states in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he court shall vacate the award if the court determines [that]: HQ (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; HQ (b) There was corruption in any of the arbitrators; HQ (c) The rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitration; HQ (d) The arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted[; or] HQ (e) The rights of such party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title.\u201d In addition, section 1286.6 provides grounds for correction of an arbitration award. That section states in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he court, unless it vacates the award pursuant to Section 1286.2, shall correct the award and confirm it as corrected if the court determines that: HQ (a) There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award; HQ (b) The arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted; or HQ (c) The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1083-7\"> In <em>Elliott &amp; Ten Eyck Partnership v. City of Long Beach </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 495 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 140], the arbitrator issued a \u201csupplemental\u201d award that modified portions of the initial award and added new provisions thereto; in short, the supplemental award \u201ceffected a substantive change in the award.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 502.) The court held that, unlike a sitting judicial officer, an arbitrator had no such power. (Ibid.; \u00a7\u00a7 1284, 1286.6, subds. (a) &amp; (c).) This, of course, is not what happened here. The remedy fashioned by the arbitrator in this case necessarily required utilization of an incremental award process; it did not involve a correction or modification of the original award as was the case in the <em>Elliott &amp; Ten Eyck </em>decision. Hightower also cites <em>Dickens </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 985 [281 Cal.Rptr. 783] as supportive of his position. However, <em>Dickens </em>is a <em>judicial </em>arbitration case and presents no issues arising from, nor is it useful in construing, implementing, or applying, the <em>contractual </em>arbitration statutes. (\u00a7 1280 et seq.) In <em>M.B. Zaninovich, Inc. v. Teamster Farmworker Local Union 946 </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 410 [150 Cal.Rptr. 233], the arbitrator\u2019s award failed to include a ruling on the critical issue of how much money was owing to the defendant union and was silent as to the number of employees who had authorized paycheck deductions for union initiation fees and dues, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>dates of such authorizations and the total amount of such deductions. The court properly concluded that the award should be vacated because it clearly had failed to resolve submitted issues, \u201cthe decision of which [were] necessary in order to determine the controversy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 413-415.) Again, this case is of no help to Hightower as it rests upon a patent failure by the arbitrator to decide a submitted issue. The Partial Final Award before us cannot fairly be charged with such an omission. The only \u201cunresolved\u201d issues were those potential conditional issues that could only arise <em>after </em>the partial final award had been confirmed and the required actions of the parties thereunder had or had not occurred. Finally, in <em>Banks v. Milwaukee Ins. Co. </em>(1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 34 [55 Cal.Rptr. 139, 36 A.L.R.3d 933], the arbitrator filed a \u201ccorrection\u201d to the initial award that purported to substantially alter the award by adding an award of general damages, which had been omitted from the arbitrator\u2019s decision as originally filed. For all of the reasons mentioned above in our discussion of the <em>Elliott &amp; Ten Eyck </em>opinion, the decision of the <em>Banks </em>court provides no assistance to Hightower.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1086-7\"> The <em>Advanced Micro </em>court cautioned, however, that it did not mean to suggest that an arbitrator\u2019s exercise of discretion in ordering relief was unrestricted or unreviewable. \u201cThe powers of an arbitrator derive from, and are limited by, the agreement to arbitrate. [Citation.] Awards in excess of those powers may, under sections 1286.2 and 1286.6, be corrected or vacated by the court.\u201d <em>(Advanced Micro, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 375.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1088-7\"> As we have already noted, the rules referred to are those in effect on August 24, 1998, when Hightower made his written demand for arbitration.

This argument is summarily rejected. It simply begs the larger question that we have already addressed: Does an arbitrator have the authority in a proper case to fashion a remedy which utilizes partial or interim awards? Because we have answered that question in the affirmative, we need say no more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1092-6\"> See footnote 27, <em>ante. </em>We also do not address any issues relating to the arbitrator\u2019s determination that Hightower was entitled to relief on his claim for reformation of Green Hills\u2019s articles. In view of the result we reach and the fact that Hightower\u2019s shares have been transferred and cancelled, any question of reformation is now moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
