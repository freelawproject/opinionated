He filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1094.5, seeking judicial review of a decision by the City Council of the City of Novato (City Council) suspending him for four days without pay. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that it was barred by the limitations provision in section 1094.6, subdivision (b), because it was filed more than 90 days after the date the City Council\u2019s decision became \u201cfinal,\u201d which the trial court concluded was the date of a cover letter accompanying the decision mailed to him. Appellant contends that the City Council\u2019s decision was not served in compliance with the statute, and thus denial of his petition as untimely was improper. We agree, holding that the cover letter does not meet the statutory requirement that the mailing include \u201ca copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing\u201d (\u00a7 1094.6, subd. (b)). We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">On October 30, 1997, appellant, a corporal with the Novato Police Department (Department), received a \u201cNotice of Proposed Discipline\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Department\u2019s police chief proposing that appellant be \u201cdemot[ed] in rank, up to termination\u201d for alleged misconduct. On January 20, 1998, Novato City Manager Roderick Wood issued a written decision agreeing with the recommendation to demote appellant from the rank of corporal to officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On January 26, 1998, appellant filed an administrative appeal from the city manager\u2019s decision, the hearing on which was held on April 14, 1998, before an administrative law judge (ALJ). On May 6, the ALJ issued her proposed decision recommending that appellant\u2019s appeal be upheld because the demotion was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">On August 11, 1998, the City Council reversed the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision and imposed upon appellant a four-day suspension without pay. On September 8, 1998, the City Council issued a written decision memorializing its proposed decision, which decision stated in relevant part, \u201cUnless a shorter period applies, any judicial challenge to this decision is governed by Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1094.6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">On September 9, 1998, Novato Deputy City Manager David Rowlands mailed a copy of the City Council\u2019s decision and a cover letter to appellant\u2019s representative, William McPoil, at McPoil\u2019s Sacramento address.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">On September 10, 1998, Rowlands allegedly mailed the City Council\u2019s decision to appellant at \u201c2414 Grads Hill Street, Santa Rosa, CA 95402,\u201d although appellant\u2019s correct mailing address was \u201c2414 <em>Gads </em>Hill Street, Santa Rosa, CA <em>95401.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Accompanying the decision was a cover letter dated September 10, 1998, addressed to appellant at an address with the same errors in the street name and zip code. The cover letter reads in its entirety as follows: \u201cDear Mr. Donnellan: [\u00b6] Enclosed please find a copy of the City Council\u2019s decision regarding your appeal of the proposed discipline from [the police chief], [\u00b6] If you have any questions, please contact me. [\u00b6] Sincerely, [\u00b6] David Rowlands [\u00b6] Deputy City Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">On December 21, 1998, appellant filed a verified petition for writ of mandate under sections 1085 and 1094.5 naming the City Council and the City of Novato (hereafter collectively respondents).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 8, 1999, the petition was denied as untimely, on the ground that it was not filed within 90 days of the September 9, 1998, the date of the cover letter mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>appellant\u2019s representative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter this court granted the parties\u2019 motion for a stipulated reversal of the judgment, and remanded the matter to the trial court based on <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 819, 824-830 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 144], which held that under section 1094.6 the administrative decision must be served on the party and not the party\u2019s representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">On remand, respondents again asserted that the writ petition was untimely, this time because it was not filed within 90 days of September 10, 1998, the date of Rowlands\u2019s letter to appellant enclosing the decision. Respondents\u2019 untimeliness claim was supported with declarations by Rowlands and a United States Postal Service (USPS) employee. Rowlands\u2019s declaration, dated October 27, 1999, states that on September 10, 1998, he placed the cover letter addressed to appellant in a mailbox, postage prepaid, with the aforementioned errors as to appellant\u2019s street name and zip code, and that the envelope bore the City of Novato\u2019s return address. Rowlands further declared that almost two months earlier he had sent appellant a letter containing the same address errors as the September 10 mailing, and that several days later appellant called him in response to that mailing. Finally, Rowlands declared that he had received no indication that the September 10 mailing was not properly delivered to appellant at his Gads Hill Street address, or that the mailing was returned to the City as undeliverable. The essence of the USPS employee\u2019s declaration was that the September 10, 1998 mailing was in fact delivered to appellant, and that the \u201cminor\u201d address and zip code errors would likely have delayed delivery by a day at most.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">At the hearing on remand appellant conceded that he had received the City Council\u2019s decision \u201csoon\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> after it was assertedly mailed to him, but argued that respondents had not strictly complied with the service requirements of section 1094.6, subdivision (b). Respondents argued that only substantial compliance with section 1094.6 is required. The court agreed, and determined that respondents had substantially complied with the notice requirements of section 1094.6, and that Rowlands\u2019s cover letter satisfied the requirement of a \u201ccertificate of mailing.\u201d The court also noted that appellant had not declared that he failed to receive the decision. The court concluded that, despite the fact that the address contained \u201ctwo minor mistakes,\u201d the City Council\u2019s decision was served on appellant on September 10, 1998, and thus his petition was untimely. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Section 1094.6 permits local agencies, except school districts, to shorten the period for review of decisions subject to review under section 1094.5, \u201csuspending, demoting, or dismissing an officer or employee . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1094.6, subd. (e).) When, as here, section 1094.6 applies, a petition for judicial review of a decision of a local agency under section 1094.5 must be filed \u201cnot later than the 90th day following the date on which the decision becomes final.\u201d (\u00a7 1094.6, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Section 1094.6, subdivision (b), provides in relevant part: \u201cIf [as in this case] there is a provision for a written decision or written findings, the decision is final for purposes of this section upon the date it is mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, including a copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing, to the party seeking the writ. Subdivision (a) of Section 1013 does not apply to extend the time, following deposit in the mail of the decision or findings, within which a petition shall be filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Section 1094.6, subdivision (f),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires the local agency to provide notice to the party that section 1094.6 governs the time within which judicial review of the local agency\u2019s decision must be sought. And the 90-day limitations provision of section 1094.6 does not begin to run until the subdivision (f) notice is given. <em>(El Dorado Palm Springs, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Review Com. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 335, 345 [281 Cal.Rptr. 327]; <em>Cummings v. City of Vernon </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 919, 922 [263 Cal.Rptr. 97].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Here there is no dispute that the City Council\u2019s decision itself provided the notice required under section 1094.6, subdivision (f). The issue rather is whether the notice requirements of subdivision (b) were met by Rowlands\u2019s September 10, 1998 cover letter, an issue that appears to be one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Appellant contends that the requirements of section 1094.6, subdivision (b), must be strictly complied with, and that respondents\u2019 failure to include with the City Council\u2019s decision an affidavit or certificate of mailing does not constitute such strict compliance. So, his argument runs, the 90-day limitations period never began to run, and his petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Respondents rejoin that \u201cAll that [section 1094.6, subdivision (b)] requires to begin the running of the 90-day statute of limitations [period] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>mailing by first-class mail, postage prepaid\u201d; that section 1094.6, subdivision (b), does not define or specify the requirements of an \u201caffidavit or certificate of mailing,\u201d and thus substantial compliance is all that is required; and that Rowlands\u2019s cover letter dated September 10, 1998, was sufficient to enable appellant to calculate the date by which a timely petition had to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Resolution of this issue involves a question of statutory interpretation of section 1094.6, subdivision (b), and therefore we review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Richards, Watson &amp; Gershon v. King </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1179 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 169].)  \u201c[O]ur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. . . . [Citations.]\u201d (Dyna<em>Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201c[W]e consider each section of the statute in the context of the statute as a whole. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Stites Prof. Law Corp. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1718, 1726 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 570].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In construing section 1094.6, subdivision (b), we are mindful that it is a procedural limitations provision and, consequently, jurisdictional. <em>(Tielsch </em>v. <em>City of Anaheim </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 [206 Cal.Rptr. 740]; <em>Foster v. Civil Service Com. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 444, 452 [190 Cal.Rptr. 893].)  The primary purpose of a statute of limitations is to prevent the assertion of stale claims by persons who, without excuse, have failed to file their action until evidence is no longer fresh and witnesses are no longer available, thus rendering the claims difficult or impossible to defend. <em>(Addison </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, 317 [146 Cal.Rptr. 224, 578 P.2d 941].) It has also been noted that statutes of limitations are technical defenses which should be strictly construed to avoid the forfeiture of a person\u2019s rights. Such statutes are obstacles to just claims, and courts may not indulge in strained constructions to apply the statutes to the facts of a particular case. <em>(Steketee v. Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg </em>(1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>38 Cal.3d 46, 56 [210 Cal.Rptr. 781, 694 P.2d 1153]; <em>Herman v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at pp. 826-827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The triggering point for the limitations provision in issue is the \u201cdate on which the decision becomes final\u201d which, according to section 1094.6, subdivision (b), occurs when the written decision containing notice of the time within which judicial review must be sought is \u201cmailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid <em>including a copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing </em>to the party seeking the writ.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, the statutory language on its face requires the agency to include an affidavit or certificate of mailing when mailing the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The parties acknowledge that there is no uniform definition or common understanding of the terms \u201caffidavit\u201d or \u201ccertificate of mailing,\u201d and that those terms appear in various California statutes and rules of court. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 2924i, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 411.20, 664.5, 684.120, 1013, subd. (b), 1013a; Ed. Code, \u00a7 94822; Fin. Code, \u00a7 18611; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1305, subd. (b), 1305.2; Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2855, 2953; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 4.315, 1248, 1457(a).) In some instances, the Legislature has specified the contents of such an affidavit or certificate; in other instances it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Appellant argues that an \u201caffidavit or certificate of mailing\u201d is akin to a proof of service by mail and should be interpreted according to both section 1013, subdivision (b) (which concerns service by mail),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and section 1013a (which sets forth the requirements of an affidavit or certificate when such service is effected).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Respondents disagree, and in reliance on <em>Herman </em>argue that sections 1013 and 1013a do not apply because section 1010, contained within the same chapter as sections 1013 and 1013a, provides: \u201cNotices and other papers may be served upon the party or attorney in the manner prescribed in this chapter, when not otherwise provided by this code.\u201d <em>Herman </em>held that section 1010 does not apply to section 1094.6, reasoning that the latter section provides for service on a \u201cparty,\u201d that \u201csection 1010 applies to civil actions, and that no such [civil] action has been filed where an agency simply gives notice of its own decision.\u201d <em>(Herman v. Los Angeles County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number><em>Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 827; see also <em>Thierfeldt </em>v. <em>Marin Hosp. Dist. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 186, 198 [110 Cal.Rptr. 791].) We agree with respondents that section 1013, subdivision (b), and section 1013a do not apply to the notice by mail required.by section 1094.6, subdivision (b). But that does not end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The obvious purposes of the affidavit or certificate of mailing requirement of section 1094.6, subdivision (b), are to establish the fact of the date of mailing of the agency\u2019s decision, and to inform the party seeking the writ of the effective date of the mailing. Since subdivision (b) establishes that the 90-day period in which to file the writ petition is triggered only after the decision is mailed, proof of the mailing necessarily establishes, and informs the party of, the date the 90-day limitations period begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Our review of the legislative history suggests that the Legislature enacted section 1094.6, subdivision (b), to ensure that the party seeking the writ had notice of the effective date the agency\u2019s decision became final, the date triggering the 90-day limitations period. And that notice must be served properly. As the court in <em>Herman </em>put it in discussing its review of the legislative history: \u201cThe materials note that since [section 1094.6] adopted a much shorter limitations period, it was crucial that the party have proper notice.\u201d <em>(Herman </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Section 1094.6, enacted in 1976, shortened the limitations period governing the relevant writ of mandate petitions from three or four years to 90 days. <em>(Foster v. Civil Service Com., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d at p. 450; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 829.) And courts have cautioned that an interpretation of section 1094.6 which shortens the 90-day period even further should be avoided. <em>(El Dorado Palm Springs, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Review Com., supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 345; <em>Cummings v. City of Vernon, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The language in section 1094.6, subdivision (b), providing that a local agency\u2019s written decision is final upon the date it is mailed \u201cincluding a copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing,\u201d was added in 1991 by Assembly Bill No. 1484 (Stats. 1991, ch. 1090, \u00a7 6, pp. 5054-5055), \u201can omnibus civil practice bill to include noncontroversial changes in civil practice law\u201d (Comments, Assem. Ways and Means Com., Republican Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1484 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) May 29, 1991, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>1). The amendment to section 1094.6, subdivision (b), was intended to \u201cclarify when an administrative decision becomes final for purpose of filing a petition for judicial review.\u201d (Summary, Assem. Ways and Means Com. Republican Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1484, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1; Digest, Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1484 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) May 9, 1991, p. 1.) Thus we must look to the plain meaning of the terms \u201caffidavit\u201d and \u201ccertificate\u201d to ascertain precisely what section 1094.6, subdivision (b), requires, and whether the cover letter of September 10, 1998, complied with those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">\u201cAn \u2018affidavit\u2019 is a written statement verified by oath or affirmation.\u201d <em>(People v. Griffini </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 581, 587 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 590], citing <em>Common Wealth Ins. Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kersten </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 1014, 1031 [115 Cal.Rptr. 653]; \u00a7 2003.) A certificate is \u201c \u2018a written testimony to the truth of any fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dolan </em>v. <em>United States </em>(8th Cir. 1904) 133 Fed. 440, 449, quoting Webster; accord, <em>People v. Griffini, supra, </em>at pp. 586-587; <em>Cal. Employment Com. </em>v. <em>Malm </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 322, 324 [138 P.2d 744]; see also Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 218, col. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Based on all the above, we interpret section 1094.6, subdivision (b), to require that, when the local agency mails its written decision to the party seeking the writ, such mailing must include a written statement verified by oath or affirmation, or a written statement attesting to the date that the decision was mailed to the party by first class mail, postage prepaid. Only such verified or testimonial statement meets the requirements of section 1094.6. No such verified or testimonial statement was included with the decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We find support for our conclusion that affidavit and certificate mean what they say, and that Rowlands\u2019s cover letter does not measure up, in the language of other statutes as to what begins the running of the applicable limitations period. Illustrative is Revenue and Taxation Code section 6933, which states that the claimant\u2019s time to bring an action for a refund against the board begins to run on \u201cthe mailing of the notice of the board\u2019s action.\u201d Likewise, Government Code section 65009, subdivision (c) provides that actions challenging local zoning and planning decisions must be brought \u201cwithin 90 days after the legislative body\u2019s decision.\u201d Simply put, the Legislature knew how to say what it meant, and if it meant to say the date of mailing, it could have said so. It did not, but rather, and specifically, said that there must be \u201cinclud[ed]\u201d with the decision \u201ca copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.6, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Respondents argued, and the trial court found, that Rowlands\u2019s cover letter satisfied the \u201ccertificate of mailing requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. It is probably enough to say that the letter was not a certificate: it was not \u201ctestimony\u201d to the truth. (See <em>People v. Griffini, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 586-587.) Beyond that, while the September 10, 1998 date on the face of the cover letter may reasonably suggest that that was the date of its <em>writing, </em>it does not establish that the letter and the City Council\u2019s decision were <em>mailed </em>on that date. Certainly, it is reasonably possible, and often the case, that a letter is not mailed on the date it is written. Neither the cover letter nor the City Council\u2019s decision establishes or verifies the date the decision was in fact mailed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">In addition, the after-the-fact declaration of Rowlands stating that he mailed the cover letter to appellant by first class mail, postage prepaid, on September 10, 1998, does not satisfy the requirements of section 1094.6, because under the express language of the statute the facts of the mailing must be attested to in a written statement <em>included </em>with the written decision. (See <em>West </em>v. <em>West </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 120, 125 [154 Cal.Rptr. 667] [after-the-fact certification of mailing does not comply with \u00a7 1013a proof of mailing requirements].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We also reject respondents\u2019 argument that appellant\u2019s admission that he received the decision and his failure to produce evidence of the date he received it permitted the trial court to infer that he received the decision more than 90 days prior to filing the petition. As noted, the Legislature intended that a local agency give the affected party direct written notice at the time its decision is mailed of the date the decision was mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid. Such notice is effective when given in the manner required by section 1094.6, subdivision (b), not when it is actually received. (See <em>El Dorado Palm Springs, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Review Com., supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 347.) Furthermore, the requirement of an affidavit or certificate of mailing establishing the date the local agency\u2019s decision is mailed necessarily precludes a mere <em>inference </em>of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We conclude that respondents failed to provide appellant notice of the effective date of mailing of their decision in the manner required by section 1094.6, subdivision (b), at any time prior to appellant\u2019s filing of his petition. Thus the petition was timely filed, and the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to reinstate the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Jones, P.

Consequently, our review concerns purely legal issues of statutory interpretation, and we need not address the effect, if any, of the errors in appellant\u2019s address and zip code, nor appellant\u2019s claim that the statute of limitations was tolled by the mailing of the decision at the incorrect address. Because of this, the substantial evidence rules of appellate review on which respondents rely are inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> Section 1013, subdivision (b), provides: \u201cThe copy of the notice or other paper served by mail pursuant to this chapter shall bear a notation of the date and place of mailing or be accompanied by an unsigned copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> The City Council does not assert that its cover letter constituted an \u201caffidavit\u201d for purposes of section 1094.6, subdivision (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
