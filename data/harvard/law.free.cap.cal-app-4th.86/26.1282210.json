J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">The chief question in this case is whether a broker-dealer of securities has a common law duty to supervise sales by its registered representatives of investments in which the broker-dealer has no economic interest to persons who are not customers of the broker-dealer. We hold that where, as here, the registered representative is not an employee of the broker-dealer, has no actual or apparent authority to sell the investment at issue, and the broker had no notice of and did not in any way benefit from the transaction, the broker-dealer has no such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In 1996 and 1997, appellants Kenneth and Sandra Asplund and Marguerite Summers purchased promissory notes issued by Medco, Inc. (Medco), a Florida-based medical equipment company, from Joseph P. Tufo. Tufo was a registered representative of respondent Selected Investments in Financial Equities, Inc. (SIFE), a California corporation that is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also as a broker-dealer with the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). SIFE\u2019s only purpose is to act as a management company for a mutual fund, the SIFE Trust Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In October 1997 a federal court enjoined Medco from offering or selling promissory notes, which the SEC alleged to be \u201can elaborate Ponzi scheme\u201d in violation of federal securities laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 24, 1997, the California Department of Corporations, acting under the authority of section 25532 of the Corporations Code, issued an order directing Medco, Tufo and others to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale in the State of California of investment contracts, promissory notes or any other securities of Medco on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the ground such securities were unqualified for sale in this state. Five months later SIFE terminated its relationship with Tufo, who was subsequently charged by the SEC with violating federal securities laws, and by the Department of Corporations for violating the California Corporations Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Medco eventually failed and was placed in receivership. As a result of their investments in Medco, appellants lost approximately $154,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Appellants commenced this action in March 1998 by filing a complaint against Tufo, his wife, and his family trust, naming also numerous Doe defendants. In May 1998 appellants amended their complaint by naming SIFE a defendant. In August 1998 Tufo filed for bankruptcy. Thereafter appellants dismissed their complaint as against him without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">All but one of appellants\u2019 seven causes of action against SIFE are based on a theory of vicarious liability. Alleging that Tufo had actual or ostensible authority to act in its behalf, appellants sought to impose vicarious liability on SIFE for misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence and breach of an oral contract. The remaining cause of action against SIFE asserted direct liability for negligent failure to supervise Tufo in his repre: sentative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">In March 1999, SIFE moved for summary judgment claiming (1) that SIFE could not be found vicariously liable because Tufo\u2019s sales of investments in Medco were not within the scope of his agency relationship with SIFE, and (2) that direct liability could not be imposed because SIFE had no duty to supervise Tufo with respect to his sale of investment products such as Medco in which it had no financial interest, as such sales were outside the scope of its agency relationship with Tufo.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on September 20, 1999, and on that basis thereafter entered judgment for SIFE.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Kenneth and Sandra Asplund first learned that Tufo offered investments in Medco from a radio advertisement. What impressed them was that the ad described a fully secured investment that returned a steady 12 to 16 percent annual return. They phoned Tufo for an appointment and met with him about five times. Tufo informed the Asplunds that in addition to selling investments he was an insurance agent with the Farmers Insurance Group. As to investments, he offered two \u201coptions.\u201d The first was to invest in the SIFE Trust Fund, which Tufo described as a mutual fund; the second was to purchase promissory notes in Medco. Tufo stated that Medco leased medical equipment to hospitals and physicians and that it was \u201ca very safe investment\u201d because the loan was secured by the equipment. He also said that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>unlike a mutual fund that goes up and down in value, the Medco notes produced \u201ca steady 12 to 16 percent,\u201d depending upon the amount of the investment and the maturity date. After considering these options, the As-plunds decided Medco was the better investment and initially purchased promissory notes in the amount of $50,000. Thereafter, in order to receive returns greater than 12 percent, which required a higher investment, the Asplunds used money from a bank certificate of deposit and a checking account to invest an additional $48,000. The Asplunds lost all but $18,000 of their entire $98,000 investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Kenneth Asplund also recommended an investment in Medco to appellant Robert Summers, his uncle, who purchased Medco notes in the amount of $56,000 in May 1997, a few months before he died.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summers apparently also lost all or most of this investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Sandra Asplund believed there was a relationship between SIFE and Medco because Tufo promoted investments in both and because his business card contained SIFE\u2019s name \u201cin big bold letters, and the words \u2018Joseph Tufo, Registered Representative,\u2019 directly across from the SIFE logo.\u201d In a declaration, she stated that she reached this conclusion also because Tufo provided her and her husband with a chart showing the performance of the SIFE Trust Fund over 15 years, which stated in large print \u201cJoseph P. Tufo Registered Representative,\u201d and he also provided them a copy of the SIFE 1995 annual report. The annual report commenced with the statement: \u201cGoing Strong: $600 million and growing\u201d and listed the numerous financial institutions, other large corporations and United States treasury bills in which SIFE invested. The annual report also contained a section entitled \u201cAdditional SIFE Services\u201d which stated that the SIFE Trust Fund provided \u201ccontinuing individual services to the Investor,\u201d and stated that \u201c[inquiries concerning any of SIFE\u2019s services may be directed to your representative or the home office. . . .\u201d Based on the business card, the chart and the annual report, Mrs. Asplund \u201cunderstood that Mr. Tufo was a registered representative of SIFE, and that he was advising us regarding investments offered by SIFE [and] that the options offered included Medco as well as the SIFE Trust Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Carl Regalado, who also purchased Medco investments from Tufo,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified at deposition that one of the reasons he was impressed with Tufo was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>his connection with SIFE. Regalado assumed Tufo was employed by SIFE which he knew to be \u201ca very good company.\u201d He thought SIFE was the company he was dealing with, because \u201cSIFE is an investment company, and that\u2019s what I\u2014that\u2019s what this was all about.\u201d Because he thought SIFE was involved in the investment, Regalado \u201cfelt very comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Virginia Redler, an employee of Tufo and also an investor in both SIFE and Medco, testified at deposition that Tufo \u201cgot a lot of people into his other schemes by, you know, the legit thing of SIFE.\u201d Appellants never claimed, however, that Tufo ever explicitly represented that Medco was affiliated with SIFE, and Tufo testified that he never made any such representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Tufo was not an employee of SIFE but became a registered representative for the SIFE trust in 1985 or 1986. As a result of that relationship, Tufo was licensed by the NASD through SIFE.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relationship between SIFE and Tufo was defined by the \u201cSales Representative Agreement\u201d they entered into in 1993. By this agreement, SIFE appointed Tufo \u201cas its agent for the sale and distribution of Participating Agreements of the Trust Fund, . . .\u201d Paragraph 2.1 of the agreement stated \u201cthe parties\u2019 intention that Sales Representative [i.e., Tufo] shall be an independent contractor and not an employee of SIFE. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be taken as evidence of an employer-employee relationship, an association, a partnership or a joint venture among the parties. Although Sales Representative is subject to the supervision and control of SIFE regarding the sales of Participating Agreements [i.e., shares or units in SIFE] in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and other rules and regulations regarding the sales of securities, Sales Representative shall determine the time, place and details of sales presentations to prospective investors. While Sales Representative is expected to devote substantial effort and time to the representation of SIFE, his/her status as an independent contractor requires that his/her hours of work, the percentage of time devoted to SIFE representation, and generally all details pertaining to Sales Representative\u2019s actual service be determined by Sales Representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Tufo\u2019s right to engage in other employment is also addressed in paragraph 8.1 of the agreement, which provided that, as an independent contractor, a sales representative \u201cmay engage in whatever other activities, including other employment\u201d as he or she may desire. \u201cAccordingly, Sales Representative may enter into other business activities or employments, such as tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>return preparation, accounting, the sales of personal or real property, mortgage brokering, insurance, business consulting, pension administration, legal services, etc. SIFE\u2019s only requirement is that Sales Representative keep all such other activities strictly separate from SIFE activities, that funds collected for SIFE never be commingled with funds from other activities, and that Sales Representative keep SIFE fully informed as to the nature of all such other employment or activities. The only limitation on this freedom of activity is that Sales Representative agrees not to undertake employment with any organization or business which is competitive with that of SIFE. Activities deemed competitive include, but are not limited to, investment advisory service, stock brokerage, mutual fund sales, and financial planning activity. Any exception to this broad prohibition against representation of competing business requires the prior specific consent in writing from SIFE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In support of its opposition to the motion for summary judgment, appellants provided the transcript of an NASD arbitration proceeding <em>(Lopez </em>v. <em>SIFE) </em>regarding a dispute between SIFE and other investors also involving sales made by Tufo. In his testimony at that proceeding, Bruce Woods, the chief executive officer of SIFE, agreed that, despite language in the sales representative agreement describing Tufo as an independent contractor, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as an independent contractor for purposes of the NASD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">At the time he sold Medco promissory notes to appellants, Tufo believed the investment was sound; indeed he and his wife invested in Medco as did his secretary. Tufo did not think he needed SIFE approval to advertise and sell these investments because he felt Medco\u2019s promissory notes, which he was informed were secured by real property, were not \u201csecurities.\u201d Nevertheless, because he felt obliged to inform SIFE of all his business activities, he told SIFE, \u201cin writing, that I was marketing the Medco product, and several of the managers there knew what I was doing because I told them. I tell everybody everything . . . [a]nd I gave them written notice.\u201d Tufo produced a photocopy of a letter he sent SIFE by facsimile on October 22, 1996 (a month before he sold appellants their initial investments in Medco), which stated, \u201cI am marketing a private mortgage, MEDCO. They are a Florida based corporation. They are an asset-based lender/lessor and operator of sophisticated medical equipment for doctors, clinics, and hospitals. MEDCO offers a low risk/high return stable income program for its investors. . . . [\u00b6] There is no pooling or fractionalization. Each investor receives an individual chattel mortgage, pledge of personal property, promissorymote and UCC-1 filing. There is no sales charge or fee, front or back end. There is 30 day liquidity with a simple written notice for any reason whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Tufo also produced two forms SIFE provided its registered representatives (an \u201cannual certification\u201d form and a \u201ccompliance meeting agenda for registered representatives\u201d) calling for disclosure of \u201coutside activities,\u201d which he filled out on November 22, 1996, about a month after the letter he assertedly faxed SIFE. On both forms Tufo noted in writing that he offered his clients \u201cpromissory note programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">SIFE made no inquiry about Tufo\u2019s sale of Medco investments until after the Department of Corporations issued its desist-and-refrain order concerning Medco. Woods acknowledged that he received the documents dated November 22, 1996, but he testified that no one at SIFE ever received the October, 1996 letter, and opined it was \u201cbogus.\u201d He stated that if the letter had been received the Medco investment Tufo was offering would have been seen as competitive and Woods \u201cwould have asked Mr. Tufo to either give up that product or give up his licensure with SIFE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Tufo vigorously denied the charge that the letter was a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to shift blame to SIFE. He claimed that prior to June 1997 officers and employees of SIFE were fully aware of his activities in behalf of Medco, which he openly carried out in Walnut Creek, where SIFE was also located, and often asked him, \u201c[h]ow is Medco going?\u201d Tufo also gave tapes of his radio advertisements for Medco to Melinda Adams, an employee in SIFE\u2019s compliance office, and she helped him rewrite the copy. Woods, compliance officer John King and other SIFE officers acknowledged Tufo had always been forthcoming with information, that he stated on SIFE disclosure forms dated November 22, 1996, that he was offering \u201cpromissory note programs\u201d to his clients, and that Tufo frequently advertised his sales of Medco notes on the radio and in the Contra Costa Times, and that SIFE should therefore have been aware of the \u201cdanger\u201d to its interests and more promptly investigated the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Woods testified at deposition that until the middle of 1997 Robert Linde-mann was SIFE\u2019s compliance officer. In July of 1997, about a month after the Department of Corporations issued its desist-and-refrain order regarding Medco, Woods terminated Lindemann, because \u201c[h]e never took on the responsibility of compliance for the registered representatives.\u201d Woods testified that during the period Lindemann failed to supervise the registered representatives, and until July 1997 when his assistant, John King, became compliance officer, Woods alone monitored registered representatives\u2019 compliance. John King was chiefly responsible for promulgating SIFE\u2019s compliance manual and convening periodic compliance meetings with registered representatives. Woods acknowledged that, prior to the desist-and-refrain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>letter from the Department of Corporations, neither he nor King nor any other representative of SIFE ever inquired about Tufo\u2019s sale of investments in Medco or visited Tufo at his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Although SIFE\u2019s compliance manual reiterated an NASD rule that a registered representative shall not engage in \u201cany business activity\u201d outside the scope of his relationship with an NASD member such as SIFE \u201c \u2018unless he has provided prompt written notice in order to clear approval by the member on a form as may be required,\u2019 \u201d Woods did not believe NASD or SIFE required a registered representative who provided notice of an outside business activity to obtain approval in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Woods justified his failure (and inferentially that of other SIFE compliance officers) to educate himself about Tufo\u2019s sales of Medco notes on the ground that under paragraph 8.1 of the sales representative agreement, \u201cMr. Tufo was clearly restricted to the sales of SIFE only and so the compliance with the distribution of SIFE was where I focused my attention since Joe was not authorized in any way to offer any other products.\u201d Woods acknowledged he initialed forms dated November 20, 1996, in which Tufo stated in writing that he offered his clients \u201ctwo promissory note programs.\u201d When asked whether this disclosure \u201craise[d] any concerns that Joe Tufo may be involved in things he should not be involved with?\u201d Woods responded: \u201cIf in 1996 anything that Mr. Tufo had given me raised concerns, we would have opened an investigation immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In November 1996, the Department of Corporations issued a desist-and-refrain order prohibiting Simmons Financial, Inc. (Simmons), \u201cand all persons acting in concert or participation with you,\u201d from offering for sale any promissory note or other securities of that company on the ground that such securities were unqualified for sale in California. A Simmons advertisement described the company as \u201ca San Francisco Asset-Based Lending Firm licensed under the State of California\u2019s Finance and Lender\u2019s Law, and is bonded with a Surety Bond from a top-rated insurance company. In the last seven years, SFI has been privately raising funds by offering a one-year term account with a guaranteed 15% interest compounded quarterly.\u201d Simmons\u2019s advertisement named Tufo as an individual who could provide additional information and provided his address and phone number. Because of his involvement with Simmons, the Department of Corporations sent Tufo a copy of the desist-and-refrain order. Appellants contend SIFE either knew or should have known of this activity of its registered representative, which was a \u201cred flag\u201d indicating a need to closely supervise his activities. The record does not show SIFE was aware Tufo had been selling investments in Simmons until after the desist-and-refrain order relating to Medco.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>In a declaration submitted in support of SIFE\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Woods reiterated that \u201cSIFE has no connection whatsoever to MEDCO,\u201d and stated that \u201cTufo\u2019s agency with SIFE is limited to selling shares in the SIFE Trust Fund,\u201d and that \u201c[n] either I nor any other SIFE officer or employee has ever expressly authorized Tufo to take any actions on SIFE\u2019s behalf, except as set forth in the Sales Representative Agreement . . . [and] did not authorize Tufo to sell investments in MEDCO,\u201d which was therefore \u201coutside the scope of his agency with SIFE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">A trial court may grant summary judgment in a case if no triable issue exists as to a material fact, and if the papers submitted on the motion entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) As was the case here, summary judgment proceedings may also raise questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\u201c \u2018Where as in the case at bar, a <em>defendant </em>seeks summary judgment, his declaration and affidavits must either establish a complete defense to plaintiff\u2019s action or demonstrate an absence of an essential element of plaintiff\u2019s case. If defendant establishes the foregoing, and the plaintiff\u2019s declaration in reply does not show that there is a triable issue of fact with respect to that defense or that an essential element exists, the summary judgment should be granted. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stratton v. First Nat. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1083 [258 Cal.Rptr. 721], quoting <em>Dolquist v. City of Bellflower </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 261, 266 [241 Cal.Rptr. 706], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">A trial court ruling on a summary judgment motion is, of course, subject to de novo review by this court. <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 60 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766]; <em>Edward Fineman Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1116 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 478].) Like the trial court, we must strictly construe the moving papers and liberally construe the materials offered in opposition. The evidence in support of and in opposition to the motion must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered; due to the drastic nature of the procedure, all doubts about the propriety of granting the motion must be resolved in favor of its denial. <em>(Stationers Corp. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>785]; <em>Heredia </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins.

Co., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 1083.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Appellants now advance three arguments. The first appears to be that the duty of a broker-dealer to supervise its registered representatives under federal securities law supports imposition of a like duty of care under California common law. The second is that Tufo\u2019s sales of Medco investments were within the scope of his employment with SIFE, and SIFE could therefore be liable on a theory of respondeat superior even if it did not authorize him to make the misrepresentations upon which appellants relied, as such misrepresentations are a foreseeable risk of doing business as a broker-dealer of securities. Finally, appellants claim the trial court erroneously excluded evidence that SIFE\u2019s failure to supervise Tufo was below the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">A <em>Duty of Care Does Not Arise Under Federal Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Appellants\u2019 argument in the trial court that SIFE violated the duty of a broker-dealer to supervise the work of its registered representatives was predicated primarily on California common law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court rejected this argument, predicating its analysis with the following formulation of the issue: \u201cThe issue of whether or not a cause of action can be stated for negligent supervision rests upon the special question of whether the duty of supervision for a registered securities broker-dealer extends to all of the activities of that representative or only to those securities which the broker-dealer entrusts the representative to sell. In other words, if the representative has neither actual nor ostensible authority to sell other securities on behalf of the broker-dealer, may the latter nonetheless have a duty to supervise him or her in the event that he or she chooses, with the broker-dealer\u2019s blessing, to sell other securities. Plaintiffs have established that Tufo was so registered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>and that SIFE did not supervise him as to activities other than the selling of SIFE securities. The motion will therefore be determined based upon the legal conclusion as to whether such a duty of supervision does or does not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The trial court then stated that, as neither party contended that there is a common law duty to supervise an independent contractor, \u201c[t]he question, then, is whether the special relationship of a registered agent for the sale of securities and the broker-dealer under whose registration the agent is registered, creates such a duty as to activities of the salesperson which relates to securities transactions in which the broker-dealer has no interest.\u201d After observing that it was unable to locate any California appellate authority addressing this issue, the court considered appellants\u2019 arguments that the duty in question arose under subdivision (g) of section 25212 of the California Corporations Code and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Corporations. Section 25212, subdivision (g) provides in pertinent part that a broker-dealer may be disciplined if, among other things, it \u201chas failed reasonably to supervise . . . another person who commits a violation [of statutes, rules or regulations], if the other person is subject to his or her supervision . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that this statute only applies in situations in which there is a preexisting responsibility to supervise, and therefore does not create such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Appellants also claimed that a duty to supervise was created by a regulation implementing section 25218 of the Corporations Code. Section 25218 states in material part that \u201c[n]o broker-dealer . . . shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state in contravention of such rules as the commissioner [of corporations] may prescribe designed ... to protect investors and the public interest . . . .\u201d The implementing regulation appellants relied upon simply states that \u201c[e]very broker-dealer shall exercise diligent supervision over the securities activities of all of its agents.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 260.218.4, subd. (a).) The trial court rejected the argument that the regulation created a duty to supervise, relying on <em>California Service Station etc. Assn. v. American Home Assurance Co. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1166 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 182], which held that \u201can administrative agency cannot independently impose a duty of care if that authority has not been properly delegated to the agency by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1175.) The court agreed that the Legislature has the power to require broker-dealers to supervise their registered agents, and may delegate to the commissioner of corporations the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>responsibility to define the scope of that duty, but concluded that at this time the Legislature has not made such a delegation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellants do not in this court renew the contentions that the duty of a broker-dealer to supervise its registered representatives arises under a California statute or regulation, which we believe the trial court properly rejected.  Appellants\u2019 chief contention now is that because the sale of securities and the activities of broker-dealers are activities regulated primarily by federal law, \u201cthe federal standards govern, preempting any conflicting state law.\u201d According to appellants, \u201c[f]ederal law indicates that a Broker-Dealer such as SIFE has a duty to supervise <em>all </em>of its representatives\u2019 securities transactions.\u201d This is a curious argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">For one thing appellants do not suggest there is in fact any conflict between applicable state and federal law; furthermore appellants never pleaded a federal cause of action. We understand appellants to be arguing that federal securities law\u2014in particular, section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t)\u2014may be adopted as a standard of care in a state negligence action either where, as here, the broker-dealer has adopted the federal securities law requirements as its own personal standard, or under the doctrine of negligence per se.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>Satterlee v. Orange Glenn School Dist. </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 581, 588 [177 P.2d 279] [\u201cif the evidence establishes that the plaintiff\u2019s or defendant\u2019s violation of the statute or ordinance proximately caused the injury and no excuse or justification for violation is shown by the evidence, responsibility may be fixed upon the violator without other proof of failure to exercise due care\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Like the trial court, we do not believe SIFE subjected itself to the requirements of federal (or state) securities laws with respect to its responsibility to supervise the outside activities of its registered representatives. Appellants appear to be basing their claim on the theory that the sales representative agreement allows SIFE\u2019s registered representatives to sell outside (i.e., non-SIFE) investments if it provides notice of such proposed sales and SIFE does not object in writing. Appellants suggest the allowance of outside sales and the notice requirement shows that SIFE \u201cembraced all federal and state securities laws [and NASD rules] as its own personal standard,\u201d and that for this reason appellants have a \u201cright to use the NASD rules and other federal law to support their tort claims against SIFE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Not surprisingly, SIFE characterizes the provision very differently, seeing it not as a grant of but a limitation on the authority of registered representatives. According to SIFE, the purpose of the provision is not to incorporate federal and state securities laws or NASD rules into the agreement but simply to prevent registered representatives from selling competing investments. The trial court agreed with SIFE, stating that \u201c[p]laintiff misconstrues the contract provision, which is a \u2018competition\u2019 agreement not an \u2018agency authority\u2019 provision. By barring its sales representatives from competing with SIFE absent the company agreeing that they may do so, the company is not agreeing that they may do so, the company is not agreeing that where it allows such competition the representative becomes its agent in all of such activity. Such an interpretation would be irrational in light of the clear language of the agreement to the contrary.\u201d We agree with the trial court. Neither the sales agreement nor anything else in the record suggests SIFE desired or felt obliged to adopt the supervisory requirements of federal or state securities laws, or the rules of the NASD, with respect to the sales by its representatives of competing investment products.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We are mindful that there is authority for the proposition that a violation of a federal statute may, in certain circumstances, be adopted as a standard of care (see, e.g., <em>Sierra-Bay Fed. Land Bank Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 318, 332 [277 Cal.Rptr. 753]; <em>Toole </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 689, 703-704 [60 Cal.Rptr. 398, 29 A.L.R.3d 988]); but adopting a standard of care is significantly different from imposing a common law duty that would not otherwise exist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any case, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>enough for us to conclude, as we do, that the facts of this case do not establish a violation of federal securities law. <em>Hollinger </em>v. <em>Titan Capital Corp., supra, </em>914 F.2d 1564, and <em>Hauser </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 14 F.3d 1338, the federal cases appellants primarily rely upon, impose no responsibility on a broker-dealer to supervise sales to persons with whom it has no relationship of securities in which it has no economic interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Hollinger </em>v. <em>Titan Capital Corp., supra, </em>914 F.2d 1564, was a securities fraud action by investors against a broker-dealer and a financial counseling firm, seeking to recover for a registered representative\u2019s embezzlement of money entrusted to him. The trial court granted summary judgment for both defendants. The issue in <em>Hollinger </em>germane to the case before us was whether Titan, the defendant broker-dealer, could be held vicariously liable as a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which with certain exceptions extends vicarious liability of brokerage firms beyond common law respondeat superior liability: \u201cEvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a).) The district court felt Titan was not a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d within the meaning of the statute unless it exercised \u201cactual power or influence\u201d over the fraudulent dealings of Wilkowski, the registered representative, and was a \u201cculpable participant\u201d in his fraudulent dealings. It concluded Titan had no \u201cpower or influence\u201d over Wilkowski because he was an independent contractor, Titan exercised no control over his defalcation of funds, did not benefit from that defalcation, and did not authorize Wilkowski to receive personal checks. The district court also determined that because Titan and Wilkowski had agreed that the latter would be an independent contractor, \u201cTitan had no duty to supervise unauthorized and unknown transactions and therefore could not have been a \u2018culpable participant\u2019 in Wilkowski\u2019s misdeeds.\u201d (914 F.2d at pp. 1572-1573.) The district court \u201cmade the question of whether Titan controlled Wilkowski turn on the particular business arrangement of the parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Ninth Circuit rejected the district court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion, holding that \u201ca broker-dealer is a controlling person under \u00a7 20(a) with respect to its registered representatives.\u201d <em>(Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>supra, </em>914 F.2d at p. 1573.) The court emphasized that that statute was designed to protect the investing public from representatives who were inadequately supervised or controlled. Purchasers of securities often rely heavily for investment advice on the broker\u2019s representative, and because representatives are usually compensated by commissions that are proportional to sales there is an \u201cever present\u201d temptation to take advantage of the client. To ensure diligent supervision and control, Congress held broker-dealers vicariously liable for injury to investors caused by violations of the statute or rules promulgated thereunder. \u201cThe very nature of the securities business, as it has developed in this country, militates for such a rule as public policy and would seem to suggest strict court enforcement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because the securities laws impose on broker-dealers a duty to supervise their registered representatives, and the representatives need the dealers to gain access to the securities markets, the <em>Hollinger </em>court held that, as a matter of law, a broker-dealer is a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to its registered representatives. Significantly, the court refused to make any distinction between employees or other agents of a broker-dealer and independent contractors, stating that \u201c[t]o exclude from the definition of controlling person those registered representatives who might technically be called independent contractors would be an unduly restrictive reading of the statute and would tend to frustrate Congress\u2019 goal of protecting investors. Thus, we reject the argument that broker-dealers can avoid a duty to supervise simply by entering into a contract that purports to make the representative, who is not himself registered under the Act as a broker-dealer, an \u2018independent contractor.\u2019 \u201d (914 F.2d at p. 1574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">However, the <em>Hollinger </em>court also explained that a broker-dealer is not necessarily liable \u201cfor all actions taken by its registered representatives,\u201d and is not an insurer for its representatives. <em>(Hollinger </em>v. <em>Titan Capital Corp., supra, </em>914 F.2d at p. 1574.) Section 20(a) provides that a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d is liable, \u201cunless [he] acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a).) The burden to establish good faith rests with the broker-dealer once it is shown to be a controlling person, and it cannot satisfy this burden \u201cmerely by saying that it has supervisory procedures in place, and therefore, it has fulfilled its duty to supervise. A broker-dealer can establish the good faith defense only by proving that it \u2018maintained and enforced a reasonable and proper system of supervision and internal control.\u2019 \u201d (914 F.2d at p. 1576, quoting <em>Zweig v. Hearst Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(9th Cir. 1975) 521 F.2d 1129, 1134-1135, cert, den., 423 U.S. 1025 [96 S.Ct. 469, 46 L.Ed.2d 399].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the <em>Hollinger </em>court concluded that the district court erred in ruling Titan had satisfied its duty to discharge because it had adopted rules for accepting investment payments and for supervising a contractor\u2019s compliance with securities laws and regulations. <em>(Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., supra, </em>914 F.2d at p. 1576.) \u201cShould Titan choose to rely upon the good faith defense, then it must carry its burden of persuasion that its supervisory system was adequate and that it reasonably discharged its responsibilities under the system.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The Ninth Circuit refined its reasoning in <em>Hollinger </em>in <em>Hauser v. Farrell, supra, </em>14 F.3d 1338, which considered what conduct by a representative is \u201coutside of the broker-dealer\u2019s statutory control.\u201d In that case the plaintiffs, Hauser and Acosta, invested in a partnership, intended to be incorporated, called \u201cNew Technologies in Energy\u201d (NTE), with two stockbrokers, Harvey and Farrell, employed at Rauscher/Pierce, a securities brokerage firm. When the venture failed the plaintiffs sued the stockbrokers and the firm. The complaint alleged that Harvey and Farrell had violated rule 10b-5 of the SEC (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.106) by misrepresenting certain facts about the investment in NTE. Rauscher/Pierce was alleged to be liable as an aider and abettor of the rule 10b-5 violation, as a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under section 20(a) (15 U.S.C. 78t), and under the theory of respondeat superior. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>granted the brokerage firm\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of these claims and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court that the transaction at issue was an \u201coutside\u201d transaction for purposes of controlling person liability. First, it was not the type of securities transaction that could only be performed through Harvey\u2019s and Farrell\u2019s association with a broker-dealer; second, the investment in NTE was unrelated to any of the securities offered by the broker-dealer through its registered agents; third, Harvey and Farrell were not acting in their capacity as registered agents of Rauscher/Pierce when they approached the plaintiffs with their investment in NTE. <em>(Hollinger </em>v. <em>Farrell, supra, </em>14 F.3d at p. 1341.) The court also noted that \u201cRauscher/Pierce has never had an interest in the venture. There has been no evidence offered to suggest that Rauscher/Pierce even had any meaningful knowledge of the scheme or that it was the type of transaction that Rauscher/ Pierce dealt with or had an interest in at all as a brokerage house. In fact it was not. Rather the NTE \u2018deal\u2019 was a separate arrangement entered into by the co-defendants as private individuals, not as \u2018registered agents\u2019 of Rauscher/Pierce. As such, that scheme and any related transactions fell outside the scope of that activity that Rauscher/Pierce, as a broker, is statutorily required to supervise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1341-1342.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Almost all the foregoing considerations are present in this case. Tufo was not acting in his capacity as a registered representative for SIFE when he sold appellants investments in Medco, which are unrelated to the mutual fund SIFE markets through its registered representatives. SIFE has no economic or other interest in Medco, and investments in Medco compete with those SIFE offers the public. Tufo\u2019s authority to market investments in Medco did not derive from SIFE.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, unlike the registered representatives in <em>Hauser, </em>Tufo never met with investors in the broker-dealer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>office, and for that reason (and others) it cannot be argued that he exploited his relationship with the broker-dealer more than they did. While there may be a triable issue as to whether the letter Tufo claimed he sent SIFE on October 22, 1996, provided \u201cmeaningful information\u201d about Medco, that information would not in and of itself trigger a duty under federal securities laws, because the letter did not suggest SIFE had an interest in the investment (other than the fact that it competed with SIFE\u2019s investment, which is not an interest protected under federal securities laws). In short, as we see it, SIFE would not be held vicariously liable under section 20(a) (15 U.S.C. 78t).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Since a violation of federal securities law has not been established, the doctrine of negligence per se does not come into play in this case, even indulging the dubious theory that the violation of a federal statute or regulation can be employed under the doctrine not simply to define the standard of care but to impose a duty that would not otherwise exist under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>Tufo Was Not an Employee of SIFE and the Doctrine of Respondeat Superior Is Inapplicable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Appellant\u2019s attempt to impose vicarious liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior consists of an amalgamation of reasons Tufo should be considered an employee of SIFE despite contrary provisions of the sales representative agreement, the main reason being that Tufo had actual authority to sell non-SIFE investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The trial court concluded that \u201c[t]here is no triable issue of fact as to whether Tufo had actual authority to act on behalf of SIFE in dealing with Plaintiffs with reference to MEDCO promissory notes. The Sales Representative Agreement between Tufo and SIFE expressly limits Tufo\u2019s authority to the selling of SIFE investments. Plaintiffs present no evidence that establish[es] any other actual grant of authority.\u201d Appellants challenge the determination that Tufo had no actual authority to sell Medco investments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>behalf of SIFE,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> claiming that the evidence shows \u201cSIFE not only authorized Tufo to sell products other than the SIFE investment recited in the [sales representative agreement], but encouraged him to do so,\u201d and that it is therefore \u201cquestionable . . . whether the Sales Representative Agreement has any effect at all.\u201d The evidence appellants seize upon does not support the claim \u201cthat Tufo had SIFE\u2019s tacit approval to market MEDCO to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">At one point during his lengthy deposition, Bruce Woods stated that between November and early December of 1996, SIFE prepared for sale a so-called \u201cwrap product\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> known as the \u201cSIFE Seven Seas Global Advisors Money Market Fund.\u201d Tufo, during the course of his deposition, recalled being authorized to sell this new money market fund, though the verbal authorization was never put in writing. This evidence does not contradict the trial court\u2019s manifestly correct finding that the sales representative agreement limited Tufo\u2019s authority \u201cto the selling of SIFE investments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Appellants also attempt to buttress the argument that the sales representative agreement did not truly define the relationship between SIFE and Tufo by claiming that such an agreement cannot operate to relieve a broker-dealer of the supervisory requirements imposed by federal securities laws and regulations, as well as NASD rules, because those requirements apply not just to employees but as well to independent contractors. This argument is, of course, simply a different way of advancing the argument that a common law duty of care should be predicated on the federal statutory standard of care, which we have already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellants\u2019 related claim, that \u201cTufo\u2019s tortious sale of MEDCO [was] committed within the scope of his employment as a Registered Representative of SIFE,\u201d is no more than a reformulation of the claim that Tufo had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>actual authority to sell Medco investments. Appellants say the trial court was wrong in concluding there was no evidence of such authority, because \u201c[t]he only avenue through which Tufo could sell MEDCO was through SIFE. SIFE, as Tufo\u2019s Broker-Dealer, has the responsibility to oversee Tufo\u2019s sale of securities. Where the employer places the employee in the position of being able to perpetrate the fraud, vicarious liability will be found. . . . [Additionally,] SIFE should have foreseen the risk that its Registered Representative, Tufo, would sell unqualified, unstable securities, and, if not properly supervised, would misrepresent their value as an investment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The sole authority appellants produce in support of this argument is <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sulimen </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1434 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 790], The case does not support the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>was an action against a licensed real estate broker by a mortgage loan broker that processed a fraudulent loan submitted by a licensed real estate agent employed by the defendants. The court of appeal reversed a grant of summary judgment for the defendants, finding that not only was there evidence of agency, but that a finding of agency was ' not even required in light of the evidence that the agent was employed by the defendants at the time the loan application was submitted on one defendant\u2019s loan application form. <em>(Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sulimen, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1440.) Also, an employee of the plaintiff testified that Baskaron, the agent, affirmatively represented to her that he was a loan representative and real estate agent for the defendants and, based on such representations, she processed the loan. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1442.) Because Baskaron led the plaintiff loan broker\u2019s employee \u201cto believe that when he submitted the Brown loan to Inter Mountain Mortgage, he was performing his job duties as an American Frontier loan representative ... a nexus existed between Baskaron\u2019s alleged tort, the fraudulent loan transaction, and his employment as a loan representative. The risk of one of defendants\u2019 loan representatives submitting a fraudulent loan application, such as the Brown loan application, was a generally foreseeable risk inherent and incidental to defendants\u2019 mortgage loan brokerage business. Baskaron\u2019s employment as a loan representative placed him in the position of being able to submit fraudulent loan applications. Such an occurrence was ' \u201cnot so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among the other costs of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Lisa M. </em>v. <em>Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 299 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 510, 907 P.2d 358].) The Court of Appeal stated that even though there may have been conflicting evidence that Baskaron did not commit fraud, was not employed by the defendants at the time of the loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>transaction, and was not at that time acting within the scope of his employment during the transaction, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to the contrary, raising triable issues as to whether defendants are vicariously liable for Baskaron\u2019s alleged fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>(Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. v. Sulimen, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The evidence that Tufo was acting within the scope of his employment does not approach that presented in <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>First of all, there was not in <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc., </em>as there is here, an employment agreement describing the putative employee as an independent contractor, and explicitly limiting the scope of the agent\u2019s authority. Furthermore, the agent in <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>affirmatively represented to the plaintiff that he had authority to act in behalf of the defendant, California Department of Real Estate public records showed he was employed by that defendant at the time of the transaction, and Baskaron produced documents, including an appraisal of the property in question, prepared by or for the defendants. <em>(Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sulimen, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438.) There is no such evidence here. On the contrary, Tufo stated that he never told appellants or others that SIFE sponsored or promoted Medco investments. The only similarity between this case and <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc. </em>is that, like Baskaron, Tufo was an agent of the defendant principal. However, the absence of any evidence of actual or ostensible authority beyond that specified in the sales representative agreement dispositively distinguishes this case from <em>Inter Mountain Mortg., Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">As the trial court stated, \u201c[p]laintiffs set forth, in their 74 statements of disputed facts, only 2 facts that in any manner relate to acts of SIFE which could be contended to \u2018cause or allow a third person to believe\u2019 the existence of an agency relationship. In item \u20188\u2019 they allege that Tufo used a business card that identified him as a \u2018registered agent\u2019 of SIFE (although there is no evidence presented that SIFE either prepared, had prepared or knew of that card) and in items \u201812\u2019 and \u201826\u2019 they allege that he had an undescribed \u2018plaque\u2019 on the wall of his office from SIFE. Without more, these two items are insufficient to cause or allow a reasonable person to expect that Tufo, working out of his own Farmers Insurance sales office, has been granted an all encompassing agency covering whatever products Tufo may cho[o]se to sell.\u201d This determination, which is supported by the law (see, e.g., <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Hannaford &amp; Talbot </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 182, 184 [45 Cal.Rptr. 785]) and by the record, was correct. This case is not one in which the broker represented to the plaintiff that its agent had authority to manage his account (see, e.g., <em>Kahn v. Gordon </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 722 [57 Cal.Rptr. 725]), or the defendant broker knew of or benefited in some way from the fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>transaction (see, e.g., <em>Blackburn v. Dean Witter </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 518 [19 Cal.Rptr. 842], <em>Walsh v. Hooker &amp; Fay </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 450 [28 Cal.Rptr. 16]), or the principal knew of the fraudulent transaction as it was taking place and did not disavow the agent\u2019s authority to act on its behalf. <em>(Reusche </em>v. <em>California Pacific Title Ins. Co. </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 731, 737 [42 Cal.Rptr. 262].) Here, the limitations set forth in the sales representatives agreement, coupled with the absence of substantial evidence of apparent or actual authority beyond that specified in the agreement, eliminates any basis upon which to impose vicarious liability on SIFE under the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Did Not Erroneously Exclude Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellants submitted to the court the declaration of Marvin G. Breen, their \u201cdesignated expert witness\u201d on securities regulation. Mr. Breen had been involved in the securities industry for 44 years, and was, among other things, chairman of the ethics and business conduct committee of the Pacific Stock Exchange, and was familiar with the \u201cstatutes, rules, regulations, standards and practices which are at issue in this matter.\u201d His declaration includes a description of NASD rule 3010(a), which relates to the supervision of registered representatives by broker-dealers, and an explanation of his \u201cprofessional opinion\u201d that \u201cSIFE breached its duty to supervise Tufo with respect to his selling of Medco promissory notes.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">SIFE objected to the receipt in evidence of Breen\u2019s declaration on the ground that the issue before the court on the motion for summary judgment was simply the question of duty, and that this is a legal not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>factual question, and experts may not give opinions on matters essentially within the province of the courts to decide. The trial court sustained this objection, stating that \u201cMr. Breen offers an opinion as to SIFE\u2019s duties, but the existence of a duty is a question of law for the court to determine by reference to the facts.\u201d The trial court\u2019s ruling was unquestionably correct. It is well established that \u201cthe question of the existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty is a legal question which depends on the nature of the . . . activity in question and on the parties\u2019 general relationship to the activity, and is an issue to be decided by the court, rather than the jury.\u201d <em>(Knight v. Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 313 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696], citing also 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 748, pp. 83-86, and cases there cited.) It is equally well established \u201c \u2018that experts may not give opinions on matters which are essentially within the province of the court to decide.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sheldon Appel Co. </em>v. <em>Albert &amp; Oliker </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 863, 884 [254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498], quoting <em>Carter v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 524, 525 [154 P.2d 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Appellants claim the trial court erred and that Breen\u2019s declaration was properly admissible \u201cto aid the court in deciding whether SIFE breached the standard of care applicable to securities dealers.\u201d The sole case they rely upon, <em>Jambazian v. Borden </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 768], does not support their argument. <em>Jambazian </em>was a medical malpractice action for injuries sustained as a result of surgery and for failure to inform the plaintiff of the consequences of the procedure. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant doctor, indicating it relied on the declarations filed by the defendant and two other physicians, and because the plaintiff had failed to present a counterdeclaration from an expert. The court of appeal affirmed, and in the course of its opinion quoted the following statement of the Supreme Court: \u201c \u2018[T]here may be a limited number of occasions in the trial of informed consent claims where the adequacy of disclosure in a given case may turn on the standard of practice within the relevant medical community. In such instances, expert testimony will usually be appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 847, quoting <em>Arato </em>v. <em>Avedon </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1172, 1190 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 131, 858 P.2d 598].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">This observation has no bearing on the issue before us. The question in <em>Jambazian </em>was not, as it is in this case, the existence of a duty\u2014as physicians unquestionably have the duty to obtain informed consent from their patients\u2014but simply whether the disclosure provided the defendant to the plaintiff was adequate to satisfy that duty, that is to say, whether the disclosure met the appropriate standard of care, which is a factual not a legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment entered on the grant of summary judgment for SIFE is affirmed.

Blacher, \u201cmade material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with their sales of at least $16 million in promissory notes to the investing public. The notes promised investors returns of between 12% and 16% annually, depending upon the amount of the investment and the maturity of the note. The [SEC] complaint further alleges that Medco represented to investors that the notes were collateralized by used medical equipment which Medco purchased and then leased out to end-users such as doctors and clinics. According to the SEC\u2019s allegations, Medco is leasing only a fraction of the medical equipment it has claimed to be leasing. In fact, the SEC contends that one lessee, which purportedly was leasing medical equipment securing $1.6 million of investor funds, was a fictitious entity created by Blacher that had no leases, office space or real business. The SEC also contends that Medco significantly over-valued the medical equipment purportedly collateralizing investor funds. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that Blacher lied about his professional background and that of Medco[]. The SEC also alleges that Medco wired at least $250,000 of investor funds to an off-shore bank account in Luxembourg.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Appellant Marguerite Summers is the mother and sole heir of Robert Summers and is participating in this action as her son\u2019s successor in interest.

Only if both respondeat superior and \u00a7 20(a) are available is the statutory scheme comprehensive and the public protected by the federal securities laws. \u2018To allow a brokerage firm to avoid secondary liability simply by showing ignorance, purposeful or negligent, of the acts of its registered representative contravenes Congress\u2019 intent to protect the public, particularly unsophisticated investors, from fraudulent practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hollinger </em>v. <em>Titan Capital Corp., supra, </em>914 F.2d at p. 1577, quoting <em>Paul F.

Dissenting from the majority opinion in <em>Hollinger, </em>Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall \u201cwould hold that section 20(a) of the Act, which already imposes vicarious liability upon all employers for the fraudulent acts of their employees, precludes the grafting of the common law doctrine of respondeat superior onto a federal securities law action. The inclusion in the securities laws of statutory provisions which expressly impose controlling person liability indicates that Congress intended to exclude other forms of vicarious liability. If we impose secondary liability under respondeat superior on Titan for Wilkowski\u2019s rule 10b-5 fraud, we effectively nullify the exculpatory provision of section 20(a) as well as the scienter element of a 10(b) claim.\u201d (Hollinger, at p. 1579 (dis. opn. of Hall, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">After <em>Hauser </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court held, in <em>Central Bank of Denver N.A. v.
