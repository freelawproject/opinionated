J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYb\">This is an appeal by Tracor Flight Systems, Inc., the defendant below, after judgment was entered against it in an action for wrongful termination of employment. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed in the trial court, resolving in that party\u2019s favor all issues of credibility and all inferences from the evidence presented. <em>(Jessup Farms </em>v. <em>Baldwin </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 639, 660 [190 Cal.Rptr. 355, 660 P.2d 813].)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">In 1992, plaintiff and respondent Rosie M. Thompson was the director of human resources for the Mojave facility of defendant and appellant Tracor Flight Systems, Inc. As such, respondent was responsible for implementing personnel decisions at the facility. She hired new employees when requested by other members of management, terminated and disciplined employees when directed to do so, and maintained personnel records of employees. In addition, she was the person primarily responsible for the Mojave facility\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>compliance with appellant\u2019s equal opportunity requirements as an employer and as a contractor with the federal government. In 1992, respondent acted as appellant\u2019s primary contact for an employment practices audit of the Mojave facility conducted by the United States Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Appellant was a subsidiary of Tracor, Inc. Appellant\u2019s corporate headquarters was in Austin, Texas, as were corporate offices of the parent company. At various times relevant to the present case, respondent reported directly to either the general manager of the Mojave facility or a corporate official in Austin. In addition, respondent at all times had the authority to consult with the human resources staff of the parent company. At various relevant times, the parent company was reorganizing or trying to develop uniform human resources standards and practices throughout the extended organization; as a result, respondent at times worked more closely with the Austin human resources staff than otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In May or June of 1994, Donald Sullivan became general manager of the Mojave facility. During his tenure as general manager in Mojave, Sullivan \u201cyelled and screamed\u201d at respondent and other employees. Sullivan, by all accounts, had a blunt, no-nonsense management style, particularly when he was trying to overcome impediments to the accomplishment of his program goals for the company. He was known to have grabbed a male manager by the shirt in an effort to remove him from a staff meeting. Respondent acknowledged that from the beginning she did not like Sullivan\u2019s management style. For his part, Sullivan had complained even before he became general manager that respondent was \u201cstirring the pot\u201d by reporting unnecessary information to Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">After Sullivan became general manager, there were several instances in which respondent thought Sullivan\u2019s actions presented a potential for employment-related suits against the company. Respondent testified specifically about five such instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">First, around the beginning of July 1994, an employee\u2014respondent\u2019s sister\u2014was scheduled to take maternity leave. The sister worked in the quality assurance department. Her local supervisor followed a chain of command leading to a quality assurance director in Austin, not to Sullivan. Respondent received a personnel request for a temporary employee to replace her sister during the maternity leave. Respondent telephoned the quality assurance director in Austin to report that the local supervisor (a salaried employee) had a television set on her desk and was not doing the work she was supposed to perform. As a result, according to respondent, her sister (an hourly employee) performed extra work, consistently taking home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>this work for completion at night and for which she was not being compensated. Respondent was concerned this was a wage-and-hour law violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The second instance, toward the end of July 1994, involved a related aspect of the matter involving respondent\u2019s sister. At a meeting with respondent, her sister, and the sister\u2019s supervisor, Sullivan informed the sister he might terminate her position when she returned because, upon reviewing her time cards, it seemed she was spending less time on certain tasks than would have been necessary to constitute a full-time position. The sister tried to explain that she did much of this work at home, but Sullivan reiterated that he could not assure her of a job when she returned from leave. Respondent recalled a similar layoff after a maternity leave under a previous general manager. She was concerned the current action involved prohibited retaliation for taking maternity leave. She contacted corporate staff in Austin and followed up with a memorandum to Austin. At the time of trial, respondent\u2019s sister was still employed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Third, in mid-August 1994, Sullivan directed respondent to discipline two female employees who had taken time off when they did not have leave time available. Respondent was aware that several male employees had similarly taken leave without suffering disciplinary measures. Respondent raised this issue with Sullivan, who listened to her and then told her to do as she had been instructed. Respondent contacted corporate staff in Austin orally and in writing concerning this issue because of its potential gender discrimination implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In the fourth incident, on August 18, 1994, respondent tried to direct Sullivan\u2019s attention to the need to make the Mojave facility handicapped accessible. Sullivan\u2019s response was \u201cthat we just wouldn\u2019t hire any goddamn handicaps.\u201d Respondent reported the comment to corporate human resources staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Finally, toward the end of August 1994, Sullivan informed respondent that a department head was to be fired. The department head, \u201cin his fifties,\u201d was to be replaced by a younger employee. The department head had received a poor performance review from his supervisors and, apparently unaware he was to be terminated, had come to respondent to find out how to challenge the review. Respondent met with Sullivan and received his permission to investigate the matter further, although Sullivan warned her \u201cit\u2019s not going to do any good.\u201d Respondent received favorable reports about the department head from other management personnel. When Sullivan told her to fire the man anyway, respondent contacted corporate staff in Austin and wrote a memorandum to Sullivan and to respondent\u2019s own corporate superior pointing out potential age discrimination dangers that might arise from terminating the employee. Sullivan did not respond to the memorandum in any way. Although moved to a different position, the employee was not terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>During Sullivan\u2019s entire tenure at Mojave (he had started in Mojave in 1992 as a program manager), he and respondent \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem to hit it off very well. I felt that he did not like the idea of listening to a female manager,\u201d according to respondent. Respondent complained to the corporate human resources director that \u201cevery time I made a suggestion or a comment to him, he would turn things around where it became a screaming issue with him no matter what I said or did. [^Q I told him that it was starting to become very intolerable to be there and trying to appease [Sullivan] so that we could work together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Starting in June of 1994, Sullivan directed respondent to handle the office switchboard (located just outside respondent\u2019s office) during some of the breaks taken by the regular switchboard operator. Respondent complained to the facilities manager that she was the only manager assigned this duty, but she did not take the matter directly to Sullivan because she \u201cjust viewed it as another\u2014it was more indicative of him trying to get me upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In July of 1994, after respondent contacted corporate headquarters about requiring the hourly worker to work at home without pay, Sullivan entered respondent\u2019s office while she was in a meeting and \u201cstarted yelling and screaming about me calling Austin.\u201d However, after the next time respondent contacted Austin in late July, Sullivan\u2019s treatment of her was not \u201canything different than how he had been treating me prior to that.\u201d \u201cHe seemed to be agitated all the time with me,\u201d according to respondent. Respondent\u2019s supervisor in Austin had the impression at this time that Sullivan was \u201cpicking on\u201d respondent and \u201cgoing out of his way to make her life difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">When respondent returned from a July vacation, she discovered her calendar/business diary was missing from her office. She learned Sullivan had been in her office and confronted him about the calendar. He denied any knowledge of the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">On approximately August 26, 1994, Sullivan informed respondent, in front of other managers, that respondent was not a \u201cteam player\u201d and did not appear to be \u201con management\u2019s side\u201d; if this were the case, Sullivan said, he was inclined to transfer respondent\u2019s job to Austin. He suggested that perhaps respondent\u2019s husband would prefer that she not work at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">By August of 1994, respondent had begun avoiding contact with Sullivan to the extent she could. Sullivan himself did not initiate contact, but when he was in the vicinity of respondent\u2019s office, he glared at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>During the period from June through September 1994, respondent began to suffer continuous headaches; in addition, she was having stomach problems, nose bleeds and insomnia. She considered quitting her job and discussed this with human resources staff at corporate headquarters. Even though she had not decided to quit, she \u201cknew that that\u2019s what it was coming down to.\u201d Although her entire experience with Sullivan was bad, during the last three weeks of respondent\u2019s employment the situation deteriorated: \u201c[I]t became very intolerable. I was a wreck personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">On August 31, 1994, respondent and Sullivan came into contact concerning the hiring of a new driver (also known as a \u201cmaterial expeditor\u201d) at the Mojave facility. Sullivan was impatient to have the position filled, but respondent insisted it was necessary to post the job opening for two weeks to satisfy affirmative action requirements. Sullivan asked respondent whether she knew a \u201cwetback\u201d they could hire immediately to fill the position. Respondent is Hispanic, as Sullivan knew; respondent concluded Sullivan made this comment specifically to irritate her. She reported the incident orally to five people at corporate headquarters and by memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Respondent had no contact with Sullivan from the occasion of the \u201cwetback\u201d conversation until September 9, 1994. On that date, Sullivan summoned respondent to his office to inquire about the status of filling the driver position. Respondent reported that the job had been posted but that no one had been hired yet. Respondent said a minority applicant had applied for the position the day before. Sullivan wanted to know why they could not just hire the minority applicant immediately. Respondent told Sullivan that as a result of the 1992 Department of Labor audit, she was required to post every job for two weeks. The theory was that increasing the applicant pool and appellant\u2019s profile with local job agencies were goals of equal importance to the goal of actually hiring a minority applicant for any given position.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Sullivan thought this was a \u201cstupid-ass rule\u201d and told respondent he was going to call the Department of Labor auditor so he could \u201chear it from her because he didn\u2019t want to have to adhere to that.\u201d Sullivan was \u201cshouting and screaming and cursing . . . shouting at the top of his lungs.\u201d He ordered respondent to bring the telephone number for the auditor from respondent\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Respondent did not think it was \u201ca smart move\u201d for Sullivan to call the auditor \u201cin the mode that he was in,\u201d so respondent called corporate headquarters to warn them what Sullivan planned to do. She reached Elizabeth Haran, appellant\u2019s human resources manager in Austin. When she returned to Sullivan\u2019s office with the telephone number, Sullivan was engaged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>conference call with the corporate director of human resources, Ronald Booth, and Haran. Sullivan was on the speakerphone and directed respondent to join the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Sullivan was shouting at respondent \u201cthat he didn\u2019t ask me to go and make a phone call to Austin, he just wanted the [Department of Labor] number and that\u2019s not what he asked me to do and you\u2019re always calling Austin.\u201d Sullivan, according to respondent, was shouting and yelling, trembling and red-faced. She tried to leave the office but Sullivan ordered her to come back. (Respondent testified; \u201cHe screamed at me and yelled at me to come back, that he wasn\u2019t through with me.\u201d) In order to be heard by her colleagues in Austin, respondent had to stand next to the telephone and in close proximity to Sullivan. Sullivan became more and more agitated, to the point where respondent believed Sullivan was about to strike something in his anger; since she was standing next to Sullivan, she believed Sullivan might strike her. Respondent backed away, said \u201cI quit,\u201d and announced that if she were to leave, \u201cit was not going to end here.\u201d Sullivan calmed immediately and asked the other two persons if they had heard what respondent said. Booth told respondent he would call her. Respondent left Sullivan\u2019s office and returned to her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Booth conferred with a colleague in Austin and decided to accept respondent\u2019s resignation. When he called respondent, Booth got the impression respondent did not want to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Respondent called the Tracor corporate ombudsman (who was also a vice-president of Tracor for human resources) in Austin and asked him to intervene. He said he would \u201chave to look at his schedule\u201d before committing to anything. Respondent left work at the end of the day, taking with her copies of documents from her own personnel file and copies of documents generated in the Department of Labor audit. She anticipated using these materials if corporate officials called her at home over the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">On Monday, September 12, respondent again spoke with Booth, appellant\u2019s human resources director. He asked if she could continue to work with Sullivan. Respondent said she could if Sullivan were sent to \u201cmanagement school.\u201d Booth said that \u201cwasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d He said he would get back with respondent. Later, Booth told respondent to collect her personal belongings and to come back the next day for her final paycheck. Respondent also spoke to the corporate ombudsman, but he said he would be unable to come to Mojave \u201cright away,\u201d citing his own busy schedule. When respondent left work at the end of the day on Monday, she took with her a file containing copies of documents involving various personnel issues she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>had worked on over the past year. She never returned to the company any of the copies she took home.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, respondent sued appellant on May 17, 1996, for wrongful termination of employment. Alleging that she was constructively discharged from employment by the intolerable and aggravated actions of appellant\u2019s managerial employees, respondent alleged discrimination on the bases of sex, race, and ancestry in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, particularly Government Code section 12940. Respondent also alleged appellant constructively terminated her employment in retaliation for her assertion of the fair employment rights of others as prohibited by Government Code section 12940, subdivision (f). Respondent sought an award for lost wages, as well as general and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Trial began on March 4, 1998. On March 24, 1998, the jury returned a special verdict finding that respondent was not subjected to a hostile working environment based on her sex or national origin. The jury unanimously concluded respondent \u201cwas subjected to adverse employment action because of engaging in protected activities such as opposing any practices forbidden under the Fair Employment &amp; Housing Act.\u201d The jury unanimously found respondent had been constructively discharged and that she had not engaged in \u201cwrongdoing prior to or at the time of her resignation which would have given defendant grounds to terminate her had it known of her misconduct at the time of her resignation.\u201d The jury awarded loss of earnings damages in the amount of $340,000, general damages in the amount of $60,000, and (in a subsequent verdict) punitive damages in the amount of $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">After judgment was entered on the verdict on March 30, 1998, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. When appellant\u2019s motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding verdict were denied, appellant filed a second notice of appeal. We ordered the two appeals consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Appellant raises two issues on this appeal. First, appellant contends the record contains insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination that respondent was constructively discharged from her employment. Second, appellant contends the trial court abused its equitable discretion in rejecting appellant\u2019s defense based on \u201cafter-acquired evidence\u201d of employment-related misconduct by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">\n<em>Constructive Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Appellant contends there was no constructive discharge as a matter of law. \u201cThis argument calls for our determining whether substantial evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict for respondent.\u201d <em>(Hardison v. Bushnell </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 22, 25-26 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 106].)  \u201cWhere findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal, we are bound by the \u2018elementary, but often overlooked principle of law, that. . . the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted,\u2019 to support the findings below. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183].) We must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.\u201d <em>(Jessup Farms </em>v. <em>Baldwin, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">An employer is considered to have discharged an employee when \u201cthe employer\u2019s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, T quit,\u2019 the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer\u2019s acts, against the employee\u2019s will.\u201d <em>(Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244-1245 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022] (hereafter <em>Turner).) </em>This form of termination of the employment relationship is commonly known as \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d and it is \u201clegally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">In <em>Turner, </em>the Supreme Court traced the development of the constructive discharge doctrine from cases decided under the National Labor Relations Act, through federal employment discrimination cases, and into state law wrongful discharge cases. <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1246.) The opinion then traced the development of the standard in the appellate courts of California, noting there were two primary aspects necessary for a finding of constructive discharge: first, there must be intolerable working conditions; second, the employer must in some manner be held to knowledge of the conditions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">As to the second issue, the <em>Turner </em>court modified the law as it had been established by the Court of Appeal. Rejecting liability based on constructive knowledge, the <em>Turner </em>opinion held that the employer must \u201ceither intentionally create[] or knowingly permit[]\u201d the intolerable conditions in order to be held liable. <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>As to the first issue, however, <em>Turner </em>reaffirmed the \u201cintolerable conditions\u201d requirement in the same terms as it had been developed in the federal courts and in the California Court of Appeal: \u201cThe essence of the test is whether, under all the circumstances, the working conditions are so unusually adverse that a reasonable employee in plaintiff\u2019s position \u2018 \u201c \u2018would have felt compelled to resign.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247.) More specifically, \u201c[t]he conditions giving rise to the resignation must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer. The proper focus is on whether the resignation was coerced, not whether it was simply one rational option for the employee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The <em>Turner </em>opinion gives some examples of what does not constitute constructive discharge: \u201c[A]dverse working conditions must be unusually \u2018aggravated\u2019 or amount to a \u2018continuous pattern\u2019 before the situation will be deemed intolerable. In general, \u2018[s]ingle, trivial, or isolated acts of [misconduct] are insufficient\u2019 to support a constructive discharge claim. . . . Moreover, a poor performance rating or a demotion, even when accompanied by reduction in pay, does not by itself trigger a constructive discharge.\u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">These requirements from <em>Turner </em>were conveyed to the jury in the present case with BAJI No. 10.02 (8th ed. 1994), requested by appellant, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">\u201cA termination of employment may be either actual or constructive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">\u201cIt is actual when the employer notifies the employee, orally or in writing, that the employment is terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">\u201cIt is constructive termination when an employee resigns because an employer acting directly or through . . . persons effectively representing such employer, namely an officer, director, managing agent, or supervisory employee, either intentionally creates, or knowingly permits to exist, working conditions that are so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee\u2019s resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would be compelled to resign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">\u201cAdverse working conditions must be unusually aggravated or amount to a continuous pattern before the situation will be deemed intolerable. Single, trivial, or isolated acts of misconduct by an employer are generally insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">\u201cThe length of time an employee remains on the job following the onset of the claim of adverse working conditions is a fact you may consider in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>determining the intolerability of employment conditions from the standpoint of what a reasonable employee would have done under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The jury, as noted, unanimously found that \u201cdefendant either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of plaintiff\u2019s resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in plaintiff\u2019s position would be compelled to resign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Appellant contends there was no substantial evidence to support this finding; in particular, its argument on appeal states the evidence failed to establish an adverse employment action sufficient to cause a reasonable employee to resign. Appellant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the other necessary elements of the \u201cretaliation\u201d wrongful discharge claim, namely, the existence of an employer/employee relationship, that respondent was engaged in the protected activity of opposing what she reasonably believed were unlawful employment practices, that respondent\u2019s protected activity was a motivating factor for appellant\u2019s actions, and that respondent was injured or damaged by appellant\u2019s actions. (See BAJI No. 12.10 (1997 new) (8th ed. 1994).)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">There is a failure on appellant\u2019s part to recognize the substantial evidence standard of review in two critical ways that undermine its argument. First, appellant undervalues evidence the jury could and clearly did find credible. Second, appellant attempts to slice into separate incidents\u2014and to evaluate individually\u2014evidence from which the jury could and clearly did find a \u201ccontinuous pattern\u201d of conduct on the part of appellant and its employees. (See <em>Kovatch v. California Casualty Management Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1269-1270 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 217] [sufficiency of evidence to raise triable issue of fact in summary judgment context].)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Appellant contends respondent only presented evidence of two instances in which Sullivan yelled at her. This argument disregards, without any discussion, respondent\u2019s testimony that Sullivan \u201cseemed to be agitated all the time with me\u201d and that respondent complained to the corporate human resources director that \u201cevery time I made a suggestion or a comment to [Sullivan], he would turn things around where it became a screaming issue with him no matter what I said or did.\u201d The argument ignores the testimony of respondent\u2019s supervisor in Austin that he had the impression that Sullivan was \u201cpicking on\u201d respondent and \u201cgoing out of his way to make her life difficult.\u201d Finally, the argument ignores the other kinds of harassment about which respondent testified. The jury could have credited respondent\u2019s testimony that she was assigned to the switchboard by Sullivan when no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>manager was, that Sullivan used the term \u201cwetback\u201d in a discussion with respondent, that Sullivan took respondent\u2019s business diary from her office during a vacation, and that Sullivan threatened to transfer respondent\u2019s job to Austin knowing that respondent\u2019s husband would be unlikely to agree to respondent\u2019s moving with the job. The jury could have inferred these actions were all intended by Sullivan to harass respondent and to contribute to an intolerable work situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Additionally, appellant attempts to dissect Sullivan\u2019s treatment of respondent into distinct incidents; each incident is then claimed to be either trivial or a justified response to respondent\u2019s own acts. This view is justified, according to appellant, because respondent testified \u201cshe enjoyed working for Tracor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">This testimony must be viewed in the proper context. According to respondent, as the situation with Sullivan deteriorated, she began to lose hope that her corporate supervisors could effectively come to her aid. She said the Tracor human resources director thought he could \u201cresolve some of the situations\u201d with Sullivan, but that \u201cat the end I don\u2019t think he felt that it would change.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel then asked: \u201cAll right. So why didn\u2019t you resign before that?\u201d Respondent answered: \u201cBecause I\u2014I enjoyed working at Tracor Flight Systems.\u201d Immediately prior to this testimony, respondent testified: \u201cIt was very hard to go to work there. We didn\u2019t have a good working relationship. I felt [Sullivan] was doing things to try to get me to leave and he was making comments to antagonize me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Even lifted out of context, as appellant has done, this testimony by respondent is not a basis for holding that, as a matter of law, the jury was not permitted to give credence to respondent\u2019s extensive testimony about the part of her job she did not enjoy\u2014namely, Sullivan\u2019s treatment of her and the physical and mental toll of that treatment upon her. This isolated portion of testimony does not compel a finding, as a matter of law, that respondent\u2019s complaints were trivial.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Yet, in appellant\u2019s view, this testimony requires that only the September 9, 1994, incident be considered in evaluating the evidence of constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>discharge. In appellant\u2019s view, Sullivan\u2019s behavior on that date was provoked by respondent\u2019s lies when she called Austin; in any event, says appellant, Sullivan\u2019s conduct\u2014\u201calbeit loud, harsh and accompanied by profanity\u2014could not, as a matter of law create \u2018intolerable\u2019 conditions of employment\u201d because it \u201chad none of the hallmarks that would turn <em>an isolated incident </em>into intolerable working conditions . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Respondent\u2019s counsel did not argue the case to the jury on the basis of the September 9, 1994, incident in isolation. Rather, counsel relied in part on Booth\u2019s testimony in which he \u201ccertainly\u201d agreed that there were \u201ca lot of occurrences where even though you can\u2019t recall the details of the conflict, Miss Thompson would end up telling you that Sullivan was yelling and screaming at her.\u201d He cited Booth\u2019s testimony that the \u201cgist\u201d of respondent\u2019s complaints was that Sullivan was constantly yelling and screaming and making an intimidating environment. As we have noted above, both Booth and respondent testified to a continuing and escalating conflict between Sullivan and respondent that clearly supported an inference that, in Booth\u2019s words, Sullivan was \u201cpicking on\u201d respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">By contrast, appellant\u2019s counsel did not argue to the jury that the course of conduct to which respondent testified was inadequate to force a reasonable employee to resign. Instead, counsel argued that respondent was a liar\u2014that the course of conduct simply did not occur in the manner respondent said it did: respondent, according to appellant\u2019s counsel, knew Sullivan thought she was incompetent as the human relations manager and she \u201cbegins to set a situation up to get back at Mr. Sullivan and ultimately to get back at her employer.\u201d Respondent\u2019s \u201cdisjointed and fabricated incidents\u201d were only credible if every other witness is lying, according to appellant\u2019s counsel, who argued: \u201cCredibility in this case is a huge, huge issue. And we submit the credibility of the plaintiff is a huge issue. As you heard her in rebuttal, witnesses are lying, she\u2019s not lying but everybody that we\u2019re\u2014that we called up there is not telling the truth, [fl] I submit to you that if everybody isn\u2019t telling the truth and only Miss Thompson is telling the truth, we wouldn\u2019t be here at all and presenting these people to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The jury apparently did believe respondent\u2019s testimony (which, we will note, was corroborated in many important respects by Booth and by Elizabeth Haran, at least in the original version of her testimony). This evidence rationally supports a conclusion that a reasonable employee in respondent\u2019s position would have been compelled to resign her employment: Sullivan intentionally had made it impossible for respondent to do her job through a continuous course of intimidation and harassment.  This determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>that the \u201creasonable employee\u201d would have been compelled to quit because of Sullivan\u2019s conduct is quintessential^ a jury function. (See <em>Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Internat., Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 93, 106, fn. 3 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 900, 948 P.2d 412].) \u201cWhere the trial court or jury has drawn reasonable inferences from the evidence, we have no power to draw different inferences, even though different inferences may also be reasonable.\u201d <em>(Rosales v. Thermex-Thermatron, Inc. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 187, 197 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Finally, there is a thread of argument running throughout appellant\u2019s briefs summarized in the following statement from appellant\u2019s reply brief: \u201c[Constructive discharge typically involves a combination of continual sexual or racial epithets, explicit physical threats or assault, economically adverse employment actions, or requiring the employee to personally engage in illegal activity.\u201d While actions unlawful in themselves may \u201ctypically\u201d be a part of a constructive discharge case, they are not <em>required </em>to be. In the seminal United States Supreme Court constructive discharge case, relied upon by the <em>Turner </em>court, an employer constructively discharged its employees by reporting them to the Immigration and Naturalization Service as undocumented aliens. (See <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 883, 894-895 [104 S.Ct. 2803, 2809-2811, 81 L.Ed.2d 732].) The United States Supreme Court recognized that an employer\u2019s \u201creporting of any violation of the criminal laws is conduct which ordinarily should be encouraged, not penalized.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 895 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2810].) Nevertheless, when such reporting \u201cis in retaliation for the employee\u2019s protected union activity,\u201d it is properly characterized as a constructive discharge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 895-896 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2811].)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">While the conduct may not be \u201cordinarily . . . encouraged,\u201d employers have the right to unfairly and harshly criticize their employees, to embarrass them in front of other employees, and to threaten to terminate or demote the employee. <em>(Casenas v. Fujisawa USA, Inc. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 101, 115 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 827] [performance review]; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Aro Corp. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1628, 1636 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 882] [embarrassment, criticism, demotion]; <em>Soules v. Cadam, Inc. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 390, 401 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 6] [demotion]; see <em>Helgeson v. American Intern. Group, Inc. </em>(S.D.Cal. 1999) 44 F.Supp.2d 1091, 1098, 1100 [inter alia, threatened termination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Nevertheless, a continuous course of such actions, uncorrected by management, can constitute objectively intolerable working conditions. (See <em>Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 1259-1260 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>As stated in <em>Turner, </em>\u201cadverse working conditions must be unusually \u2018aggravated\u2019 <em>or </em>amount to a \u2018continuous pattern\u2019 before the situation will be deemed intolerable.\u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247, italics added.) Implicit in this disjunctive formulation is that even though individual incidents in a campaign of harassment do not constitute justification for an employee to resign, the overall campaign of harassment can constitute such a justification. (See <em>Etter </em>v. <em>Veriflo Corp. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 457, 465 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] [concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine, or a generalized nature required to show hostile work environment]; <em>Guthrey </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1123-1124 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 27] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Appellant places significant reliance on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Guthrey </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at pages 1117-1118. Appellant contends <em>Guthrey </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cplaintiff did not suffer [a] hostile working environment or adverse employment action although [his] supervisor loudly berated plaintiff in front of her [sic] peers while \u2018very aggressive\u2019 and \u2018real red in the face.\u2019 \u201d Contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, the issue in <em>Guthrey </em>was not whether the employee had suffered a hostile working environment or adverse employment action. Rather, the issue was whether the employee had presented any evidence that would support an inference that the supervisor \u201chandled the matter the way she did because of plaintiff\u2019s gender.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1118.) The opinion specifically recognized that the employee\u2019s allegations concerning his supervisor \u201cmight raise a question of fact whether [the supervisor\u2019s] aggression reached the level of unwarranted hostility,\u201d but concluded that any nexus between the alleged conduct and the gender of the employee was \u201cmere speculation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nothing in <em>Guthrey </em>supports a claim that severe verbal abuse of an employee <em>in retaliation for protected conduct </em>cannot constitute substantial evidence supporting a constructive discharge finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Viewing the evidence in the present case in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury reasonably could have found a continuous pattern of conduct by Sullivan, uncorrected by higher management, that resulted in intolerable working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\n<em>After-acquired Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The doctrine of after-acquired evidence shields an employer from liability or limits available relief where, after a termination, the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>learns for the first time about employee wrongdoing that would have led to the discharge in any event. <em>(Camp </em>v. <em>Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp; Marmaro </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 620, 632 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].) The doctrine is the basis for an equitable defense related to the traditional defense of \u201cunclean hands.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 638.) The doctrine has been summarized by the United States Supreme Court: \u201cWhere an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge.\u201d <em>(McKennon </em>v. <em>Nashville Banner Publishing Co. </em>(1995) 513 U.S. 352, 362-363 [115 S.Ct. 879, 886-887, 130 L.Ed.2d 852].)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">In the present case, there were conflicts in the evidence concerning respondent\u2019s actions, her motivations, and the possible consequences of her actions within appellant\u2019s disciplinary system. The trial court submitted those factual questions to the jury for resolution and then used the resulting special verdict as the basis for concluding appellant was not entitled to equitable reduction of the damages award. Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in reaching that conclusion. Upon review of the record in the light most favorable to the verdict, we find there clearly was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s wrongdoing, if any, would not have resulted in termination of employment if appellant had known of the conduct. Accordingly, we conclude the court did not abuse its equitable discretion in refusing to bar recovery or limit respondent\u2019s damage award on the basis of the after-acquired evidence of respondent\u2019s acts at the end of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Respondent testified that she kept a separate file consisting of copies of personnel items about which she had contacted Austin so that she would have the items at hand when there was follow-up from corporate staffers. In the final days of her employment, after she had announced her resignation, respondent testified, she took this file home with her because she wanted to use these items in discussions with the corporate ombudsman when he called her or came to Mojave, as respondent expected him to at that time. During the same time period, she also copied and took with her portions of her own personnel file, documents from the Department of Labor audit file, and certain corporate manuals. Not only did she want these records with her in case the ombudsman called, but because of the missing business diary she feared the records might \u201cdisappear\u201d also. Appellant testified she was authorized to take files and records home as part of her job and that she did so virtually every day throughout her employment, because she worked at home every night.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>Appellant contended at trial that respondent\u2019s conduct in removing copies of files at the time of her resignation constituted wrongdoing that would have resulted in her termination if appellant had known what respondent was doing. Appellant presented the testimony of Ray Bradshaw, director of human resources for appellant at the time of trial, to establish the company\u2019s policy regarding termination and employee discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Bradshaw\u2019s testimony was premised on the idea that respondent had removed company documents from the Mojave facility for her own personal use. He acknowledged that if respondent had taken the documents home for a company purpose or \u201ca current project,\u201d her actions would have been fully authorized. He said appellant had a general policy of \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d that involved supervisory counseling, written warnings, and suspension prior to termination. He added the comment that there was a \u201cseparate policy\u201d recognizing \u201cthere are some violations that employees can be involved in that surpass any benefit to progressive discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The jury unanimously found respondent had been constructively discharged and that she had not engaged in \u201cwrongdoing prior to or at the time of her resignation which would have given defendant grounds to terminate her had it known of her misconduct at the time of her resignation.\u201d In employing a standard that focused on the phrase \u201cwould have given defendant grounds\u201d to terminate respondent, the instruction applied a standard impermissibly favoring appellant. \u201cAs has been observed, \u2018proving that the same decision would have been <em>justified </em>... is not the same as proving that the same decision <em>would have been </em>made.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(McKennon </em>v. <em>Nashville Banner Publishing Co., supra, </em>513 U.S. at p. 360 [115 S.Ct. at p. 885], italics added, omission in <em>McKennon.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Accepting as true respondent\u2019s testimony concerning her motivation and expectations in taking home the records, a reasonable jury could conclude that respondent acted within the scope of her prior authorization to take home documents, since she reasonably anticipated meeting with company officials from Austin. At the very least, substantial evidence permitted a reasonable jury to find that respondent\u2019s motivation in taking the documents home constituted poor judgment and not theft, and would have subjected her to, at most, lesser measures of \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d instead of termination. Given the underlying factual findings by the jury, the court did not err in failing to bar recovery or equitably reduce the award of damages pursuant to the after-acquired evidence doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondent is awarded her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Harris, J., and Wiseman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\"> At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel contended we must disregard Sullivan\u2019s treatment of respondent prior to the first instance of \u201cprotected activity\u201d in July of 1994. That is, counsel argued, Sullivan\u2019s action prior to that could not be viewed as retaliation for events that had not yet happened. While the latter point is clearly true, the first point is nevertheless incorrect. In determining whether a reasonable employee would have felt compelled to resign, the jury is entitled to consider all of the circumstances of the employment relationship. The jury is not required to start with an artificial baseline of a \u201cnormal\u201d employer-employee relationship on the date of the first protected activity. The jury was entitled to conclude that Sullivan\u2019s retaliatory actions made what was previously just a bad situation into an intolerable situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
