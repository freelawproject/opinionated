A seven-week jury trial in a lawsuit seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages resulted in a verdict that a single sheriff\u2019s deputy committed a civil rights violation, with an award of $3,380 in compensatory and $1,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Plaintiffs sought almost $250,000 in attorney fees for achieving this victory, which was pyrrhic in every respect save the potential of the fee request. But the court went beyond a mere denial. Acting under the misconception that turnabout is fair play, it awarded nearly the same amount (some $240,000) for <em>defendants\u2019 </em>attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We hold the court had discretion to taketh away, but no discretion to giveth. Because of plaintiffs\u2019 extremely limited success on their civil rights claims, we follow <em>Farrar v. Hobby </em>(1992) 506 U.S. 103 [113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494] and leave each side to bear its own attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 other grounds for reversal are without merit. They complain the denial of their right to introduce conspiracy evidence was \u201cerror <em>per se,\u201d </em>but we know of no such rule of automatic reversal in civil cases. And remanding this litigation for additional months of trial to recover a nominal $1 damage award on a pattern or practice theory under <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 658 [98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611] (hereafter <em>Monell) </em>would be futile and unnecessary. This case, having overstayed its welcome, does not deserve a return visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The underlying incident took place in the early morning hours of October 13, 1991, when plaintiffs Shawn Choate and Jose Bernal admittedly \u201cprovoked\u201d some off-duty sheriff\u2019s deputies into a \u201cstreet fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Choate, then 19 years old, and Bernal, age 20, passed the evening drinking and partying with a third friend, 17-year-old Albert Valladares, a member of the \u201cOld Town Boys\u201d street gang. They ended up at the Dana Point apartment of Choate\u2019s 14-year-old girlfriend. Across the street defendant Brian Scanlan was hosting a birthday party at his condominium for about 10 to 20 people. Both Scanlan and many of his guests were off-duty sheriff\u2019s deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The party ended between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. As three of the guests were walking to their cars, they were confronted by a heavily intoxicated Valla-dares, followed by about three or four other males. Valladares was verbally combative, profane and lewd, especially to Kim Anderson, who was with her boyfriend, defendant Pat Higa. Higa repeatedly said \u201cwe didn\u2019t want any problems, we just wanted to leave the area,\u201d but to no avail. Valladares took a flying kick at defendant Kurt Bourne\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Fearing they were outnumbered, Higa tried for a quick exit: \u201cI didn\u2019t want this thing to escalate. . . . My thing was [to] cut our losses and just leave the area.\u201d As Higa was walking towards his car, Valladares swung at him and hit his left jaw. Despite this, Higa \u201cmade a bee line straight for my car,\u201d but Valladares kicked the car door and shattered the driver\u2019s window. Anderson ran back for help.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Scanlan and two remaining party guests (off-duty Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Doug Doyle and a civilian friend Sam Samawi) responded. They saw some eight to twelve people advancing on Higa, making hostile, belligerent and threatening statements. They chased the men into an alley. Choate picked up a board and \u201cswung [it] like a baseball bat,\u201d shouting, \u201cDo you want to die, motherfucker?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bernal hit Samawi in the head with a brick. Valladares wildly swung a metal pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Choate, Bernal, and Valladares were overpowered within five to eight minutes, \u201creal quick.\u201d There were conflicting stories about how this occurred. Choate\u2019s girlfriend and her mother, for example, reported seeing Choate hit in the head at least three times with a big flashlight. Other eyewitnesses said plaintiffs repeatedly were told to \u201cjust lie still, the police will be here in a minute,\u201d and \u201c[pjlease calm down. . . . We\u2019re just trying to control you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Two on-duty sheriff\u2019s deputies, defendants Mark Billings and James DeKruif, responded to emergency calls just as the fracas was ending. Bernal, Choate, and Samawi were taken to a medical center for treatment. Bernal subsequently pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace. No charges were filed against Choate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Plaintiffs sued the off-duty sheriff\u2019s deputies and civilian Samawi for \u201cbrutally attack[ing]\u201d them during the fight. Billings and DeKruif, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>on-duty deputies, were sued for conspiring \u201cto give their off-duty colleagues enough time to \u2018finish the plaintiffs off\u2019 \u201d and for endeavoring \u201cto cover up the incident by . . . filing knowingly false and misleading police reports.\u201d The complaint, filed in January 1993, contained 11 causes of action, including battery, conspiracy, and federal civil rights. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.) It included a <em>Monell </em>cause of action against the county, alleging the sheriff\u2019s department had an official policy or custom of condoning unconstitutional conduct and conducting a \u201ccorrupt, whitewash investigation into the plaintiff\u2019s complaints.\u201d (Monell, <em>supra, </em>436 U.S. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The court bifurcated the <em>Monell </em>claim from the other causes of action. Deputies Higa, Scanlan, Bourne and Doyle were represented by separate counsel. Bernal briefly testified and then disappeared. The court struck his testimony because he could not be cross-examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After an extensive discussion, the court nonsuited plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims. Plaintiffs voluntarily dropped their negligence cause of action and conceded they lacked evidence against the responding deputies, Billings and DeKruif, except on the cover-up conspiracy charges. The court granted a nonsuit as to Doyle and Higa on the 42 United States Code section 1983 claims, finding they acted for personal reasons as private citizens and not under color of law. It denied a nonsuit on this same predicate issue as to Scanlan and Bourne because of conflicting evidence as to whether they had described themselves as police officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The jury was given special verdict forms as to the remaining defendants and causes of action. It determined Scanlan and Bourne were acting under color of law. Choate recovered $3,380 in compensatory damages and $1,000 in punitive damages on excessive force and battery theories against Scanlan. Bernal recovered $1,089 in compensatory damages and $250 in punitive damages against Scanlan and Samawi on a battery theory. The jury exonerated the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Following the verdict, the court dismissed the <em>Monell </em>claim as moot. It denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial and for an additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The court denied plaintiffs\u2019 fee request for $248,647 in section 1988 attorney fees, but awarded fees of $241,644 to all defendants (except Scan-lan) because plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights causes of action were frivolous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>without merit. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.) It described plaintiffs as \u201cseveral of Dana Point\u2019s more notorious local hooligans\u201d who sought \u201cunprovoked combat\u201d for the fun of antagonizing \u201capparently passive victims.\u201d It concluded, \u201cnot even the most wildly imaginative attorney would <em>think </em>of suing on these facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Plaintiffs claim their damage awards are inadequate as a matter of law, requiring a new trial on damages or an additur. They overstate our limited role in reviewing the fact question of the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Unlike the jury and the trial judge, we did not see/ or hear the witnesses and cannot resolve evidentiary conflicts regarding the severity of injuries or their cause. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>Taz Express </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 853, 855 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 360] [\u201c[B]etween black and white are various shades of gray, and all of the colors of the rainbow as well. What constitutes fair and reasonable compensation in a particular case is a question of fact . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Choate\u2019s recovery under the federal civil rights law (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) does not change the equation. Constitutional torts employ the same measure of damages as common law torts and are not augmented \u201cbased on the abstract \u2018value\u2019 or \u2018importance\u2019 of constitutional rights . . . .\u201d <em>(Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 299, 310 [106 S.Ct. 2537, 2545, 91 L.Ed.2d 249].) Plaintiffs have the burden of proving compensatory damages in section 1983 cases, and the amount of damages depends \u201clargely upon the credibility of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony concerning their injuries.\u201d <em>(Butler v. Dowd </em>(8th Cir. 1992) 979 F.2d 661, 669.) A finding of excessive force does not entitle plaintiffs to compensatory damages as a matter of law\u2014both justifiable and excessive force may have been used. <em>(Gibeau </em>v. <em>Nellis </em>(2d Cir. 1994) 18 F.3d 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In <em>Gibeau </em>the Second Circuit refused to remand for a new trial on inadequate damages even though the evidence showed a prison guard struck an inmate at least three times in the head with a heavy flashlight. The court observed, \u201cIt is possible that the jury considered only the last blow to be excessive, and it may have concluded that the head contusion was caused by the first blow.\u201d <em>(Gibeau v. Nellis, supra, </em>18 F.3d at p. 110.) As in <em>Gibeau, </em>the jury\u2019s findings against Scanlan do not necessarily mean that all the force he used was objectively unreasonable or that Choate\u2019s evidence was to be taken at face value. Perhaps the jurors concluded that defendants unnecessarily prolonged the confrontation but plaintiffs\u2019 injuries had already occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">It also may be that the jury concluded plaintiffs\u2019 evidence regarding the extent of their injuries and the manner in which they were inflicted was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>credible, or only marginally credible. <em>(Butler v. Dowd, </em>supra, 979 F.2d at p. 672.) Various eyewitnesses contradicted their depiction of events, stating, for example, \u201c[t]here was no bashing of heads or anything . . . like that going on at all.\u201d And the treating paramedic reported \u201cno significant negative findings\u201d as to Choate, and Bernal was alert with a \u201cminor head injury resulting from a fight.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We simply are not in a position to second-guess these factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We turn now to the fee awards, by far and away the biggest monetary component of the case. There is nearly a gap of half a million dollars between the fees sought by plaintiff and the court-awarded fees to defendants. The trial court got it half right, we think.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Defendants are <em>not </em>entitled to attorney fees merely because they prevailed on all or most of plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights claims.  While the attorney fee provision in 42 United States Code section 1988 makes no distinction between prevailing plaintiffs and defendants,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has developed more stringent standards for the latter than for the former. <em>(Hughes v. Rowe </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 5, 14 [101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163].) Attorney fees ordinarily are awarded to prevailing civil rights plaintiffs unless special circumstances render such an award unjust. <em>(Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. 103.) In contrast, however, prevailing civil rights <em>defendants </em>can recover attorney fees <em>only </em>where the court also finds that the civil rights claim was objectively \u201c \u2018frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hughes, supra, </em>449 U.S. at p. 15 [101 S.Ct. at p. 179]; see also <em>Del Rio </em>v. <em>Jetton </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 30, 34-35 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Why the double standard? That is because of the need to encourage \u201cvigorous enforcement of good faith civil rights claims . . . .\u201d <em>(Del Rio </em>v. <em>Jetton, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 35.) Private citizens should not forgo the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>opportunity to vindicate core federal rights because they lack financial resources or because they fear they will have to pay the other side\u2019s attorney fees if they lose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 34-35.) The specter of attorney fees should chill only vexatious plaintiffs who bring meritless lawsuits to settle scores, not disputes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 35 [\u201cSuits filed with no real hope of victory needlessly bring defendants through the costly and agonizing uncertainty of defending suit\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Whatever criticism may be levied against the prosecution of this case, it manifestly was not clearly frivolous or brought solely for harassment without hope of success. Choate and Bernal sustained real injuries as a result of their encounter with Scanlan and the other party guests, some of whom were found to be acting under color of law. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s characterization of plaintiffs as \u201chooligans\u201d and \u201cpugnacious drunks\u201d (characterizations with which we do not necessarily agree), they did not thereby forfeit their claims to constitutional protection and certainly did not deserve <em>whatever </em>they got.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It is not unusual to have difficulty identifying who in a melee is responsible for what. In <em>Perez v. City of Huntington Park </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 817 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 258], the appellate court affirmed a judgment against a public entity even though the trial judge (acting as the trier of fact) was unable to determine which of four officers hit the plaintiff and ruled in favor of the individual defendants. The court stated, \u201cMorally, [the city] should be liable to [the plaintiff] in these circumstances. The procedural fact that [he] named and joined the employees (but was unable at trial to identify them) should not be controlling, in light of the substantive finding that two of [the city\u2019s] employees committed tortious acts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 821-822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">All the defendants named and served by plaintiffs were directly involved in the incident. This is not a situation where plaintiffs insisted, in the face of uncontroverted evidence, on proceeding against individuals who had no conceivable role in contributing to their injuries. Even the trial court recognized the murkiness of the evidence regarding \u201cjust who did what to whom[.] [S]uffice it to say the court was reminded of nothing so much as the parable of the several blind men examining and describing the elephant.\u201d Based on the record before us, the court erred in awarding attorney fees to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Choate\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees is another story. For United States Code section 1988 fees, we review the court\u2019s decision for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>discretion because of its \u201csuperior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u201d <em>(Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424, 437 [103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40].)  This discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">There is no dispute that Choate, having recovered money damages from Scanlan, was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of 42 United States Code section 1988, and thereby potentially entitled to attorney fees. <em>(Farrar v. Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. at p. 115 [113 S.Ct. at p. 575].) But that does not end the matter. As Justice O\u2019Connor observed, section 1988 is not \u201ca relief Act for lawyers\u201d who accomplish no public goal \u201cother than occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client.\u201d (506 U.S. at pp. 121-122 [113 S.Ct. at p. 578] (cone. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) As in <em>Farrar, </em>special circumstances support the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision not to award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Sometimes, as <em>Farrar </em>holds, a reasonable fee is zero, especially where the recovery is de minimis, establishes no important precedent and does not change the relationship of the parties. According to <em>Farrar, </em>the \u201cmost critical\u201d factor for determining the reasonableness of the fee award is \u201c \u2018is the degree of success obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Farrar v. Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. at p. 114 [113 S.Ct. at p. 574].) Where the purpose of a civil rights action is to recover private damages, <em>Farrar </em>continues, the court, in fixing fees, must \u201c \u2018give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>City of Riverside v. Rivera </em>(1986) <em>477 </em>U.S. 561, 585 [106 S.Ct. 2686, 2700, 91 L.Ed.2d 466] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.).) We apply this analysis here. (See also <em>Sintra, Inc. v. City of Seattle </em>(1997) 131 Wash.2d 640 [935 P.2d 555, 568] [reversing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 fee award where trial court chiefly considered factors other than degree of success \u201csuch as the difficulty of the case, the undesirability of the case, and the level of skill necessary to pursue the case properly .... This was error\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The <em>Farrar </em>plaintiffs sought $17 million in damages from six defendants, but recovered only $1 from one of them. Despite this, they were awarded $280,000 in attorney fees. The Supreme Court reversed; while the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, their failure to recover actual damages or establish a significant precedent militated against any fee award. With regard to the reasonableness prong of 42 United States Code section 1988 fees, the court noted that \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief... the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.\u201d <em>(Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. at p. 115 [113 S.Ct. at p. 575].) The \u201cmoral satisfaction\u201d of knowing there was a constitutional rights violation, standing alone, did not justify a fee award there. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114 [113 S.Ct. at p. 574].) Fees may only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>considered in relation to the extent of success obtained by the plaintiffs via damages or other relief. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 115-116 [113 S.Ct. at p. 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Considering Choate\u2019s limited success, the court did not abuse its discretion under <em>Farrar </em>by dispensing with the lodestar and awarding no fees. <em>Farrar </em>encompasses <em>any </em>de minimis damage award. (See, e.g., <em>Morales v. City of San Rafael </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 96 F.3d 359, mod. 108 F.3d 981 [\u201c \u2018Nominal damages\u2019 is not limited to an award in the amount of $1, but includes an award that may properly be classified as \u2018de minimis\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1998) 13 F.Supp.2d 550 [denying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 fees to plaintiff who sought over $1.4 million in compensatory and punitive damages in excessive force case, but recovered only $1,000]; <em>TCI of Illinois, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(N.D.Ill. 1994) 849 F.Supp. 326, 327-328 [no statutory fees to plaintiff who sought $100,000 but received only $420], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Simpson v. Sheahan </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 104 F.3d 998, 1002, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The <em>Farrar </em>exception thus distinguishes section 1988 fees from statutory fees available to California plaintiffs who prevail under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.) In <em>Engel v. Worthington </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 628 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 526], we held that attorney fees are mandatory for prevailing parties under that statute, with trial courts only possessing discretion \u201cto determine the amount of the fees, but not their entitlement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 632.) <em>Farrar </em>gives 42 United States Code section 1988 courts greater leeway to determine fee entitlements based upon the \u201cdegree of success\u201d obtained. <em>(Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. at p. 114 [113 S.Ct. at p. 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We acknowledge the public interest in encouraging victims of even relatively minor constitutional violations to file United States Code section 1983 suits. That is because, as Judge Posner has explained, \u201cthe cumulative effect of petty violations of the Constitution arising out of the interactions between the police (and other public officers) and the citizenry on the values protected by the Constitution may not be petty . . . .\u201d <em>(Hyde </em>v. <em>Small </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 583, 585.) Attorney fees appropriately issue to civil rights plaintiffs who \u201caim[] small and obtain[] an amount that is significant in relation to that aim (it need not reach the target) . . . even if the case establishes no precedent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Yet, as Judge Posner also recognized, there is an equally strong civic value in discouraging civil rights claims from being overlitigated in disproportion to the dollars and constitutional interests at stake and \u201cin the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>inflicting heavy costs on [the government] opponents] and wasting the time of the court . . . .\u201d <em>(Hyde v. Small, supra, </em>123 F.3d at p. 585.) The trial court was in the best position \u201cto ascribe a reasonable value to the lawyering it has witnessed and the results that lawyering has achieved.\u201d <em>(Wilcox v. City of Reno, supra, </em>42 F.3d at p. 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">There was sufficient basis in this record to determine that plaintiffs\u2019 de minimis recovery merited a de minimis (zero) fee award. Choate recovered far less than he wanted, and Bernal gained nothing under 42 United States Code section 1983. Mostly, plaintiffs lost and defendants (except Scanlan) won. There was a substantial difference between the millions sought and the paltry recovery obtained. Only plaintiffs\u2014the ostensible victors\u2014moved for a new trial and filed a notice of appeal. The verdict did. not alter the parties\u2019 relationship in any significant manner, nor did it confer a benefit on society. The exceedingly modest verdict created no new rule of liability, broke no ground, and sent no message. Choate\u2019s counsel himself had one word for the result: \u201cOutrageous.\u201d At oral argument he called the amount awarded a \u201cpittance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Even the very small punitive award against Scanlan supported the inference that it was imposed for the state battery claim (conceivably for his misconduct as a civilian), not for any actions undertaken by him under color of law for which federal civil rights liability was imposed. We know of no case holding that an exceedingly modest punitive award, which reasonably may have been imposed on a common law cause of action because of civilian (i.e., nongovernmental) misconduct, <em>compels </em>a fee award for a case which \u201caccomplished essentially nothing other than consuming substantial time, energy, and resources of this Court and the judicial process.\u201d <em>(Adams v. Rivera, supra, </em>13 F.Supp.2d at p. 553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Again, we stress the determination whether a victory is de minimis is generally left to the sound equitable discretion of the trial court in the first instance \u201cso as to avoid a second major litigation strictly over attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>(Cartwright v. Stamper </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 7 F.3d 106, 109-110 [district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>court noted plaintiffs\u2019 \u201c \u2018limited success in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole\u2019 \u201d].) In short, the trial court had sufficient grounds to conclude that Choate\u2019s self-characterized recovery of a \u201cpittance\u201d in compensatory and punitive damages from Scanlan created no significant precedent that likely would alter the behavior of on-duty law enforcement officers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 110 [\u201c \u2018the \u201cexternal benefits\u201d or future deterrent effect of this action is limited\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, supra, </em>506 U.S. at p. 121 [113 S.Ct. at p. 578] (cone. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.)

We find no abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their <em>Monell </em>cause of action against the county, arguing they had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to a <em>Monell </em>trial phase \u201ceven if only for an award of nominal additional damages\u201d of $1. They claim the sheriff\u2019s department violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure through its \u201creckless indifference in hiring, training, disciplining its employee officers, and in conducting sham investigations of complaints of police misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The trial court considered this claim to be moot because the county, acting pursuant to Government Code section 825, subdivision (a) had already agreed to pay the jury award: \u201c[T]he injury caused by any police officer will be fully compensated, thus litigating against the county for the exact same damages which have already been paid is basically a waste of time.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court did not abuse its discretion in determining the instant <em>Monell </em>pattern or practice claim to be unnecessary since the judgment would be paid out of the county\u2019s deep pockets. We explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In interpreting federal statutes such as 42 United States Code section 1983, we are bound to follow controlling opinions of the United States Supreme Court, but are not bound to follow federal circuit or district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>decisions. <em>(Garcia v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 177, 181 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 580].) Since the United States Supreme Court has not directly spoken on the issue of <em>Monell </em>mootness, we look for guidance to its recent decisions regarding <em>Monell </em>and related subjects, as well as to lower court decisions and sound principles of judicial administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Local governments have no liability under 42 United States Code section 1983 simply because their employees may have violated a plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights; the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply. <em>(Monell, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 691 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2036].) No punitive damages can be awarded against a public entity. <em>(City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc. </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 247, 271 [101 S.Ct. 2748, 2762, 69 L.Ed.2d 616]).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The United States Supreme Court has carved out a limited area of direct municipal responsibility \u201cif the deprivation of rights was caused by an official policy or custom of the county, set by the county\u2019s lawmakers or by an official who speaks with final policymaking authority for the county.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1166, 1168 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 860].) At most, <em>Monell </em>liability adds an additional defend-ant, a municipality, to the universe of actors who will be jointly and severally liable for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Entity liability may arise in one of two forms. The municipality may itself have directed the deprivation of federal rights through an express government policy. This was the situation in <em>Monell, </em>where there was an explicit policy requiring pregnant government employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were medically required. (See also <em>Pembaur v. Cincinnati </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 469, 485 [106 S.Ct. 1292, 1301, 89 L.Ed.2d 452] [county prosecutor, acting as the county\u2019s final decision maker, directed deputies to unlawfully enter petitioner\u2019s place of business].)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Alternatively, the municipality may have in place a custom or practice so widespread in usage as to constitute the functional equivalent of an express policy. Pattern or practice lawsuits involve far-reaching inquiries into how police departments train and discipline their officers. The Supreme Court has viewed them skeptically: \u201cRigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied\u201d to ensure that the municipality, through culpable misconduct, was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged. <em>(Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cty. </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 397, 404-405 [117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626] (hereafter <em>Bryan County).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The <em>Monell </em>doctrine \u201chas produced a body of law that is neither readily understood nor easy to apply. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] [This] makes it difficult for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>municipalities to predict just when they will be held liable based upon \u2018policy or custom.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Bryan County, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 433, 436 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1402, 1403] (dis. opn. of Breyer, J.).) If there is any pattern to <em>Monell </em>decisional law, it is a crazy quilt. (Hamilton, <em>The Importance and Overuse of Policy and Custom Claims: A View from One Trench </em>(1999) 48 DePaul L.Rev. 723, 728 (Hamilton) [\u201cWe are not dealing here with a rationally designed system of legal doctrines\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The Supreme Court has expressed its disinclination to issue advisory decisions on <em>Monell. </em>Most notably, in <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Heller, supra, </em>475 U.S. at page 799 [98 S.Ct. at page 1573], the court refused to permit an abstract trial on the constitutionality of the use of a carotid chokehold by the Los Angeles Police Department. The plaintiff in <em>Heller </em>was injured during a drunk-driving stop when the arresting officer attempted to place him in such a chokehold. Reversing the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court ordered the <em>Monell </em>claim dismissed because the jury determined that a constitutional violation had not occurred. Once this issue was removed from the case, \u201cthe fact that the departmental regulations might have authorized the use of constitutionally excessive force is quite beside the point.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A number of federal courts have applied the <em>Heller </em>rationale to the instant scenario. In such situations, an additional <em>Monell </em>trial \u201chas little, probably no, practical significance. . . . [S]ince the City indemnifies its employees for damage awards made against them in respect of the torts they commit in the course of their employment, [plaintiff] will collect his judgment in full whether or not the City is held liable.\u201d <em>(Jones v. City of Chicago </em>(7th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 985, 995; see also <em>Sanchez v. City of Riverside </em>(C.D.Cal. 1984) 596 F.Supp. 193, 195 [\u201cThe issues of \u2018government custom\u2019 and negligent supervision have been rendered hypothetical by ... the City\u2019s recognition of its obligation under state law to pay the judgment\u201d]; see also Hamilton, <em>supra, </em>48 DePaul L.Rev. at p. 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In <em>George </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 706, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of an arrestee\u2019s <em>Monell </em>claim against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>municipal police department after the officers had been found to have violated his constitutional rights during a warrantless \u201cno knock\u201d entry. Like Choate, the arrestee argued he was entitled to a <em>Monell </em>trial on the \u201csymbolic\u201d issue of his right to recover nominal damages for the municipality\u2019s pattern or practice of condoning constitutional violations and poorly training its police officers. Finding the error (if any) to be harmless, <em>George </em>held the following: \u201cAny damages resulting from a possible <em>Monell </em>claim would result from the same constitutional violation of the warrantless arrest which resulted in nominal damages. Even if George were to prove the City failed to adequately train the police officers, the result would simply be another theory of action concerning the conduct .... George\u2019s recovery, if any, based upon a <em>Monell </em>claim would be limited to nominal damages. <em>We therefore hold that any error by the district court in dismissing the Monell claim was harmless.\u201d </em>(George, at p. 709, italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">There are several contrary opinions. In <em>Amato v. City of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 170 F.3d 311, the Second Circuit remanded an excessive force case for a new trial on <em>Monell </em>\u201cto seek symbolic vindication from the municipality as well as the individual official for violation of constitutional rights,\u201d even though the plaintiff\u2019s recovery would be limited to nominal damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 321.) And in <em>Ruvalcaba v. City of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 167 F.3d 514, a plaintiff appealed from the dismissal of his <em>Monell </em>claim after the jury determined he was entitled to $60,400 in compensatory damages because of a police officer\u2019s use of excessive force in making an arrest. The appeals court agreed, holding the arrestee \u201cmay still recover nominal damages for a \u2018separate and distinct [constitutional] wrong\u2019 irrespective of whether he is entitled to actual damages for that wrong.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524.) The court did not identify that \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d wrong, and it did not mention <em>George </em>or attempt to reconcile the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We agree with <em>Jones, George, and Sanchez </em>and disagree with <em>Amato </em>and <em>Ruvalcaba. </em>First, we believe the Supreme Court would follow its own rationale in <em>Heller: </em>Once a plaintiff has been fully compensated, a second trial to establish <em>Monell </em>liability would be \u201cquite beside the point.\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles v. Heller, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 799 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1573].) Why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>litigate the issue of municipal liability in the abstract when the municipality already has accepted it in reality?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Second, a separate <em>Monell </em>trial for nominal damages would be expensive in time and resources to prove (or refute) a widespread pattern or practice of misbehavior. This is particularly true for large urban law enforcement agencies such as the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Moreover, the possibility exists that departments with serious structural problems could use a nominal <em>Monell </em>defense verdict as a clean bill of health, thereby delaying needed reforms.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Third, the expense of <em>Monell </em>pattern or practice litigation would unduly inflate the settlement value of suits like this one. The prospect of a wasteful and protracted <em>Monell </em>trial can be too easily misused to expand the settlement value of such claims. As the concurring judge in <em>Amato </em>observed, \u201cMany thousands of dollars would be expended [on] this one-dollar lawsuit, money that the citizens of Saratoga Springs may judge better spent on a school crossing-guard or a part-time music teacher. These burdens on the court, and on the taxpayers . . . would outweigh\u2014hands down\u2014the benefits of remand that the majority opinion identifies.\u201d <em>(Amato v. City of Saratoga Springs, supra, </em>170 F.3d at p. 323 (conc. opn. of Jacobs, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Fourth, <em>Monell </em>pattern or practice claims raise problems of federalism. For law enforcement, they implicate virtually every aspect of a police department\u2019s operations, including hiring, training, discipline, tactical operations and investigations. The United States Supreme Court has been highly sensitive to \u201cserious federalism concerns, in that it risks constitutionalizing particular . . . requirements that States have themselves elected not to impose.\u201d <em>(Bryan County, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 415 [117 S.Ct. at p. 1394]; see also <em>Collins v. Harker Heights </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 115, 129 [112 S.Ct. 1061, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1070, 117 L.Ed.2d 261] [decisions regarding civil liability standards that \u201cinvolve a host of policy choices . . . must be made by locally elected representatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of Government for the entire country\u201d]; <em>Rizzo v. Goode </em>(1976) 423 U.S. 362, 366 [96 S.Ct. 598, 602, 46 L.Ed.2d 561] [citing an \u201cunwarranted intrusion by the federal judiciary\u201d into state and local discretionary decisions regarding how to handle police misconduct claims].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We see little purpose to an open-ended <em>Monell </em>trial on pattern or practice liability here or most cases. <em>(Sanchez v. City of Riverside, supra, </em>596 F.Supp. at pp. 194-195 [\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against the City allege no wrong not alleged against the police officer or no injury or damages proximately caused thereby different from the injury or damages sought against the police officer defendant\u201d].) Since plaintiffs will be fully compensated by the damage awards they have secured, there is nothing further to litigate because there is nothing further for them to recover. In Judge Hamilton\u2019s words, in \u201ca substantial proportion of the cases asserting <em>Monell </em>claims based on alleged practices or customs, the <em>Monell </em>claims should have little practical significance.\u201d <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>48 DePaul L.Rev. at p. 729.) This is precisely such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We raise two important caveats. Our decision does not apply to situations where the entity has refused to indemnify, nor does it extend to <em>express </em>departmental policies that are unconstitutional. (See, e.g., <em>Blackburn v. Snow </em>(1st Cir. 1985) <em>771 </em>F.2d 556, 571 [municipal liability based on sheriff\u2019s order requiring body cavity strip searches for all county jail visitors].) This leaves unaffected what amounts to the core of <em>Monell: </em>municipal policies or actions by municipal policymakers that are violative of federal law or that direct or authorize deprivations of civil rights. (See <em>Bryan County, supra, </em>520 U.S. at pp. 406-407 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 1389-1390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Such circumstances, however, are not presented in this case, where plaintiffs\u2019 pattern or practice claims involve unrelated instances of misfeasance, malfeasance, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Our conclusion comports with California law on harmless error and nominal damages. <em>(Sill Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>CMAG, Inc. </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 42, 55 [33 Cal.Rptr. 155] [\u201cIn the absence of special circumstances the error would be of no consequence since the law does not regard trifles and courts will not reverse a judgment simply because nominal damages were not awarded\u201d].) In <em>Staples v. Hoefke </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1397 [235 Cal.Rptr. 165], a commercial tenant argued it was entitled to nominal damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>trespass because of sound vibrations from the adjoining premises even though the jury determined such vibrations did not damage its business operations. The court declined to do so, applying the general \u201charmless error\u201d rule that \u201ca judgment will not be reversed for a failure to award nominal damages . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">There are no special circumstances here. Far from supporting an unwieldy <em>Monell </em>pattern or practice claim, public policy sustains dismissal where the public entity has accepted responsibility to pay compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to secure a retrial on a conspiracy theory following the nonsuit by the trial court are without merit. They claim the off-duty deputies engaged in a conspiracy to unlawfully \u201cfail[] to intervene in the criminal acts of assault and battery on plaintiffs\u201d and that all deputies, on- and off-duty, conspired to cover up their initial liability by \u201csuccessfully conceal[ing], or fabricat[ing] so much evidence.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs allege <em>two </em>conspiracies: \u201cOne, to batter the plaintiffs and, two, to lie about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">That is a tall order. While criminal conspiracies involve distinct substantive wrongs, civil conspiracies do not involve separate torts. The doctrine provides a remedial measure for affixing liability to all persons who have \u201cagreed to a common design to commit a wrong.\u201d <em>(Agnew </em>v. <em>Parks </em>(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 756, 762 [343 P.2d 118].)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Because civil conspiracy is so easy to allege, plaintiffs have a weighty burden to prove it. <em>(Hinkle v. City of Clarksburg, W. Va. </em>(4th Cir. 1996) 81 F.3d 416 [affirming summary judgment on cover-up conspiracy allegations].) They must show that each member of the conspiracy acted in concert and came to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful plan, and that one or more of them committed an overt act to further it. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 421.) It is not enough that the conspiring officers knew of an intended wrongful act, they had to agree\u2014expressly or tacitly\u2014to achieve it. Unless there is such a meeting of the minds, \u201c \u2018the independent acts of two or more wrongdoers do not amount to a conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(National Congress P.R. Rights v. City of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1999) 75 F.Supp.2d 154, 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u201cBare\u201d allegations and \u201crank\u201d conjecture do not suffice for a civil conspiracy. <em>(Mahaney v. Warren County </em>(8th Cir. 2000) 206 F.3d 770, 772.) In <em>Hinkle </em>the plaintiffs relied upon evidence that \u201ctwo white males in blue jackets\u201d sneaked into the victim\u2019s apartment the day after a police shooting to support the inference that the defendant police officers conspired to destroy evidence. <em>(Hinkle v. City of Clarksburg, W. Va., supra, </em>81 F.3d at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>422, fn. 3.) The appeals court rejected such speculation as a \u201ctheory without proof,\u201d pointing out that \u201c[t]here is a reason why we do not allow this level of conjecture to determine lawsuits: such adventures of the mind tend to be unreliable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">For a \u201ccover-up\u201d conspiracy, plaintiffs must show the conspirators shared a common goal to intentionally conceal evidence <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Satz </em>(11th Cir. 1998) 137 F.3d 1275, 1278, fn. 7) and that the \u201ccover-up actually rendered all state court remedies ineffective.\u201d <em>(Delew </em>v. <em>Wagner </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 143 F.3d 1219, 1223.) The mere failure to investigate fully does not constitute a federal civil rights violation. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>137 F.3d at p. 1278, fn. 7; see also <em>Feist v. Simonson </em>(D.Minn. 1999) 36 F.Supp.2d 1136 [inadequate evidence as matter of law to sustain conspiracy allegation that police officers conspired to \u201csabotage\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights claims, notwithstanding minor variations in police reports and testimonial discrepancies by police officers].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Plaintiffs have fallen short of their burden of proof to establish a prima facie case of either of their two conspiracies. There is no evidence of a meeting of the minds among the alleged conspirators, either to batter plaintiffs or to intentionally cover up the attacks. There is no proof that defendants have rendered ineffective plaintiffs\u2019 state court remedies. To the contrary, the jury awarded money damages to both of them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Plaintiffs specifically point to testimony regarding injuries allegedly inflicted upon Bernal by \u201cthe fellow with the ponytail and short pants\u201d (whom they call \u201cBoots\u201d after his footwear) who got off \u201cscot-free\u201d and was \u201cnever held to answer for his actions.\u201d They further claim that the identity of the \u201celusive \u2018Boots\u2019 \u201d was \u201cconcealed by his fellow deputies and partygoers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We are totally in the dark about \u201cBoots\u201d and about those others who conspired to kick him out of the picture. Who was this elusive (if not mythic) man? A party attendee? Meddling passerby? Rival gang member out for revenge? If there is any evidence to sustain conspiracy allegations regarding Boots\u2019s presence or absence (or defendants\u2019 responsibility for either), plaintiffs do not disclose it. We will not scour the record for facts that may not exist except in an <em>X-Files </em>episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 response is that their inability to prove anything about \u201cBoots\u201d only shows the conspiracy\u2019s success: \u201cThere\u2019s witnesses suppressed. We\u2019ll never know about them. . . . [T]hey continue to suppress that evidence . . . so we don\u2019t have a strong case as we would have liked . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">This is a mind-boggling concept (the bigger the conspiracy, the less the proof), one worthy of Oliver Stone. The history of conspiracy, it has been observed, evidences the \u201c \u2018tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Krulewitch v.

Tort law deals with the known or the should have known; it does not dwell in the realm of the unknown or the never-can-be-known. (See, e.g., <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v.

As a result of the lawsuit, the police officer was disciplined and the department changed its official policy to prohibit closed-fist strikes to the face. <em>Wilcox </em>affirmed the trial court\u2019s authority to make discretionary determinations of the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s success: \u201cWe cannot say in these circumstances that the District Court\u2019s finding . . . was clearly erroneous. Predictably, Wilcox argued that it did result in an improved policy, while the City argued that it did not. The District Court was free, within the bounds of the clearly erroneous standard, to find that the lawsuit did benefit the police department.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 556.) <em>Wilcox </em>underscores the discretion vested in the trial court to make such determinations\u2014the outcomes of which will inevitably vary with the decision maker. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 555.)

The determination whether the opportunity to vindicate the reputation of the Department would offset the economic costs is one for these defendants to make.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But, as the concurring judge pointed out, such a resolution would be nonsensical from a policy standpoint since \u201cthe trivial amount at issue in the <em>Monell </em>trial virtually assures that a loss by the municipality would have no collateral estoppel effect.

Plaintiffs have not challenged the trial court\u2019s determination that Doyle and Higa (the off-duty deputies) were acting as civilians during the fight and not as police officers (thereby forestalling any duty to intervene), and that DeKruif and Billings (the on-duty deputies) arrived after the fight was virtually over, making them powerless to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
