The trial court denied this claim, finding that the children of Shirley Ann Thompson had received or suffered neither bodily injury nor property damage as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">While we agree that any claim they may have to \"property damage\" has been defined out of the policy because none of the property loss they have experienced can be considered \"tangible\" as that term has meaning as a word of art in property law, we reverse this case because we find that the policy definition of \"bodily injury\" has actually picked up and employed some of the very words that the legislature used when it enacted R.C. 2125.02 (B)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In our view, the language of exclusion at page 23 of the policy under \"losses we do not cover\" excluding coverage for bodily injury to an insured person or property damage to property owned an insured person, does not apply to the case at bar because by this action is not for the bodily injury of Shirley Ann Thompson nor damage to the property of Shirley Ann Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Our judgment is not in conflict with that of the Court of Appeals for Clark County in <em>Progressive Casualty Ins Co. v. William R. Bolin </em>(Oct. 3, 1988), Clark App. No. 2467, unreported, because the policy provisions in that case were entirely different from those in the case at bar. The definition of bodily injury is entirely different in that case. The words in the definition of bodily injury in that case do not include the words employed by the definition in this casa</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and a final judgment is here entered declaring that Allstate Insurance Company on its Allstate deluxe homeowner's policy issued to Edward Thompson and Shirley Ann Thompson has an obligation to defend and indemnify Edward Thompson against the wrongful death claims brought against him by the children of Shirley Ann Thompson.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-9\">HOFFMAN, J., and GWIN, J., concur</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
