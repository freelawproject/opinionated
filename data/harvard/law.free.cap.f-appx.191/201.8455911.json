Can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>non appeals. Her attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but requesting that we review the imposition of sentence. Cannon was advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file such a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Cannon\u2019s admitted violations justified revocation of her supervised release. Further, the district court properly calculated Cannon\u2019s guidelines range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment, and imposed a three-month term, well below the applicable statutory maximum. Nothing in the record suggests any error on the part of the district court, and we conclude the sentence imposed was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
