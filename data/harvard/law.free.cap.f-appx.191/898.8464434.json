Irizzary argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to modify his sentence because Amendments 598 and 599, which altered the language of Application Notes 1 and 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, are retroactive and show that he was double-punished for the discharge of a firearm while committing a robbery and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). We review <em>de novo </em>a double-counting claim. <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1310 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that has been subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Before granting a sentence modification, however, a district court must consider the factors set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, and evaluate whether such a reduction is \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, the law permits, but does not require, a district court to resentence a defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255 (11th Cir.1997). Moreover, only amendments listed in \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) may be applied retroactively through a 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Amendment 598 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). It thus may not be applied retroactively. Therefore, the district court correctly refused to apply Amendment 598 to Irizzary.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Amendment 599 may be applied retroactively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (Nov. 2000). Amendment 599 affects the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 and provides that if a sentence under this guideline (i.e., a 60-month mandatory sentence as required by 18 U.S.C \u00a7 924(c) for use of a firearm) is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, the sentencing court may not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G-App. C, amend. 599 (Nov.2000). Amendment 599 further provides that a sentence under \u00a7 2K2.4 accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable as relevant conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">At the time Irizzary was sentenced in 1992, Amendment 489 had just changed application note 2 to \u00a7 2K2.4 to the version that appeared in the sentencing guidelines prior to Amendment 599. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 489 (Nov.1993). Amendment 489 eliminated the subtraction formula from the previous version of the guidelines, and allowed the district court to upwardly depart to the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there been no conviction under \u00a7 924(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In 1993, Application Note 2 provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm (e.g., \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(F) (Robbery)) is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">In a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraph may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c), or \u00a7 929(a), produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c), or \u00a7 929(a) (i.e., the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancement for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c), or \u00a7 929(a) does not result in a decrease in total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c), or \u00a7 929(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (Nov. 1993). In 2000, Application Note 2 stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AT1\">If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">[\u2022\u25a0\u2022]</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">In a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraphs may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c) or \u00a7 929(a), produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c) or \u00a7 929(a) <em>(ie., </em>the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c) or \u00a7 929(a) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), \u00a7 924(c) or \u00a7 929(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (Nov. 2000). In 2002, Amendment 642 redesignated Application Note 2 as Application Note 4. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 642 (Nov. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">The purpose of Amendment 599 is merely \u201cto clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 599 (Nov.2000), \u201cReason for Amendment.\u201d Irizzary did not receive a weapons enhancement to his offense level; rather, the district court departed upward as suggested in application note 2. The final paragraph of application note 2 was not changed by Amendment 599. Thus, after Amendment 599, district courts are still permitted to depart upward to the maximum guideline range that would have resulted had there been no conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (Nov. 2000). Because Irizzary received an upward departure, and not a weapons enhancement, Amendment 599 does not apply to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Irizzary\u2019s sentence was enhanced pursuant to an upward departure based on Amendment 489. Amendment 599 does not affect these changes to the guidelines made by Amendment 489. Thus, Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>ment 599 does not apply to Irizzary. The district court did not err in refusing to apply this Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AHOJ\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-19\">. Irizzary's other arguments on appeal are rejected without need for further discussion. Irizzary's request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
