INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We will uphold the finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the IJ\u2019s decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Our review of the record reveals that the IJ\u2019s decision was substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez, 78 </em>F.3d at 197. As determined by the IJ, other than the affidavits of his brothers, Ali failed to produce documentary evidence supporting his claims that he was (1) forced to pay bribes, (2) targeted for writing and publishing anti-government articles, (3) arrested by the police, and (4) hospitalized for injuries inflicted by government agents. Ali also failed to establish by objective evidence that he was a member of the Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM). Accordingly, even if members of MQM still face persecution, Ali has not demonstrated that he would be targeted as a member of that group.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">Moreover, accepting Ali\u2019s testimony at face value, he further fails to demonstrate that the alleged isolated incidents of mistreatment establish a \u201cclear probability\u201d that he would be persecuted upon his return to Pakistan. This court has held that similar allegations of mistreatment do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir.1978). Ali also admitted that his mother has remained in the same neighborhood without incident. Because the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion, <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez, 78 </em>F.3d at 197, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
