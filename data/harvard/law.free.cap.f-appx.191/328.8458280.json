We granted Walker a certificate of appealability (COA) on his claims that (1) his guilty plea was rendered involuntary by his attorney\u2019s having allegedly promised Walker that he would receive a minimal prison sentence and (2) the trial court violated his due process rights by failing to provide him an opportunity to challenge information contained in his presentence report (PSR). In the order granting COA, we emphasized that significant portions of the state-court records appeared to be missing, and directed the parties to brief the \u201ceffect of the absence of [those] records in connection with these [two substantive] claims and whether an evidentiary hearing should have been held to remedy this problem.\u201d We also directed the parties to address whether Walker\u2019s due-process claim was procedurally defaulted. Thereafter, the respondent provided us with all state-court materials that are pertinent to the disposition of this case. In addition, Walker filed a pro se reply brief and a pleading that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>interpret as a motion to file the reply brief out of time. We grant that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Federal habeas relief may not be granted on any claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court,\u201d unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Walker insists that, prior to his rearraignment, he was told by his attorney that if he pleaded guilty, he would be subject to a sentence of only one to two years in prison. This was based on the attorney\u2019s determination that Walker\u2019s record of criminal arrests and convictions was \u201cspotless.\u201d The PSR, however, reflected that Walker had two prior burglary convictions in other states, which resulted in the trial court\u2019s imposition of the more severe sentence. Federal constitutional law requires that, before it accepts a guilty plea, the trial court must ensure that the defendant \u201c \u2018has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Whitley, </em>933 F.2d 325, 329 (5th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)). \u201cWhen a defendant pleads guilty on the basis of a promise by his defense attorney or the prosecutor ... breach of that promise taints the voluntariness of his plea.\u201d <em>Davis v. Butler, </em>825 F.2d 892, 894 (5th Cir.1987). When a defendant can show that the court, the prosecutor, or defendant\u2019s counsel induced the guilty plea by \u201c \u2018clearly and unequivocally <em>guaranteeing </em>a lesser sentence or some other specific leniency,\u2019 \u201d the defendant may show that his guilty plea was involuntarily entered. <em>See Bond v. Dretke, </em>384 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.2004) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Amaya, </em>111 F.3d 386, 388-89 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Although Walker has faulted his attorney for allegedly advising him to plead guilty on the ground that his criminal history was \u201cspotless,\u201d the transcripts of the hearing on Walker\u2019s November 16, 1998 pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his November 18,1998 sentencing proceeding reflect that Walker himself misled his attorney about his criminal history. We surmise that Walker hoped that his prior convictions would not be discovered during the presentence investigation, and that he moved to withdraw his plea only after his criminal background was revealed. Moreover, the transcripts of those hearings do not support Walker\u2019s allegation that his attorney had \u201cpromised\u201d that he would receive a sentence of only one to two years. Furthermore, Walker\u2019s rearraignment transcript reflects that he understood that he faced a prison sentence of up to 24 years. Finally, Walker acknowledged that he received the benefit of his plea bargain in the State\u2019s agreement to consolidate six burglary charges into two counts. Walker\u2019s involuntary-guilty-plea claim is refuted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Walker\u2019s apparently unexhausted due-process claim regarding sentencing should not have been considered procedurally defaulted because the respondent expressly waived a contention that Walker had failed to exhaust state remedies. <em>See Bledsue v. Johnson, </em>188 F.3d 250, 254-55 (5th Cir.1999). Nonetheless, the newly provided state-court materials reflect that this claim, too, is not supported by the record. Walker\u2019s assertion that he was denied an opportunity to challenge the information in his PSR is contradicted by the transcripts of the November 16 and 18, 1998, proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT Walker\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of time, and we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
