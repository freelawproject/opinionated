The IJ denied Aluko\u2019s application for cancellation of removal because Aluko had not shown that his removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his family. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). This court reviews the order of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it influenced the <em>determination of </em>the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">Aluko argues that the IJ erred by making an unqualified medical judgment on the seriousness of his son\u2019s breathing difficulties. He argues that the IJ\u2019s decision on this issue was not discretionary and may therefore be reviewed by this court despite the jurisdiction stripping provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Aluko is essentially challenging the weight the IJ, in his discretion, accorded the evidence of Aluko\u2019s son\u2019s health in holding that Aluko\u2019s family would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. We lack jurisdiction to review such discretionary determinations. <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Aluko\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">Aluko also contends that by deciding his case without oral argument and not proffering a reason for denying his request for oral argument, the BIA violated his due process rights. Aluko has not shown any constitutional right to appeal, much less to oral argument. As he acknowledges, the decision whether to grant oral argument is within the BIA\u2019s discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-23\">Finally, Aluko argues that the BIA violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause by summarily affirming the decision of the IJ. Aluko is incorrect in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>assertion that the BIA employed its summary affirmance procedure to affirm the result reached by the IJ. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(\u201cAffirmanee without opinion\u201d). Instead, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and added a discussion of the new evidence submitted by Aluko. This court has upheld that procedure. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.55, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
