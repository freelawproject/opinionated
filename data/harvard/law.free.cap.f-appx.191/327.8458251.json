Cardona also moves for appointment of counsel. Cardona pursued relief in parallel actions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and Ms actions were consolidated in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Cardona argues that the district court erred by disposing of his <em>Bivens </em>claims against Assistant U.S. Attorney Arrambide and U.S. Marshal Mossman as time-barred because his amended complaint did not relate back to Ms initial complamt. Cardona contends that he was entitled to eqrntable tolling and that his amended complaint should have related back to his mitial complaint. He argues as to his <em>Bivens </em>and \u00a7 1983 actions that the restrictions placed on his visitation, correspondence, and telephone access violated his constitutional rights and that the use of chemical agents violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The district court erred by disposing of the <em>Bivens </em>claims against Arrambide and Mossman as time-barred because Cardona\u2019s amended complaint did not relate back to Ms imtial complaint. <em>See Holmes v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 1563, 1566 (5th Cir.1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). Cardona\u2019s IFP motion therefore is granted. However, all of Cardona\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims agamst Arrambide and Mossman are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on the alternative <em>Heck </em>basis. <em>See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">To the extent that Cardona\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims regarding the restrictions placed upon him are intertwined with his contention that he was unable to prepare and present an adequate defense, those claims are barred by <em>Heck. See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189-90 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Moreover, Cardona alleges no specific facts to support his legal arguments regarding his \u00a7 1983 claims. He has failed to brief those issues for this court\u2019s consideration. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Finally, Cardona has not shown exceptional circumstances requiring the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
