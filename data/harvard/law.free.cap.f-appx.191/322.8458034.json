He argues that (1) his North Carolina felony conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute did not constitute a \u201cfelony drug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) (2004); (2) the district court plainly erred in assessing two criminal history points for two prior sentences pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c); and (3) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">On de novo review, <em>see United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005), we hold that the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) enhancement because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Cedillos\u2019 North Carolina conviction was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and was therefore a \u201cfelony.\u201d <em>See United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">On plain error review, we hold that although the district court clearly erred in assessing two criminal history points pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for sentences imposed more than 10 years prior to the instant offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(c), comment. (n.3), Cedillos has failed to carry his burden of establishing that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 363-64. The district court could, on remand, impose the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003). Alternatively, it is not reasonably probable that, but for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines, Cedillos would have received a lesser sentence because the correct and incorrect guideline ranges overlap and he did not receive a sentence substantially greater than would have otherwise been permitted. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005); <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Finally, Cedillos\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cedillos contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Cedillos properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
