A Social Security claimant must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking review in federal court. <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 107, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900(a)(5), (b), 416.1400(a)(5), (b); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (providing for judicial review of \u201cfinal\u201d administrative decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">There is no dispute that Caesar\u2019s claim was before a Social Security Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) when she filed the instant action, and it apparently still is pending. Caesar nonetheless contends that the order from the Social Security Appeals Council remanding to the ALJ is appealable as a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.984(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-24\">That regulation pertains to Appeals Council action following a remand from federal court and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-25\">If the Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction, it will make a new, independent decision based on its consideration of the entire record affirming, modifying, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>reversing the decision of the administrative law judge <em>or </em>remand the case to an administrative law judge for further proceedings, including a new decision. <em>The new decision of the Appeals Council is the final decision of the Commissioner after remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.984(b)(3) (emphasis added). Caesar contends that the final sentence of subsection (b)(3) means literally that the decision of the Appeal Council is \u201cfinal\u201d even though the decision merely remands to the ALJ for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We reject Caesar\u2019s proposed reading of the regulation, because doing so would produce \u201can absurd result in clear violation of the intent of the drafters\u201d in the context of exhaustion requirements. <em>See KCMC, Inc. v. F.C.C., </em>600 F.2d 546, 549 (5th Cir.1979). The phrase \u201cnew decision of the Appeals Council\u201d in the final sentence refers only to the council's first alternative of making of its own \u201cnew, independent decision,\u201d not its second alternative of remanding for further consideration by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
