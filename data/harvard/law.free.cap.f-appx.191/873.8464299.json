We deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Sidhwani, a native and citizen of Pakistan, was admitted to the United States in May of 1999 as a nonimmigrant, with authorization to remain until November 29th of that year. In February of 2003, he was issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) that charged him with being removable for remaining in the United States beyond his authorization, and for failing to maintain or comply with the conditions of the nonimmigrant status under which he was admitted, all in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), (C)(i). At a May 2003 hearing, Sidhwani conceded all allegations against him in the NTA, except for an allegation of unauthorized employment. However, he later requested a continuance of his removal hearing because he had a pending application for labor certification. An IJ denied the request, finding that the pending application for labor certification did not constitute good cause for a continuance, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29, because adjustment of status relief was speculative and because granting relief would reward those who did not seek to have their prospective employer obtain a visa for them before their arrival. On January 29, 2004, the IJ granted Sidhwani\u2019s request for voluntary departure in lieu of removal, with a departure deadline of March 29, 2004, and imposed an alternate order of removal to Pakistan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">Sidhwani did not appeal the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, but rather filed a motion to reopen with the IJ on March 9, 2005, almost a year after his voluntary departure deadline had passed. He argued that: (1) the denial of his request for a continuance (based upon the pending labor certification) was improper; (2) he had new relief available in the form of a pending I-140 petition filed on his behalf; and (3) the addition of INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), which allows certain aliens physically present in the United States to apply for adjustment of status based, <em>inter alia, </em>on an application for labor certification, was an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d excusing his failure to depart voluntarily. The government opposed Sidhwani\u2019s motion, arguing that it was untimely and filed for no reason other than to frustrate his removal, and that adjustment of status relief was speculative because Sidhwani\u2019s 1-140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>petition was merely pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government also argued that Sidhwani had no regard for U.S. immigration laws, because he had overstayed his original visa, engaged in unauthorized employment, failed to post a bond, and stayed beyond his voluntary departure date.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The IJ issued a written order denying the motion to reopen, explaining that: (1) Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline for such motions, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1); (2) Sidhwani had failed to leave the United States voluntarily by his departure date, and was therefore ineligible for adjustment of status relief for 10 years, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(d)(l)(B); <em>In re Shaar, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 541, 1996 WL 426889 (BIA 1996) (en banc); (3) the government opposed the motion to reopen; and (4) Sidhwani had failed to present exceptional circumstances warranting relief, <em>see In re J-J-, 21 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 976, 984, 1997 WL 434418 (BIA 1997) (en banc). Although Sidhwani invoked <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 2002 WL 393173 (BIA 2002) (en banc) (explaining that a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status, pending approval of an 1-130 visa petition, may be granted provided that certain criteria are met), the IJ distinguished <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>on the grounds that the motion to reopen in that case was timely filed, and the case involved an adjustment of status based on marriage, not employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Sidhwani appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred in denying his motions for a continuance and to reopen, because: (1) Sidhwani had demonstrated a prima facie case for relief; (2) INA \u00a7 245(i) allows the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition or labor certification application filed before April 30, 2001, to apply for an adjustment of status without leaving the United States; (3) <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>shows that removal proceedings can be reopened where an alien shows he is eligible for an adjustment of status; and (4) under <em>Azarte v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir.2005), the voluntary departure period can be tolled while a motion to reopen is pending. On November 2, 2005, the BIA dismissed Sidhwani\u2019s appeal for several reasons. First, the BIA found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Sidhwani\u2019s appeal regarding the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance, because Sidhwani had failed to appeal that decision. Second, the BIA declined to apply <em>Azarte </em>outside the Ninth Circuit, and noted that, unlike the petitioner in <em>Azarte, </em>Sidhwani had not filed his motion to reopen <em>during </em>his voluntary departure period. <em>See Azarte, </em>394 F.3d at 1289. Finally, the BIA stated it would not address Sidhwani\u2019s claim that <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>should extend beyond family-based visa petitions to labor-based visa petitions. The IJ\u2019s denial of Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA concluded, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Several weeks later, Sidhwani filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the denial of Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen. He argued that the BIA had erred in refusing to address his claim that <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>should apply to labor-based visa petitions, and in declining to apply <em>Azarte </em>without sufficient explanation. Sidhwani emphasized that the record contained no evidence that he was admonished by an IJ for failing to depart voluntarily, and requested that the BIA \u201cexercise its equitable tolling power and reinstate the voluntary departure or extend it pursuant to its regulatory and statutory power.... \u201d The BIA denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>motion to reconsider, stating that Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen had been found untimely filed by the IJ, and that under Eleventh Circuit law, the filing deadline for a motion to reopen under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The BIA also reaffirmed its earlier refusal to apply <em>Azarte, </em>and stated that it (the BIA) had \u201cno authority to grant extensions of voluntary departure,\u201d citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.57. Sidhwani now petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decisions affirming the denial of his motion to reopen and denying his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">On appeal, Sidhwani contends that the BIA erred because: (1) the BIA should have considered INA \u00a7 245\u00a9 an exception to the 90-day time limit on the filing of motions to reopen; (2) the BIA should have remanded the case for a factual determination on whether it presented extraordinary circumstances warranting reopening; and (3) the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen Sidhwani\u2019s case deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the denial of motions to reopen and for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (motion to reopen); <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2003) (motion to reconsider). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (internal quotes and citation omitted). To the extent Sidhwani claims the BIA\u2019s actions deprived him of due process, however, our review is de novo. <em>See Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">\u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of a deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (internal quotes and citation omitted). An alien may file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(A), (B) (2004); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B) (2005). Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the statute and regulations, \u201cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i) (2004) ; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (2005); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(e)(2), 1003.23(b) (2005) . As for a motion to reconsider filed with the BIA, it must, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order\u201d and \u201cbe supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (2005); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">In the instant case, the record indicates that the IJ, when granting Sidhwani\u2019s request for voluntary departure with a deadline of March 29, 2004, also entered an alternate order of removal to Pakistan. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(d) (2004). Sidhwani does not dispute that this order of removal became final upon the overstay of his voluntary departure period. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 241.1(f) (2004), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1241.1(f) (2005). Nor does he dispute that he filed his motion to reopen far outside the 90-day limit, on March 9, 2005, and that the motion does not fall within any listed exception. Rather, Sidhwani contends that the 90-day limitation should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>not apply because his failure to depart was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d and was merely due to the fact that he seeking to achieve an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). He notes that the Ninth and Second Circuits have applied equitable tolling to the 90-day limit on filing a motion to reopen before the BIA. <em>See SocopGonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1190 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (\u201c[W]e conclude that the filing deadline for motions to reopen is subject to equitable tolling.\u201d); <em>Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cBecause there is no evidence that Congress intended to enact a jurisdictional bar to untimely motions to reopen, the limitations period for such motions may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d). In <em>Abdi, </em>however, this Circuit held that the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied a petitioner\u2019s untimely motion to reopen, because the 90-day limit was \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and ... not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d 430 F.3d at 1150. Indeed, the BIA recognized as much in its opinion denying Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reconsider the decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Although Sidhwani also claims that his case presents \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d he concedes that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), which is applicable to his case, eliminated that exception to the imposition of certain penalties on an alien who overstays his voluntary departure deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (describing civil penalties imposed on an alien who fails to depart voluntarily by his deadline); <em>Ugokwe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 1325, 1329 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIIRIRA specifically excised statutory language in the INA that stated that \u2018any alien allowed to depart voluntarily ... who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than <em>because of exceptional circumstances, </em>shall not be eligible for ... relief ....\u2019\u201d) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(2)(A) (1994)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given our holding in <em>Abdi, </em>the BIA did not abuse its discretion when, in the course of affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen, and denying his motion to reconsider, the BIA did not toll the 90-day limit on a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Sidhwani also contends that the BIA should have remanded his case for a factual determination on whether his case presented \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting reopening, because regulations state that the BIA \u201cwill not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Sidhwani does not identify the alleged \u201cfact-finding\u201d of which he complains, however, and this argument therefore fails to persuade.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Finally, Sidhwani claims that the BIA violated his due process rights by failing to address why the 90-day time limit on motions to reopen should not be equitably tolled, in that he \u201ccould not help that his case was approved\u201d after the 90-day limit on the fihng of a motion to reopen had passed. As explained above, however, the BIA noted in its opinion denying Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reconsider that the deadline for fifing a motion to reopen is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d thereby indicating that equitable tolling was unavailable. <em>See Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. Even if the BIA had not done so, Sidhwani still would not have established a due process violation. \u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1341-42. Generally, an IJ and the BIA have discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen\u2014and may deny the motion even if the moving party has made a prima facie case for relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a); 1003.23(b)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the decision to adjust an alien\u2019s status ultimately lies within the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). \u201c[T]he failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Sidhwani filed his motion to reopen after the mandatory and jurisdictional 90-day time limitation for doing so had expired, and he did not demonstrate in his motion for reconsideration that the BIA had committed an error of law or fact in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision denying Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen, or in denying his subsequent motion for reconsideration. Nor did the BIA\u2019s actions deprive Sidhwani of due process. Accordingly, we deny his petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">. Although the record is unclear, it appears that Sidhwani may have again requested a continuance at the hearing on January 29, 2004, because he then had an 1-140 employment-based visa petition pending. According to Sidhwani, the request was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. In an emergency motion for a stay of removal pending adjudication of the motion to reopen, however, Sidhwani attached a document indicating that his 1-140 petition had been approved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-4\">. Sidhwani further claims that the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), which authorize an adjustment of status for certain aliens physically present in the United States, \"trump\u201d the penalties imposed under \u00a7 1229c(d), including a 10-year period of ineligibility for relief. We need not reach the merits of this claim, because the untimeliness of Sidhwani\u2019s motion to reopen provides sufficient support for the BIA's decisions affirming the IJ and denying Sidhwani\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Notably, <em>Ugokwe </em>holds that \"the <em>timely </em>filing of a motion to reopen tolls the period of voluntary departure pending the resolution of the motion to reopen.\u201d 453 F.3d at 1331 (emphasis added). Unlike the petitioner in <em>Ugokwe, </em>Sidhwani did not file a <em>timely </em>motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. Sidhwani further asserts that a three-member BIA panel should have convened to decide the appeal on his motion to reopen (which was disposed of by a single BIA member), but does not explain why. We reject this conclusory assertion, and note we have previously held that \"under the regulations, no entitlement to a full opinion by the BIA exists.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>see </em>8C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">. Likewise, the decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider is within the BIA\u2019s discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
