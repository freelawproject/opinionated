Johnson seeks to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to raise a constitutional issue under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court denied leave to amend but granted Johnson a certificate of appealability on the issue whether he should be permitted to raise a claim under <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Johnson argues that the court abused its discretion by denying him leave to amend. He asserts that the court committed error under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by applying mandatory sentencing guidelines to enhance his sentence based on facts neither admitted nor found by a jury and that <em>Booker </em>applies retroactively to his case. Johnson\u2019s arguments concerning <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2948, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2006) (No. 05-1504); <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2005). The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
