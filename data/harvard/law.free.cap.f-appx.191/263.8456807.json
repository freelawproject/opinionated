The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court also denied Hernandez\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for leave to file a second amended complaint, for sanctions against defense counsel, and to disqualify the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Hernandez asserts that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his First Amendment claims. Hernandez claimed that the defendants violated his rights under the First Amendment by \u201cviolating\u201d his e-mail account in a way that restricted his access to his graduate program\u2019s listserv. He conceded in the amended complaint that he did not know who made the alleged change to his email account or how it was done. The conclusory allegations do not state a claim for relief. <em>See Chiras v. Miller, </em>432 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Next Hernandez asserts that the district court erred by denying his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint after the magistrate judge determined that his case should be dismissed. The district court denied the motion on the basis that Hernandez had failed to take advantage of a previous opportunity to amend his complaint. The court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Quintanilla v. Texas Television Inc., </em>139 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Hernandez also argues that the district court erred in refusing to appoint counsel. The district court considered each of the four factors listed in <em>Jackson v. Dallas Police Department, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261-62 (5th Cir.1986), for determining whether appointment of counsel is appropriate. It concluded (1) the case was not complex; (2) Hernandez had not shown he was unable to present his claims; (3) he seemed capable of understanding the federal rules governing discovery; and (4) he failed to show that the case would present a large amount of conflicting testimony, and his admission into graduate school reflected his intellectual abilities. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Next Hernandez asserts that the district court erred in faffing to order the magistrate judge to answer Hernandez\u2019s motion to disqualify him. This issue is frivolous; there is no requirement that the magistrate judge respond to a motion for disqualification. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455; <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 541-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Moreover, the district court ruled on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">In addition, Hernandez argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for sanctions against the defense attorneys under Rule 11. He asserts that the court erred in faffing to investigate and adequately explain whether sanctions were proper. Due to the nature of the outlandish accusations in Hernandez\u2019s motion, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Friends for Am. Free Enter. Ass\u2019n v. Wal-Mart, </em>284 F.3d 575, 577-78 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Finally, Hernandez asserts two other issues in the Statement of Issues in his brief that he does not include in the body of the brief: that the district court erred in failing to consider documents attached to his complaint in ruling on the 12(b)(6) motion and that the court erred in limiting discovery and failing to supervise a pre-trial conference. Hernandez waived these issues by his failure to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
