He argues that the district court lacked authority to enhance his sentence because the Information and Amended Information filed by the Government did not satisfy the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-20\">For the first time on appeal, Parra challenges the Information by arguing that the Government failed to properly file and serve the document. Because Parra did not challenge the Information in the district court on the basis he now asserts, his argument is subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 161-62 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-21\">A review of the rearraignment transcript indicates that the Government filed and served the Information prior to the entry of Parra\u2019s guilty plea, as required by \u00a7 851. Additionally, although the Information identified the wrong venue for the prior conviction, the record establishes that Parra was not misled by the erroneous venue designation. <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1028 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the error does not negate the notice provided by the Information. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">Parra has not established plain error with regard to the sufficiency of the Information. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Because the original Information filed in this case was sufficient under \u00a7 851, it is not necessary to address Parra\u2019s arguments regarding the sufficiency of the Amended Information. The district court did not lack authority to impose the enhanced sentence. <em>See Steen, </em>55 F.3d at 1025. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
