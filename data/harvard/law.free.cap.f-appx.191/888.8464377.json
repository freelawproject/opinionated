They entered the United States in New York in February 2000 as non-immigrant visitors for pleasure with authorization to stay for a period not to exceed six months. After arriving in New York, they worked there for a time and then moved to Davie, Florida. In June 2001, they were married and Zapata filed an application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-24\">Because Petitioners overstayed their six-month authorization, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), on August 15, 2002, served them with a Notice to Appear, charging them with remaining in the United States without authorization. Petitioners thereafter appeared before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), admitted the allegations of the Notice to Appear and conceded removability. At a subsequent asylum hearing, the IJ considered Zapata\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>asylum application together with his request for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Zapata conceded that his asylum application was untimely and attempted to excuse the filing delay by explaining that he had suffered some emotional problems during his first year in the United States. The IJ found the excuse insufficient, and dismissed the asylum application as untimely. Then, after considering Zapata\u2019s case, based mainly on Zapata\u2019s testimony, for withholding of removal and CAT protection, the IJ stated that had Zapata\u2019s asylum application been timely, he would have denied it on the merits because Zapata failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Since Zapata failed to make out a case for asylum, the IJ denied his request for withholding of removal and CAT protection\u2014which required a showing significantly greater than that required for asylum\u2014and ordered Petitioners\u2019 removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Petitioners appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA affirmed, agreeing with the IJ that Zapata\u2019s asylum application was untimely and inexcusable and that Petitioners had failed to establish a basis for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT. Petitioners now seek review in this court. We consider first the question of the timeliness of Zapata\u2019s asylum application, then the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.... \u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests [this] Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Further, the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, does not change this jurisdictional rule. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that we \u201ccannot review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of [petitioner\u2019s] asylum claim, even considering the changes in the Real ID Act\u201d because \u201c[t]he timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the Real ID Act\u2019s changes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Because we lack the authority to review the determination that an asylum application is untimely, the portion of the instant petition seeking review of Zapata\u2019s claim for asylum is dismissed. We consider now whether Petitioners should have been granted withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Petitioners contend that Zapata\u2019s testimony demonstrated that he had suffered past persecution by the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (\u201cFARC\u201d) due to the threats made against him because he campaigned for a Liberal Party candidate. They contend that because it is welldocumented that Colombia is \u201csaturated\u201d by the FARC, Zapata was entitled to a presumption that his life would be threatened upon his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">We \u201creview only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA expressly agreed with the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both decisions. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions are based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the [IJ]\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s [and the IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien establishes that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or, as Petitioners contend here, political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Additionally, an alien may receive withholding of removal based on an imputed political opinion not actually held by the alien. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir. 2004) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal based on persecution by a guerilla group on account of a political opinion, [petitioner] must establish that the guerillas persecuted [him] or will seek to persecute [him] in the future because of her actual or imputed political opinion.\u201d). The burden of proof is on the alien to show his eligibility for withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can establish, with specific and credible evidence: (1) a past threat to life or freedom through proof of past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) a future threat to life or freedom if it \u201cis more likely than not\u201d that the protected ground will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2). If an alien establishes past persecution, he is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution, unless the government can rebut the presumption with evidence of changed circumstances in the alien\u2019s country, or that the alien could relocate within his country and that it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). If, however, an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future threat to life or freedom by showing that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution on the basis of the protected ground, and he could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">\u201c \u2018[Persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Zapata failed to meet his burden of showing that he more likely than not would suffer persecution upon returning to Colombia. The candidate for whom Zapata had campaigned was killed in 1999, and he and his family thereafter lived in Columbia unharmed for eight months. Zapata\u2019s only evidence of persecution was his connection with that candidate. The candidate\u2019s death eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>that connection and thus the basis for the alleged persecution. We therefore deny the instant petition with respect to Petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">PETITION DISMISSED, IN PART; DENIED, IN PART</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
