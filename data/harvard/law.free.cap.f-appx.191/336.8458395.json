In his complaint, he sought equitable and monetary relief for alleged violations of his constitutional rights and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l et seq. White alleged that the appellees restricted his right to free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, White is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). White\u2019s motion for IFP is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The district court concluded that the rule announced in <em>Gillespie v. Crawford, </em>858 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc), required that White\u2019s claims be dismissed since they dealt with conditions of confinement at Parchman. This conclusion was correct insofar as it concerned White\u2019s claims for equitable relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1102-03. Moreover, White\u2019s transfer off the Parchman Unit mooted such claims. <em>See Biliski v. Harborth, </em>55 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, this portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">However, White is not seeking equitable relief only, but is also seeking compensatory and punitive damages. To the extent that the district court dismissed such claims pursuant to <em>Gillespie, </em>this was error. Also, the district court failed to address White\u2019s claim that the appellees\u2019 failure to accommodate his religious practices and rituals violated RLUIPA. Whether the facts ultimately will prove such a claim is not a question to be answered at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of White\u2019s claims for monetary relief and relief under RLUIPA is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">MOTION FOR IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqU\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
