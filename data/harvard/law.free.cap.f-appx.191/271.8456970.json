A certificate of appealability was granted by this court on the issue whether \u201ccounsel rendered ineffective assistance, which caused [Bramlett] to stand trial rather than plead guilty, by failing to advise him of his statutory maximum sentencing exposure.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bramlett, </em>No. 04-20367 (5th Cir. Nov. 3, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Resolution of Bramlett\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim turns on a factual issue, namely, whether his trial counsel informed him of the statutory maximum sentence. The district court has made no factual findings with regard to this issue. This court should not make that factual assessment in the first instance. <em>See United States v. Birdwell, </em>887 F.2d 643, 645 (5th Cir.1989). Rather, the better approach is to have the district court conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>412 F.3d 577, 582 (5th Cir. 2005). An evidentiary hearing would confirm or dispel Bramlett\u2019s allegation that his attorney did not advise him of the statutory maximum applicable in his case. The remand would also \u201callow the district court to develop a complete record, make appropriate fact findings, and grant relief in the first instance if evidence supports [Bramlett]\u2019s contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Bramlett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is REVERSED and the matter is REMANDED for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
