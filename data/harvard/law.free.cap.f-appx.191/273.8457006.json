Mancilla contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>district court committed reversible plain error by departing upwards from the guideline sentencing fine range of $7,500-$75,000 to a fine of $125,000; that the district court committed reversible plain error by sentencing him pursuant to the guideline sentencing scheme found unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. He contends that the waiver provision of his plea agreement does not preclude him from raising those arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Government does not rely on the waiver provision to bar Mancilla\u2019s upward-departure contention or his constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b). We therefore do not enforce the waiver as to those contentions. <em>See United States v. Lang, </em>440 F.3d 212, 213 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, Mancilla\u2019s contention that the district court erred by sentencing him under the formerly mandatory guideline sentencing regime is not barred by his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The district court imposed the $125,000 fine based solely on Mancilla\u2019s ability to pay a fine. A defendant\u2019s socioeconomic status is an impermissible factor on which to base an upward departure. <em>See United States v. Painter, </em>375 F.3d 336, 339 (2004); <em>United States v. Hatchett, </em>923 F.2d 369, 373-75 (5th Cir.1991). There is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lower fine sentence had it realized that Mancilla\u2019s ability to pay was an impermissible factor for a departure. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 437 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005). As to the fine only, Mancilla\u2019s sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Mancilla correctly concedes that he cannot satisfy the plain-error review standard as to his contention that the district court erred by sentencing him under the formerly mandatory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Mancilla raises his contention to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Mancilla\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Mancilla contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mancilla properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further <em>review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
