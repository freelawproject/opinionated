This court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, this portion of the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">With respect to the denial of withholding of removal, Kapisauanhu has failed to show that the record compels reversal of the finding of the BIA and IJ that she failed to give credible testimony that she is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). With respect to the denial of relief under the CAT, Kapisauanhu has abandoned any challenge to the denial of that relief. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). The remainder of the petition seeking review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tion for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
