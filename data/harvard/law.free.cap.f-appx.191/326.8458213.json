Watson appeals his guilty-plea conviction for use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Watson traded a quantity of drugs to an undercover agent in exchange for a handgun. Watson specifically reserved the right to appeal whether this factual basis was sufficient to support his conviction for use of a firearm under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Watson acknowledges our decisions in <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254 (5th Cir.1994), and <em>United States v. Ulloa, </em>94 F.3d 949 (5th Cir.1996), but he argues that these decisions are distinguishable and thus not controlling. He asserts that, in his case, government agents first proposed trading drugs for the handgun, that he controlled the handgun for only moments before his arrest, and that he could not have used the handgun because it was unloaded. We conclude, however, that nothing in <em>Zuniga </em>or <em>Ulloa </em>suggests that any of these factors are material to the determination of \u201cuse\u201d or otherwise render those cases distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Watson also asks us to \u201creconsider\u201d <em>Zuniga </em>and <em>Ulloa </em>in light of contrary decisions from other circuits. \u201cIt is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
