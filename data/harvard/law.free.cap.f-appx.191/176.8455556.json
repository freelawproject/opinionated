We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Moore v. Cease, </em>No. CA-03-144-7 (E.D.N.C. July 5, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
