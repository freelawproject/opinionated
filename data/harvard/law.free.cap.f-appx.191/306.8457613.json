The district court sentenced Garcia-Baeza to a 27-month term of imprisonment and a three-year period of supervised release. Garcia-Baeza contends that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We review the district court\u2019s fact findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d 420, 430 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1449, 164 L.Ed.2d 146 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">Garcia-Baeza contends the court should have suppressed statements made by him before he was given warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Garcia-Baeza was arrested after bulk currency was discovered on his person and in his vehicle during a traffic stop. Routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>traffic stops are analyzed under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d at 430. A reasonable person in Garcia\u2019s situation would not have understood that he was under formal arrest. <em>See United States v. Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d 593, 596-98 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc). The restraint on his freedom of movement was not of a degree that the law associates with formal arrest. <em>See id. </em>The court did not err in refusing to suppress the pre-arrest statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Garcia-Baeza argues that the court should have suppressed the statements he made during an interview, two days after his arrest, with a Special Agent of the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he was not taken before a magistrate judge in accordance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a). He does not dispute that he was legally detained pursuant to the immigration laws or that he was advised of his right to remain silent before the interview. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(2). Because he has been tried and convicted, he must show that he was prejudiced by the delay in taking him before a magistrate judge. <em>See United States v. Causey, </em>835 F.2d 1527, 1529 (5th Cir.1988). He can do so by demonstrating that the delay affected the voluntariness of his custodial statement. <em>See United States v. Bustamante-Saenz, </em>894 F.2d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1990). His conclusional argument does not demonstrate that the delay in taking him before the magistrate judge was \u201cfor the purpose of interrogation or for any other malevolent reason\u201d or \u201cthat the delay tainted the voluntariness of his confession or that there was a causal connection between the delay and his confession.\u201d <em>See Bustamante-Saenz, </em>894 F.2d at 120; <em>see also United States v. Martin, </em>431 F.3d 846, 849-50 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1664, 164 L.Ed.2d 404 (2006); <em>United States v. Perez-Bustamante, </em>963 F.2d 48, 51-54 (5th Cir.1992). The court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Garcia-Baeza contends in a Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) letter that his sentence was increased beyond the statutory maximum in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This question is not properly before this court and has not been considered. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(j); 5th Cir. R. 28.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
