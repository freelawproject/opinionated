The BIA denied Espinoza\u2019s and Josue\u2019s applications for cancellation of removal because they had not shown that their removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to their children. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). This court lacks jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision regarding cancellation of removal. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">Espinoza and Josu\u00e9 argue that the BIA engaged in impermissible fact-finding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>reaching its decision. They vaguely state that the BIA should not have assumed the existence of evidence to their detriment \u201csuch as a visa to Mexico or Guatemala.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The REAL ID Act authorizes courts to consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). To the extent that the claim raises a question of law, this court has jurisdiction to review it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), the BIA may \u201cnot engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record does not reflect, however, that the BIA made factual findings different from those of the IJ and Espinoza and Josu\u00e9 fail to clearly identify such facts. Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
