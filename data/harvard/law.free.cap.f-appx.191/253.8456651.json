Faced with Gharbi\u2019s indictment, the district court reasoned that \u201ca determination regarding [his] eligibility for naturalization would be premature.\u201d It therefore stayed Gharbi\u2019s \u00a7 1447(b) action pending resolution of his criminal proceedings. After having twice moved unsuccessfully for the district court to reconsider its stay, Gharbi now appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his second motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court abused its discretion in ordering the stay of his \u00a7 1447(b) proceedings. We dismiss Gharbi\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Generally, we have jurisdiction to consider only an appeal from a district court\u2019s final judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agree that the district court\u2019s stay order\u2014 or, more precisely, its order denying Gharbi\u2019s second motion for reconsideration of the stay order \u2014 is not a final appealable judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, Gharbi premises our jurisdiction on an exception to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\u2019s final judgment rule: <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.\u2019s </em>collateral order doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">A non-final order \u201ccome[s] within the \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions excepted from the final-judgment rule\u201d if it \u201cconclusively determine[s] the disputed question, resolve[s] an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [is] effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have restated this rule with the following elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">(1) The order must finally dispose of an issue so that the district court\u2019s decision may not be characterized as tentative, informal or incomplete; (2) the question must be serious and unsettled; (3) the order must be separable from, and collateral to, the merits of the principal case; and (4) there must be a risk of important and irreparable loss if an immediate appeal is not heard because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQs\">Other than conclusionally stating that the district court\u2019s \u201cstay order is an appealable collateral order,\u201d Gharbi makes no attempt to demonstrate exactly how the order denying his second motion for reconsideration of the stay order meets our four-part test. Despite his omission, however, we conclude that it does not meet the test. And, as Gharbi asserts no other basis for our jurisdiction, we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The four-part collateral order test is conjunctive: If the order does not satisfy even one element, we lack appellate jurisdiction. Here, it is at least arguable that the first three elements have been satisfied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But it is more than arguable-indeed, we find it inescapable-that the fourth element is <em>not </em>satisfied. This is because Gharbi has not demonstrated \u201ca risk of important and irreparable loss if an immediate appeal is not heard because the order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gharbi seems to contend that, by itself, the <em>delay </em>that the stay has caused and is causing to his naturalization proceedings is sufficient to constitute an \u201cimportant and irreparable loss.\u201d Delay alone, however, is not enough.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>\u201cCohen </em>requires some showing of <em>extraordinary </em>harm,\u201d and Gharbi has not made such a showing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal, therefore, is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

First, the order denying Gharbi\u2019s second motion for reconsideration may finally dispose of the instant disputed issue-whether the stay should have been granted in the first place. Like \"every order short of a final decree,\u201d the order is subject to reconsideration and, thus, inherently tentative. <em>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 12, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). But, as the <em>Moses H. Cone </em>Court demonstrated, this alone is not enough to deprive the order of sufficient finality for collateral order doctrine purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 12-13 (holding that the order at issue \"conclusively determinefd] the disputed question\u201d because \"there [was] no basis to suppose that the District Judge contemplated any reconsideration of his decision\u201d). The district court here has <em>twice </em>denied reconsideration of his stay order; that may be enough to find that the court \"conclusively determine[d] the disputed question.\u201d Second, the question is at least arguably serious: Staying Gharbi\u2019s \u00a7 1447(b) naturalization proceeding pending the outcome of his potentially long criminal proceedings could significantly delay resolution of his naturalization claim. And third, the question whether the stay order should have been granted is clearly separate from the merits of the \u00a7 1447(b) proceeding in which the stay arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b281-26\">. <em>Kershaw, 9 </em>F.3d at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b281-27\">. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 15 (reasoning that delayed recovery of fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act is not a sufficient harm for collateral order doctrine purposes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b281-28\">. <em>EEOC v.
