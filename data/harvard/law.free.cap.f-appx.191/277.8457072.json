We will uphold findings that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Under the substantial evidence standard, reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision is improper unless the alien shows that the evidence compels it. <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Khan fails to show that substantial evidence supports that he has suffered past persecution or will more than likely suffer persecution or torture if he is returned to Pakistan. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3); <em>Majd, </em>446 F.3d at 594-95; <em>Adebisi v. INS, </em>952 F.2d 910, 913 (5th Cir.1992). Additionally, Khan did not file in the administrative proceedings a motion regarding a continuance or a change in status. Therefore, this issue was not exhausted, and we will not consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Khan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
