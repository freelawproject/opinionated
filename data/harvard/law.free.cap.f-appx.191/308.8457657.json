Despite multiple claims asserted by Appellants and multiple theories supporting Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court\u2019s ruling was predicated only on \u201cthe written reasons to be filed at a later date.\u201d The record, however, does not reveal the subsequent entry of any written reasons supporting the ruling. \u201cWhen we have no notion of the basis for a district court\u2019s decision, because its reasoning is vague or simply left unsaid, there is little opportunity for effective review. In such cases, we have not hesitated to remand the case for an illumination of the court\u2019s analysis through some formal or informal statement of reasons.\u201d <em>McIncrow v. Harris County, </em>878 F.2d 835 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Myers v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>731 F.2d 281, 284 (5th Cir.1984)). Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the district court to permit the district court to give reasons for its decision and to enter final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
