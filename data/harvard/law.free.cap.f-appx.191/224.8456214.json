McDonald appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the sentencing range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, which are now advisory. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it falls within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. A sentence that falls within the correctly determined guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">At sentencing, the district court stated that it had read McDonald\u2019s Bench Memorandum Regarding Sentencing. The court heard argument from counsel and stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court sentenced McDonald within the statutorily prescribed range, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2006), and further correctly calculated McDonald\u2019s guideline range. We therefore conclude that the sentence imposed is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-12\"> We reject McDonald\u2019s request that we find that this presumption of reasonableness violates <em>Booker. </em>Similarly, we reject McDonald\u2019s claim of a Sixth Amendment violation based on a jury\u2019s not having found facts pertaining to his past criminal conduct. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
