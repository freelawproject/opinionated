He was sentenced to 41 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He now appeals his sentence, which was imposed after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), asserting that it was unreasonable, because it was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">The record shows that the district court fulfilled its duty to consider all of the \u00a7 3553 factors and that the court sentenced Santoyo-Garcia to 41 months of imprisonment, the lowest end of the sentencing guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). This sentence is within the properly calculated advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). There is no indication that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Santoyo-Garcia also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Santoyo-Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Santoyo-Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding Supreme Court precedent. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Santoyo-Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, raising it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
