MILLETTE, JR.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal concerns the so-called \"safety valve\" provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), providing for relief from mandatory sentences when the defendant truthfully provides all information and evidence concerning his offense to the Commonwealth \"[n]ot later than the time of the sentencing hearing.\" In the instant case, the defendant provided the information immediately prior to the sentencing hearing, and the trial court determined that such motion was untimely and declined\n   to rule on the merits. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Terrance Kevin Hall pled guilty to three counts of distribution of cocaine, second or subsequent offense, subject to the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, and two counts of distribution of cocaine in a school zone. Sentencing was scheduled for 9 a.m. on February 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of sentencing, Hall filed a motion pursuant to the safety valve provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), which provides potential relief from mandatory minimum sentences, according to the following terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to be imposed for a violation of this subsection shall not be applicable if the court finds that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. The person does not have a prior conviction for an offense listed in subsection C of \u00a7 17-805;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. The person did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon in connection with the offense or induce another participant in the offense to do so;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   c. The offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   d. The person was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise as defined in subsection I; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Not later than the time of the sentencing hearing\n   </em>\n   , the person has truthfully provided to the Commonwealth all information and evidence the person has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the person has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Commonwealth already is aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) (emphasis added). Hall attached to his motion a two-page, handwritten disclosure, which, according to the transcript, the Commonwealth received just prior to or at 9 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sentencing hearing commenced sometime after 9 a.m., and the parties do not dispute that the Commonwealth received the disclosure prior to the commencement of the sentencing hearing. The trial court entertained the motion prior to sentencing. The Commonwealth argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As of nine o'clock this morning when the sentencing hearing was to begin, this Defendant has never sat down with the Commonwealth, he's never sat down and answered any questions from law enforcement about the offenses in this particular case so he has not sufficiently gone through and done what he needs to do in order for him to avoid these minimum mandatories. ... [I]f this has not been done before the time of the sentencing hearing, then it does not apply and he does not get the benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defense counsel responded that the Commonwealth received a disclosure from Hall before the judge took the bench to commence sentencing proceedings, rendering the disclosure timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court stated that: \"[W]hether or not there's been compliance with the statute is something that the Court has to determine and - and that probably requires the Commonwealth to have an opportunity to review this, look at it and - and make an argument about whether or not there's been compliance with the statute.\n   <em>\n    This Court has not reviewed this information\n   </em>\n   this morning, it's just been handed to the Court as well as the motion and simply put, I previously ruled and I think the Court of Appeals has held not later than sentencing hearing means that it means not the morning of the sentencing hearing, not before the case is called for sentencing. ... [T]he motion is not timely and there has not been compliance with the statute as it's been filed this morning.\" (Emphasis added.) The motion was denied. Due to this ruling, the parties did not argue the merits of the disclosure's completeness or truthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hall received the mandatory sentences and timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's denial of the motion, specifically ruling that subpart (e) does not provide for a bright line rule for timeliness but that timeliness depends on the time necessary to \"test [the] statement for veracity and completeness.\" Hall timely appealed to this Court, assigning error to the finding of the Court of Appeals that the trial court did not err due to Hall's failure to comply with Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While a trial court's sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion, to the extent that sentencing involves statutory construction, such construction is reviewed de novo. The Court considers de novo the language \"Not later than the time of the sentencing hearing\" in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have said: \"When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.

The Commonwealth argues permitting such a late disclosure makes it impossible for the circuit court to intelligently weigh the truthfulness or completeness of the statement in order to determine whether it satisfied the statute. Thus, the Commonwealth contends Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C)(e) is not satisfied by minimal avoidance of the deadline, but requires that the defendant produce sufficient evidence to support a sentencing court in \"find[ing] that\" he \"has truthfully provided to the Commonwealth all information and evidence,\" as well as the time to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Commonwealth's argument could be construed to mean that the plain meaning must be driven by the trial court's preconceived purpose of the subsection, such an approach to statutory construction would be erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%2096\">\n    273 Va. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637489\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/174/\">\n    639 S.E.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e must give effect to the legislature's intention\n   <em>\n    as expressed by the language used\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). However, the Commonwealth does not truly dispute the plain meaning of the phrase itself, but rather argues the plain meaning must be altered in order that the overarching purpose of the subsection, requiring that the trial court make a finding, may be achieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Though the Commonwealth does not label it as such, its argument is more properly construed as an absurdity argument, invoking that little-used caveat completing the quote from\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   : that we find legislative intent as expressed by the language \"unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity.\"\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%2096\">\n    273 Va. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637489\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/174/\">\n    639 S.E.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Commonwealth argues that the statute would be inoperable, in light of the statute's call upon the court to make an actual finding as to the truthfulness and completeness of a disclosure, if the Court were to permit disclosures only moments before a sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   And yet we need only to turn to the numerous federal jurisdictions in which the\n   similar safety valve statute is operable, and which permit disclosure immediately before sentencing, to find that this is not the case. Since the same plain language interpretation is proving legally workable in at least six federal circuits, it seems far from a manifest absurdity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    UnitedStates v.

The numerous federal jurisdictions interpreting the safety valve provision to allow filings made prior to commencement of sentencing demonstrate that this alleged impracticality is by no means \"legally unworkable,\" even if it may not be the model of efficiency to have defendants present a disclosure on the day of sentencing. If the legislature wishes to expedite the process in Virginia, it is empowered to do so, but the Court is bound by the words of the statute insofar as it is workable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The issue of timeliness must first be treated as a separate and distinct inquiry from the merits inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schreiber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11575926\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/103/#p107\">\n    191 F.3d at 105, 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding for a finding on the merits where the trial court disqualified at the threshold a timely filed disclosure without an evaluation of the truthfulness or completeness). The timeliness question is a simple, threshold issue: the defendant either made his disclosure \"not later than the time of the sentencing hearing\" or he did not. In this instance, there is no question that the disclosure was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nonetheless, the risk of last-minute yet procedurally timely disclosure is not irrelevant to the merits where, as here, the burden of production and of persuasion lies with the defendant.

Broun, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 337 (7th ed. 2013).

This burden obliges the defendant to prove to the court that the information he supplied in the relevant time frame was both truthful and complete.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant enters this type of last minute disclosure at his own risk: the trial court is within its discretion to disbelieve a self-serving disclosure if it appears\n   incomplete or untruthful, and the court is entitled to consider the last-ditch nature of the effort or previous untruths into that calculus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brownlee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480512\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1302/#p1304\">\n    204 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1304-05 ;\n   <em>\n    Schreiber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11575926\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/103/#p107\">\n    191 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   108 ;\n   <em>\n    Tournier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11637232\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/645/#p647\">\n    171 F.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (all noting that prior untruths or last minute disclosures do not automatically disqualify a defendant from safety valve relief but become part of the mix of evidence in evaluating the truthfulness and completeness of the disclosure). The trial court is entitled to use its discretion in determining whether to allow the defendant to augment his filed disclosure through in-court testimony or through the granting of a continuance to allow the Commonwealth to investigate and verify that the information presented by the defendant is full and complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The risk facing a defendant who waits until the last minute to file a motion under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) is enhanced if the prosecutor invites the trial court to review and reject, on the merits, a defendant's unverified disclosure. \"The decision to grant a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the circuit court and must be considered in view of the circumstances unique to each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia Fuel Corp. v. Lambert Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644337\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/781/162/#p104\">\n    291 Va. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644337\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/781/162/#p104\">\n    781 S.E.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (citation omitted). The trial court's discretion whether to grant a motion for a continuance made\n   <em>\n    on the defendant's behalf\n   </em>\n   would necessarily take into account whether the defendant has apparently exercised due diligence and good faith in attempting to present a complete and truthful disclosure to the Commonwealth by the statutory deadline. The denial of such a motion can be overturned only when the defendant can demonstrate an \"abuse of discretion\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   resulting prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644337\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/781/162/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, however, the trial court, refusing the motion as per se untimely, stated clearly on the record that it had not read the motion and refused to review the substance of the included disclosure. In doing so, the trial court declined to make any finding on the merits as to the veracity and completeness of the claim. The sole basis for refusing the motion was the last-minute nature of the disclosure. While the timing of the disclosure may weigh into a trial court's consideration on the merits, the court may not bar a motion as untimely based on a last-minute disclosure when such disclosure was nonetheless timely made: that is, not later than the commencement of the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because disclosure was timely made to the Commonwealth, the motion was timely and warrants consideration on the merits by the trial court for the completeness and truthfulness of the disclosure as well as any further disclosure made to the Commonwealth before resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The sentences are hereby vacated, and the case is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
