LACY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal we consider whether the circuit court erred in denying a motion for nonsuit, prospectively denying an inmate\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-692, and imposing a pre-service review with possible summary dismissal on the inmate's future filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carl D. Gordon, an inmate at Red Onion State Prison, filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief to protect him from alleged unsanitary dental treatment by the prison's dental assistant. The circuit court granted Gordon\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status on September 8, 2017. A summons and copy of the complaint were sent to the defendants, Prison Warden Jeffrey B. Kiser, Assistant Warden J. Artrip, and N. H. Scott, Deputy Director of Administration, Virginia Department of Corrections (collectively \"the Warden\") and a hearing was set for November 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 10, 2017, the Warden filed a demurrer, plea of sovereign immunity and motion to dismiss. In addition to asserting that the Warden was entitled to sovereign immunity, the Warden argued that Gordon's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that, in dismissing the complaint, the circuit court should include \"an express finding\" that the dismissal counted as a \"strike\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-692, which denies\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status to prisoners who have had at least three cases dismissed for being frivolous, malicious or for failure to state a claim. The Warden also asked that the circuit court order that any future complaint Gordon files be subject to pre-service review and possible summary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gordon filed a motion for temporary injunction on October 17. On October 23, he filed a motion for nonsuit and for a hearing on his motion. He also asked if the circuit court denied his nonsuit motion, that it grant an extension of 30 days from the date of denial so that Gordon could file a response to the Warden's demurrer, plea of sovereign immunity and motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   No hearing was held on November 1, but the circuit court entered an order on that date in which it granted the Warden's motion to dismiss, holding that Gordon failed to state a claim for injunctive relief because it was \"merely speculative\" and did not show irreparable harm and the lack of an adequate remedy at law. The circuit court also held that the dismissal in the present action constituted the fifth \"strike\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-692 and stated that the court \"shall deny\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status\" to Gordon, unless in the future he could show that he was \" 'in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time of filing his motion for judgment or the court determines\n   that it would be manifest injustice to deny\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status.' \" The circuit court also reviewed a number of cases filed by Gordon and concluded that \"[c]onsidering the frequent nature of this litigant's filings, as well as the ultimate disposition of those pleadings,\" a screening requirement of complaints allowing a pre-service, summary dismissal \"would be appropriate in further claims filed by [Gordon] in this Court.\" The circuit court did not address Gordon's motions for a nonsuit or extension of time to respond to the Warden's motions. We granted Gordon's timely filed petition for appeal in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gordon's 11 assignments of error fall into four categories: (1) error in denying Gordon's motion for nonsuit and holding that the complaint failed to state a claim and was frivolous; (2) error in imposing pre-service review with potential summary dismissal of future complaints filed by Gordon; (3) error in assessing \"strikes\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-692 ; and (4) error in failing to grant Gordon an extension of time to reply to the Warden's demurrer, plea of sovereign immunity and motion to dismiss. We will address these in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Motion for Nonsuit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The general rule in Virginia is that a plaintiff may take one nonsuit \"as a matter of right\" unless a motion to strike has been sustained, the jury has retired or \"the action has been submitted to the court for decision.\"\n   <em>\n    INOVA Health Care Servs. v.

Gordon argues that in this case the matter had not been submitted to the court for decision at the time he filed his motion for nonsuit. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An action is submitted to the court for decision when \"the parties, by counsel, ... have\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   yielded the issues to the court for consideration and decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Transcon.

Therefore, the Warden concludes, Gordon was not entitled to take a nonsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the cases relied upon by the Warden, the motions at issue had been briefed and argued by both parties and \"[n]either the parties nor the court anticipated any further proceedings,\" such as briefing and argument.\n   <em>\n    Anheuser-Busch Cos.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=289%20Va.%20318\">\n    289 Va. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20S.E.2d%20499\">\n    770 S.E.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, nothing further was necessary to submit the case to the court for disposition. Here, in addition to a November 1 hearing date, Gordon had not yielded the issues to the court for consideration because he specifically requested additional time to respond to the Warden's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on these facts, we hold that because both parties had not submitted the issues to the circuit court for decision, the circuit court erred in denying Gordon's motion for a nonsuit. Accordingly, we will vacate that portion of the circuit court's judgment holding that the complaint was speculative and failed to establish irreparable harm and the lack of an adequate remedy at law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gordon argues that if this Court concludes, as we have, that the circuit court erred in failing to grant his motion for nonsuit, we need not review the circuit court's judgment imposing prospective denial of\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status or the pre-service review with potential summary dismissal of any future complaints because the circuit court would not have reached these issues had it granted the nonsuit. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Courts have statutory and inherent power to \"protect [their] jurisdiction from repetitious and harassing conduct that abuses the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    Adkins v.

A circuit court retains jurisdiction to consider a motion for sanctions of the type requested by the Warden either before it rules on the request for nonsuit or if it rules within 21 days of entry of a final order in the case.\n   <em>\n    Williamsburg Peking Corp. v.

Here, even if the circuit court had granted Gordon's motion for nonsuit, it would have retained jurisdiction to rule on the sanctions request for 21 days after entry of the nonsuit order. Because the circuit court imposed the sanctions contemporaneously with entry of its judgment order, the rulings were timely. Therefore, we reject Gordon's suggestion that we need not review the circuit court's ruling on the sanctions request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Pre-Service Review and Summary Dismissal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   , we reaffirmed a court's inherent authority to protect its jurisdiction from harassing conduct that abuses the judicial process, while acknowledging that restricting the ability of a litigant to access the court system is a drastic remedy that should be used sparingly.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20Va.%20446\">\n    293 Va. at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/799/929/\">\n    799 S.E.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, we adopted the four-factor test established in\n   <em>\n    Cromer v. Kraft Foods North America, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142876\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/812/\">\n    390 F.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2004), in deciding whether such a remedy was appropriate. The four factors to be considered are (1) the party's history of litigation and whether the party has filed vexatious, harassing or duplicative lawsuits; (2) whether the party had a good faith basis for pursuing the litigation or simply intended to harass; (3) the extent of the burden on the courts and parties; and (4) the adequacy of alternative sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Adkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20Va.%20446\">\n    293 Va. at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/799/929/\">\n    799 S.E.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After applying these factors, we concluded that imposing a pre-filing injunction against Adkins that required she obtain an attorney to file any petition for appeal, motion or other pleading or that she obtain leave of court to file any\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleading was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647847\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/799/929/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, the Warden asked the circuit court to impose on Gordon a sanction which would limit his access to that court. Specifically, the Warden asked the circuit court to impose a requirement that any future complaints filed in the court would be reviewed and subject to pre-service, summary dismissal. The circuit court imposed this sanction, stating that \"[c]onsidering the frequent nature of this litigant's filings, as well as the ultimate disposition of those pleadings, this Court finds that such a sanction would be appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court's analysis arguably addressed the first factor of the four-factor test adopted in\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   . The circuit court's order however does not demonstrate consideration or analysis of the remaining three factors. Accordingly, we will vacate the circuit court's imposition of the pre-service review and possible summary dismissal on any future complaints Gordon might file in that court and remand the matter for consideration of the four-factor test adopted in\n   <em>\n    Adkins.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Application of Code \u00a7 8.01-692\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-692 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The court shall deny in forma pauperis status to any prisoner who has had three or more cases or appeals dismissed by any federal or state court for being frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner shows that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time of filing his motion for judgment or the court determines that it would be manifest injustice to deny in forma pauperis status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, the circuit court stated that Gordon \"has had at least four claims dismissed in state and federal court for failure to state a claim, including one in which the\n   court found the complaint to be frivolous.\" The circuit court cited the following four cases:\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   CL06-568,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the cases cited either did not dismiss all defendants for failure to state a claim (\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Like the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Tolbert\n   </em>\n   , we find the answer in the plain meaning of the word \"case.\" That word is unambiguous. Its plain meaning includes all claims asserted in the proceeding. Therefore, to qualify as a \"strike\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-692, all claims and all defendants-the entire case-must be dismissed for one or more of the reasons identified in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, we have not considered whether a case dismissed on a motion for summary judgment can qualify as a \"strike\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-692. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed that issue in\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   . The majority of the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, determined that the plain meaning of the word \"dismiss\" as used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) means \"to terminate (an action or claim) without further hearing, esp[ecially] before the trial of the issues involved.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694492\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/607/\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   611 (citing Black's Law Dictionary, 1573 (9th ed. 2009) ).
