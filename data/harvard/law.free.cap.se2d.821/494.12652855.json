On appeal, Appellants argue the master erred in (1) finding the easement encumbering Appellants' property, 45 Legare Street, was an easement appurtenant rather than an easement in gross; (2) finding the 1971 restrictive covenant, given by Appellants' predecessor-in-title, was valid and runs with the land; and (3) finding Appellants' claims were barred by the statute of limitations. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal arises from a dispute regarding a recorded easement in Charleston, South Carolina. The easement is an eight-foot-wide alley or driveway, which encumbers the servient parcel located at 45 Legare Street (45 Legare) currently owned by Appellants. The easement benefits the adjacent, dominant parcel at 47 Legare Street (47 Legare) currently owned by Tamsberg. W.G. Hinson previously owned both parcels as one property, but in 1911, Hinson divided his property into two adjacent lots, a southern parcel, 45 Legare, and a northern parcel, 47 Legare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an April 15, 1911 deed (the 1911 Deed), Hinson conveyed 47 Legare to his niece, Julia Dill, while reserving 45 Legare for himself. The 1911 Deed included the following clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Also, the full and free use and enjoyment as an easement to run with the land of the right of ingress, egress, and regress, in, over, through[,] and upon the alley-way eight (8) feet wide as a drive way or carriage way, situate, lying[,] and being immediately to the south of [47 Legare], and being the southern boundary of said [47 Legare].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The easement described in the 1911 Deed was located entirely on 45 Legare and ran from Legare Street to the\n   western lot line that bordered the Saint Peter's graveyard wall. Subsequently, title to both 45 Legare and 47 Legare passed to different owners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 5, 1971, the Bank-having title to 47 Legare at the time as executor of Julia's estate-and Black-owner of 45 Legare at the time-executed and recorded simultaneous documents, in which the Bank conveyed the western, rear portion of the easement to Black by deed and in which Black executed a restrictive covenant (the Covenant) that sought to reaffirm the existence of the original easement, \"to the extent as agreed upon by the parties,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   by execution of\n   the within covenant.\" In their respective documents, both Black and the Bank provided verbatim descriptions of the original easement from the 1911 Deed and referenced a 1971 Cummings &amp; McCrady, Inc. plat of 47 Legare (Cummings &amp; McCrady plat), which showed both the area of 45 Legare encumbered by the easement to 47 Legare and the western, rear portion of the easement sold to Black. The Covenant also provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Black, the owner in fee simple of [45 Legare], hereby covenants and agrees that the strip of land located on the west side of Legare Street in the City of Charleston, State of South Carolina, being eight feet in width and 101.25 feet in depth and being more particularly shown on [the Cummings &amp; McCrady plat], as enclosed within the letters, B, E, F, H, B, the line F, H being the terminus thereof, shall be\n   subject to the following restrictions, limitations[,] and rights as to the future use of said strip of land:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) That no building or other structure shall be erected thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) That no obstruction shall be placed or permitted to remain thereon so as to prevent the right of ingress, egress, and regress, in, over, or through, and upon the said strip of land as a driveway or carriageway to the owner of [47 Legare].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The aforesaid covenants, restrictions[,] and limitations shall be covenants running with the land and shall be binding on Margarette deSaussure Black, her heirs, assigns[,] and successors in title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tamsberg's deed to 47 Legare-and the deed to her predecessor-in-title-included the following provision with the conveyance of the property on 47 Legare:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Together an easement, to run with the land, over an adjoining strip of land shown on [the Cummings &amp; McCrady] plat as enclosed within the letters B, E, F, H, and B, for ingress, egress, and regress, in, over, or through, and upon the said strip of land as a driveway or carriageway for the owner of [47 Legare] described above, as conveyed by W.G. Hinson less a portion shown on [the Cummings &amp; McCrady] plat within the letters F, G, C, H[,] and F, .... The strip covered by said easement is also covered by restrictive covenants ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellants' deed to 45 Legare, however, did not contain the same provision, but did include a clause subjecting 45 Legare's title to all easements and restrictions of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellants acknowledged they were aware of the easement at or near the time they obtained title to 45 Legare in 2004. However, Appellants considered the easement abandoned because, in 2004, Tamsberg finished replacing a chain-link fence with a masonry wall that ran alongside the border of 45 Legare in the area where the easement previously extended. The wall contained a three-to-four foot gate, which provided access to 47 Legare from the easement on 45 Legare and was\n   located near the site of a former garage that previously existed in the rear of 47 Legare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellants indicated the easement \"was never used as a carriage way\" or used by Tamsberg, herself. Instead, Appellants stated \"the only time [the easement] was ever used\" was to allow Tamsberg's landscapers to walk down the driveway to use the gate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tamsberg, however, claimed she-as well as family members, guests, \"tradesmen, and other permittees\"-continuously used the easement since she purchased 47 Legare in 1988 because it provided the only access to the rear of 47 Legare for large-scale appliances, equipment, and machinery; and because it provided access to the only suitable area for off-street parking for her property. Tamsberg also claimed she had driven a golf cart down the easement and parked in the rear of 47 Legare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants claimed that in 2014, ten years after they purchased 45 Legare, Tamsberg approached and informed them that their fence-erected in the easement-\"[was] coming down\" and she would be using their\n   \"driveway as easement to the back.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants filed a complaint in Charleston County in September 2014, and subsequently amended their complaint in September 2015. In their amended complaint, Appellants requested: (1) a declaratory judgment ruling that the easement was abandoned, the Covenant was abandoned, and the burdened property should revert to Appellants; (2) injunctive relief preventing Tamsberg from removing Appellants' fence; (3) that the circuit court find the grant of the easement described in the 1911 Deed and the Covenant was an easement in gross that could not be transferred, and as a result, that the easement terminated as a matter of law; and (4) that the circuit court find that each instance of Tamsberg using the easement was a separate act of trespass because Tamsberg used the easement as a walkway, which was outside the scope\n   of the easement's intended use as a carriage or driveway. The parties consented to reference to the master, and later, filed cross motions for summary judgment under Rule 56, SCRCP. The master held a hearing on Appellants' motion for summary judgment on March 2, 2016, and held a hearing on Tamsberg's motion for summary judgment on March 16, 2016. On March 29, 2016, the master filed an order granting Tamsberg's motion and denying Appellants' motion.

Intuitively, the dominant estate must have access to the purported easement. In addition, a court could find an easement appurtenant if the purported easement (1) at least touches the dominant estate and (2) in cases where the easement is an adjacent boundary between-or runs parallel to-the dominant and servient estates such as in the instant case, the easement does not extend beyond the purported dominant estate's boundary-i.e., at most, the easement ends at the lot line of the dominant estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whaley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2343397\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/21/221/\">\n    21 S.C. at 224-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a right of way could not be appurtenant to the purported dominant estate when the right of way did not have a terminus that touched or reached the dominant estate);\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2080189\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/204/124/\">\n    204 S.C. at 131-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2080189\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/204/124/\">\n    28 S.E.2d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no terminus on appellant's land when an alleyway running adjacent to the appellant's property began at the public thoroughfare on the east of the appellant's property, continued westward over the land of the appellant's predecessor-in-title, then continued over the respondent's property, extended beyond appellant's property line, and ended on respondent's westernmost property line).

Specifically, Hinson described the property at 47 Legare and included \"the full and free use and enjoyment as an easement to run with the land of the right of ingress, egress, and regress, in, over, through[,] and upon the alleyway eight (8) feet wide\" lying \"immediately to the south of [47 Legare] and being the southern boundary of said [47 Legare].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tupper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517228\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/326/318/#p323\">\n    326 S.C. at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517228\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/326/318/#p323\">\n    487 S.E.2d at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n appurtenant easement inheres in the land, concerns the premises, has one terminus on the land of the party claiming it, and is essentially necessary to the enjoyment thereof.

The record indicates that, at the time of the 1911 Deed, a garage existed at the rear of 47 Legare and the driveway was the only accessible method of reaching the garage. Additionally, the Cummings &amp; McCrady plat, which was referenced in the 1971 Covenant, shows the existence of the structure at the rear of\n   47 Legare and located adjacent to the present-day gate, which allows access onto 47 Legare at a point where the easement ends. Not only does the\n   easement touch 47 Legare as a southern boundary and does not extend beyond 47 Legare's boundary, nothing in the record indicates that Tamsberg was prevented from accessing 47 Legare directly from the easement. Indeed, Tamsberg directly accessed the property via the rear gate. This indicates the existence of a terminus onto 47 Legare. Because we find the parties who created the easement intended for it to be an easement appurtenant and because we find the easement has a terminus on 47 Legare, where the rear gate is located, we affirm the master on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Even when viewing the evidence in favor of Appellants' statements that Tamsberg does not personally use the easement and it was only used by her landscapers, no issue of material fact exists to dispute the necessity of the easement to bring large-scale equipment and tools to the rear of 47 Legare. Appellants contend the front gate allows access to the rear, but they offer no evidence to refute the necessity of the easement to allow large equipment into the rear of 47 Legare. Thus, we find the master did not err in finding the easement necessary for 47 Legare's use, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In conclusion, we find the evidence reflects the original parties to the 1911 Deed intended to create an easement appurtenant, and the elements for an easement appurtenant existed at the time of its creation. Accordingly, we find the master did not err in granting Tamsberg's motion for summary judgment, and we affirm the master's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the master's order granting Tamsberg's motion for summary judgment is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LOCKEMY, C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Hinson's combined property was known as 47 Legare Street before the division. Both 45 and 47 Legare are bounded on the east by Legare Street and on the west by a wall bordering the Saint Peter's Church graveyard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    For clarity, we provide the complete chain of title for each property from the 1911 division to the current owners. We start with 45 Legare. Hinson retained 45 Legare until his death in 1917, and in 1919, his estate conveyed 45 Legare to his three nieces-Julia, Pauline Dill, and Frances Dill. In 1920, Julia and Frances conveyed their interest in 45 Legare to Pauline, who, in 1936, sold 45 Legare to Henry deSaussure. In 1955, Henry bequeathed 45 Legare to Margarette deSaussure Black. Black retained title to 45 Legare until her death in 1997, at which point her estate devised the property to her sons. In 2004, Black's sons conveyed 45 Legare to Appellants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    As for 47 Legare, Julia retained title to 47 Legare until her death in 1970, when the South Carolina National Bank of Charleston (the Bank) assumed title as executor of Julia's estate. In 1971, the Bank sold 47 Legare to Nancy Linton, who then sold 47 Legare to Tamsberg and her now deceased husband in 1988.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The record is unclear whether \"parties\" refers to the original parties to the 1911 Deed or Black and the Bank.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The gate still existed at the time of the hearing. The site of the former garage was a residential space as of 2004.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    At his deposition, Appellant Williams testified Tamsberg asked for, and was given, Appellants' permission for her landscapers to walk down the easement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The record is not clear as to whether the fence is the same as the wall Tamsberg erected in 2004 or if it is a different fence altogether.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Appellants assert that Tamsberg's restrictive covenant argument is an alternative argument if the easement in the 1911 Deed was an easement in gross. Additionally, Appellants' underlying cause of action relies on the non-existence of an appurtenant easement, which is an action at law. Therefore, because our finding of a valid appurtenant easement is dispositive, we need not address Appellant's remaining issues on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Futch v.
