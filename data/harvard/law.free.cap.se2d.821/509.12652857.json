We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2002, Bostic Brothers Construction, Inc. (Bostic) began construction as the general contractor on Stoneledge, a townhouse community on Lake Keowee. Bostic marketed the properties as \"quality construction\" and \"maintenance free.\" Bostic stated, \"The quality and attention to detail of the cedar and stacked-stone homes are just as breathtaking as the views.\" Bostic also noted \"Your homeowner[']s association dues cover both maintenance of the grounds and the exterior of your home leaving you more time to enjoy the lake and surrounding attractions.\" Several of the units were sold in 2003, but the attempts to sellout were \"erratic at best.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By late 2004, Bostic was having difficulties finishing other jobs and had to cease operations at Stoneledge. According to property owners at Stoneledge, when Bostic left in 2004, there were \"a number of issues.\" Steven Taylor, a property owner at Stoneledge, testified \"[i]t was like a ghost town.\" He stated property owners were concerned about whether electricity bills were being paid, whether the septic system would work properly, and who was responsible for keeping the common areas landscaped. Taylor testified Bostic had completed the exteriors of the remaining units, but had not completed the interiors when it abandoned the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, IMK Development Company purchased the property from Bostic, and Marick Home Builders, LLC took over the building responsibilities for Stoneledge. Marick's site superintendent, Nathan Hornaday, testified he walked through the\n   unsold units and noted existing damage and what needed to be fixed. According to Hornaday, the exterior of the units, including the roof, porches, decks, and siding were installed in all of the homes and only two or three units needed doors or windows installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hornaday testified that when he arrived on the Stoneledge site, he observed leaks around the porches and decks. Taylor testified he too noticed leaks on his porch and deck. Additionally, Hornaday stated he observed water damage inside the unfinished units, not associated with the porches. He believed that the water damage was the result of broken or missing windows and doors. Hornaday alerted Marick, and one of its principals, Rick Thoennes, about the issues. Marick pulled permits for the unfinished units to complete construction. Marick also hired Coleman Waterproofing to rectify the leaks on the decks and porches by applying a waterproof coating to the concrete. According to Marick, the waterproofing appeared to rectify the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2005, IMK created a homeowners association (HOA) for Stoneledge. At that time, the HOA Board was comprised of IMK representatives, including Thoennes. The HOA conducted regular business, but the homeowners did not have much interaction with the Board. The HOA performed maintenance to the units, but progress was sometimes slow. The IMK/Marick representatives of the Board turned over the HOA to the homeowners in late 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the spring of 2009, the homeowner-controlled Board began receiving complaints of leaks on the decks and porches. Some homeowners also noticed water running through the crawl-space of their homes during heavy rains. The HOA completed destructive testing on the porches and decks and found significant damage. The HOA also found hidden rot caused by water intrusion to structural columns, and homeowners began reporting interior damage caused by water infiltration from the roof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2010, the HOA filed an action against Bostic, IMK, Marick, and other development entities, subcontractors and individuals. The HOA settled with some defendants, but went to trial against Bostic, IMK, Marick and the original IMK/Marick board members, alleging negligence, breach of\n   implied warranty of workmanlike service, breach of implied warranty of habitability, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the HOA requested the jury return a verdict for $6,309,197 for the full amount required to bring the damaged buildings up to the quality at which they were marketed. After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the HOA for a total of $5,000,000: $3,000,000 on the negligence cause of action against Marick and Bostic, $1,000,000 on the breach of implied warranty cause of action against Marick and Bostic, and $1,000,000 for the breach of implied warranty cause of action against Marick. Following post-trial proceedings to allocate fault and setoff settlement funds, the trial court entered revised judgments. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

But, Hornaday also testified he observed water damage in unfinished units and leaks around some porches and decks. Furthermore, he acknowledged Marick pulled permits to complete construction at Stoneledge totaling $1.4 million, including some that stated the work was to \"complete townhome from foundation stage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the charge conference, the court stated it would charge the elements of negligence. Specifically, the court stated, \"I'll charge as far as the elements of damages the negligence is the cost of repairs and incidental and consequential damages.\" The court then noted, \"Have we got any-I don't know about the duty to exercise reasonable care in making repairs.\" The HOA told the trial court, \"That would be relevant to the claims against Marick.\" Marick responded, \"We put the\n   <em>\n    Roundtree Villas\n   </em>\n   case in there, I believe.\" Later during the charge conference, the court noted it would charge the jury \"the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to prove not only that there was negligence, but that the named defendant or defendants were the cause of that [damage].\" Again, Marick argued to the trial court it should include a charge from\n   <em>\n    Roundtree Villas\n   </em>\n   regarding \"liability of subsequent builder making repairs.\" The court noted it could not find the proposed charge but Marick quoted from the charge that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   One who undertakes to make repairs [sic], the defective components of a construction project is not liable for the negligence of the prior builder or contractor. The entity who assumes to make repairs to defective components is only liable for damages proximately caused by alleged negligent repair but not for any original damages proximately caused by the negligence of a builder or contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court declined to charge the language from\n   <em>\n    Roundtree Villas\n   </em>\n   because it involved a lender that took title to property, not a subsequent builder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With regard to the HOA's issue preservation argument, we find Marick sufficiently proffered its requested charge to the trial court. While there was some discussion that the charge was not included in Marick's requests sent to the court prior to the charge conference, Marick sufficiently brought to the trial court's attention the requested content of the charge, and there is a sufficient record for this court to review it. Therefore, we find this issue has been sufficiently preserved for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the merits, the trial court charged the jury the correct statement of the law in South Carolina regarding builder negligence and liability. While we agree with Marick it may have been helpful to include the language from\n   <em>\n    Roundtree Villas\n   </em>\n   in the charge to the jury, after reviewing the entire jury charge, we find no error under the specific facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court charged the jury on the general elements of negligence. The court specifically charged the jury \"[t]he plaintiffs must also prove by a preponderance or the greater weight of the evidence that they suffered damages as a result of the defendants' breach of duty.\" The trial court continued by instructing the jury on proximate cause. The court instructed, \"The plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the damages were proximately caused by the defendants' breach\" and the\n   plaintiffs must prove causation in fact \"by showing that the damages would not have occurred but for the defendants' negligence.\" The court also charged the jury that a plaintiff must prove a builder negligently constructed a building and \"the negligence or carelessness of the defendants in performing the construction work was a proximate cause of the damages sustained by the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the court instructed, \"If [two] acts happened one after the other, but not related to each other, they would not be concurring causes. In that case, only one person whose negligence actually caused the injury would be responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Taken as a whole, these charges adequately instructed the jury on the law of South Carolina. Marick's requested charge\n   is certainly appropriate here, but the court's charge as given instructed the jury that only the person or entity whose negligence caused the injury would be responsible. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Marick argues the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of implied warranty of habitability because the breach of implied warranty of habitability claim had been dismissed prior to trial. The HOA asserts the trial court's error was harmless because no cause of action for breach of implied warranty was included on the verdict form. We agree with the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The HOA initially asserted a cause of action against the Stoneledge developers for breach of implied warranty of habitability. The trial court, however, granted the developers summary judgment on the breach of implied warranty of habitability prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In preparing its jury instructions, the trial court stated it planned to charge the jury on four causes of action, including a charge for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Marick then asked \"Does anybody think there's a work habitability claim still out there?\" The HOA responded, \"Your Honor, I think that you dismissed the habitability claim by earlier order.\" The trial court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, during the charge, the trial court instructed the jury,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A builder who contracts to construct a dwelling impliedly warrants that the work undertaken will be performed in a careful, diligent, and workmanlike manner. This is an implied warranty of workmanlike services, and it exists as a matter of law. The implied warranty o[f] workmanlike manner is a duty to perform the work skillfully, carefully and diligently. The work need not be performed to absolute perfection or to the personal satisfaction of either party, but it must be performed to the satisfaction of the contract. The skill required of a person providing services is the same degree of skill, efficiency and knowledge of those of ordinary skill, competence and standing in the particular trade, profession or business in which the person is working. If\n   you find the construction was defective by reason of the builder's workmanlike performance, the breach of warranty gives a plaintiff a claim for damages for the loss of his expectancy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that there has been a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service and a breach of implied warranty of habitability. An implied warranty is one which is presumed to be included in every sale, whether the defendant actually stated the promise or not. The proper measure of damages for the breach of an implied warranty is the actual damages shown to have been sustained by the plaintiff which are the natural, direct and proximate cause of the breach of the implied warranty and which may be reasonably regarded as within the contemplation of the parties at the time [sic] the warranty as a probable consequence of the breach of this warranty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the court's instruction on damages for the breach of implied warranty cause of action, the trial court did not indicate a specific implied warranty, instead noting \"[i]ncidental\n   damages from a breach of implied warranty may be recovered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the charge, Marick noted its exception to the breach of implied warranty of habitability language. Marick acknowledged the implied warranty of habitability issue was a \"small one\" that was \"buried in other charges.\" After deliberating, the jury requested the trial court \"provide the jury charge for breach of implied warranty of workmanlike service and [the trial court's] charge for breach of fiduciary duty.\" The court repeated these charges at the jury's request. After the court's recharge on the law, Marick again objected to the implied warranty of habitability reference. The trial court noted the error, but found there was no injury to Marick because the term was only mentioned one time in the section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We agree with the trial court's assessment. The jury charge only included the phrase breach of implied warranty of habitability once; it did not define the concept or give any elements for it with respect to a separate cause of action. Further, the jury specifically requested the trial court recharge the issue of breach of warranty of workmanlike service, not mentioning the warranty of habitability.

The HOA asserts it presented evidence of Marick's \"failure to comply with the code in performance of over $1.4 million worth of completion work; its extensive, failed efforts to repair waterproofing on the porches and decks and foundation; and its disregard of open and obvious deficiencies\" its superintendent saw but did not repair, which led to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The HOA's forensic engineer, Derek Hodgin testified he examined the units in Stoneledge and found a number of issues. On his first inspection of Stoneledge, Hodgin found issues with water intrusion on the decks and porches, flashing issues, and siding issues. Hodgin also testified he discovered a significant amount of damage to paneled subfloors and floor framing caused by water intrusion. Finally, Hodgin noted there were inappropriately constructed fire-rated walls which he could observe in an unfinished unit inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Hodgin analyzed the plans and permits pulled in this case and determined Marick used out of date building codes when it applied for twenty-six building permits in 2005, although \"there [was] really no substantial or substantive difference between the two codes ... for any of the issues\" in this case. He also noted several problems with the amount of detail on the plans, and stated the builders should have contacted the architect to clarify those points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Hodgin testified the homeowner's reports of water intrusion should have put Marick on notice to sufficiently investigate to determine the source of the water intrusion. According to Hodgin, to completely fix the issues Stoneledge\n   faces, it would require the removal of all the exterior wall material, and its subsequent reapplication using proper flashing and waterproofing details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We acknowledge several witnesses testified the exteriors of the homes were already constructed when Marick took over at Stoneledge. We also note the HOA's expert testified a large portion of the damages would not have been any different had Marick done nothing to attempt repair. The HOA's expert testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Certain things wouldn't change at all. The need for fire-rated walls to be correct would not change. The need for every window to be removed and reset with proper flashing would not change. The waterproofing of the foundation walls would not change. The balcony reconstruction, I don't think would change. There may have been-you may have had some framing to salvage in the balconies in 2004. I don't know. But other than that it would be same fix.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   However, Hodgin also testified Marick had a duty to properly investigate issues and make repairs as the subsequent general contractor when it knew of problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Marick's expert testified the repairs identified by the HOA's expert which were attributable to Marick would cost $250,000 to repair. The record does not indicate that the HOA's expert broke down his damages opinions between Bostic and Marick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mindful of our standard of review, we find evidence in the record to support the jury's determination that Marick was the proximate cause of Stoneledge's damages, and those damages exceeded $250,000. The most apparent evidence supporting the jury's decision are the permits for construction Marick requested, at least one of which was to completely construct a new unit. While the HOA's expert may not have taken time to delineate which damages were due to Bostic's negligence and which damages were due to Marick's negligence, we find there was evidence to support the jury's verdict.

I didn't have the pleasure of being able to say, I'm a director now. At seven o'clock, I'm a contractor. At eight o'clock, I'm a marketing person. I didn't have that luxury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In the eyes of the HOA members, IMK, Marick, and the individual investor parties serving on the HOA board were one and the same. Stoneledge property owner Robert White testified, \"I.M.K., to me, in terms of the faces of the folks that were part of I.M.K. were Rick Thoennes and his son and Tim Roberson.\" White and his wife communicated with IMK regarding their \"quite hefty list of punch list items.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Further, Thoennes, as Marick's principal and license holder\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , had at least constructive knowledge of the pervasive\n   construction defects that plagued the project, but was nevertheless directly involved in IMK and Marick's marketing and sale of the units. Given that Marick's and IMK's profits were entirely dependent on IMK's ability to sell the units, their operations were clearly in pursuit of a common business purpose, albeit to the detriment of the HOA members. Accordingly, we find evidence supports the trial court's single business enterprise ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

[The HOA] sought no other remedy.... Thus there was nothing for [the HOA] to elect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Immediately after the jury returned its verdict, the HOA asked the trial court if the damages award was meant to be cumulative.

The trial court ruled that the damages the jury awarded for each of the causes of action would be added together, and that the HOA was entitled to damages for each of those causes of action. Marick failed to object to the court's decision or request the court ask the jury what its intent was in how it awarded damages. Accordingly, Marick is unable to argue on appeal the court's decision was in error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allegro Inc. v.

After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the HOA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   for a total of $5,000,000-$3,000,000 on the negligence cause of action against Marick and Bostic, $1,000,000 on the breach of implied warranty cause of action against Marick and Bostic, and $1,000,000 for the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action against Thoennes and other directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   After the jury returned its verdict, the trial court held an additional proceeding to apportion fault among the defendants. The jury apportioned 40% of fault to Marick on the negligence claim and 70% of fault to Marick on the breach of implied warranty claim. The jury was then dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The trial court held a post-trial hearing on several motions after releasing the jury. Among those motions was a motion for setoff. During the hearing on the motion for setoff, the HOA requested the court reform the jury's verdict to reflect that each cause of action supported the $5,000,000 cumulative verdict. After several motions for reconsideration, the trial court entered judgment against Marick as follows: (1) for negligence-$857,635.29; (2) for breach of implied warranty-$2,144,088.23. The trial court entered judgment against Rick Thoennes for $2,144,088.23 for breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Initially, Marick asserts the trial court erred in entering judgment as detailed above because \"the damages awarded and the apportionment provided do not correlate with the evidence.\" Essentially, Marick argues the trial court's final entry of judgment does not correlate with the jury's verdict. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It appears the trial court amended the jury's verdict to find that each cause of action independently supported a $5 million verdict. In doing so, the trial court invaded the province of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joiner v. Bevier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2013902\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/155/340/\">\n    155 S.C. 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2013902\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/155/340/\">\n    152 S.E. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (1930) (\"It is [the judiciary's] duty to enforce a verdict, not to make it.\"). Therefore, we find the jury's verdict, and its allocation of damages to the three separate causes of action should be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The question then becomes how the court should allocate the setoff Marick and Thoennes are entitled to based upon the settlement the HOA received prior to trial. Thoennes' fiduciary duty to the HOA was the result of his position on the Board of the HOA. Based on the record, it does not appear any Board members settled with the HOA prior to trial. Therefore,\n   none of the settlement proceeds should be set off against Thoennes' liability for breach of fiduciary duty because none of the settlement proceeds would have included any amount for damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty. Accordingly, Thoennes is responsible for the $1 million award for breach of fiduciary duty, subject to any claims he may have for contribution from any other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The remaining $4 million verdict should be set off by the amount of the prior settlements. After deducting the value of the settlements, this would leave a $2,144,088.23 judgment to allocate between the negligence and breach of implied warranty causes of action. Because the jury awarded $3 million to the negligence cause of action and $1 million to the breach of implied warranty cause of action, we believe it would be proper to allocate three-fourths of the remaining judgment to the negligence cause of action and the remaining one-fourth to the breach of implied warranty cause of action. This allocation would mean $1,608,066.17 would be allocated to the negligence cause of action and $536,022.06 would be allocated to the breach of implied warranty cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Applying the apportionment statute and the apportionment amounts the jury determined at trial, Marick would therefore be responsible for $643,226.47 for the negligence claim and $536,022.06 for the breach of implied warranty claim, subject to any claims it may have against Bostic for contribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-38-15\">\n    S.C.
