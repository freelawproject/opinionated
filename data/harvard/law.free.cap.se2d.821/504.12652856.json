Bostic argues the trial court erred by (1) denying its motion for a directed verdict based on the statute of limitations, (2) improperly setting off portions of the jury's verdict, and (3) denying its motion for a new trial.

This case involves the first developer of the property, Bostic, which the jury found to be partially responsible for the damages Stoneledge suffered. Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Stoneledge I\n   </em>\n   adequately addresses the second and third issues Bostic raises in this appeal.

Bostic relies heavily on property owner Steven Taylor's testimony that he \"observed water intrusion in various parts of [his] home, including the outside porch and crawlspace, both before and after Marick/IMK assumed control of the Project and created the HOA.\" Bostic also noted Taylor told Rick Thoennes, then a member of the HOA, of the defects in 2005.

At that time, and each year until May 1990, the Barrs had the house inspected for termites.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Those reports indicated excessive moisture under the home and suggested repairs, \"including adding vents, back-filling footers, and installing a polyethylene vapor barrier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

July 28, 2010). Centex was the developer, general contractor, and seller of a condominium complex in North Myrtle Beach.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *1. The complex consisted of ten buildings;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   the dispute concerned Building 3, completed in June 2001, and Building 1, completed in April 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The defendants were subcontractors on the project.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In 2002, Centex discovered water damage to Building 3, thought to have been caused by water intrusion at the intersection of decks and the outside walls of the units.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Two of the defendants performed repairs to the buildings to address the damage to Building 3.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . No damage was reported to Building 1 at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2006, Centex discovered water damage in Building 3 and in Building 1.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *2. Centex alleged that damage was also caused by water intrusion at the intersection of decks and the outside walls.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Centex repaired the damage and brought suit against the subcontractors for damages to both buildings.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The subcontractors moved for summary judgment, alleging the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The subcontractors asserted Centex knew or should have known that a cause of action existed with regard to Building 1 after the damage was reported to Building 3 in 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *3. The defendants' argument was \"based on the fact that similar problems developed in Building 3, a nearly identical building constructed next door to Building 1, only months after Building 1 was completed in 2002.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Centex admitted it knew Building 1 was missing a flashing that was replaced in Building 3 after it was damaged in 2002, but did not take any corrective measures to add that flashing to Building 1.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court found Centex presented sufficient questions of material fact to overcome\n   summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *5. After analyzing\n   <em>\n    Santee\n   </em>\n   , the District Court noted Centex's expert testified there was more than one way to add flashing to a building and the flashing could have been under the stucco, making it a latent defect.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the initial expert Centex retained to inspect the buildings did not discover any defects with the flashing as Building 1 was being constructed, just as the expert in\n   <em>\n    Santee\n   </em>\n   felt the work it was doing would be a \"permanent repair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . While the District Court noted the case was a close question, the court declined to grant the defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *6.\n   Here, there was testimony during trial that some owners knew about issues including roof leaks and water intrusion as early as 2003. According to Taylor, Marick undertook to repair some of the water intrusion issues that plagued the homeowners, and it did not become apparent those repairs were inadequate until drought conditions ended in 2008 and 2009. Specifically, Marick caused a waterproofing substance to be applied to the porches and decks and excavated around at least one unit to discover the cause of a leak in the basement. Additionally, property owner Robert White testified he noticed water intrusion in his crawl-space when he moved in during 2006, and he told Rick Thoennes about those issues. Furthermore, the HOA's engineering expert testified the condition of the windows and doors in the abandoned units would put a general contractor on notice that an investigation of the other units was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, other homeowners had no such knowledge. Taylor testified certain significant defects were not discovered until 2009. Some homeowners only discovered issues with their construction when the rains returned in 2008 and 2009. Taylor testified that damage to columns and framing was not discovered until homeowners began having problems with railings on a number of the porches at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mindful of our standard of review, we find there is some evidence these latent defects could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence until 2009 at the earliest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520086\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/331/371/#p376\">\n    331 S.C. at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 S.E.2d at 207 (\"When reviewing a motion for directed verdict, this court must consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and may only reverse a jury's verdict if the factual findings implicit within it are contrary to the only reasonable inference from the evidence.\"). These defects were hidden by stone veneers and exterior walls, and many could not be seen without destructive testing. Understandably, if there was very little rain, damages that only become apparent due to water intrusion would not be discovered until there was sufficient precipitation to put the homeowners on notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The decision to grant a directed verdict is driven by the specific facts presented during trial. The facts in this case created a jury question as to whether it was reasonable for the\n   homeowners to know, or by reasonable diligence discover, there were issues with their construction. There was evidence these specific homeowners, whose homes were damaged because of water intrusion, were unable to appreciate their cause of action against Bostic because the area had very little rain, and their problems only began to appear in 2009.
