(Association) and the Fund's Board of Trustees (Board). The underlying dispute arose after the Board announced plans to wind down the Fund and use the Fund's remaining assets to finance a new mutual insurance company. Petitioners, who were members of the Fund, disagreed with that decision and challenged the Board's authority to use the Fund's assets in such a way. The trial court twice dismissed Petitioners' suit, first on the basis that it involved the internal affairs of a trust and therefore should have been filed in probate court, then in a subsequent proceeding, on the basis that the lawsuit was a shareholder derivative action and that the complaint failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of Petitioners' complaint, finding the trial court properly concluded (1) the Fund was not a trust; (2) Petitioners' claims were derivative in nature; and (3) Petitioners' complaint was properly dismissed as it did not properly allege a pre-suit demand as required by Rule 23(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

We reverse and remand, for Petitioners have satisfied the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), irrespective of whether the Fund is properly characterized as a trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   All employers conducting business in South Carolina must secure the payment of compensation to their injured employees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-5-10\">\n    S.C.

The Agreement also provided that \"In the event of termination, the remaining funds available in the [Fund], after providing for all outstanding obligations, shall be distributed, through a formula determined by the [Board], to the participating members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the fall of 2003, the Board began discussing the idea of winding down the Fund and using the remaining monies on hand to capitalize a mutual insurance company, presumably to be comprised of the members of the Fund. Over the next several years, the Board continued to explore this \"conversion\" with the Association, the Commission, and the Department of Insurance (DOI); the two biggest challenges were identified as accumulating the $5 million necessary for the mutual insurance company's starting capital reserve and upgrading the Fund's existing computer systems to enable compliance with DOI's regulatory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In furtherance of the plan to create a mutual insurance company, the Board authorized expenditures from the Fund to purchase a custom computer software program; purchase office space costing $1.6 million; include \"operations of the insurance company\" in the scope of its directors and officers insurance coverage; and to subscribe to a national workers' compensation insurance-rating and data-collection bureau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In May 2011, the Board notified the Commission it planned to cease accepting new members into the Fund effective July 1, 2011, and planned to withdraw the Fund from the self-insured program effective January 1, 2012. The Board also sought and received \"approval\" from the Commission to use $5 million in Fund assets to capitalize the reserve fund for the\n   mutual insurance company; however, this \"approval\" included no evaluation of whether this use of Fund monies complied with the terms of the Agreement. Indeed, the director of the self-insurance division of the Commission wrote to the Fund's administrator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to your request[,] we have approved the release of $5 million in non-pledged assets of the SC Home Builders Self-Insurers Fund to be used solely to capitalize the SC Builders Insurance Group, Inc., in conjunction with the closure of the self-insured [F]und. It is understood that the [F]und will cease accepting new members effective July 1, 2011[,] and will become no longer self-insured for workers' compensation in South Carolina effective January 1, 2012.\n   <em>\n    The outstanding liabilities of the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    F\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    und at the time of closure, January 1, 2012, will remain the responsibility of the self-insured\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    F\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    und and its membership under joint and several liability\n   </em>\n   .

The [F]und will also be required to comply with Self-Insurance Tax and Second Injury Fund Assessment requirements following the [F]und[']s closure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioners are members of the Fund who, in February 2012, filed suit against the Fund,\n   the Board, and the individual members of the Board (collectively, Respondents). Petitioners alleged breach of fiduciary duty; breach of trust; breach of contract; and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act. Petitioners alleged that the Board committed\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts in breach of its fiduciary duties by removing more than $5 million from the Fund to establish the mutual insurance company-monies which should have been returned to the Fund's members under the terms of the Agreement. Petitioners also alleged that in addition to not receiving their share of the $5 million paid-in surplus, they have suffered or will individually suffer additional tax consequences and additional liability exposure to cover the Fund's obligations. Petitioners alleged that all improper expenditures should be reimbursed to the Fund to reduce the amounts for which Fund members might ultimately be jointly and severally liable. Additionally,\n   Petitioners sought an accounting and a declaration that Fund assets could not be used for the purpose of establishing a mutual insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting eight separate bases for dismissal, including (1) the circuit court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint involved the internal affairs of a trust, which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) that the action was derivative in nature and did not meet the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents' motions sought protection from responding to Petitioners' discovery requests during the pendency of the motions; incorporated by reference an affidavit of the Fund's administrator, to which twelve separate exhibits were attached; and stated \"the Court will be asked, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, to consider matters outside of the Complaint and treat the motion as one for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 4, 2012, a hearing was held on Respondents' motions to dismiss, during which the circuit court indicated it was inclined to dismiss the complaint based on the probate court's exclusive jurisdiction of the internal affairs of trusts and requested proposed orders. On January 30, 2013, after the hearing but before the circuit court issued its written order, Petitioners sent a written demand letter to Respondents' counsel itemizing specific requests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In particular, our clients believe the following actions are necessary and should be taken on behalf of the [F]und:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. The $5,000,000 which was taken out of the [F]und as excess funds to establish a competing mutual fund should be distributed immediately to the beneficiaries of the Trust as it is not needed for the operation of the South Carolina Builders Self Insurers Fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. An accounting should be made of all remaining funds in custody of the South Carolina Home Builders Self Insurers Fund. All funds not necessary to insure liability should be distributed to members of the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3. Elections have not been held as required by the Trust documents. Elections should be held for all positions of the Trustees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   4. The Trust should be dissolved as it appears in the Trustees' decision that a competing entity should be set up and that the Trust no longer serves its functions. As a result, the Trust should be dissolved with requisite amounts kept on hand to insure against future liabilities with the remaining assets distributed to members of the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   5. All assets contemplated for use by the Mutual Fund and purchased with that intent should be sold with the proceeds to be distributed to beneficiaries of the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The letter also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [We] believe previous correspondence in the lawsuit set forth the basis for these requests of the Trust. We are just sending this to you to make clear to you that under Rule 23 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure we are asking that these actions be taken. [We] believe these requests have already been made to you as well as your clients. It is our understanding that your clients have refused to take these actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   If your clients' position is any different, please let [us] know so we can discuss this matter. If [we] do not hear from you regarding this, [we] will assume your clients refuse to take the actions as requested above, and we will take appropriate action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Respondents did not immediately respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 5, 2013, the circuit court issued a written order of dismissal finding \"[i]t is clear from the documents submitted\n   to the Court that this dispute concerns a trust\" and concluding the circuit court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the dismissal was without prejudice, allowing Plaintiffs to refile their complaint in Probate Court and subsequently remove the re-filed matter back to circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Still having received no response to their January 30, 2013 letter, Petitioners refiled their lawsuit in probate court on April 9, 2013, alleging the same causes of action and including a new paragraph, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   8. To the extent required by South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the Plaintiffs allege:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   a. The Plaintiffs were beneficiaries of the trust at all times relevant including when the transactions complained of were made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   b. The Plaintiffs, their agents or others on their behalf have made efforts to obtain the action they desire in this matter including correspondence to counsel for the Defendants, meetings with counsel for the Defendants, correspondence to the Trust and a previous lawsuit to no avail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The re-filed suit was removed to circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Respondents moved to dismiss this second complaint, alleging, among other things, that the lawsuit\n   <em>\n    did not involve a trust\n   </em>\n   but rather was a shareholder derivative action and that the complaint failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) and therefore should be dismissed; Respondents submitted an affidavit in support of their motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ultimately, the circuit court dismissed Petitioners' complaint, finding the Fund was an unincorporated association, not a trust, and that the complaint was therefore subject to Rule 23(b)(1). The circuit court held that the complaint failed to comply with Rule 23(b)(1). Petitioners then filed a Rule 59(e) motion, arguing the pre-suit demand was properly made and that the trial court's order elevated form over substance. In their motion, Petitioners also sought to supplement or amend their pleadings if more detailed pleadings were required. The circuit court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed, finding the circuit court properly concluded (1) the Fund was an unincorporated association and not a trust; (2) Petitioners' claims were derivative in nature; and (3) Petitioners'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   complaint was properly dismissed as it did not properly allege a pre-suit demand as required by Rule 23(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.
