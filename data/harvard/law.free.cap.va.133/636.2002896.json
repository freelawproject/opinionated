There were two witnesses. One in substance testified that he knew the accused; that he went to a car in the dark; that there were three or four men there, but he did not know who they were; that he bought two pints of whiskey, reaching into the car to get it; and that he did not recognize the accused as being present, and did not- know that he had bought any whiskey from him within twelve months prior to the dat\u00e9 of the indictment. The other witness, upon whose testimony the accused had just been convicted of the illegal sale of whiskey, testified that he bought whiskey from him at other times than those to which he had testified in the previous trial, but could not remember the times or dates of such other purchases. After this, upon being further pressed, he said that the other purchases were \u201cwithin the last twelve months.\u201d Inasmuch as the indictment was found May 6, 1921, and the trial occurred September 16, 1921, this doubtful evidence falls short of showing that these other sales by the accused occurred within twelve months prior to May 6, 1921, as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The verdict will therefore be set aside as unsupported by the evidence, the judgment reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth shall be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
