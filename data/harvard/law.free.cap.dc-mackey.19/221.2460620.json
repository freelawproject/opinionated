It is plain the present suit is neither \u201c an action on the case for words,\u201d nor \u201can action of trespass of assault, battery, wounding and imprisonment, or any of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">An action for negligence is generally presented by an action on the case; though where the wrong is done maliciously, and by the defendant himself, it may be brought in trespass. The limitation in either of those forms of action is three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>The ruling below sustaining the demiorrer is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
