It is not a lease or agreement for hiring. It is not for a definite or specific term. It contains no covenant on the part of the alleged lessors, nor is it executed by them. It is evident that the form of a lease is used to cover the real transaction between the parties. It could not have been the intention that the large sum of $325' should be paid as rent for the piano. If so, why provide for conveying the same if the payments of the rent are complied with? If the payments were merely intended as rent, why provide that on failure to make anyone of them \u201cthe payments heretofore made shall be forfeited?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-9\">The transaction is not changed by the agreement assuming the form of a lease. \u201c The courts look to the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of the parties, and if that purpose be to give the vendor a lien on the property until payment in full of the purchase money, it is liable to be defeated by creditors of the vendee who is in possession of it.\u201d Hervey <em>vs. </em>Locomotive Works, 93 U.

C. On the 18th day of December, A. D. 1885, they delivered to Henry Ewald of said city the piano in controversy under the following agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Agreement for leasing from Sanders and Stayman, Baltimore, Md.:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">One J. <em>&amp; </em>C. Fischer upright piano, style \u201c H,\u201d No. 64,926, \u25a0with the privilege of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">This certifies that I have rented of Sanders and Stayman, one J. &amp; C. Fischer piano, numbered 64,926. The said piano I have rented on the following terms :</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">I agree to pay as rent for the use of said piano the sum of three hundred and twenty-five dollars, as follows, viz: December 18,1885, thirty-five dollars paid on piano number 26,677, and ten dollars on the 18th day of each and every succeeding month until the amount of three hundred and twenty-five dollars is fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">On failure to pay any of the said amounts as above st\u00e1ted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>on demand being made, the payments heretofore made shall be forfeited, and the said Sanders and Stayman shall be restored to their said Fischer piano and may take the same into their possession, and I agree to deliver the same to them or their agents; but if the payments are made according to the aforesaid terms, then the said Sanders and Stayman are to convey to me said piano and give me a bill of sale absolute for the same, made out and delivered to me on making the last payment as agreed. The property in said piano it is agreed shall, until the last payment is made, be and remain in Sanders and Stayman, and shall at all times be used only in the city of Washington, District'of Columbia. And it is further agreed that if 1 shall sell, or offer for sale, remove, or attempt to remove, the said piano from corner of Eighteenth and L streets, N. W., without the written consent of said Sanders and Stayman or their agents, then and in that case they or their agents, shall resume actual possession of said piano, and the payments heretofore made shall be in full for the use thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Witness my hand at Washington, D. C., this 18th day of December, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">H. Ewald. [seal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Witness: E. T. Paull.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">That said Ewald took said piano to his residence and remained in continual possession thereof and used the same until July 13, 1887, when it was levied upon by the defendant under and by virtue of a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued against said Ewald in cause No. 27, 804, Law, of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">That there has been paid by said Ewald to the plaintiffs the siim of two hundred and five dollars on account of said piano, as is indorsed upon said agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">That the said agreement has never been placed upon record in said District.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">That the value of said piano is, as stated in the agreement hereinbefore referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">April 4, 1888, the case was submitted to the court and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>judgment rendered for the plaintiff for one cent damages and the costs. Appeal by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In order to determine the rights of the parties to this controversy, it is essential to ascertain the character of the agreement in evidence. To do this \u201c courts look to the purpose of the parties \u201d as evidenced by the agreement and its provisions and applyingthe law determine the real character of the transaction. While the instrument in evidence recites that Ewald has \u201c rented \u201d the piano and that he has agreed to pay as rent for the use of the same certain sums of money at the times therein mentioned and that upon failure to make any of the payments the piano shall be immediately restored to Sanders and Stayman; and it is further provided that upon full payment of three hundred and twenty-five dollars, the latter are to convey the piano to Ewald and give him a bill of sale absolute for the same. It is further agreed that the property in said piano shall until the last payment is made be and remain in Sanders and Stayman. We think the fair construction of this instrument is that the parties intended thereby a conditional sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">It is plainly expressed in the contract that the property in the piano is to remain in the vendor until compliance by the vendee with the conditions therein named. No actual fraudulent intent is alleged or proved in the transaction. Under such circumstances the case comes within the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in Harkness <em>vs. </em>Russell, 118 U. S., 663. In that case it was held that \u201c in the absence of fraud, an agreement for a conditional sale, of personal property, accompanied by deliveiy, is good and valid as well against third persons as against tire parties to the transaction.\u201d And further that \u201ca bailee of personal property, who receives it under an agreement .that he may purchase it on the performance of conditions on his part, cannot convey title to it, or subject it to execution for his own debts until performance of the conditions on which the agreement to sell is made.\u201d And the court further held that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>instrument construed to be an \u201c executory conditional sale\u201d not shown to be fraudulent, was not a mortgage and though not recorded in accordance with the registry acts relating to the recording of chattel mortgages, was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Justice Bradley elaborately reviews not only .all of the previous decisions of the Supreme Court, but the authorities generally upon this subject, and reaches the conclusions before indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We are cited by counsel to Bridget vs. Cornish, 1 Mackey, 32, as establishing the contrary doctrine. The contract in that case did not, as in the case at bar, contain an express reservation of title to the vendor. The court there found that a qualified title passed to the vendee vesting an equity in him. If, however, the latter case is to be considered as holding the law to be in any wise different from the conclusions of the court in Harkness vs. Russell, the latter must prevail in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We are also cited to Cannon vs. McMichael, 6 Mackey, 225, by defendant\u2019s counsel. That case holds that \u201c the Maryland Act of 1729, Chap. 8, Secs. 5 and 6, requiring a bill of sale of personal property whereof the grantor remains in possession to be recorded within twenty days from its execution, is in force in this District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the case at bar, however, as we have seen, we have instead of a bill of sale, a memorandum of an agreement evidencing an executory, conditional sale and expressly providing that the title shall remain in the vendor until the performance of conditions; hence Cannon vs. McMichael has no application. In law the real relation of Sanders and Stayman with Ewald was that of bailor and bailee until performance of the conditions named in the contract. There is no more reason to say that such a relation was fraudulent in this case than in any other case of bailment where no actual fraudulent intent is shown. A bailee in possession of personal property apparently his own cannot sell it to another who has or has not notice of the title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>simply because he has nothing to sell \u2014 no title which he can transfer. The question of good faith on the part of the purchaser is not involved in this case any more than in Harkness <em>vs. </em>Russell, though it is admitted that there are some cases where the contrary doctrine against the great weight of authority, however, has in the instance of conditional sales been upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">Holding, then, as we do, that the . agreement shown in the record of this case is evidence of a conditional sale of the piano, the title to remain in'the vendor until full payment by the vendee, and that as a matter of law, such an agreement is valid and efficient to protect the title of the vendor until performance of the conditions, it follows that under the agreed facts stated in the record, this action was rightly brought by the plaintiffs without previous demand, and the Circuit Court properly rendered judgment against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
