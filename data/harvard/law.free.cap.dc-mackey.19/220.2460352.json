The plaintiff recovered a judgment for $3,000 for injuries suffered by means of the defendant\u2019s negligence in allowing a dangerous defect in a sidewalk to remain unrepaired and unguarded. The verdict was evidently based upon a finding that the injury to the plaintiff ?s arm was permanent, and that this extent of the injury was the natural consequence of the original injury. We find that the physician who \u25a0attended the plaintiff testified that it needed not to be permanent ; that the plaintiff refused to follow his instructions to use her arm, and that such use would have made it more serviceable. We are convinced by an examination \u25a0of the evidence that the plaintiff herself caused a large part of the results of \"the injury shown at the trial, and that the verdict is therefore excessive in contemplation of law. If a remittitur of $1,500 is entered the judgment will stand affirmed ; <em>otherwise a new trial will he ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
