The Chief Justice ordered the writ to issue and the matter was certified to be heard here in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"AWy\">It must of course be conceded that the Police Court has no jurisdiction to try the offense of an assault with intent to kill; and that any justice of this court has ample power to admit the petitioner to bail before the hearing, which must be had before the Criminal Court of the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It is equally clear the Police Court has the power to admit to bail any person tried before that court who appeals from its decision to the Criminal Court; and also any person who has been examined by that court, and ordered to be bound over for the action of the grand jury. The question for our consideration is whether the judge of the Police Court has also authority to admit to bail, <em>before an examination or hearing before him, and to await such examination, </em>a person held by the marshal charged with a crime <em>which the Police Court has.no jurisdiction to- try?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">It was insisted the Police Court possesses that authority, first, as the successor, in somewise, to the powers of the justices of the peace before the organization of that court; and also by force of express statutory grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">It is perfectly settled that justices <em>at the common law </em>had no such authority. This is well explained by Circuit Judge Woodruff, in U. S. <em>vs. </em>Case, 8 Blatchford, 253, who shows that the positive duty of those officers to complete with promptness their examination of charges against persons under arrest [an unreasonable prolongation of which subjected them to an action] was stringently maintained, because the justice had no power to admit to bail until the examination was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The existence of such authority in justices of the peace must therefore be found in some statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>We are referred to the 33d section of the judiciary act of 1789, R. S. U. S., 1014 as conferring such statutory authority. But this section in terras authorizes the justices of the peace to take bail \u201cfor trial <em>before such court </em>of the United States as <em>by law has cognizance of the-offense.\u201d </em>Of course it furnished no authority for a justice of the peace to admit a person to bail to appear before an examining magistrate for a preliminary hearing, when that magistrate \u201cby law has no cognizance of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">A later act, 1867, Chap. 63, Sec. 6, requires justices of the peace, in all criminal cases <em>in which they have jurisdiction </em>to allow the defendant reasonable time to obtain bail; but this also could not -apply to a case where bail was asked for <em>before the hearing, </em>and in a case where the justice was <em>ivithout jurisdiction to try.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Even if the language of these statutes were of doubtful import in limiting the authority conferred to the cases where the justices have cognizance of the offense, the court would be obliged to incline to this construction, because the opposite view would be in derogation of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">It seems clear, then, that the Police Court could not have derived the authority in question merely as successor to the criminal jurisdiction of justices of the peace in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Next, has the authority been specially conferred upon the Police Court or its judge by statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The Police Court was established by the Act of June 17, 1870, Chap. 33, Rev. Stats. D. C. Its jurisdiction as to deeds of violence was limited to \u201csimple assaults and batteries,\u201d and similar offenses, by 1049. By-1051, \u201cthe judge of the Police Court <em>may examine and commit and hold to bail </em>in all offenses, whether cognizable in the Police Court or in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,\u201d and this section, \u2022it is claimed, confers the jurisdiction referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">But as the power to commit in' this unlimited class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>cases was the result and accompaniament of the examination, so the power <em>to hold to bail </em>was the result only of such <em>examination. </em>The authority of the Police Court to hold to bail in any case after an examination is undoubted. But this is a very different thing from the power claimed by the petitioner here, which is to admit to bail <em>in advance </em>of an examination, and in a case not cognizable in the Police Court. The language of the section taken distributively would read thus: \u201cThe judge of the Police Court may examine and commit, and <em>examine and hold to bail,\u201d &amp;c., </em>and this we think would express a little more clearly the meaning of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On July 10, 1870 (Sec. 998, R. S. D. C.), a month after the establishment of the Police Court, Congress declared \"that justices of the peace should no longer \u201cexercise any jurisdiction over crimes and offenses, either for examination to commit or hold to bail.\u201d This language also shows the power to bail there spoken.of was to be exercised only <em>after examination, </em>and was not supposed to extend to an admission to bail <em>in advance of an examination. </em>We conclude that the Police Court had acquired by its organic act only what the justices of the peace, a month afterwards, were distinctly deprived of.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">It might be a convenience if this power were conferred by law upon the Police Court, but we cannot find that such authority has thus far been confided to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We therefore agree with the judge of the Police Court that he was without authority to comply with the application, under the circumstances before him. Of course, he was right not to assume to do so, as his act might have worked mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">It is well settled an unauthorized recognizance is void. United States <em>vs. </em>Rumbolt, 2 Curtis C. C., 41, 45; United States <em>vs. </em>Horton, 2 Dillon C. C., 94 ; United States <em>vs. </em>Wans, 2 Blatchf. C. C., 332; United States <em>vs. </em>Case., 8 Blatchf. C. C., 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>In the last case the court held the statutes conferred no power upon a United States Commissioner to take bail for the appearance at a future day, of a person charged, <em>for examination, </em>before a committing magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">See also Hosmer <em>vs. </em>Charter Oak Life Insurance Co., 1 Mackey, 297; Wallace <em>vs. </em>Pratt, 4 Mackey, 259/</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>We shall pass an order remanding the petitioner to the custody of the marshal. The petitioner can then apply for bail to any justice of this cou/rt.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
