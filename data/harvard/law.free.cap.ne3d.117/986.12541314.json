Shine-Johnson, appeals a decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas convicting him of murder and tampering with evidence. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 18, 2015, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01 ; one count of murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02 ; and one count of tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A), arising from the fatal shooting of appellant's father, Joseph Bythewood (\"Joe\"). Each count included an associated firearm specification pursuant to R.C 2941.145(A). Appellant entered a plea of not guilty, and the case proceeded to a jury trial where appellant argued he shot his father in self-defense. A summary of relevant evidence adduced at trial follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In May 2015, Joe and his girlfriend, Maureen Quinn, moved into a house with their daughter, Alexis, and Maureen's minor son. Joe and Maureen also allowed appellant, Joe's son from his prior marriage to Lauren Shine, to live in the basement of the house. Lauren lived near Joe and Maureen's house. Appellant had lived in Lauren's house previously and still had belongings there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Maureen owed appellant money because he paid to have one of her cars released from the impound lot. On the day of the shooting, September 10, 2015, appellant posted a social media update referencing money and stating \"just don't play with me love or me money, that's when it becomes tombstone\" and posting a \"meme\" with text which read, \"[w]atch who you're being loyal too [sic], don't fuck around and make an ass out of yourself doing all the\n   right shit for the wrong motherfucker.\" (Tr. Vol. 5 at 946; Tr. Vol. 4 at 789; State's Ex. 115.) Alexis saw the post and believed appellant was upset about Maureen not repaying him. Appellant testified the comment was a quote from a line in the movie\n   <em>\n    Tombstone\n   </em>\n   and was \"[j]ust a random post. It's dealing with the situation. I mean, it's just [a] random quote.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 787.) He denied it was posted in regard to the conflict he had with Maureen, denied it was a threat at all, and testified that he could not see how it could be considered a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Maureen testified that on the day of the shooting, the air conditioner was not working so she attempted to go to the basement where the fuses were located. She found the stairs blocked with ropes, screwdrivers, and at least one knife, and saw a bucket of water with some sort of battery charger plugged in nearby at the bottom of the stairs. Fearing she may be injured, Maureen opted not to go downstairs and told Joe about the situation. Appellant denied he had \"booby-trapped\" the basement. (Tr. Vol. 5 at 993.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant got a ride to work that day with Barbara Dick, a friend from work who lived nearby. Barbara did not notice anything unusual about appellant. After work, appellant watched a movie with Barbara at her house. Appellant testified that while he was watching the movie he had an argument, via text, with Maureen about repayment of the money she owed him, which ultimately resulted in Maureen texting him \"don't text me, don't talk to me anymore, leave me alone, talk to your dad.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 800.) According to appellant, he nearly immediately also received a text from Joe saying \"bring your ass home.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 806.) He told Barbara that \"things are getting bad\" and that he had to go home to handle a family issue. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 806.) Appellant knew Joe had a short temper and could get violent, which was a concern for him, but he testified that he did not expect he would be assaulted when he got home and was not looking to harm his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} According to Barbara, near the end of the movie, appellant received a text and told Barbara he needed to go home immediately and that \"it wasn't going to end well.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 453.) Barbara noted appellant's mood completely changed, like a \"bulb just flashed right off,\" and he seemed sad and quiet. (Tr. Vol. 3 at 454.) Barbara drove appellant home; during the drive, Barbara asked appellant if everything was okay and again appellant stated \"it wasn't going to end well.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 454.) Appellant asked Barbara to pull into the driveway to the right of the house, and she stopped just short of the end of the house. Appellant asked her if she would stay there because, according to appellant, he was worried about what would happen and had a \"gut feeling that there was going to be an argument.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 817.) Barbara did wait in the car once appellant exited and began to read a book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Inside the house, Maureen testified that after dinner and watching a movie in the living room with her kids, she started up the stairs leading to the second floor bedrooms and heard a loud noise that she described as a \"[d]oor slam, things getting thrown\" from the kitchen area. (Tr. Vol. 2 at 190.) She continued upstairs, then heard Joe and appellant arguing, both sounding \"very aggravated and mad.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 194.) She heard \"get out of my face,\" appellant yelling about her and money for the impound charge, and them running up and down the basement steps. (Tr. Vol. 2 at 195.) Maureen thought the argument lasted about 10 or 15 minutes; she stayed upstairs in order to try to calm her son and the dogs down until the argument\n   escalated to the point that she told her kids to call 911, and she proceeded down the stairs. At that point, she saw the two men arguing near the basement door, then appellant said he was leaving and walked out the back kitchen door with Joe behind him in the kitchen; Maureen did not see anything in Joe's hands. According to Maureen, Joe was in the process of closing and locking the back door when appellant kicked it back in. The door flew open. Joe lost his footing and then turned around to face outside of the door. Maureen heard Joe ask \"so you're just going to shoot your dad?\" and appellant responded \"[y]ep,\" followed by a gunshot. (Tr. Vol. 2 at 207.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Maureen testified she shut the back door and dead-bolted it. As she turned around, another gunshot came through the glass of the back door, and glass struck her in the back of the head. She yelled \"I got hit\" but then realized she was not bleeding and diverted her attention back to Joe, who was asking her for help. (Tr. Vol. 2 at 208.) She ran upstairs to get her cell phone to call 911. When she came back downstairs, Joe had pulled himself to the living room. Both Maureen and her daughter were on the phone with 911 and attempting to apply pressure on his wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Maureen, on cross-examination, remembered telling the police she could not say at what point appellant had a gun because they were going from downstairs to outside as she was dealing with her son and dogs upstairs. She also agreed she told the police that she did not remember the color of appellant's shirt because she really did not see him. On redirect, Maureen confirmed that although she was upstairs dealing with the dogs and her son during the argument, she came downstairs and witnessed the critical moment of Joe standing in the doorway and suffering the gunshot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Alexis testified that on the day of the shooting, when she came home from work the 20-gauge shotgun, which she knew did not work and which was usually stored in the closet, was lying on the couch. Later that evening, she was upstairs with her mom when she heard appellant come into the house and the sounds of things slamming. She heard her dad ask appellant if he was okay and then the two of them arguing about money in the kitchen. When Alexis briefly came down stairs to get her dog, she did not see her dad with any weapons or threatening appellant. She returned upstairs to her bedroom, put the dog down, and heard a gunshot from outside below her bedroom window. She heard both her mom and dad screaming, went downstairs, and called 911. The 911 call was played for the jury and admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Sheena Bythewood, Joe's niece, testified that she came over after the shooting while the police were still present. She testified that both Maureen and Alexis, speaking with her together, told her Joe had the 20-gauge in his pant leg all day waiting for appellant to come home. On cross-examination, Sheena testified Alexis must be lying in testifying that she and Maureen were put in the back of separate police cruisers before she arrived and that Alexis was permitted to hug Sheena and get back in the cruiser. She testified she had no knowledge that everyone was at work and not with Joe throughout the day. Finally, she agreed that she talked with appellant \"all the time.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 726.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} According to appellant, once he was inside the house, Joe began yelling at him saying that appellant had accused everyone of stealing from him. Joe pushed him in the kitchen and again on the stairs to the basement. In the basement, appellant\n   testified that Joe kicked things, threw stuff around, picked up a telescope and swung it at appellant's head, which appellant dodged, and carried the telescope into the kitchen. Alexis later saw the telescope and a large pot, usually kept in the basement, were in the kitchen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Both men proceeded upstairs again. Appellant testified he wanted to leave at that point, but Joe accused appellant of threatening Maureen on social media and stated they did not owe appellant money because he had not paid rent. When Joe said the loan would not be repaid, appellant said he would sue Maureen. According to appellant, this made Joe \"very angry,\" and Joe picked up a knife that was on the table and said \"I'm gonna fuck you up.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 826, 827.) Appellant thought Joe was going to stab him, but, according to appellant, Joe set the knife back down, retrieved a 20-gauge shotgun from under a blanket on the couch, pressed it in appellant's face and chest, and called appellant a \"punk mother fucker.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 827.) Joe backed appellant into the kitchen with the gun aimed at appellant at close range. Appellant testified he began to fear for his life and thought Joe was going to shoot him. Appellant panicked and ran to the basement because Joe was blocking the back door. He could not call the police because his cell phone was \"dead\" and was still charging, and there was no land line. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 833.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant testified he got a 12-gauge shotgun from the basement and went back upstairs to try to flee. According to appellant, no one but Joe was present. Joe aimed the 20-gauge shotgun at appellant. Appellant asked \"you're going to shoot me?\" and took off running toward the back door. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 836.) Joe followed, and as appellant got the back door open and tried to step onto the stairs, Joe hit him with the back of the shotgun, causing appellant to miss several steps and stumble forward into the yard. Appellant turned around to see where Joe was and saw him standing in the doorway, as if he was going to step onto the porch, with the shotgun aimed in appellant's direction. According to appellant, he believed Joe was going to shoot him. Unable to \"outrun a bullet\" and with \"nowhere for [him] to run,\" appellant fired his shotgun while it was still at hip level without having a chance to aim. (Tr. Vol. 4 at 841.) Joe jumped back, but appellant was unaware whether his first shot hit his father. Still perceiving a threat, he immediately fired a second shot as the back door was still open and then he chambered but did not fire another round. After he went away from the door, he heard someone scream \"he shot my dad.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 844.) Appellant testified he walked away from the house to Barbara's car and then went to his mother's house and told her what happened. Not feeling safe there, he put the shotgun in his mother's basement on top of his suitcases, walked to his girlfriend's house, and then turned himself in to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Barbara, still parked in her car in the driveway, heard arguing from inside the home that she believed lasted about three or four minutes. She could not see the back door itself but heard it open. According to Barbara, appellant, holding a shotgun, walked away from the house and into about the \"middle or little bit past the middle\" of the yard. (Tr. Vol. 3 at 461.) He then turned around, fired a shot leveled at the house, and fired a second shot in the air at an angle that Barbara thought would be high enough to go over the house. Appellant walked back toward Barbara's car, and she rolled down the window and asked him if he was all right. Appellant said \"I shot him\" and then he \"took off running.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 463.) Barbara\n   called 911 and stayed to speak with detectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Paramedics and law enforcement arrived. Law enforcement noted a shotgun in the living room laying \"far enough away that [the responding officers] were rather confident that [Joe] was not going to be able to reach it.\" (Tr. Vol. 2 at 93.) Maureen testified it had belonged to Joe's father and Joe inherited it, and it was common knowledge to the family, including appellant, the gun did not work. Appellant testified he believed it worked and that Joe kept ammunition for it in the house. A crime scene detective documenting evidence at the scene noted \"possible blood\" on the 20-gauge, and a forensic examination showed it was loaded with one live cartridge but inoperable due to a missing firing pin. (Tr. Vol. 3 at 545.) A forensic scientist with the Columbus Division of Police Crime Laboratory testified that, when assembled, a person could not tell if the gun was operable by looking at it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Mark Butler testified that he was living with Lauren, appellant's mother, at the time of the shooting. Mark learned appellant had left a shotgun in the basement of his home. He used a towel to move the gun outside in the front yard and later called the police to report the discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Joe was pronounced dead at the hospital. According to the coroner's report, Joe died from a shotgun wound of the abdomen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On February 24, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the aggravated murder charge and guilty to the murder and tampering with evidence charges and associated specifications. The trial court sentenced him to a prison term of 19 years to life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Cohabitant Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellant first challenges the trial court's rejection of his proposed instruction regarding cohabitants and the \"no duty to retreat\" rule as it relates to self-defense. (Appellant's Brief at 44.) The jury instruction at issue given by the court states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A person has a duty to retreat unless he is in his residence * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Residence\" means a dwelling in which a person lives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A \"dwelling\" means a building of any kind that has a roof over it and is designed to be occupied by people at night. A building includes an attached porch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (February 24, 2017 Jury Instructions at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant objected to this instruction and requested an instruction that \"there's no duty to retreat from one's own home before resorting to the use of force and self-defense against a cohabitant with an equal right to be in the home.\" (Tr. Vol. 4 at 896.) Appellant argues this instruction is relevant since appellant was a cohabitant with his father, was necessary to instruct the jury since he was assaulted inside the home prior to trying to escape through the backyard, was not redundant since the instructions given by the court did not address cohabitants, and was prejudicial since plaintiff-appellee, the State of Ohio, had elicited testimony that appellant was not on the lease, was not paying rent, and was not part of the original family unit, all of which implied he had a lesser\n   right to be at the home. Appellant also suggests that additional instructions-that a defendant has to rule out all other means of escape before using force, could not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger, must not seek a fight armed with a dangerous weapon, and must withdraw from a fight he started-confused and contradicted the instruction regarding not retreating from one's own home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellee argues it is undisputed that at the time of the shooting, appellant was not in the house and that the only evidence before the jury was that appellant was outside the house when he fired the shot that killed his father. As a result, appellee argues the cohabitant instruction would have been inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Under Ohio law, self-defense is an affirmative defense which a defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence. R.C. 2901.05(A) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820787\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/21/91/#p94\">\n    21 Ohio St.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20N.E.2d%20166\">\n    488 N.E.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). To prove self-defense, a defendant must prove that he: (1) was not at fault in creating the situation that gave rise to the fight; (2) had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that the use of force was his only means of escape; and (3) he did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This understanding aligns with the definitions set forth in Ohio's no duty to retreat statutes.

Considering all the above,\n   we find appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to provide a jury instruction on the no duty to retreat rule extending to cohabitants or that the lack of such an instruction constitutes reversible error in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

According to appellant, this is a correct statement of the law pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-5630\">\n    2016-Ohio-5630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.E.3d%20189\">\n    62 N.E.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18, and the failure to give the instruction increased the probability of prejudice to appellant in light of the prosecutor's alleged misstatement of law that by raising self-defense appellant admitted murder and that appellee's burden of proof was therefore \"done.\" (Appellant's Brief at 46.) Appellee counters that appellant's requested instruction was already apparent from the instructions given by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The relevant jury instructions given by the trial court stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   If the defendant fails to establish self-defense, the State still must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of an offense before you can convict the defendant of that offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * * Consult with one another.

However, you should not surrender your honest convictions in order to be congenial or to reach a verdict solely because of the opinion of other jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Before you can find the defendant guilty, you must unanimously agree on the verdict.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Emphasis added.)

The\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   court noted that \"[i]n the normal situation based on the standard unanimity instruction, the jury's finding of guilt is an implicit rejection of the affirmative defense because the unanimity instruction requires the jury to act as one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. However,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   was not \"the normal situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, after the court gave a standard unanimity instruction, the jury inquired whether they must unanimously find that the defendant acted in self-defense, and the trial court gave a supplemental, erroneous instruction that essentially stated all jurors must find appellant guilty unless they unanimously accepted appellant's self-defense argument. Jury polling showed at least one juror would have found the defendant not guilty based on an affirmative showing of self-defense. With the record clear that there was no unanimous verdict in the case, the appellate court reversed and ordered a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Unlike\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , in this case, the trial court did not instruct the jurors that they all must find appellant guilty unless they unanimously accepted appellant's self-defense argument, and the record had no clear indication that a juror would have found appellant not guilty based on self-defense. As noted by\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the standard\n   unanimity instruction is generally sufficient, and the jury's finding of guilt is an implicit rejection of appellant's self-defense argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by appellant's argument that the prosecutor's alleged misstatement of law during her closing argument regarding appellant admitting \"murder\" and therefore appellee's burden of proof being \"done\" added to the need for this requested jury instruction. (Appellant's Brief at 39.) As discussed in depth in the first assignment of error, below, the prosecutor's statement does not rise to the level of error when considered in the larger context of the closing argument. The prosecutor repeatedly emphasized appellee had the burden to prove each element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and was making the point appellant admitted to purposeful killing, which, pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, is expressly defined as murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Overall, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to add appellant's requested unanimity instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Character Evidence Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellant contends the trial court erred in not providing a limiting instruction pertaining to evidence admitted related to an allegation that appellant caused a younger, autistic stepbrother to seek treatment for a concussion in order to show his propensity for violence and which was unfairly prejudicial in violation of Evid.R. 403(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 41} \"When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request of a party, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.\" Evid.R. 105. The rule on character evidence, Evid.R. 404, provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (A) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, subject to the following exceptions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same is admissible * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (3) Character of witness. Evidence of the character of a witness on the issue of credibility is admissible as provided in Rules 607 [Impeachment], 608 [Evidence of character and conduct of witness], and 609 [Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (B) Other crimes, wrongs or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Proof of character may be made by testimony as to reputation, by testimony in the form of opinion, or, on cross-examination, by inquiry into a relevant specific instance of conduct under Evid.R 405(B). Thus, when a defendant introduces evidence of a particular character trait, usually peacefulness in a trial involving a violent offense, the defendant \"opens the door\" for the prosecution, which is then permitted to rebut or impeach this character evidence on cross-examination.

The cross-examination\n   may include inquiry into relevant specific instances of conduct. Evid.R. 405(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Here, appellee called Alexis on direct. Appellant, in cross-examining Alexis, asked whether she knew appellant to be a violent person and whether he was \"one to go out and just try to cause harm to other people,\" which Alexis answered in the negative, and whether appellant tends to try to walk away from confrontation and tends to \"bring the peace,\" which Alexis answered in the positive. (Tr. Vol. 3 at 416.) On redirect, appellee asked Alexis about her answers to these questions, followed by asking whether she knew of violence he committed and beginning to ask her to \"[t]ell us about him and [his younger stepbrother], the concussion [the stepbrother] got.\" (Tr. Vol. 3 at 420.) Appellant objected and the parties conducted a voir dire examination of Alexis out of the presence of the jury. The court then disallowed appellee from questioning Alexis about the specific instance of violence because she did not have personal knowledge of the incident but allowed questioning regarding her awareness of situations in which he had gotten into fights generally. Appellee then resumed questioning of Alexis as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Referring specifically to the questions [defense counsel] asked you about your brother's character trait for peacefulness, do you remember those questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. It was your answer on cross-examination that you know your brother to be a peaceful man, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. But, in fact, you also know of more than one incident of where he did not act in a peaceful, peacemaker way, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. Okay. And, in fact, you have direct knowledge of at least one of those incidents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 3 at 438-39.) Appellant denied being involved with any physical altercations with other members of his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Our review of the transcript shows appellant introduced evidence of appellant's character trait of peacefulness, opening the door for appellee to rebut or impeach this evidence. This is an exception to Evid.R. 404's prohibition against admitting evidence of a person's character or a trait of character for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. Evid.R. 404(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Moreover, the specific information that appellant deems prejudicial-the inference that appellant gave his young, autistic family member a concussion-was contained within the prosecutor's question. The trial court instructed the jury that \"[e]vidence is all the testimony received from the witnesses, the exhibits admitted during the trial, and facts agreed to by counsel call [sic] stipulations\" and that \"you must not draw any inference or speculate on the truth of any suggestion included in a question that was not answered.\" (Jury Instructions at 2, 3.) Thus, the information was not \"evidence\" which would be subject to a limiting instruction, and the jury is presumed to follow the trial court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Flight Instruction (Relevant to Tampering)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in including a flight instruction in the jury instructions. The instruction given by the trial court states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Testimony has been admitted indicating that the defendant fled the scene. You are instructed that flight alone does not raise a presumption of guilt but it may tend to indicate the defendant's consciousness of guilt. If you find that the facts do not support that the defendant's flight or if you find that some other motive prompted the defendant's conduct or if you are unable to decide what the defendant's motivation was then you should not consider this evidence for any purpose. However, if you find that the facts support that the defendant engaged in such conduct, and if you decide that the defendant was motivated by a consciousness of guilt, you may, but are not required to, consider that evidence in deciding whether the defendant is guilty of a crime charged. You alone will determine what weight, if any, to give to this evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (Jury Instructions at 1202-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellant objected to this instruction because the evidence showed he left the scene in fear of his safety and there was otherwise insufficient evidence to support the flight instruction. Appellant also asked the court to instruct the jury that it could consider the fact that appellant voluntarily surrendered. Appellee contends there was sufficient evidence to support a flight instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 48} On this record, we agree with appellee. It is undisputed that appellant did not remain at the scene of the shooting but, instead, left the scene and proceeded on foot to his mother's house. He then left his mother's house and went to a second residence before deciding to turn himself in to the police. An inference could be drawn from this evidence that defendant fled the scene and continued to flee because of a consciousness of guilt. If the jury believed appellant's side of the story, the instructions specifically state the jury is free to decide that another motive, such as fear for his safety, prompted him to leave the scene. Furthermore, nothing in the flight instruction negated the jury's ability to consider the fact that appellant voluntarily surrendered. Therefore, we find the flight instruction was appropriate, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Overall, appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court erred or abused its discretion in relation to the jury instructions. Accordingly, we overrule appellant's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sufficiency of the Evidence for Tampering Conviction (Seventh Assignment of Error)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Under his seventh assignment of error, appellant contends his conviction for tampering with evidence with a firearm specification is not supported by sufficient evidence.

He points to evidence that he went to Lauren's house because he was traumatized, told his family what he had done, and put the 12-gauge with some of his things in the basement \"for safety.\" (Appellant's Brief at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Appellant points to evidence supporting his version of events. However, record evidence is present that, if believed, supports appellant's conviction. Appellant, having fired shots into a house, would know a police investigation would likely be instituted. It is undisputed that appellant did not leave the gun at the scene of the shooting but, instead, took the gun to his mother's house and ultimately left it in the basement. Police recovered the gun after Mark called 911 to report his discovery of the gun in the basement. Having viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to appellee, we find a rational trier of fact could have found that appellee proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of tampering with evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Regarding the firearm specification, appellee was required to prove that appellant, while committing the underlying offense of tampering with evidence, had a firearm on or about his person or under his control. R.C. 2941.141(A). Appellant essentially argues that he could not have simultaneously possessed the gun to support the specification while he \"dispossessed\" it or \"removed it from his person\" to support the tampering charge. (Appellant's Brief at 57.) In other words, appellant believes because he left the gun in the basement he did not possess and control a firearm at the point the tampering offense was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Appellant does not argue or provide legal authority that a tampering with evidence and an attendant firearm specification conviction can never co-exist. Rather, appellant argues, here, that commission of tampering with evidence was only committed on his dispossession of the gun in the basement. However, removal of the gun from his person in the basement is not the only operative fact in this case. As stated above, evidence is sufficient to support appellant removed the gun from the scene of the shooting with knowledge that an investigation is likely to be instituted and with purpose to impair its value or availability as evidence in such proceeding or investigation.

Appellant suggests that Maureen, who he believes gave the only testimony countering his version of the fatal moment in the backyard, contradicted herself regarding whether she was actually upstairs at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 63} The evidence in this case shows appellant returned home to what he believed to be a family argument that would not end well, a belief emphasized by him requesting that his friend wait outside with the car. It is apparent that a heated argument occurred between father and son within the residence they shared and that appellant retrieved a shotgun from the basement and left through the back door. The jury then heard two versions of events\n   at the point where appellant exited the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 64} According to Maureen, who testified that she returned downstairs when the argument escalated, Joe was unarmed and attempting to close and lock the back door when appellant kicked it in. After Joe regained his footing in the doorway, Maureen heard appellant reply that he was going to shoot his father followed by a gunshot. Conversely, according to appellant, Joe had threatened him with a telescope, a knife, and the 20-gauge shotgun inside of the home. While appellant was attempting to flee in fear for his life, Joe then hit appellant with the shotgun causing appellant to miss several stairs and stumble out into the yard. Appellant testified that when he turned around, Joe was standing in the doorway aiming in his direction, so, fearing for his life and with nowhere to run, appellant shot back at Joe and then almost immediately shot again because he still perceived a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 65} We do not find the jury lost its way in believing Maureen over appellant. First, contrary to appellant's argument, our review of the transcript does not show that Maureen contradicted herself about whether she was upstairs at the time of the shooting. She testified she was upstairs until the argument escalated at which point she came downstairs. Her testimony regarding her statements to police shed some doubt as to how much of the argument in the kitchen she witnessed but does not show she told the police she was upstairs at the point of the gunshot. \"A defendant is not entitled to a reversal on manifest weight grounds merely because inconsistent evidence was presented at trial.

Furthermore, Maureen's account is strengthened, rather than weakened, by Alexis's testimony. Alexis testified that she was upstairs with her mother at the start of the argument, but, after the gunshot, she heard both her mother and father screaming. Alexis also testified that she did not see her father with weapons when she briefly went downstairs to retrieve her dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Second, appellant's version of events, a panicked episode where he ran for his life out of the kitchen, stumbled into the backyard after being hit with the shotgun, turned back toward the house and fired his gun without time to aim, and fired a second shot while still perceiving a threat, is belied by Barbara's account of appellant walking with his back to the house to the middle or past the middle of the yard, turning and firing the gun, and walking to her car. Appellant's choice to then run away on foot, rather than to stay and explain to police how his father repeatedly assaulted him and aimed a gun at him, tends to indicate appellant's consciousness of guilt.

(Tr. Vol. 5 at 982.) Appellant does not argue that a \"duty to avoid\" is an improper consideration altogether but, instead, essentially believes the prosecutor inappropriately suggested that because appellant returned home to a possible confrontation he was at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray-a separate self-defense requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Contrary to appellant's argument, the prosecutor did not expressly connect the duty to avoid trouble with the not-at-fault element and was instead pursuing a line of questioning directly regarding the duty to avoid the danger. Furthermore, appellant cites no authority to support his claim it is erroneous or prejudicial error for the prosecutor to impliedly connect the duty to avoid trouble with the not-at-fault element. To the contrary, this court has noted the multitude of cases in which facts showing a defendant who chooses to confront the victim with otherwise lawful actions support both the finding that the defendant was at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray and/or a finding that the defendant violated a duty to avoid danger or retreat.\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16 (finding, based on a multitude of similar cases, \"the jury could properly find appellant at fault and/or he did not comply with his duty to avoid danger because he chose to enter a place where he knew the victim and [his ex-girlfriend] would be despite knowing that a confrontation might ensue, he chose to stay in the store even after a confrontation ensued with [his ex-girlfriend], and he chose to follow the victim and [his ex-girlfriend] out of the store and engage in a further confrontation outside instead of staying inside the store or walking away from the volatile situation\"). Therefore, we do not find the prosecutor's conduct to be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Finally, we note, although appellant does not allege the prosecutor misstated the law of duty to retreat from one's home, he argues that the prosecutorial error alleged here was \"compounded by the fact that [appellant] did not have a duty to retreat from his own home.\" (Appellant's Brief at 17-18.) Pursuant to R.C. 2901.09(B), \"a person who lawfully is in that person's residence has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's residence.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-2735\">\n    2013-Ohio-2735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 51 (stating that, contrary to the general rule that a person may not kill in self-defense if he has available a reasonable means of retreat from the confrontation, \"[w]hen a person is attacked in their home, * * * they have no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense\" pursuant to R.C. 2901.09(B) ). The prosecutor's cited statement here did not concern appellant's duty or lack thereof to retreat from danger once inside his own home, and appellant does not cite to case law extending R.C. 2901.09(B) to a defendant's choice to return home to potential trouble. Therefore, we find appellant has not demonstrated error in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Considering all the above, we do not find the prosecutor's statements regarding the \"duty to avoid\" to be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Appellant next contends the prosecutor misstated the law by stating during her closing argument that because appellant had raised self-defense he was \"admitting murder\" and so appellee's burden of proof on the murder count was \"done.\" (Appellant's Brief at 18.)

Furthermore, appellant's substantial rights were not prejudicially affected. The trial court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   First of all, it is your exclusive duty to decide all questions of fact that are submitted\n   to you. In connection with this duty, you must determine the effect and value of the evidence and you must not be influenced in your decision by any sympathy, prejudice, or passion toward any party, witness,\n   <em>\n    or attorney\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   I want you to remember, however, that the attorneys are not witnesses.

(Tr.

There is no indication in the record that the jury failed to follow these instructions. Therefore, appellant's argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Statement of Personal Knowledge of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Appellant contends the prosecutor improperly stated personal knowledge of facts in the following exchange during cross-examination of appellant regarding the social media post:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   Q. And you told this jury yesterday, once again, something random you're just saying, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   A. Yes. It's actually a quote from a movie.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Q. In fact, yeah. I tried to find that quote. You're saying it's from Doc Holliday in\n   <em>\n    Tombstone\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   Q. Well, since I couldn't find that quote --\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Tr. Vol. 5 at 942.) At that point, appellant objected. The court overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued questioning appellant about the meaning of the quote and did not again attempt to state that he could not find it in the movie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   {\u00b6 94} It is improper for a prosecutor in a criminal jury trial to state \"what amounts to testimonial assertions under the pretext that he is merely asking a question.\" (Internal citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Urbina\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7009\">\n    2016-Ohio-7009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20105\">\n    72 N.E.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45. In this case, it appears that the prosecutor began to improperly assert personal knowledge or outside research into the movie\n   <em>\n    Tombstone\n   </em>\n   into the line of questions about the social media post's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   {\u00b6 95} However, the jury was specifically instructed \"[y]ou must not draw any inference or speculate on the truth of any suggestion included in a question that was not answered.\" (Jury Instructions at 3.) The question was not answered, the prosecutor did not reassert the quote was not in the movie, and in follow-up questions appellant had the chance to clarify the quote did not actually include the word \"tombstone\" but, instead, appellant wrote \"becomes tombstone\" as a reference to the movie itself. (Tr. Vol. 5 at 946.) Moreover, whether or not the quote was from or referencing to the movie had little, if any, impact on whether it was nonetheless a veiled threat or not. Considering the above, we do not find appellant was deprived of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Curative Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Appellant challenges the trial court's failure to provide curative instructions in several of the situations already addressed: after sustaining the objection to the duty to avoid comment (rather than question) made by the prosecutor; after\n   refusing to remedy the prosecutor's comment in his closing argument that appellant admitted murder; and after sustaining objections to the prosecutor's statements of personal opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Appellant requested a curative instruction regarding the prosecutor's comment in his closing argument that appellant admitted murder, which the trial court declined to do because of the untimely objection. We have already found the prosecutor did not misstate the law within the context of the closing argument. Therefore, no curative instruction was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Appellant did not request curative instructions in the remaining challenges. In general, where a party fails to follow up its objection with a request for a curative instruction, that party waives its right to assert the error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

Therefore, appellant waived review of this issue, and we decline to address it for the first time here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Strength of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   {\u00b6 99} Appellant argues the evidence supporting appellant's guilt was not strong enough to overcome the prosecutorial misstatements in this case, which potentially lead jurors to completely ignore the self-defense evidence completely. Considering the trial as a whole, we find it clear, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury would have found appellant guilty even absent any misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880108\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/141/254/\">\n    141 Ohio St.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880108\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/141/254/\">\n    2014-Ohio-4751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201096\">\n    23 N.E.3d 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 162 (internal citation omitted) (\"We will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even absent the [prosecutorial] misconduct.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

This argument fails for the same reason as outlined in the above response to the first assignment of error. We find the prosecutor's statements regarding the \"duty to avoid\" to be proper, the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of self-defense, and there is no indication\n   the jury failed to follow the instructions. Therefore, we find no plain error in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 104} Next, appellant argues the prosecutor expressed his own opinion of appellant's guilt when, in his closing argument, the prosecutor stated \"[n]o matter what we decide, no matter what we do, Joe Bythewood is dead in the ground. So, yeah, he did it; no, I don't believe it's in self-defense.\" (Tr. Vol. 5 at 1171.) However, a review of the context of that statement, although not the most clearly stated, shows the prosecutor was discussing the hypothetical situation of jury members erroneously putting themselves into the scene of the crime or family and deciding the case on sympathy, bias, or prejudice. The prosecutor discouraged this impulse and went on to lay out the elements of self-defense. Therefore, on this record, we disagree the prosecutor was actually expressing his own opinion of guilt and find no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 105} Appellant additionally argues the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions of the jury in seeking to have Alexis's 911 call-which contained her stating \"[o]h, my God\" multiple times, that she was scared, and that there was too much blood, \"[t]his is my dad\" and \"this is my daddy,\" pleads for medics to hurry, and crying-to be played for the jury. (Tr. Vol. 3 at 406-07.) Appellant contends the call added nothing to appellee's case and was played to appeal to the jury's emotions. Before the 911 recording was played, defense counsel objected on the basis that the recording was \"duplicitous and place[d] undue emphasis on Alexis's] testimony\" but did not object on the ground that the 911 call was unfairly prejudicial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr.

(Appellant's Brief at 39.) While defense counsel objected and asked for a limiting instruction, he did so after the closing argument. The trial court did not opine on whether the statement was in error but refused to issue a limiting instruction since an objection was not contemporaneously filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   {\u00b6 112} As addressed in the first assignment of error, we do not find that the prosecutor's comments during the closing argument amounted to error. The prosecutor repeatedly emphasized that appellee had the burden to prove each element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and was making the point the appellant admitted to purposeful killing, which, pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, is defined as \"murder.\" The prosecutor then went on to discuss self-defense and her argument as to why the evidence shows he was not justified in killing his father. As a result, we disagree with appellant that a curative instruction was necessary in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   {\u00b6 113} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Cumulative Effect of Errors (Sixth Assignment of Error)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6 114} Under his sixth assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court committed prejudicial error and denied him a right to a fair trial through the cumulative effect of evidentiary errors at trial. We note that although the assignment of error refers to \"evidentiary\" errors, appellant also incorporates contentions regarding prosecutorial misconduct.

Evid.R. 403(A) covers the mandatory exclusion of relevant evidence and\n   states \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree the 911 call only served to inflame the jury. This is a case where the identity of the shooter was established and largely turned on who the jury thought was telling an accurate account of the evening-who the jury believed. Because credibility mattered so much here, the probative value of \"neutral\" evidence bearing on the actual events, such as the 911 call, increased. Furthermore, although the 911 recording of the daughter of the victim in her father's final moments is emotional, we cannot say its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to warrant mandatory exclusion. Evid.R. 403(A). Therefore, we find appellant's argument lacks merit, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   {\u00b6 118} Appellant's next argument in support of cumulative error points to the prosecutor's alleged misstatement of the law of self-defense on the duty to avoid and the prosecutor's statement of personal knowledge of facts (the\n   <em>\n    Tombstone\n   </em>\n   quote). We have already determined that the prosecutor did not misstate the law of self-defense but did improperly attempt to assert personal knowledge of facts based outside the record. As a result, considering all the above, the trial court did not commit multiple errors, the cumulative error principle is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Clay\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, we disagree with appellant's assessment that the prosecutor's alleged misstatements of law, assertions of personal opinion, personal knowledge of facts, appeal to the jury's emotions, without curative instructions, and evidentiary errors resulted in cumulative error and denied him a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   {\u00b6 119} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's sixth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (Fifth Assignment of Error)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   {\u00b6 120} In his fifth assignment of error, appellant contends his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation and that the defendant suffered prejudice as a result.\n   <em>\n    Oteng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1231\">\n    2015-Ohio-1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 86, citing\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Furthermore, we have already concluded the arguments posed by appellant here lack merit, and, as a result, an objection on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct alleged by appellant or the 911 call on the basis asserted by appellant would not likely have been successful. Therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise those objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   {\u00b6 122} Finally, appellant argues his trial counsel's many errors, when considered together, deprived him of a fair trial.

I would therefore vacate the conviction for murder and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   {\u00b6 125} Joseph T. Shine-Johnson was summoned home by his father. Shine-Johnson went home. His complying with his father's demand had nothing to do with any duty to retreat or any duty to avoid injuries. The State of Ohio had simply no legal basis for arguing otherwise. A person who is summoned home by a parent has a right to go home, even if the person summoned fears that bad things could happen once the person arrives home. The prosecution's assertion otherwise had and has simply no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   {\u00b6 126} Further, a person has no duty to retreat from the place where the person is living. Ohio law is crystal clear on that point. The issue of self-defense should have been litigated free of the improper argument by the State of Ohio that Shine-Johnson had to retreat from his residence rather than confront his irate father, who had summoned him home. The argument that Shine-Johnson was more likely to be culpable because he did what his father demanded and went home conflicts with common sense and Ohio law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   {\u00b6 127} Prosecuting attorneys are supposed to seek justice, not seek convictions any way they can get them. That did not happen here. The conviction for murder in particular was tainted and therefore should be vacated. The case should be tried again, this time free of improper assertions and arguments on the issue of self-defense.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
