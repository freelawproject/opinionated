The Court of Claims erred by denying a public records request when three of the four factors under\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v.

The Court of Claims erred by concluding that [the Tri-C] Foundation was not responsible for public records of [Tri-C].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The assigned error in the cross-appeal states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court of Claims misapplied the law by concluding that the [Tri-C] Foundation's contract with Ms. Spencer is not protected from disclosure under the Public Records Act as a trade secret based on the public availability of a different contract with a different entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b64} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we hold as a matter of law that this court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to R.C. 2743.75(G)(1). We find that the Court of Claims of Ohio erred in not adopting the report and recommendation of the special master as it relates to\n   the unredacted Spencer contract; consequently, we reverse its decision as to the fifth and seventh objections. We conclude that the Tri-C Foundation is the functional equivalent of a public office under R.C. 149.011(A), and as such, is subject to the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43. We further conclude that the Spencer contract is not a trade secret; therefore, under the public records law, Sheil is entitled to the unredacted Spencer contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b65} This action is based on the public records request of Sheil to have an unredacted copy of the contract between Spencer and the Tri-C Foundation as to its fundraising luncheon where Spencer appeared as the keynote speaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b66} The issues for us in this appeal are whether Tri-C's Foundation meets the functional equivalence test as a public entity under\n   <em>\n    Oriana House, Inc. v.

To receive, hold, invest and administer property of any kind, including money, * * * for the benefit of, any community college now or hereafter owned or operated by the Board of Trustees of the Cuyahoga Community College District * * * [including to] make expenditures for any one or more of the normally accepted functions of colleges and universities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. To acquire, construct, equip, furnish, repair, remodel, renovate, enlarge, improve, maintain and operate buildings, structures, and facilities, and to acquire real estate and interests in real estate in connection therewith, or any combination thereof, for the use of such Community College, its staff, faculty, students, or any organization thereof or related or affiliated thereto;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. To establish and maintain programs for the purpose of financially assisting, directly or indirectly, by gift, loan, guaranty, or otherwise students attending [Tri-C] * * *;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. To engage in and conduct special activities on behalf of [Tri-C], its staff, faculty, students, or any organization thereof or related or affiliated thereto;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5. To engage in and conduct activities and programs for solicitation of contributions from the general public for the benefits, directly or indirectly, of said corporation or [Tri-C].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b68} In the event of dissolution of the Tri-C Foundation, its assets are to be transferred to the Board of Trustees of the Cuyahoga Community College District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b69} According to Megan O'Bryan, the president of the Tri-C Foundation, ex officio member of the Tri-C Foundation Board, and vice-president of development for Tri-C, the Tri-C Foundation was incorporated \"for the purpose of collecting donations from individuals, corporations, and foundations * * * to be distributed as scholarships to persons attending [Tri-C] and to be used for other purposes benefitting [Tri-C].\" O'Bryan explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   9. The [Tri-C] Foundation transfers funds to [Tri-C] for distribution as scholarships to students, for educational program enhancement, or for emergency funds for students in financial distress. The acceptance of these funds are approved by the College Board of Trustees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b610} O'Bryan also averred that the Tri-C Foundation's scholarship luncheon featuring Spencer raised $1,200,000. In 2017, the Tri-C Foundation raised $2,900,000 for\n   Tri-C scholarships, and since 1992, the luncheons have raised in excess of $18,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b611} O'Bryan stated that the Tri-C Foundation has a board of approximately sixty directors, four of whom are ex officio seats held by Tri-C officers or employees. Tri-C provides the Tri-C Foundation with office space and technology in-kind support, the value of which is determined by Tri-C's chief financial officer. However, the Tri-C Foundation manages its own endowment money and does not hold funds in Tri-C's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b612} According to the Tri-C Foundation's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 2016, the Tri-C Foundation received contributions and special events revenue from Tri-C of $870,874. The following year, the Tri-C Foundation received $1,158,452. The Tri-C Foundation also receives and holds grant monies from various donors that it submits to Tri-C for education development programs once the conditions of the grants are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b613} The Tri-C Foundation is subject to annual audits by the Ohio auditor of state pursuant to R.C. Chapter 117, and state auditing rules require the Tri-C Foundation to identify itself as a \"unit\" of Tri-C. The Tri-C Foundation's Independent Auditor's Reports for 2016 and 2017 identify the Tri-C Foundation as \"a component unit of [Tri-C.]\" The Tri-C Foundation's Independent Auditor's reports are available online on the Ohio auditor's official website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b614} The Tri-C Foundation is a tax-exempt corporation under Section 501(c)(3). Its IRS form 990 forms demonstrate that the Tri-C Foundation gives grants of over $1,000,000 per year to Tri-C, and that the Tri-C Foundation's books and records are kept by Tri-C's accounting and financial operations director. In 2013, the Tri-C Foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 described the Foundation's tax-exempt activities as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Tri-C Foundation conducts its activities within the College's Office of Resource Development. Tri-C Foundation is responsible for fund-raising and \"friend raising\" opportunities and activities College-wide working with partners from foundations/organizations, corporations/businesses, individuals, and government agencies. Solicitations are presented on behalf of [Tri-C] or the Foundation as appropriate to the funding source. All fund-raising activities conducted by [the] Foundation are evaluated and determined to benefit [Tri-C] and its students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b615} The Tri-C Foundation entered into an agreement with Spencer outlining her appearance as the keynote speaker at an October 4, 2017 fund-raising luncheon. Several weeks before the luncheon, Sheil, on behalf of WJW-TV, sought a copy of the agreement from Horton. Horton refused to provide the agreement, and asserted that the Tri-C Foundation is \"not the equivalent of a public entity and not subject to the Ohio Public Records Act.\" Sheil subsequently filed a public records request in the Court of Claims seeking a copy of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b616} A special master for the Court of Claims determined that the Tri-C Foundation is the functional equivalent of a public office and therefore subject to the Public Records Act in accordance with the test articulated in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v.
