(\"Rayco\") appeals from the trial court's decision granting defendants-appellees/cross-appellants' (collectively, \"appellees\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion to enforce a settlement agreement that resolved legal malpractice claims Rayco had filed against appellees. Rayco contends that the trial court erred in finding that there was an enforceable settlement agreement. In their cross-appeal, appellees contend that the trial court erred in denying their request to recover the attorney fees they incurred to enforce the settlement agreement. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's decision to the extent that it grants appellees' motion to enforce the settlement agreement, reverse the trial court's decision to the extent that it denies appellees' motion for attorney fees and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In October 2013, Rayco filed a complaint against appellees for legal malpractice arising out of appellees' handling of a prior lawsuit Rayco had filed against Deutz Corporation and Deutz AG (collectively, \"Deutz\") for breach of warranty and other claims arising out of Deutz's sale of engines to Rayco. In that case, summary judgment was granted in favor of Deutz and affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In February 2015 and June 2016, the parties attempted to mediate their dispute with the assistance of a retired judge as the mediator. At the second mediation, Rayco authorized the mediator to convey a settlement demand of $3,050,000, in the aggregate, to appellees. At the conclusion of the second mediation, no agreement had been reached but efforts to settle the case continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In July 2016, the mediator issued a written recommendation to the parties, recommending that they settle the case for $2,650,000 in the aggregate. Rayco's counsel advised the mediator that Rayco did not agree with the recommendation and that appellees would have to pay the full\n   $3,050,000 it had demanded to settle the case. In September 2016, with the consent of all parties, the mediator met with Rayco's chief executive, John Bowling, to further discuss the possibility of resolving the case. After the meeting, the mediator continued to have settlement discussions with Rayco and its counsel by telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In the fall of 2016, several pretrial conferences were cancelled at the parties' request due to ongoing settlement negotiations. During this time period, one of Rayco's attorneys, Robert Kehoe, had discussions with appellees' counsel in which he reiterated that the only way to settle the case would be to pay Rayco's full settlement demand of $3,050,000. Given the amount of the demand, appellees needed to request additional authority from their insurance carriers to settle the case. To that end, in late 2016, Murphy's counsel and Cavitch's counsel separately requested written settlement demands from Rayco that they could submit to their insurance carriers. In January 2017, Cavitch's counsel emailed Attorney Kehoe inquiring about the status of the \"demand letter\" from Rayco. Attorney Kehoe replied that he was \"working on it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 26, 2017, Attorney Kehoe sent letters to Murphy's counsel and Cavitch's counsel. He indicated that he was writing \"to follow up on the June 23, 2016 mediation and subsequent settlement discussions with [appellees' counsel] and the mediator.\" He stated that Rayco had authorized the mediator to convey a \"firm demand\" of $3,050,000 to settle the case and had \"made it clear\" that \"$3,050,000 was an absolute aggregate amount necessary to settle the case.\" He further indicated that \"[w]e have not explored the possibility of resolving Rayco's claims against [the Murphy and Cavitch appellees] independent[ly]\" but that there was \"enough insurance coverage\" for appellees \"[i]n combination\" to \"meet Rayco's demand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At a pretrial conference on January 30, 2017, the parties advised the trial court that settlement negotiations were ongoing. A month later, on February 23, 2017, one of Murphy's attorneys, Ernie Vargo, with the consent of Cavitch's counsel, sent an email to Rayco's counsel, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   This is in response to Rayco's offer of settlement as set forth in your letter of January 26, 2017 to me. Counsel for Cavitch indicates that he has received a substantively similar letter on behalf of the Cavitch firm and named attorneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Murphy firm, Cavitch firm, and named lawyers from each firm accept the collective settlement demand of $3,050,000 in the aggregate. This acceptance is conditioned upon a full release and dismissal and other customary provisions to be negotiated and memorialized in a formal settlement agreement. Defendants agree to provide the initial draft of the written agreement to you for comments. Please expect the draft within 14 days of this email.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Thank you for your efforts in negotiating this resolution with us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Later that day, Attorney Kehoe responded to the email. He left a voicemail message for Attorney Vargo, thanking him and requesting that he return his call, indicating, \"I'd like to talk to you briefly about the logistics and I note that you'll take the first cut at the settlement documents and have them in about 14 days, which is fine.\" The following day, another of Rayco's attorneys, J. Douglas Drushal, emailed Attorney Vargo. He thanked Attorney Vargo for his February 23, 2017 email and stated that \"[i]f he has not done so yet, [Attorney Kehoe] will be in touch shortly with how we would like to proceed to finalize things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On March 2, 2017, Attorney Drushal emailed appellees' counsel, stating, \"I believe we are waiting for the final versions of what your side wants signed in the way of releases, etc. before presenting the package to Rayco. We need to know every detail before we can finalize. Anything you could do to expedite that would be helpful. Thanks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On March 7, 2017, Murphy's counsel emailed \"defendants' draft settlement agreement and release\" to Rayco's counsel. Murphy's counsel also inquired whether the parties should notify the court that they had \"an agreement in principle\" given that a pretrial conference was scheduled with the trial court for the following day. Attorney Drushal responded: \"Agree that we should contact [the] court and say we don't need the conference. I will defer to the rest of you to coordinate that, assuming all others concur.\" The trial court cancelled the March 8, 2017 pretrial conference at the parties' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 10, 2017, Attorney Kehoe forwarded a red-lined version of the settlement agreement \"with suggested changes from Plaintiff's counsel\" along with a proposed dismissal entry. The suggested changes included a mutual release provision, i.e., in addition to Rayco's release of its claims against Murphy and Cavitch, Murphy and Cavitch would release any claims they had against Rayco, and a provision that the trial court would retain jurisdiction over any disputes related to the settlement agreement. Attorney Kehoe stated: \"Kindly review and let us know if [the suggested changes] are acceptable. If so, we will proceed to obtain our client's signature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellees' counsel made additional changes to the revised settlement agreement circulated by Rayco's counsel and sent a red-lined version of the document to Rayco's counsel on March 16, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On April 4, 2017, Attorney Kehoe left a voicemail message for Attorney Vargo. He indicated that \"[t]he settlement document itself is fine\" and that \"[w]e had John [Bowling's] commitment to settle with the number that we agreed upon, but he's being a little bit difficult in getting the document signed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Rayco never signed the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On June 16, 2017, appellees filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. Appellees asserted that the parties had agreed to settle the case on February 23, 2017 but that Rayco refused to sign the settlement agreement. Appellees requested that the court enforce the settlement agreement and award them the attorney fees they incurred to enforce the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Rayco opposed the motion. It argued that there was no settlement agreement because, by the time appellees \"accepted\" the $3,050,000 settlement offer Rayco made at the June 2016 mediation, it had lapsed. Rayco further argued that its counsel's January 26, 2017 letters simply summarized the parties' past settlement positions and indicated Rayco's \"willingness to re-open negotiations\" and were not settlement offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to enforce the settlement. The hearing was held before an advisory jury, which the trial court empaneled, sua sponte, to address the issue of \"whether the parties entered into a contract to settle the lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Attorney Vargo (one of Murphy's attorneys), Attorney Timothy Brick (one of Cavitch's attorneys), and two of Rayco's attorneys, Attorneys Kehoe and Drushal, testified at the hearing. The parties also submitted a joint stipulation of undisputed facts. The 38 facts to which the parties stipulated detailed the history of the parties' settlement negotiations and included 15 documents created or exchanged by the parties during the course of their settlement negotiations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} During their testimony, Attorneys Vargo and Brick \"walked through\" the parties' stipulations and incorporated exhibits. Appellees argued there were at least three potential \"offers\" and three potential \"acceptances\" that gave rise to an enforceable settlement agreement. Appellees argued that Rayco's counsel's January 26, 2017 letters to appellees' counsel constituted offers that appellees accepted by means of Attorney Vargo's February 23, 2017 email to Rayco's counsel. They argued that the subsequent conduct of counsel, i.e., exchanging drafts of the settlement agreement, constituted further evidence of the parties' agreement to settle the case. Alternatively, appellees argued that (1) Murphy's counsel's February 23, 2017 email constituted a counteroffer to settle the case for $3,050,000 that Rayco accepted (a) by means of Attorney Kehoe's voicemail message to Attorney Vargo later that day or (b) by means of the email Attorney Drushal sent to Attorney Vargo the following day or (2) Rayco's counsel submission of the revised settlement agreement (which included mutual releases and other changes) to appellees' counsel on March 10, 2017 constituted an offer to settle the case for $3,050,000 that appellees accepted on March 16, 2017, when they made additional changes to the revised settlement agreement and returned the document to Rayco's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Attorney Kehoe testified upon cross-examination. He acknowledged the \"tru[th] and accura[cy]\" of the facts set forth in the parties' joint stipulation and confirmed that he was authorized to enter into the stipulation on behalf of Rayco. He indicated that he sent the January 26, 2017 letters to appellees' counsel in response to their request for a written settlement demand and that Rayco had authorized him to send the letters. He further acknowledged receipt of Attorney Vargo's February 23, 2017 email, indicating that appellees agreed to pay the amount Rayco had demanded ($3,050,000 in the aggregate), that he understood the email was sent on behalf of both Murphy and Cavitch and that he and appellees' counsel thereafter exchanged various emails congratulating and thanking one another for \"working so hard to get this done.\" Attorney Kehoe testified that after he received Attorney Vargo's February 23, 2017 email, he reported the settlement to Bowling. He indicated that Bowling accepted his congratulations on the\n   settlement and did not dispute that the case had been settled or object to the settlement at that time. He further testified, however, that when Bowling was presented with the settlement documents, he was \"unwilling to sign\" them. According to Attorney Kehoe, Bowling told him that he believed the settlement of the lawsuit was like a real estate transaction, i.e., that the deal was not finalized and there was no settlement until he signed the written settlement agreement. Attorney Kehoe further testified, however, that he had fully intended to consummate a settlement through his communications with appellees' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Attorney Drushal testified that he interpreted his co-counsel's January 26, 2017 letters not as a \"renewed demand\" or \"offer that could be accepted\" but rather, as a \"recitation of the history of what had happened\" and \"as seeking an offer from the lawyers, law firms, and their insurance company which would be presented to Mr. Bowling to see if he would accept it at that point.\" He further testified that, as he communicated in his March 2, 2017 email, in his view, \"everybody needed to sign off on\" the final version of the agreement before the parties had a settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} After the parties concluded their presentation of evidence and gave closing arguments, the advisory jury deliberated. Six interrogatories were submitted to the advisory jury. The advisory jury answered interrogatories indicating that the parties had entered into a settlement agreement and signed a verdict form in favor of appellees and against Rayco on the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} After dismissing the jury, the trial court stated that \"[b]ased upon the evidence hearing and having taken into consideration or under consideration the jury's verdict in this case, I find that the motion to enforce the settlement is well taken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On December 14, 2017, the trial court issued a written decision granting appellees' motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The trial court determined, \"[b]ased upon all the evidence,\" that the parties had \"a contract to settle with terms clear and enforceable,\" as a result of Rayco's \"acceptance\" of appellees' February 23, 2017 \"offer\" to settle the case for $3,050,000. As the trial court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, on February 23 the defendants unambiguously offered the plaintiff a settlement of $3,050,000 in exchange for a dismissal of all claims against all defendants. The plaintiff - through counsel but with the authority of Rayco's chief executive - accepted that offer as shown by trial counsel's February 23 voicemail and as further evidenced by: 1) plaintiff's co-counsel's email that same day, 2) the plaintiff's March 10 proposed release of all claims leaving the figure of $3,050,000 undisturbed and 3) the plaintiff's confirmation on April 4 that \"the settlement document (release dated March 16 and drafted by the defendants) is fine\" and that Bowling had previously accepted the proffered settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court ordered the parties to \"conclude the settlement under the terms outlined\n   in the March 16, 2017, written settlement agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The trial court, however, denied appellees' request to recover the attorney fees they had incurred to enforce the settlement agreement based on the \"American rule,\" i.e., that each party to a lawsuit is responsible for its own attorney fees unless they agreed otherwise, had a statutory entitlement to attorney fees or the other party acted in bad faith. Because the parties did not agree to shift fees, because there was no applicable statute providing for the recovery of attorney fees and because there was \"insufficient evidence of the reasons for, and nature of, Bowling's resistance to finalizing the settlement\" to support a finding that Rayco acted in bad faith by refusing to finalize the settlement, the trial court held that appellees were not entitled to recover the attorney fees they incurred in enforcing the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Rayco appealed, raising the following three assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I. The trial court erred in finding that there was an enforceable settlement agreement entered into by the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   II. The trial court erred by permitting appellees' counsel to testify in violation of the witness advocate rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   III. The trial court erred in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether there was an enforceable settlement agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Murphy and Cavitch cross-appealed, raising the following single assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law when it failed to award appellees reasonable attorney fees incurred to enforce the settlement agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} For ease of discussion, we address Rayco's assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The standard of review applied when reviewing a ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement depends on the question presented. If the question is a factual or evidentiary one, the reviewing court will not overturn the trial court's finding if there was sufficient evidence to support the finding.\n   <em>\n    Turoczy Bonding Co. v.

Rayco asserts that these letters simply summarized the parties' past settlement positions and made it clear that Rayco was still willing to consider settlement rather than specifying the terms upon which Rayco would settle the case. Rayco further contends that the letters could not be deemed settlement offers because they did not specifically allocate settlement amounts between Murphy and Cavitch and because they lacked \"other essential settlement terms required to execute a proper settlement agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court, however, did not find an enforceable settlement agreement based on the settlement demand Rayco made at the mediation or its counsel's January 26, 2017 letters to appellees' counsel. Rather, the trial court found that Murphy's counsel's February 23, 2017 email constituted an \"unambiguous offer\" to Rayco to settle the case for $3,050,000, which Rayco accepted when its counsel, Attorney Kehoe, left a voicemail message for Murphy's counsel later that day. The trial court found that the parties' agreement was \"further evidenced\" by (1) Attorney Drushal's February 24, 2017 email, (2) Rayco's counsel's circulation of its proposed revisions to the settlement agreement on March 10, 2017 leaving the figure of $3,050,000 undisturbed and (3) Attorney Kehoe's statement on April 4, 2017 that \"the settlement document is fine\" and that Bowling had previously agreed to the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Accordingly, Rayco's first assignment of error is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In its third assignment of error, Rayco contends that the trial court instructed the jury regarding, and itself applied, the wrong standard of proof. Rayco argues that if the trial court had properly instructed the jury that appellees needed to prove the existence of a settlement agreement by clear and convincing evidence rather than a preponderance of the evidence, \"the jury may well have ruled in Rayco's favor.\" Rayco further argues that \"[t]o the extent the trial court acted independently of the advisory jury,\" the trial court erred in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard rather than a clear and convincing evidence standard in determining whether a settlement agreement existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 36} This was a bench trial with an advisory jury pursuant to Civ.R. 39(C)(1). The advisory jury in this case was not the factfinder. After receiving answers to interrogatories and the verdict from the advisory jury, the trial court made its own findings of fact and conclusions of law. As the trial court stated in its journal entry: \"Based upon all the evidence, I find that there is a contract to settle with terms that are clear and enforceable.\" As such, any error in the trial court's instructions to the advisory jury was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 37} There is no indication in either the trial transcript or the trial court's decision what standard of proof the trial court applied in determining that a settlement agreement existed.

However, that testimony was contradicted by (1) his co-counsel's April 4, 2017 voicemail message to Attorney Vargo (in which Attorney Kehoe stated indicated that \"[t]he settlement document itself is fine\" and that \"[w]e had John [Bowling's] commitment to settle with the number that we agreed upon, but he's being a little bit difficult in getting the document signed\") and (2) Attorney Kehoe's testimony at the hearing that he had intended, by his words and actions, to consummate a settlement with appellees' counsel. Thus, the uncontroverted evidence in this case was not only sufficient to prove the existence of a settlement agreement by the greater weight of the\n   evidence under a preponderance of the evidence standard but was also sufficient to produce a firm belief or conviction in the mind of the trier of fact as to the existence of a settlement agreement, so as to establish the existence of a settlement agreement under a clear and convincing evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Phillips\n   </em>\n   , 3d Dist.

This is not a case in which the testimony presented could have been elicited by other means. Aside from the mediator and the clients themselves, who were not directly involved in the settlement negotiations after the parties stopped working with the mediator, the only persons with personal knowledge regarding the parties' settlement negotiations were the parties' attorneys. Although the parties had attempted to avoid having their attorneys testify by submitting a joint motion for leave to file stipulation of undisputed facts regarding defendants' motion to enforce settlement agreement, the trial court denied their request to have appellees' motion decided based on the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 49} As explained in the comments to Prof.Cond.R. 3.7, the rationale for the advocate-witness rule is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The tribunal has proper objection when the trier of fact may be confused or misled by a lawyer serving as both advocate and witness. The opposing party has proper objection where the combination of roles may prejudice that party's rights in the litigation.

It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Comment 2, Prof.Cond.R. 3.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Rayco argues that it was prejudiced by appellees' counsel serving as both witnesses and advocates at the hearing because it enabled appellees' counsel to refer to their own testimony during closing arguments and urge the jury to accept their recitation of the facts - in essence vouching for \"the truthfulness of their own testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 51} However, in this case, the jury had only an advisory role. The advisory jury gave its \"advice,\" based on its view of the evidence, to the trial court, but its decision was not binding on the trial court. The trial court was required to make its own independent findings of fact and conclusions of law as if there had been no verdict from the advisory jury.

In their joint motion, the parties asserted that there were no disputed questions of material fact relevant to the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, that an advisory jury was no longer necessary and that \"[t]he sole remaining question is whether the undisputed facts give rise to a binding settlement agreement as a matter of law.\" The trial court denied the motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    One of the trial court's November 9, 2017 journal entries states: \"The jury answered interrogatories to the effect that the parties did enter into an enforceable settlement agreement and signed a verdict form in favor of the defendants.\" The interrogatories submitted to the advisory jury, the advisory jury's answers to those interrogatories and the jury's signed verdict form were not included in the record this court received on appeal.

At oral argument, for the first time, Rayco attempted to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Berry\n    </em>\n    on the ground that, in\n    <em>\n     Berry,\n    </em>\n    Wachovia was forced to litigate the existence of the settlement agreement in a separate action rather than by filing a motion to enforce settlement in a pending action. It also argued that the award of attorney fees in\n    <em>\n     Berry\n    </em>\n    could be interpreted as an award based on Berry's bad faith in breaching the settlement agreement. Finally, it argued that to the extent\n    <em>\n     Berry\n    </em>\n    conflicts with\n    <em>\n     Mayfran\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mayfran\n    </em>\n    is controlling over\n    <em>\n     Berry\n    </em>\n    because\n    <em>\n     Mayfran\n    </em>\n    was decided first.
