The couple had been saving money so that they could move out of their apartment and purchase a house. However, Lynn's daughter became engaged and had found a venue for her wedding. Lynn wanted to use $2,500.00 from the savings nest egg to give to her daughter and her fianc\u00e9 to pay for the wedding venue as a wedding present. Chad was not initially excited about the idea. The argument and discussions continued through the night via text messages. Lynn went to work the next morning and Chad returned home after his shift ended that morning. The arguments continued through the day via text. Eventually, Lynn sent Chad a message asking him to not be home when she returned after work to give her some time to calm down, as she did not want to see or talk with him. He agreed to go on a motorcycle ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} When Lynn arrived home, Chad was not home. She went to her room and took a nap. After some time, she awoke and noticed that Chad was home and was in the driveway, washing the cars. She sent him a text message regarding whether he had eaten yet. He indicated that he had not and that after he finished washing the car, they could go to dinner. Lynn agreed. Upon going downstairs, she discovered that Chad left her an envelope on the table with the $2,500.00 for the wedding venue for her daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} They eventually went to dinner and continued the discussion regarding the money issue. Lynn was frustrated that Chad did not just give the money without comment, but rather made her feel that she was wrong to use the money for her daughter's wedding venue. Lynn argued that she wanted him to admit that he was in agreement with the decision, rather\n   than just compromising and giving her the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After dinner, the argument continued in the car during the ride home. Upon arriving home, the car was parked in the driveway because the motorcycle was parked in the middle of the garage. Lynn had her cell phone in her hand while in the car. She testified that, as she was getting out of the car, she told Chad that she should call her daughter's fianc\u00e9 and tell him that Chad did not support their wedding. Chad had been walking through the garage toward the door into the apartment when Lynn made the comment. He immediately turned around with his face and Lynn's face almost touching. The abruptness of this turn, coupled with Chad's movements caused Lynn to slip and fall on the wet concrete floor, in her flip-flops. She jumped up and while yelling at Chad, she ran into the yard. She was very upset and mad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} LaToya Powers testified that she saw Chad and Lynn arguing from across the street. She saw the man and woman standing at the front door of a house. The woman was screaming for help and then the man pushed the woman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Rain Scheibert, a fourteen-year-old boy was living in a duplex next to the Walters. Rain testified he heard yelling coming from outside of the house so he opened the door and saw Lynn yelling for help. Lynn was attempting to get away from Chad. Rain let her into his house and stood in the doorway to try to keep Chad from entering. Chad followed Lynn in an attempt to retrieve her phone. Lynn tripped running into the apartment and slipped on the rug, falling on the neighbor's skateboard. Chad straddled Lynn and grabbed the cell phone from her. During this time, Lynn was crying and screaming, \"Help me, help me.\" Rain tried to go and get help from a neighbor but the neighbor refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} When Rain came back, he saw Chad run out of the house and go to his home. Upon retrieving the phone, Chad left and went to his apartment next door. Chad put the cell phone into the basket on the kitchen counter. Rain then went into his house and helped Lynn up off the ground. Rain testified that he went into the Walters' driveway to help Lynn pick up her stuff that was scattered around. Rain could see bruises on Lynn's arms. She also had a scratch on her foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Neighbors had called 9-1-1. Lynn also called 9-1-1. Upon law enforcement's arrival, Lynn explained the events of the evening. Chad was arrested and charged with one count of domestic violence and was incarcerated. Within a day or so, Lynn attempted to speak with Ontario police regarding the statements and indications made in the police report outlining the allegations from the incident on that September evening. She attempted to point out that there were mistakes that she wanted corrected. No one returned her call. Lynn testified that she also attempted to speak to the prosecutor's office to correct the mistakes she noticed in the paperwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Chad was eventually indicted by the Richland grand jury for: Count 1: Aggravated Burglary, a felony of the first degree; Count 2: Burglary, a felony of the second degree; Count 3: Burglary as a Trespass in a Habitation, a felony of the third degree; Count 4: Disruption of Public Services, a felony of the fourth degree; Count 5: Domestic Violence, a misdemeanor of the first degree; and Count 6: Assault, a misdemeanor of the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The matter proceeded to jury trial in May of 2017. At the close of the State's evidence, Chad challenged the sufficiency of the evidence presented by way\n   of a Rule 29 Motion to dismiss all counts, but most specifically, the Disruption of Public Services, assault and domestic violence. The court dismissed the assault charge but denied the rest of the Rule 29 motion. The trial court also denied Chad's request for a jury instruction for a lesser-included charge of disorderly conduct as to the domestic violence count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After a five-day trial, Chad was acquitted of the Aggravated Burglary, and Burglary, as a Trespass in a Habitation. Chad was convicted of the lesser-included charge of Criminal Trespass, Disruption of Public Services and Domestic Violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Chad raises three assignments of error,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"I.

R. 29 motion for acquittal on the charge of Disrupting Public Services. In determining whether a trial court erred in overruling an appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal, the reviewing court focuses on the sufficiency of the evidence.

Latoya Powers corroborated that Chad pushed Lynn down. 1T. at 159. Rain Scheibert testified that Chad was cutting off the circulation in Lynn's arms. 1T. at 61. He further testified that he observed cuts and bruises on Lynn after the altercation. 1T. at 67-68. Photographs of the injuries were submitted to the jury. State's Exhibits 17; 18. Although Lynn hedged her testimony at trial evidence was presented that Chad choked her. 3T. at 333; 413. The evidence also established that after pushing Lynn to the ground, Chad pursued her across the street and inside the home of a neighbor. Lynn was screaming for help as she ran. 1T. at 147. Lynn testified that all of her injuries came from the incident. 3T. at 324.
