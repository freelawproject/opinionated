That conviction was reversed after McWhorter sought post-conviction relief (\"PCR\") and the matter was remanded for retrial. Following retrial, he was again convicted of Class A felony voluntary manslaughter. McWhorter challenges this conviction, contending that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, (2) his due process rights were violated during his prior trial, and (3) he was subjected to double jeopardy. Concluding that McWhorter's contentions are without merit, we affirm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] Upon considering McWhorter's first direct appeal, we set forth the relevant facts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   In December 2005, McWhorter, Amanda Deweese (Deweese), and their baby were living with Barbara Gibbs (Gibbs), McWhorter's grandmother. On December 2, 2005, inside Gibb's home, McWhorter shot Deweese in the head with a twelve-gauge shotgun at close range causing her death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Earlier that night, both Deweese and McWhorter visited Janis Floyd's (Floyd) home. Floyd observed Deweese acting nervous and crying, and observed that McWhorter smelled of alcohol. Meanwhile, Gibbs attended a Christmas show, arriving home about 10:45 p.m. Shortly after she arrived home McWhorter and Deweese came home as well. The two argued. Just as Floyd observed, Gibbs could tell that McWhorter was intoxicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   A few moments later, Deweese and Gibbs were sitting in the kitchen and McWhorter came in carrying a shotgun. He told Gibbs, \"I'm going to show you how to use this gun[,] grandma, in case [you ever] need it.\" (Transcript p. 122). Gibbs told McWhorter to put the gun away. McWhorter placed the gun on the table and began loading and unloading it repeatedly. Eventually McWhorter took the gun out of the room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Around this time, McWhorter confronted Deweese about her having intercourse with another man while she was pregnant with their baby. McWhorter asked for the return of the engagement ring that he had given Deweese. She took it off and handed it to him. He threw it on the floor and stepped on it. Gibbs picked the ring up, handed it to\n   Deweese, and McWhorter asked for it again. Deweese gave it back and McWhorter threw it again, this time into a bedroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   McWhorter went into the room where he had thrown the ring and stayed there for a while. During this time, Gibbs was sitting across the kitchen table from Deweese, facing her and McWhorter was standing behind Gibbs facing Deweese. Gibbs and Deweese were talking about whether McWhorter might try to kill himself. \"[T]he next thing [Gibbs] knew, [she] heard a boom.\" (Tr. p. 126). Gibbs could see Deweese and quickly realized Deweese had been shot. Gibbs turned around and saw McWhorter standing close by. Gibbs asked what had happened and McWhorter said \"oh no, oh no\", and started screaming and carrying on. (Tr. p. 135). While Gibbs called 911, McWhorter said, \"I didn't know there was a shell in it,\" and left the room. (Tr. p. 135).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Henry County Deputy Sheriff Ken Custer (Deputy Custer) was the first officer on the scene. He asked her what had happened and she stated that \"[McWhorter] shot [Deweese].\" (Tr. p. 168). Supporting officers then arrived. The officers found McWhorter in the house lying behind a baby crib and a shotgun lying inside the crib. After McWhorter was taken into custody, he said on two occasions, \"I shot her.\" (Tr. pp. 174-176).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    McWhorter v.

By the time of McWhorter's retrial, Gibbs was deceased. The videotape of Gibbs's previous trial testimony was played for the jury, over McWhorter's objection. On June 28, 2017, the jury found McWhorter guilty of the Class A felony voluntary manslaughter charge and McWhorter admitted to being a habitual offender. He was subsequently\n   sentenced to an aggregate seventy-five-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I. Admission of Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [7] McWhorter contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Barbara Gibbs's testimony from the first trial. \"The decision to admit former testimony of an unavailable witness is within the sound discretion of the trial court\" and we \"will not reverse absent a showing of manifest abuse of the trial court's discretion resulting in the denial of a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Burns v.

App. 2018) (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   While prior testimony is hearsay, Indiana Rule of Evidence 804 provides an exception to its exclusion if the declarant is unavailable. To be considered unavailable, the declarant must be unable to testify because of death or a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness. If a witness is determined unavailable, former testimony given at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition is not excluded by the hearsay rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549113\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/635/#p639\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted). The exception applies if the testimony \"(A) was given [by] a witness at a trial, hearing or lawful deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and (B) is now offered against a party who had ... an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.\" Ind. Evidence Rule 804(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [8] McWhorter concedes that Gibbs was unavailable at his second trial and that he had the opportunity to cross-examine her during his first trial. McWhorter claims, however, that he lacked a similar motive to develop Gibbs's testimony during the first trial because his defense was one of accident and he did not interject the issue of sudden heat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [9] The plain language of Rule 804(b)(1) requires only that the opponent have had a \"similar\" motive to develop the former testimony. At McWhorter's trial on the charge of murder, Gibbs was the sole eyewitness testifying. McWhorter was highly incentivized to highlight any problem with her perception and recollection and to elicit from her any evidence that tended to negate or lessen his criminal culpability. Thus, we conclude that McWhorter had a similar motive in both his first and second trials. As such, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Gibbs's former testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [10] McWhorter also contends that his \"right to federal due process was violated when he was convicted the first time of voluntary manslaughter as a Class A felony, a charge not included in the information in any way and for which neither the State nor McWhorter requested an instruction.\" Appellant's Br. pp. 29-30. That conviction, which resulted from McWhorter's first trial, was reversed. We agree with the State that McWhorter, in pursuing this particular issue on appeal, \"has not alleged let alone shown that he was denied due process in his second trial.\" Appellee's Br. p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III. Double Jeopardy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [11] McWhorter last contends that because he was acquitted of murder in his first trial, the prohibition against double jeopardy barred his retrial for voluntary manslaughter. We disagree. It is well-settled that \"a defendant may be retried for a lesser offense, of which he was convicted at the first trial, after that conviction is reversed on appeal, and this is true even though the first trial also resulted in a verdict of acquittal on a greater offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

The Court addressed the availability of a standalone charge of voluntary manslaughter and the burden of proof in such an action. Our Supreme Court considered \"whether voluntary manslaughter may be brought as a standalone charge\" by the State and found that it could.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549102\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/566/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549102\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/566/\">\n    at 570-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Turning to the merits, the Court made three specific observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   One, sudden heat is a mitigating factor, not an element.... Two, there must be\n   some evidence that a defendant acted in sudden heat before a jury may consider voluntary manslaughter. As such, to the extent the State argues it can concede the existence of sudden heat without evidence of such in the record, we disagree. Three, even when voluntary manslaughter is the lead charge, the State must prove the elements of murder: the knowing or intentional killing of another human being.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549102\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/566/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549102\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/566/\">\n    at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, the crime of voluntary manslaughter does not include a unique element of sudden heat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The crime to be alleged and proven in a standalone charge of voluntary manslaughter is murder, albeit a mitigated murder, i.e., a diminished mens rea. Yet because sudden heat is not an element, voluntary manslaughter is lesser only in the degree of punishment not proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [15] As an intermediate appellate court, we are bound to follow Indiana Supreme Court precedent and will not declare its decision to be invalid.\n   <em>\n    Gill v. Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329342,12355598\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/72/945/\">\n    72 N.E.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949 (Ind. Ct.

But when McWhorter was tried on the standalone charge of voluntary manslaughter, he had already been tried for murder.\n   <em>\n    See McWhorter I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McWhorter II\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    McWhorter III\n   </em>\n   .

When the State pursued its standalone charge, McWhorter was again required to defend against the elements of murder. This is a classic example of double jeopardy. An explicit acquittal terminates jeopardy on the acquitted charge and does so \"notwithstanding any legal error.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

To the extent that\n   <em>\n    McWhorter III\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   may be seen as conflicting, we should follow the latter guidance of our supreme court specific to a standalone charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [16] Effectively, these decisions suggest that there is a lesser or diminished capacity below knowing and intentional because of the emotional response to a sudden event, i.e., sudden heat. This \"sudden heat\" arises from provocation which is absent in this case. Yet, given the framework presented to us, \"sudden heat\" is not an element of murder, rather it is something in addition to murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [17] Finally, I observe that the record here is devoid of evidence of \"sudden heat\" as that has been defined by our Indiana Supreme Court. Sudden heat exists \"when a defendant is 'provoked by anger, rage, resentment, or terror, to a degree sufficient to obscure the reason of an ordinary person, prevent deliberation and premeditation, and render the defendant incapable of cool reflection.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   , 91 N.E.3d at 572 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Isom v.

Clearly, the record indicates that McWhorter was agitated after dwelling upon events that had apparently happened many months earlier, and he may well have been facing the prospect of a breakup. But even if Deweese's affair constituted \"sudden heat,\" the existence of\n   \"sudden heat\" can be negated by a showing that a sufficient \"cooling off period\" elapsed between provocation and homicide.\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

App. 1992). Here, the conduct which Deweese apparently admitted was long past. Too, sudden heat is not shown by anger alone or by mere words.\n   <em>\n    Suprenant v.

For an act of voluntary manslaughter, coupled with enhancements for past conduct, he received a prison sentence of seventy-five years. I would reverse and remand with instructions to enter judgment on criminal recklessness and conduct a new sentencing hearing. On remand, while McWhorter is subject to a lesser sentence for criminal recklessness, this sentence is nevertheless subject to enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In 2005, when McWhorter killed Deweese, Indiana Code Section 35-42-1-1 defined murder as the knowing or intentional killing of another human being.
