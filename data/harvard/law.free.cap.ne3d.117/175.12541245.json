The court recognized that there was a developing realization by courts that such expert testimony was no longer required, and the Ohio Supreme Court quoted with approval a passage from a New York case as follows: \" 'We think the time has come when we may recognize the general reliability of the radar speed meter as a device for measuring the speed of a moving vehicle, and that it\n   will no longer be necessary to require expert testimony in each case as to the nature, function or scientific principles underlying it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.E.2d%20630\">\n    154 N.E.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    People v.

Expert testimony on the scientific principles involved in speed detection should no longer be required for modern laser or radar measuring devices that work on the same principles deemed scientifically established in\n   <em>\n    Ferell\n   </em>\n   over 60 years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b624} Numerous jurisdictions from around the country have adopted a similar approach as\n   <em>\n    Ferell\n   </em>\n   with respect to laser devices.\n   <em>\n    Dist. of Columbia v.

This should be the extent of the analysis. There is no serious contention that the scientific principles underlying laser speed measuring devices are invalid or born from junk science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b625} Although the law will never be at the forefront of technological advances, at a minimum, it should not be hampered by outdated legal analysis. It suffices, on the basis of the foregoing discussion, that Rodojev has not demonstrated the existence of plain error in the admission of the officer's testimony. The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b626} Nevertheless, we would suggest the Supreme Court of Ohio take this case and determine whether the admissibility of any speed measuring device hinges on the use of either expert testimony or judicial notice establishing the scientific reliability of the science used by the devices in general. It has been 60 years since the Supreme Court of Ohio has spoken on this issue. With the increased use and dependence on technology and the introduction of new devices in this area of law enforcement and the predominance of appellate decisions requiring scientific foundation for the admissibility issue, Supreme Court review is long overdue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b627} To this end, we sua sponte certify a conflict between the analysis in our decision and\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note that our sua sponte decision to certify a conflict does not relieve the parties of the burden to follow all Supreme Court procedural rules governing the filing of appeals on certified conflicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b628} In the second assignment of error, Rodojev claims that the prosecutor failed to timely produce \"vital information\" according to a subpoena issued before trial. We summarily overrule the argument. According to the transcript of the hearing, the city produced the requested information at the hearing, which was the date for compliance established in the subpoena, and the city provided Rodojev with a copy of the requested information - the officer's certification to operate the speed measuring device. There is no error, plain or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b629} In the third and final assignment of error, Rodojev claims the police officer was not certified to operate the particular laser speed measuring device used on the day Rodojev was issued the speeding citation. According to Rodojev, the officer was certified in 2002, nine years before the particular device was first on the market. Rodojev, although offered the certification during the trial proceedings, did not object or present an argument regarding the difference between the certification and the particular device. We find no plain error given the limited discussion presented in this appeal.\n   <em>\n    Rogers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353553\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/385/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2459\">\n    2015-Ohio-2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20860\">\n    38 N.E.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; App.R. 16(A)(7).

In this case, we are declining to find the existence of plain error based on Rodojev's failure to object to the officer's testimony, given the split of authority on the admissibility of speed measuring devices in general and the lack of arguments presented in the appellant's briefing. En banc review is not favored, but when undertaken, must be on a dispositive issue. Although the cases in general involve moving violations, the particular procedural and factual history of the cases are distinct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
