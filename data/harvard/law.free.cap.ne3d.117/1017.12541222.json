Trooper United was accompanied that day by another trooper, Trooper Michael Wilson. Trooper Wilson observed a vehicle of interest pass by, noting that the vehicle appeared to be driverless. Driverless means that the officers could not see any of the occupants of the vehicle. The plate of the vehicle came back to a rental car. Trooper Untied stated that those involved in criminal activity often time have rental vehicles to avoid seizure of their own property. The vehicle was dusty, which is typically uncommon for a rental car, and there were fingerprints in the area of trunk of the vehicle. The troopers pulled out of their position, and ultimately stopped the vehicle for a traffic offense of following too close.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The entirety of the traffic stop was recorded on the dash camera system in place within the trooper's cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After the vehicle was stopped, the driver of the vehicle was identified as Woods. The passenger was identified as Brooks.

The trial court noted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The video shows moderately heavy traffic traveling on a major interstate highway at reasonable speeds for the conditions and under the posted limits. It shows that the cruiser maintained its position in the left lane several car lengths behind the Defendants' vehicle, which was in the right lane, essentially in the driver's blind spot. It depicts that, over the course of several miles, the vehicles in the left lane in front of the cruiser start merging into the right hand causing the vehicles in that lane to lightly brake in order to maintain appropriate spacing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Why would the left lane drivers be merging right? Simple. There's a cop car behind them, in the left lane. Most reasonable drivers merge right when a vehicle behind them appears to want to go faster, especially when it's the police. In\n   fact, given the circumstances, it was required under R.C. 4511.25(B)(1). But regardless of the reason, it caused right lane traffic to become more congested. As a result, vehicles braked to slow down and accommodate. That's what the defendant did in this case. He did not violate R.C. 4511.34, by \"following too closely.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on the evidence presented, and for the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that there was not probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had been committed. The Court reaches this conclusion based primarily on the video taken from the cruiser. The Court finds that the video was more reliable and more accurate than the other evidence offered. And at times, the video simply contradicted the trooper's version of what occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   For example, Trooper Untied testified it took the driver a long time to come to a stop after he initiated his lights. The video contradicts this claim. Once the driver was ordered to pull over, he did so in a reasonable and timely manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   He also claimed that the vehicle very dusty and that there were fingerprints on the lift gate, which he took as a sign that the vehicle must have been a long term rental and therefore used in the drug trade. The video showed otherwise. In fact, the vehicle in the video appeared as clean any other vehicle on the highway that day. After all, it was an early November evening in Ohio. Who knows what the weather conditions had been like the week, days, or even hours before the stop. It's Ohio. The point is weather can change quickly here. If that's the threshold by which traffic stops are made, then we're all in jeopardy. And if it was dirty, so what? Having a dusty vehicle with fingerprints on the hatch back or tailgate, is not evidence of a traffic violation or reason to believe a crime is being committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Another claim worthy of mention is Trooper Wilson's testimony that what drew his attention to this vehicle was that he noticed the vehicle appeared to be \"driverless\" when it passed them at the 113 mile post. He stated that there were no visible occupants in the vehicle and speculated that the driver and any passengers must have pushed their seats back in order to avoid detection. Keep in mind that according the government's version of events, this vehicle passed their stationary location at 60-70 miles per hour in the blink of an eye. Trooper Untied testified that he did not even notice the vehicle as it passed. And the fact that Trooper Wilson claims that his inability to see a person behind the wheel - in that split second - and therefore, something nefarious must be going on does not bolster his credibility, it subverts it. If there were credible evidence to support a claim that a driver or occupant laid his or her seat back in order to avoid detection, one might expect other evidence might be offered to support the observation. But none was. There were no photographs of the interior compartment of the vehicle, there were no comments or questions heard on the recording about not having seen the occupants when they passed by. Nor was there any testimony about furtive movements taking place inside the vehicle before the stop was made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Decision and Entry Granting Defendant's Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n   , Feb. 16, 2018 at 3; 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    State v.
