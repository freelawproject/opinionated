The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to 180 days in jail, 90 days in the county work release program, fined him $5,000, and designated him a Tier 1 sex offender. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Heiney is an orthopedic surgeon who ran his own medical practice, called Cutting Edge Orthopedics. He operated two offices, one in Sylvania, Ohio, and the other in Lambertville, Michigan. In this case, Heiney is alleged to have touched two female patients inappropriately while examining them at his Sylvania office in early 2015. The patients, referred to as \"M.S.\" and \"K.O.,\" offered the following testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    M.S.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} M.S., a 42-year-old woman, first treated with Heiney in 2010. In 2014, she returned to Heiney with complaints of left shoulder pain and weakness. M.S. treated with Heiney a total of four times for left shoulder pain. The pain was localized to her left shoulder; it did not radiate to her chest, breast area, or any other area. The first two appointments were uneventful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} M.S.'s third appointment occurred on January 8, 2015. Heiney examined M.S. with the door closed but unlocked; no one else was in the room at the time. M.S. was wearing a tank top with thin straps and a bra, and she was seated at the exam table. Heiney asked if he could pull the straps down so that he could examine her shoulder, and M.S. said, \"Okay.\" While preparing to give M.S. an injection, Heiney explained that he would put gauze inside her bra because he \"didn't [want to] get anything on [her] pretty pink bra.\" M.S. \"tried to ignore\" and \"blow off\" the comment, although it \"felt weird.\" According to M.S., Heiney then \"pulled out the cup of my bra and he * * * tucked [the gauze] like all the way underneath my breast, and the back of his hand was brushing my breast as he kept tucking [the gauze] down.\" Heiney gave M.S. the injection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} According to the indictment, the alleged criminal conduct occurred during M.S.'s fourth and final appointment on February 12, 2015. M.S. complained of \"progressively * * * worse\" shoulder pain, although still localized to the shoulder. During the exam, M.S. sat upright on the exam table. She testified that Heiney \"asked if it was okay * * * to take my arm out of my shirt this time.\" At the last appointment, Heiney had only sought permission to lower the straps of her bra and tank top. M.S. said, \"okay\" because, as she explained, \"I was having so much pain, and I couldn't do my job. I just wanted to feel better.\" Heiney helped M.S. pull her arm out of her shirt, and then examined her left bicep by placing pressure on her arm with his hands. M.S. experienced discomfort to her bicep because he \"press[ed] so hard for so long.\" Heiney told her that pain from her breast can radiate to the arm, and he asked to perform a \"breast exam,\" to which she agreed. According to M.S., Heiney pulled the cup of her bra down, which completely exposed her breast. He \"pushed on my breast all over the top and underneath and then he squeezed it between his fingers, and he pushed on it some more.\" While examining her breast, Heiney asked if it hurt, and\n   M.S. said \"no.\" She testified, \"I didn't have any pain * * * because [my breast] wasn't hurting me to begin with.\" M.S. felt \"uncomfortable\" and \"pretend[ed to be] somewhere else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Heiney then examined her neck, and they discussed the fact that M.S. was also experiencing headaches. Next, Heiney asked to examine M.S.'s breast again, which he did by \"push[ing] on it a couple times.\" He then prepared to give M.S. an injection in her arm. Heiney, again, pulled the cup of her bra away from her body, and placed a piece of gauze \"deep inside the bra under [her] breast.\" He also commented that \"women always [wear] white bras to the doctor.\" No one was in the office at the time, and M.S. does not recall that Heiney wore gloves during his examination of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After her appointment, M.S. felt \"embarrassed * * * angry [and] ashamed.\" She did not return for further treatment. Two weeks later, M.S. requested and received her medical chart from Heiney's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} M.S. then sought treatment from Dr. Christopher Foetisch, also an orthopedic surgeon, who told her that her shoulder was dislocating and needed surgery. They also discussed how Dr. Foetisch conducts physical exams, and based on that conversation as well as her own feelings, M.S. concluded that Heiney's conduct had been improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} M.S. filed a complaint against Heiney with the State Medical Board of Ohio (\"SMBO\") on April 1, 2015. In it, M.S. complained of \"sexual misconduct\" and \"inappropriate\" conduct by Heiney during the January 8, 2015 and February 12, 2015 appointments. Under cross-examination, M.S. denied that Heiney made any inappropriate comments to her, and she did not think that Heiney had an erection during his examination of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    K.O.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} K.O., a 33-year-old woman, treated with Heiney on one occasion, March 12, 2015. She complained of left-sided pain in her shoulder, low back, and hip. K.O. reported that the pain radiated down her left arm, into her hand and \"occasionally\" into her buttock, all the way down her leg into her knee. K.O. met with Heiney in an exam room. No one else was present. During the first part of the exam, Heiney manipulated her left arm in different positions, asking if the movements caused any pain. As described by K.O.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   And then he * * * asked me if I was experiencing any discharge from my breast, and I said no. So he told me to take * * * my arm out of my sleeve and my bra strap as well, and then he held my arm like this with his one hand and with the other hand he pulled my bra down, and then gave me a breast exam and asked me if I had any pain, which I said no. And then he held my arm in a different positon and then gave me a second breast exam, the whole time when my bra had been down at this point, and then he pulled my bra back up and held my arm in a couple different positons asking me, * * * [\"]does this hurt, does this hurt[\"] and feeling around in my arm. And then * * * a third time he pulled my bra down again, said [\"]one more time[\"], and gave me a third breast exam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} K.O. described his palpation of her breast as \"padding of his fingers and just going around,\" but during his third examination, he \"cupped\" her breast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} K.O. momentarily left the exam room so that an x-ray could be taken of her neck. When she returned, Heiney examined her low back. K.O. described the examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I was facing him and he was feeling a little bit [of] my hip * * * and asking me what hurt and where. And then he asked me to turn around and face the table and touch my toes, so I did. At that point he grabbed my pants and my underwear and pulled them down to right above my knees, and then started to feel around on my behind and on my side and in my upper thigh region where his fingers kind of brushed against my private area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} When asked to elaborate, K.O. testified that while he was \"grabbing the inner part of the thigh and the lower part of the butt\" with his hand, Heiney's fingers brushed up against her genitalia. K.O. said that she was \"extremely\" surprised when Heiney pulled down her pants and that he gave her no warning that he was going to do so, nor did he give her any explanation as to why it was necessary. With K.O. still bent over, Heiney asked her if she could bend over any farther. When she said that she could not, he stopped touching her, and K.O. \"grabbed my pants and stood up quick to pull them up.\" Heiney announced, \"well, I'm done.\" K.O. testified that Heiney was not wearing gloves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After the appointment, K.O. prepared a typed-written statement of what had occurred. K.O. did not mention that Heiney had brushed his hand by her vaginal area or \"cupped\" her breast because, she testified, she did not know how detailed the statement should be and because she was \"extremely\" embarrassed. Two days after the incident, K.O. reported Heiney's conduct to the Toledo Police, which redirected her to the Sylvania Police Department because the incident occurred in Sylvania. On March 15, 2015, now three days after her appointment, K.O. met with the Sylvania Police and signed the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    The Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} K.O.'s case was assigned to Sylvania Police Detective Laura Bliss. As part of her investigation, Detective Bliss contacted Investigator Amy Myers with the SMBO. Although there were no other complaints pending with the SMBO at that time, M.S. filed her complaint with the SMBO shortly thereafter, on April 15, 2015. Investigator Myers then contacted Detective Bliss and notified her of M.S.'s complaint against Heiney, and the two coordinated their respective investigations going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Detective Bliss and Investigator Myers jointly interviewed K.O. and recorded the conversation. K.O. told them that Heiney's fingers actually rubbed against her genitals when he examined her low back. At Bliss's suggestion, K.O. requested a copy of her medical records from Heiney's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Detective Bliss conducted a videotaped interview of Heiney at the police station on May 6, 2015 regarding K.O.'s complaint. Heiney's records indicate that, within hours of his police interview, Heiney viewed and printed K.O.'s electronic medical record (\"E.M.R.\"). The next day, Heiney asked one of his medical assistants, Jennifer Downard, to make an \"add-on\" to the E.M.R. by adding some of his handwritten notes. Heiney stated that he made the changes \"to make sure [the E.M.R.] was as correct as it could be.\" He denied adding \"blocks of information\" but claimed that he just made minor additions to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Investigator Myers also interviewed Heiney about K.O.'s allegations, which occurred on June 8, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Heiney\n   was unaware that his interviews with Bliss and Myers regarding K.O. were recorded. Both interviews were played for the jury, and an overall summary of Heiney's recorded statements is set forth below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Heiney stated that he \"always\" wears gloves while performing examinations, unless he is examining for infection. He also claimed that he \"always\" asks permission before touching a patient's sensitive areas. Heiney stated that it is his practice to have a third person present when examining a patient. He is, however, occasionally unaccompanied if his medical staff is occupied with other patients. It is \"highly unlikely\" that he would see a new patient, like K.O., without having another individual in the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Heiney stated that he does not perform \"breast\" exams but may examine a patient's chest if the patient is experiencing breast discharge or complaining of pain that radiates to, or from, the breast. If the latter, he would palpate the breast to try and reproduce the pain, and he would also compare one breast to the other. If Heiney palpated a breast, it should be noted in a medical record, although it might only state that shoulder pain \"radiates.\" He said that a breast discharge would definitely be noted. During such an exam, there is no need to touch a patient's nipple, unless the patient complains of \"mastitis,\" which is inflammation of the mammary gland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} When giving a shoulder injection, Heiney stated that his practice is to place gauze above the chest area to catch any fluids; he said that he would not place gauze in the cup of the bra or under the breast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Heiney could not specifically recall K.O., but in anticipation of his interview with Investigator Myers, Heiney reviewed her medical records. Based on that review, Heiney said that K.O. complained of low back pain and shoulder pain that was radiating to her upper arm, neck and chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} He said that if he did a chest exam on K.O., it was likely because she was complaining of pain in her pectoral muscles, which are above the chest. If she complained of low back and leg pain, it would be normal to ask her to bend over and touch her toes. He would also palpate the sacroiliac joint (\"SI joint\"), which is located in the middle of the buttock area, on either side of the tailbone. To palpate the SI joint, a patient could be seated or standing. The purpose of palpating is, in part, to try and reproduce the pain and also to feel for deformities of the spine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Heiney said that because K.O. was a new patient and because she had many areas of pain, it is likely that she would have changed into a gown before he examined her. Assuming that K.O. was in a gown, she would have had her underwear on. As part of his examination of her low back, he would likely have asked her to bend down and touch her toes, and because of the location of her pain (i.e. the S.I. joint), he would have pulled her underwear down just enough that the upper part of her buttocks would have been exposed. According to Heiney, the only reason to completely expose a patient's full buttock is if the patient complained of buttock, as opposed to low back, pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Heiney denied that he has ever inappropriately touched a patient or been accused of doing so. Although he did not recall his examination of K.O., he denied\n   performing an unnecessary breast exam on her because he would not deviate from appropriate conduct. Heiney characterized allegations of inappropriate conduct as \"crazy.\" He added \"I don't do anything that they don't say is okay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 26} As part of the state's criminal investigation, Detective Bliss conducted a number of interviews, including Heiney's orthotist, Brian Kinsella and Heiney's two nurses. Bliss also interviewed office staff at Heiney's Sylvania office regarding record keeping practices, and she interviewed ten health care professionals to learn about standard exam procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Heiney's long-time orthotist, Brian Kinsella, also testified at trial. According to Kinsella, when Heiney examined a patient, Kinsella or one of Heiney's nurses, would \"usually\" be in the room. In the eight years that Kinsella worked with Heiney, Kinsella never saw Heiney place gauze underneath a female patient's breast. According to Kinsella, Heiney \"always\" wore gloves when performing an exam. As for low back exams, Kinsella testified that Heiney would ask a patient for permission to lower a patient's underwear, and he would only lower it \"slightly,\" just enough to expose the SI joint. Kinsella never saw Heiney lower a female patient's pants to her knees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Michigan Patients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The state offered the testimony of three female patients who treated with Heiney in his Michigan office-\"C.G.,\" \"L.G.,\" and \"S.E.\"-under Evid. R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} C.G. saw Heiney for pain in her lower back and right leg, numbness in her leg, and stiffness in her neck. C.G. claimed that Heiney unnecessarily touched her breasts on April 14, 2015 in his office:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Heiney said,] [\"]does it hurt here, show me where it hurts, does it hurt when you do this[?\"] And then at one point during this process, he looked at me, grabbed the gown and the bra at the same time, pulled the strap down with his hand in this fashion, squeezed, put the * * * gown back up, walked around to the other side and repeated that exact same process * * *. [He said,] \"now you don't have any pain here, no pain here[?] Okay.[\"] Bra and gown pulled to the side, reached and grabbed, and back up. * * * [He grabbed] \"my whole breast tissue\" in a \"squeezing cupped fashion.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} S.E. sought treatment from Heiney for right shoulder pain. On April 21, 2015, Heiney entered the examination room to find S.E. still clothed. Heiney said that he was in a hurry and to \"take off her top\" so that she could receive an injection. Heiney offered to help S.E. take off her top, which she declined, and then watched her disrobe instead of leaving the room while she changed. Once she had a gown on, Heiney helped S.E. to remove her bra in preparation for an injection. S.E. testified that Heiney examined both her breasts. As described by her, Heiney \"poked\" at her right breast and then \"reached around and cupped\" her left breast that included making \"some type of movement\" with her nipple. S.E. wondered \"why is he doing this * * * first just poking it, there's no value to that, and then reaching around [to her] unaffected side.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} L.G. treated with Heiney a total of four times between late March and April of 2014. The first appointment was unremarkable. During her second appointment, L.G. complained of tightness in her low back. L.G. said that Heiney asked her to touch her toes while standing behind her, and without warning, he \"pulled my pants and my underwear down to right above my knee and with his thumbs palpated the muscles above my hip parallel to my spine.\" After L.G. pulled up her pants\n   and turned around, she observed that Heiney had an erection. The third appointment was unremarkable, but during the fourth and final appointment, Heiney again pulled her pants and underwear down. This time, L.G. pulled her underwear back up and said, \"they [her underwear] didn't need to be down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 32} C.G., S.E., and L.G. all filed separate complaints against Heiney with the local Michigan police department, and the allegations went to trial. Some charges resulted in convictions after a bench trial, and the charges relating to L.G. resulted in a directed verdict. Although the trial court allowed C.G., S.E., and L.G. to be cross-examined with their sworn testimony from the Michigan case, the court did not allow either side to introduce evidence regarding the ultimate dispositions of the Michigan charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Defense Witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The defense called one witness, Dana LeFevers, who worked for Heiney as a medical assistant. LeFevers testified that either she, Kinsella, or another nurse were always in an examination room while Heiney was examining a patient and that he always wore gloves. LeFevers never witnessed Heiney do anything inappropriate with a patient. LeFevers testified that it was routine for Heiney to palpate a patient's pectoral muscles if that patient was complaining of shoulder or chest pain. She never saw him do any of the things he is accused of doing in this case, specifically: palpate a woman's breast tissue, cup a woman's breast, roll a woman's nipple with his fingers, place gauze underneath a woman's breast, or pull down a patient's underwear and pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Jury Verdict and Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The jury found Heiney guilty of two counts of Gross Sexual Imposition (\"GSI\"), in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1) and (C), felonies of the fourth degree (Counts 1 and 2) and one count of Tampering with Records, in violation of R.C. 2913.42(A)(1) and (B)(1)(2)(a), a misdemeanor of the first degree (Count 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The trial court sentenced Heiney to 180 days in the county jail and fined him $1,000 as to Count 3. With regard to Counts 1 and 2, the court sentenced Heiney to serve 90 days at the Department of Work Release and four years of community control. It also fined Heiney $2,000 as to Count 1 and an additional $2,000 as to Count 2 and ordered him to register as a Tier I sex offender pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950. Heiney requested, and was granted, a stay of execution of his sentence, pending his appeal. Through his appellate counsel, he raises 11 assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Error I: The convictions for Gross Sexual Imposition are not supported by sufficient evidence.

In determining whether a conviction is based on sufficient evidence, an appellate court does not assess whether the evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See Jenks\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus;\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79 (noting that courts do not\n   evaluate witness credibility when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Heiney's tampering-with-records conviction was based on edits that he made to K.O.'s electronic medical record (\"E.M.R.\") An E.M.R. is generated after a doctor dictates patient notes into a recording device. The dictation is sent to an outside medical transcriptionist who types the record into a Microsoft Word document and sends the Word document to the medical office. At that point, one of Heiney's assistants would \"copy and paste\" the E.M.R. into the patient's chart. Occasionally, an E.M.R. would need to be amended, and such amendment is called an \"add-on.\" Whenever an E.M.R. is modified or edited with an \"add on,\" the original version still remains in the system but is stored on a different server. An audit log tracks when E.M.R.'s are modified, printed, or opened for viewing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The E.M.R. that K.O. requested and received from Heiney's office (which she later gave to the police) differed from the one that Heiney produced to the police in response to their subpoena. The latter version includes additional details and descriptions, which the state alleges were added by Heiney after his police interview \"in an attempt to provide a medical rationale for his groping of [K.O.'s] breasts and buttocks.\" Both records were shown to the jury, and the relevant portions of each record are shown below. The original E.M.R. is on the left; the modified version is on the right:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-74\"><strong>Original Progress Note Provided to K.O.</strong> <strong>Modified Progress Note Produced</strong> <strong>Pursuant to Subpoena</strong> <strong>History:</strong> * * * <strong>History:</strong> * * * Sometimes radiates to [No reference] chest.

Indeed, the audit log confirms that on May 6, 2015-within hours of his police interview-Heiney viewed and printed the E.M.R. Then, the next day, Heiney gave his assistant, Jennifer Downard, some handwritten notes on the printed E.M.R. and asked Downard to make an \"add-on.\" Downard testified that this was how Heiney normally made \"add-ons\" to a patient's E.M.R., and that Heiney did not ask her to refrain from telling anyone about the changes. Heiney stated that he asked Downard to make the changes \"to make sure [the E.M.R.] was as correct as it could be.\" Heiney produced the modified E.M.R. in response to subpoena; he did not produce a copy of the original E.M.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} R.C. 2913.42(A)(1), the \"tampering with records\" statute, provides, in part, that \"[n]o person, knowing the person has no privilege to do so, and with purpose to defraud or knowing that the person is facilitating a fraud, shall do any of the following: * * * Falsify, destroy, remove, conceal, alter, deface, or mutilate any writing, computer software, data, or record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Heiney argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for tampering with records because (1) he was privileged to alter his own medical records; (2) the \"minor changes\" did not contain any false information; and (3) there is no evidence that he acted with purpose to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 44} First, Heiney argues that because he owned the medical records, he was privileged to make changes to them. Heiney is incorrect. The statute precludes tampering with both private and public records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2913.42(B)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1974 Committee Comment to R.C. 2913.42 (noting that the statute \"prohibits tampering with all private as well as public records, for fraudulent purposes, and thus expands upon former law which prohibited such conduct only with respect with public documents.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Heiney also argues that he could not be convicted of violating R.C. 2913.42(A)(1) because \"the tampering must involve fraudulent information.\" Heiney is, again, incorrect. The statute prohibits more than just the falsification of records. It also criminalizes destroying, removing, concealing, altering, defacing, or mutilating records. The evidence sufficiently established that Heiney altered the E.M.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Finally, Heiney argues that the \"minor additions * * * accurately listed the same symptoms to which [K.O.] testified about,\" and points to K.O.'s statement to police in which she states that her symptoms included some pain in the buttocks. In essence, Heiney argues that there was no evidence that he altered the E.M.R. \"with purpose to defraud.\" The state responds that Heiney altered K.O.'s E.M.R. to provide a \"medical rationale for his groping of [K.O.'s] breasts and buttocks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2913.01(B) defines \"defraud\" as \"to knowingly obtain, by deception, some benefit for oneself or another, or to knowingly cause, by deception, some detriment to another.\" Pursuant to R.C. 2901.22(A), purpose requires \"an intention to cause a certain result or to engage in conduct that will cause that result.\" Purpose or intent can be established by circumstantial evidence from the surrounding facts and circumstances in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708870\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/259/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n    574 N.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In a similar case, a physician was under investigation for committing Medicaid fraud.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed, Dr. Urban does not deny that he added new material to patient charts after they were subpoenaed. Rather, he stated that he did not know it was wrong and that his actions did not actually hamper the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   We acknowledge that there was trial testimony that Dr. Urban wrote openly in the charts, in plain view of anyone\n   who would walk by, and that, when asked about it, he explained that his lawyer told him he was allowed to do it. However, the fact that exculpatory evidence was presented does not mean that the jury was required to believe it. The jury could rely on the following evidence of tampering, including the sequence of events. * * * Then there was evidence that patient charts were subpoenaed, after which Dr. Urban personally reviewed the files and altered most of them. Charts showed additions of a type that could be viewed as an attempt to justify testing and billing. The jury could reasonably find that Dr. Urban altered the documents by adding to them. The jury could reasonably infer a motive to deceive and could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of tampering with the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The evidence is strikingly similar in the case before us. Given that Heiney altered the E.M.R. shortly after his police interview, we find that the jury could reasonably conclude that Heiney's purpose in doing so was to defraud-i.e., to deceitfully legitimize an otherwise unnecessary and improper touching of a patient's erogenous zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Heiney's fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

These three women each claimed that Heiney had inappropriate contact with them in his Michigan office.

We find that S.E.'s testimony was relevant, probative of \"intent\" and \"absence of mistake or accident\" under Evid.R. 404(B), and not unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to limit S.E.'s testimony as Heiney had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Regarding L.G., Heiney made two objections in the trial court relating to the admissibility of her testimony under Evid.R. 404(B) : (1) L.G. should not be permitted to testify because the Michigan court dismissed the charges that related to her allegations, and (2) L.G.'s testimony that Heiney had an erection exceeded the scope of the state's pretrial notice. On appeal, Heiney repeats these arguments and adds that the trial court improperly prohibited him from cross-examining L.G. regarding the Michigan directed verdict, and L.G.'s testimony regarding Heiney's erection conflicted with her Michigan testimony. We will address Heiney's arguments relating to the directed verdict first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 61} L.G. alleged that, on two separate appointments, Heiney abruptly pulled down her pants and underwear while she was bending over and touching her toes. She noticed that he had an erection after the first incident. Given that L.G. did not allege that Heiney actually touched any of her erogenous zones, Heiney was charged with indecent exposure. The Michigan court issued a directed verdict for Heiney because the alleged indecent exposure occurred in a doctor's office rather than in public, as required for that crime. Before trial, Heiney moved to prohibit L.G. from testifying as an Evid.R. 404(B) witness because L.G.'s charges had been dismissed. The court denied the motion. Heiney then asked for permission to raise the directed verdict during L.G.'s cross-examination. His request was denied. Heiney claims this these rulings were error and L.G.'s testimony was unduly prejudicial because \"the jury was told that it had gone to trial in Michigan\" and was therefore led \"to conclude incorrectly that he had been convicted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 62} We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing L.G. to testify under Evid.R. 404(B) despite the directed verdict in Michigan. Evid.R. 404(B) expressly allows evidence of other \"crimes, wrongs,\n   <em>\n    or acts\n   </em>\n   \" as long as the evidence is introduced for a permissible purpose. Given the temporal proximity (i.e., one year) and similarity between L.G.'s and K.O.'s allegations (i.e., both women allege that Heiney abruptly pulled their pants and underwear down while he was standing behind them and examining their backs), L.G.'s testimony regarding Heiney's other \"\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   \" was relevant and probative of \"intent\" and \"absence of mistake or accident\" under Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Moreover, the directed verdict, itself, was irrelevant and inadmissible. \"Generally, a judgment of acquittal is not admissible for two reasons: (1) because it is hearsay * * * and (2) because it is not relevant since it is not a finding of fact, but merely an acknowledgement that the government failed to prove an essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Heiney from raising the directed verdict through L.G.'s cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In addition, we note that Heiney, not the state, referred to the Michigan criminal trial before the jury. During L.G.'s direct, the prosecutor only asked whether she had reported the incident to police. On cross, Heiney referred to L.G.'s testimony \"in Monroe County in front of\n   Judge Bronson\" in which \"the prosecutor in Monroe County\" asked her \"a lot of questions.\" While it was Heiney's right to impeach L.G. with her sworn testimony in the Michigan case, any corresponding prejudice that may have resulted from referencing the Michigan criminal trial was caused by Heiney's own line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Heiney also argues that the trial court erred by refusing to strike L.G.'s testimony that he had an erection during the first exam. Heiney claimed that this testimony was a \"total surprise\" because the state's written notice of L.G.'s testimony under Evid.R. 404(B) did not reference an erection, and L.G. did not mention an erection while testifying in the Michigan case. The trial court refused to strike the testimony because Heiney's counsel acknowledged receiving the sheriff's report from Monroe County in discovery, and that report documented Heiney's \"erect penis\" during L.G.'s exam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 66} We find the trial court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Evid.R. 404(B)'s notice requirement \"should not be construed to exclude otherwise relevant and admissible evidence solely because of a lack of notice, absent a showing of bad faith.\" (Staff Notes to the 2012 Amendment to Evid.R. 404 ). Here, Heiney had actual notice of the erection allegation through other discovery and, moreover, there is no evidence of bad faith. In addition, Heiney fully cross-examined L.G. regarding the alleged \"inconsistency\" with her Michigan testimony, where she did not mention an erection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 67} In sum, we reject Heiney's arguments that the court erred by admitting the testimony of C.G., S.E., and L.G. under Evid.R. 404(B). Within this same assignment of error, Heiney also argues that the court erred by failing to give a proper limiting instruction and by failing to voir dire the 404(B) witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Prior to jury deliberations, the court offered the following instruction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Now, evidence was received about the commission of acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial.

If you find that the evidence of other crimes, acts is true and that the defendant committed it, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake or accident or the defendant's motive, opportunity, intent or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offense charged in this trial or knowledge of circumstances surrounding the offense charged in this trial.

We presume that Heiney may be referring to the court's instruction that \"any 'bad acts' cannot be referred [to] in voir dire and/or opening statements.\" Heiney does not allege\n   noncompliance with that order, nor did this court find any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 71} For all these reasons, we find Heiney's seventh assignment of error not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Testimony of Dr. Christopher Foetisch, M.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Heiney's sixth assignment of error (\"Error VI\") relates to the testimony of Dr. Christopher Foetisch, who treated M.S. for shoulder pain after she left Heiney's practice. Foetisch testified as both a lay witness (as M.S.'s treating physician) and as an expert (in orthopedic medicine generally). Heiney argues that Foetisch's expert testimony violated Crim.R. 16(K), and the trial court improperly limited his cross-examination of Foetisch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    Crim.

The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert's testimony at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Approximately three months before trial, the state produced Foetisch's curriculum vitae and his records of treatment for M.S. Then, two months before trial, the prosecutor wrote a letter in which she provided a summary of Foetisch's \"expected testimony, conclusions and opinions\" and stated that the letter was provided \"[p]ursuant to Criminal Rule 16(K).\" Although Heiney argues that the \"record is silent as to how the prosecutor spontaneously arrived at the expert conclusions she placed in [the letter],\" the record makes clear that the prosecutor drafted the letter after interviewing Foetisch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 75} At a pretrial on January 22, 2016, Heiney argued that the prosecutor's letter did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K) because it was not prepared by Foetisch himself, and the defense \"need[ed]\" a report from\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   . The trial court found that the letter \"conformed\" to Crim.R. 16(K) because it summarized Foetisch's expert opinions and adequately prevented any unfair surprise at trial, and stated that \"Dr. Foetisch will not be permitted to testify beyond the parameters of those set forth in [the letter.]\" Then, at trial, Foetisch was designated as an expert witness without objection from defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 76} On appeal, Heiney makes a general argument that the trial court \"allowed the state to violate Crim.

In this case, however, Heiney expressly waived any argument that Foetisch should have been precluded from testifying as an expert under Crim.R. 16(K) : when the state moved for Foetisch to be designated as an expert in orthopedic medicine,\n   Heiney's counsel responded \"no objection.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The letter, however, makes no reference to AMA guidelines. When Heiney objected at trial, the state argued that Foetisch was testifying as a lay witness by \"describing merely his practice and his knowledge of the [AMA] Guidelines for having chaperones in the room, specifically when the exam of a patient is of a sensitive area.\" The trial court found that \"[s]o long as [the state] is not inquiring with the specific question of an expert, and * * * what is required * * * [Foetisch] certainly is allowed to testify [in his capacity as a lay witness].\" We agree that such lay testimony is permissible.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This testimony was not beyond the scope of the Crim.R. 16(K) letter, which expressly states that Foetisch \"has never found it medically necessary to give a patient of his a breast exam * * * [and that he] does not consider it a typical course of practice for an orthopedic doctor to perform breast exams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Finally, Heiney claims that Foetisch was somehow allowed to provide expert testimony \"regarding the complaint [M.S.] filed with the medical board.\" We disagree. The objection that Heiney relies upon concerned Foetisch's testimony regarding his own \"patient scheduling worksheet\" which contains a notation that M.S. \"called inquiring about procedure for [shoulder] exams as treated with another ortho with each visit becoming increasingly invasive and inappropriate.

As Heiney's counsel began to cross-examine Foetisch regarding the letter, the state objected, and Heiney's counsel told the judge that he merely intended to \"ask him if he participated in the drafting and preparation of that letter.\" Heiney's counsel was then allowed to use the letter to cross-examine Foetisch exactly as he intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Heiney also complains that he was precluded from fully cross-examining Foetisch with regard to his \"bias and possible motivations.\" During his cross-examination, Foetisch admitted that he could be considered to be in \"competition\" with Heiney, that he is not friends with Heiney, and that Heiney has published more scholarly articles than he. The state then objected to extended questioning regarding the relevant qualifications and accomplishments of Foetish and Heiney, arguing that \"the defense is attempting to beef up the credibility of the defendant without having the defendant testify.\" The trial court agreed, but allowed Heiney to proffer such evidence into the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 86} We fail to understand how the proffered evidence, which exhaustively details all of the relative professional accomplishments of Heiney and Foetisch (e.g., Heiney teaches courses in orthopedic surgery but Foetisch does not; Heiney has published twenty-four articles on orthopedic surgery while Foetsch has published only four; etc.) is probative of \"bias\" or \"motive.\" Regardless, Heiney's right to cross-examine is not unlimited. We find that Heiney's counsel adequately established a potential for bias-i.e., Heiney and Foetish were \"competitors\" and not friends-and the jury had sufficient information to make a discriminating appraisal of Foetisch's motives and bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Heiney also argues that the trial court improperly precluded him from using medical journals and scholarly articles for the purpose of demonstrating that Heiney's examination techniques, while perhaps different from those employed by Foetisch, were \"in accordance with authoritative text books.\" We disagree. The trial court allowed Heiney to publish to the jury and to question Foetisch with 17 such exhibits (exhibits C through S), but curtailed their use after that. The court did not err in preventing further repetitive testimony and limiting an already lengthy cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treesh\n   </em>\n   at 480,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20N.E.2d%20749\">\n    739 N.E.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (a trial court may limit cross-examination to avoid repetitive testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 88} For all of these reasons, Heiney's sixth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Heiney also argues that neither witness observed Heiney display any obvious type of sexual arousal, such as an erection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 94} While Heiney's arguments highlight evidence that he touched M.S. and K.O. for legitimate medical purposes, his arguments do not negate the presence of countervailing evidence in the record that, if believed by the jury, established that Heiney touched M.S. and K.O. for his own sexual gratification. For example, Foetisch testified that, as an orthopedic surgeon, he has never found it medically necessary to give a patient a breast exam, place gauze in the bra of a patient who is receiving a shoulder injection, or remove a patient's underwear during an examination. And, as discussed, three separate witnesses-C.G., S.E., and L.G.-offered testimony regarding similar acts by Heiney and their testimony was properly admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because it was probative of Heiney's actual \"intent\" when he touched M.S. and K.O. in similar ways-i.e., that his \"intent\" was for purposes of sexual gratification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

During his interviews, Heiney asserted that he always wears gloves and asks permission before touching a patient's sensitive areas, there is no reason to perform a chest exam unless a patient complains of pain radiating to or from the chest area, and there is no reason to expose a patient's full buttocks if the patient's complaints are limited to the low back or SI joint. And yet, according to M.S., Heiney pushed and squeezed her entire breast with his bare hand, and did not ask permission before pulling her bra cup away and placing gauze under her exposed breast. And, according to K.O., Heiney did not ask for permission before removing her pants and underwear; Heiney fully exposing her buttocks and vagina; Heiney touched her vagina with bare hands and without any explanation or warning; and Heiney touched her full breast, without gloves, despite the absence\n   of any complaint by her of pain or inflammation there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 96} We find, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, that there was sufficient evidence that Heiney's contact with M.S.'s and K.O.'s erogenous areas was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Force or Threat of Force\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Heiney also argues insufficient evidence of \"force or threat of force.\" \"Force\" is expressly defined by the Revised Code as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 98} \"Any,\" as used in R.C. 2901.01(A)(1), is an adjective. \" 'As an adjective, 'any' is defined as: '[o]ne or some, regardless of kind, quantity, or number; an indeterminate number or amount.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the doctor-patient relationship is still a relevant factor to determine whether\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount of violence, compulsion, or constraint (or threat thereof) was sufficient to cause the victim \"to submit\" to sexual contact. And given the unique nature of the doctor-patient relationship, it is likely that a victim-patient will \"submit\" to sexual contact during a medical examination upon even the slightest amount of physical force, even though the same amount of force would be insufficient to cause a victim to submit within the context of a different relationship. \"While an inappropriate touch would be cause for alarm if performed by an ordinary member of society, few would question the same touch if it occurred during\n   a doctor's examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. The law is clear:\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount of physical force or threat of physical force, however slight, is sufficient to support a GSI conviction, and \"force is a relative term, which depends on the totality of the circumstances in a given case.\"\n   <em>\n    Rupp,\n   </em>\n   7th Dist.

We now turn to the two alleged victims in this case: M.S. and K.O.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b6 123} The state alleged that Heiney committed GSI against M.S. during her final appointment on February 12, 2015. M.S. alleged that Heiney fondled her breasts three times. First, he asked M.S. for permission to perform a \"breast exam,\" ostensibly to see if the pain in her arm was somehow radiating from her breast, where she felt no pain. She agreed. Heiney then pulled the cup of her bra down, which completely exposed her breast, and he pushed and squeezed her breast with his bare hand. He later asked for her permission to examine her breast again, and then he \"pushed on [her breast] a couple times.\" Finally, before giving M.S. an injection in her arm, Heiney pulled the cup of her bra away from her body, and placed a piece of gauze \"deep inside [M.S.'s] bra under [her] breast\" with his bare hand. No one was in the examination room at the time. Heiney was standing between M.S. and the door. M.S. testified that although she did not vocalize her distress or physically resist, Heiney's conduct made her feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"embarrassed * * * angry [and] ashamed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b6 124} We find that Heiney's repeated manipulation and movement of M.S.'s bra, while examining her in closed room without anyone else present, and while standing between M.S. and the door, is sufficient evidence of a physical \"compulsion\" or \"constraint\" that was separate and apart from the sexual contact itself. \"Courts have found the element of force satisfied when the state presented evidence that the defendant manipulated or moved the victim's body or clothing* * *\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts relating to M.S. are most analogous to patient \"Annette\" in\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , where Roy pulled down Annette's bra, in a closed exam room, and fondled her breasts.\n   <em>\n    Roy,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist.

Annette also similarly testified that \"she never told Roy she was uncomfortable during the exam because he was a doctor and doctors are supposed to be trustworthy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Moreover, this case is unlike \"Patient C\" in\n   <em>\n    Dew\n   </em>\n   , where the court noted that the use of fraud or deception to secure Patient C's consent to the unnecessary \"vaginal adjustment\" was,\n   <em>\n    by itself\n   </em>\n   , insufficient of force.\n   <em>\n    Dew\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

There, unlike here, the state merely argued that Dew exceeded the scope of consent; it did not advance a theory of\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   force that was separate from the sexual conduct itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123. And, even if we assume that M.S.'s additional verbal consent to the two \"breast exams\" is somehow relevant to the analysis, Heiney did not ask for permission before he pulled her bra away and pushed a piece of gauze under her breast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   {\u00b6 125} Turning to K.O., during the examination in the closed room, Heiney directed her to take her arm out of her sleeve and bra strap. Heiney then held K.O.'s left arm with one of his hands and with his other hand, he pulled down her bra, exposed her breast and gave her a \"breast exam.\" Later, while examining her low back, K.O. testified that Heiney \"grabbed my pants and my underwear and pulled them down to right above my knees, and then started to feel around on my side\n   and in my upper thigh region where his fingers kind of brushed against my private area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   {\u00b6 126} Similar to M.S., we find that any rational trier of fact could have found that Heiney exercised some physical \"compulsion\" or \"constraint\" over K.O. by manipulating and removing articles of clothing-her bra, pants, and underwear-while in a closed room with no one else present. This physical manipulation of clothing required force, however minimal, beyond that inherent in the act of the sexual contact itself. Moreover, this minimal physical force was sufficient given the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the parties' doctor-patient relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   {\u00b6 127} We therefore find Heiney's first assignment of error (\"Error I\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

For example, he asserts that he used the \"least invasive treatment;\" was \"respectful;\" asked his patients for permission before examining them; that he was \"not alone with patients [and his] staff was welcome to come and go;\" and that exam room doors were always unlocked. He adds that none of the witnesses expressed discomfort during their respective examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   {\u00b6 130} Although such evidence was before the jury, we must extend special deference to the fact finder's credibility determinations, given that it is the fact finder who has the benefit of seeing the witnesses testify, observing their facial expressions and body language, hearing their voice inflections, and discerning qualities such as hesitancy, equivocation, and candor.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury was free to choose which witnesses to credit and how to interpret the evidence before it.

The remainder of the disputed jury instruction correctly and accurately states the applicable law as applied to the facts of this case, which we discussed at length when considering the\n   sufficiency of the evidence supporting \"force or threat of force.\" Most importantly, the trial court correctly stated that \"the doctor-patient relationship does not create an inference of force,\" but that it is \"a relevant factor in determining whether the victim's will was overcome by fear or duress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   {\u00b6 138} Moreover, it is unlikely that the jury relied upon the inapplicable sentence to find\n   <em>\n    non-\n   </em>\n   physical force, alone, supported the GSI convictions because the state correctly argued the presence of\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   force. In its closing, the state argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   So what evidence of force has been presented to you throughout the course of this trial? Let's start with [M.S.] It is true that Jake Heiney asked for her permission before he palpated her breast tissue and gave her that breast exam. * * * Jake Heiney did not, however, ask for her permission when he pulled her bra away from her breasts and shoved that gauze into the cup of her bra with no gloves on. With no one else in the room, Dr. Heiney positioned between her and the door, and that door closed. He pulled her bra away, he exposed her breasts, and he placed that gauze underneath her breast while commenting on her white bra. It was subtle, it was slight, but it was force. She trusted him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   So what about [K.O.]? What evidence of force was presented in [her] case? Here it's much more obvious. Dr. Heiney never asked for her permission before he touched her breasts. He just pulled down her bra and felt her up three separate times. And when she was bent over touching her toes and he yanked down her pants and her underwear, he didn't ask for her permission. He didn't warn her. He didn't tell her why he was doing it. He just did it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   {\u00b6 139} Thus, because the remainder of the jury instruction was legally correct and applicable to the facts, and because the state properly argued that\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   force supported the GSI convictions, we find that the trial court's inclusion of the one sentence relating to the inapplicable \"\n   <em>\n    Eskridge\n   </em>\n   rule\" was harmless error.

The Admissibility of Audiotaped Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   {\u00b6 140} Heiney's third assignment of error (\"Error III\") concerns his audiotaped interview by investigators Bliss and Yoakham from the State Medical Board of Ohio. Heiney claims that the trial court erred when it allowed the audiotaped interview to be played for the jury because (1) Heiney's own statements were inadmissible hearsay given that he \"said nothing against his interest,\" (2) Yoakham improperly commented on Heiney's veracity, and (3) the admission of Yoakham's recorded comments violated his right to confront Yoakham as an adverse witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   {\u00b6 141} First, Heiney did not object to the admission of his\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   recorded statements into evidence. Instead, Heiney's trial counsel affirmatively stated that \"there's just a couple parts of the transcript that are in issue,\" and then proceeded to object to only those portions of the transcript that contained Yoakham's statements.

Bliss merely testified that, as part of her investigation, she consulted with ten medical professionals, including three orthopedic surgeons, for the purpose of understanding \"standard exam procedures.\" Detective Bliss did not offer any substantive testimony regarding \"orthopedic care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   {\u00b6 153} Detective Bliss did, however, provide some expert testimony when she testified that, based on her 19 years of experience investigating sexual assault cases, it was not \"abnormal\" that K.O. had omitted an important detail (i.e., that Heiney's fingers rubbed against her vagina) from her initial police report. Detective Bliss explained that \"[i]t's actually very commonplace\" given that only 24 hours had elapsed between the incident and the time K.O. reported the incident to the police. She then started to testify that\n   \"when someone is victimized, they go through a process,\" but was cut off after Heiney's counsel made an objection, which was sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   {\u00b6 154} This particular testimony is properly categorized as expert testimony because it required specialized knowledge beyond the knowledge of the average juror.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During the examination, defense counsel objected five times. After the first objection was overruled, defense counsel was allowed to approach the bench and make a proffer for the record. Questioning continued, and defense counsel objected four more times in short succession. Defense counsel made the final objection by saying, \"Objection. Objection. Objection\" which the court overruled, without comment. Counsel then asked to approach the bench, again, to make another proffer. The court said, \"[s]tay seated. You can put it on the record afterwards. I've ruled on your objection.\" Moments later, at the completion of Downard's testimony, defense counsel again asked about making the proffer.

Defense counsel argued in favor of being allowed \"to explore\" whether the detective had any more \"documents, records, or anything else\" in her possession that she had used during her investigation but that the prosecutors did not have. The court sustained the state's objection, which Heiney claims was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   {\u00b6 172} In our review of the transcript, we note that, despite the trial court's ruling, defense counsel asked the detective\n   <em>\n    four more times\n   </em>\n   variations of the same question, i.e. whether she had \"turned over everything you have done to the prosecutor's office, and that's all been provided in discovery; correct?\" The state did not object to any, and the detective answered \"yes\" each time. The detective also admitted that her report did not make reference to all of the professionals she spoke to in determining whether charges should be brought against Heiney. Thus, even if the trial court did err in sustaining the state's objection, it was, at most, harmless error because defense counsel was able to elicit the very testimony it sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   {\u00b6 173} Heiney's eighth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    11.

Chapter 2950 is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. R.C. Chapter 2950 is, in fact, subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment because the Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that the sex offender registration requirements under R.C. Chapter 2950 are punitive, not remedial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the Supreme Court of Ohio recognized in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   , \"the legislature has chosen to draw the line\" by recognizing the unique culpability of adults who commit certain \"sexually oriented offenses,\" including gross sexual imposition, and such individuals are therefore \"deemed more culpable and more deserving of punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   {\u00b6 178} Second, regarding the severity of Heiney's 15-year registration requirement as a Tier I sex offender under R.C. 2950.07(B)(3), we note that Heiney's registration period is much shorter than the 25-year registration requirement of a Tier II sex offender, which was determined to be constitutional in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38 (finding that the 25-year registration requirement \"do[es] not meet the high burden of being so extreme as to be grossly disproportionate to the crime or shocking to a reasonable person.\") \"Since the Court in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   determined that a registration period that is nearly twice as long as the one imposed here is permissible under the Eighth Amendment, we can discern no reason to conclude that [Heiney's] 15-year registration period is so severe as to reach the level of unconstitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
