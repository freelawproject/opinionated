We find no merit in its three assignments of error, and we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Williams was the owner of a 2010 Nissan Maxima, which was involved in an accident. He took the car to SWCC for repair. SWCC represented to consumers that it performed all repairs to automotive specifications with the intent to restore vehicles to their preloss conditions, and that its technicians were trained and certified in the latest automotive advancements. It also represented that it had gold-class certification by I-CAR, a recognized industry training organization, and that it repaired vehicles according to I-CAR guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Williams subsequently filed a complaint alleging that SWCC had committed unfair, deceptive and unconscionable acts in connection with a consumer transaction, had violated the \"Motor Vehicle Repair Rule\" set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-13, and had committed fraud. The case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The evidence at trial showed that in repairing the car, SWCC had used structural bonding adhesive to attach panels to the car, a method which was not approved by the manufacturer or appropriate under I-CAR guidelines. Williams presented the testimony of three experts, who all testified that the car was not repaired in accordance with Nissan's specifications or I-CAR guidelines, that some repairs in the estimate were not completed, and that the some of the repairs had been done in an unworkmanlike and sloppy manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The experts also testified that due to the use of the bonding adhesive and the shoddy repairs, the car was unsafe to drive because it was no longer crashworthy. Williams stated that he had stopped driving the car due to its unsafe condition. The experts also testified regarding the car's diminished value after the shoddy repairs, with one stating that it was worthless post repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The jury found in favor of Williams on both of his CSPA claims. It found that SWCC had (1) represented that the repair of the car had sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits that it did not have;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) represented that the repair was of a particular standard or quality that it was not; (3) represented that the repair had been performed in accordance with a previous representation, when it had not; (4) represented that it had a sponsorship, approval, or affiliation that it did not have; (5) failed to perform the repairs in a workmanlike manner; (6) stalled and delayed or attempted to avoid a legal obligation; (7) charged for labor based on an estimate of time, instead of the actual time to perform the repair; (8) returned the car to Williams in an unsafe condition; (9) failed to provide the consumer with an itemized list of repairs and failed to tender replaced parts; and (10) committed other deceptive and unfair practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The jury awarded Williams damages of $8,079.78. Subsequently, Williams filed a motion for treble damages, attorney fees and costs. The trial court granted the motion and awarded Williams total damages of $105,462.59, plus interest and costs. SWCC filed a motion for a new trial on the bases of misconduct of the prevailing party, newly discovered evidence, and errors of law at the trial. The trial court overruled that motion, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Diminution in Value\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, SWCC contends that the trial court erred in admitting testimony as to diminution in value and permitting the issue to be considered by the jury. It argues that while Williams presented evidence regarding the car's value after the repairs and before the accident, he failed to present evidence as to its value after the accident, but before the repairs. Therefore, Williams failed to meet his burden to show diminution in value. SWCC also argues that the trial court erred in overruling its motion for a directed verdict because of the lack of evidence of diminution in value. This assignment of error is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} SWCC relies on\n   <em>\n    Falter v.

In both of those cases, the courts held that the owner of a damaged vehicle may recover the difference between its market value immediately before and immediately after the collision.\n   <em>\n    Falter\n   </em>\n   at paragraph one of the syllabus;\n   <em>\n    Rakich\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The owner of a vehicle may prove and recover the reasonable cost of repairs provided that the recovery may not exceed the difference between the market value of the vehicle immediately before and after the collision.\n   <em>\n    Falter\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus;\n   <em>\n    Rakich\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Thus, SWCC argues, since Williams did not present evidence as to the value of the car after the accident but before the alleged shoddy repairs, he cannot recover for diminution in value. We disagree.\n   <em>\n    Falter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rakich\n   </em>\n   involved tort actions for damages after an automobile accident against a tortfeasor or the insurance company, and not allegations that repairs were not performed properly. Neither involved claims against the repair shop for shoddy repairs under the CSPA. Therefore, we find them to be inapplicable to the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The purpose of R.C.

Despite SWCC's claim to the contrary, he also presented evidence of the car's diminished value due to the shoddy repairs. Another expert testified in depth about how he arrived at his figure for diminished value. He started with the total post-repair diminished value and subtracted the inherent diminished value due to the accident, which he calculated using a standard rate of 30 percent of the car's pre-accident value. The result was the diminished value of the car due solely to the improper repairs. This evidence was relevant to determining the car's diminished value and was proper under the CSPA definition of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We review a decision granting or denying a directed verdict de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

That evidence, if believed, would have allowed reasonable minds to disagree on the damages he had suffered due to the improper repairs. Consequently, the evidence was legally sufficient to proceed to the jury, and the trial court did not err in denying SWCC's motion for a directed verdict. SWCC's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Attorney Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In its second assignment of error, SWCC contends that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees and expenses.

The trial court stated that it had reviewed them and found them to be reasonable. SWCC did not challenge the reasonableness of the fees. SWCC argues that because the jury found in its favor on Williams's fraud claim and found that SWCC acted knowingly on only two of Williams's claims under the CSPA, the court should only have awarded Williams attorney fees on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that where claims can be separated so that there is one under the CSPA for which attorney fees may be awarded, and others for which no fees are recoverable, the trial court must only award fees for the time spent pursuing the CSPA claim.\n   <em>\n    Bittner\n   </em>\n   at 145;\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.

The court further found that case involved \"some complex and detailed factual issues\" and that Williams's success \"was influenced by counsel's ability to focus the jury on those detailed facts favoring\" Williams's claims. The trial court conducted a thorough analysis of the reasonableness of the fees, and we cannot hold that amount of the fees was so high or so low as to shock the conscience. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We note that the jury awarded damages of $8,079.78, and the court awarded attorney fees and costs of over $85,000.

That dealer then sold it to another individual for approximately $11,000, although SWCC did not indicate what, if anything, Williams had received for it. The affidavits further stated that the car was sold in the same condition as it was presented to be in at trial and that \"Mr. Williams appears to have sold the vehicle without disclosure\" of its condition. Williams responded with affidavit in which he acknowledged selling the car to the dealer in the same condition it was in at trial. He further stated that he fully disclosed all issues with the car, including that the fact that he had sued the body shop, that the car was still disassembled from the last inspection by his expert, and that he had left it overnight so that the dealer could inspect it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We fail to see how Williams's actions constitute misconduct, and nothing in the record shows that SWCC was prejudiced by any alleged misconduct. SWCC contends that these facts undermine the testimony of Williams's expert that the car had no value and that it was unsafe to operate. But SWCC presented its own expert testimony and had an opportunity to rebut Williams's evidence regarding value, and the value that a third-party obtained in a sale after-the-fact was irrelevant to that determination. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the trial court's decision to overrule the motion for a new trial on the basis of misconduct was so arbitrary, unreasonable or unconscionable as to connote an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blakemore v.

It argues that the judge assigned to the case had assumed the bench the week it was assigned to trial and did not participate in any pretrial proceedings. Even though the case was tried to a visiting judge, the assigned judge ruled on the motion for a new trial. SWCC contends that due to the nature of the issues it raised in its motion, the motion should have been presented to the visiting judge or that the originally assigned judge should have conducted a hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 31} First, SWCC never asked for a hearing on the motion as required by Local Rule 14(C) of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas.
