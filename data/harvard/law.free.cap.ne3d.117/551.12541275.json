Following two failed attempts to serve defendant, plaintiff filed a \"Motion for Alternate Service\" pursuant to section 2-203.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-203.1), which allows a plaintiff to serve an individual defendant by special order of court. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion and ordered defendant to be served in a specific manner. Defendant failed to appear for court and the trial court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of possession and money judgment against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant filed a combined motion to vacate the trial court's judgment and quash service of process arguing that she was not served in accordance with the constructive service requirements of the Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-107). The trial court vacated its judgment and eventually denied defendant's motion to quash service of process. Defendant again failed to appear for court, and the trial court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of possession and money judgment against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Defendant appeals the trial court's judgment arguing that (1) the trial court erred when it denied her motion to quash service of process and (2) the trial court's judgment is void for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff failed to file a brief in response. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 16, 2016, plaintiff filed a complaint for eviction seeking an order of possession and a money judgment in the amount of $2800 for \"rent late fees, rent and late fees that accrue up to and including judgment, unpaid utilities, and any damages to premises.\" Following two failed attempts to serve defendant with an \"eviction summons for trial,\" plaintiff filed a \"Motion for Alternate Service\" pursuant to section 2-203.1 of the Code and requested that defendant be served \"via regular mail to Defendant or by any other means directed by this Court.\" On August 25, 2016, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion and ordered defendant to be served by \"certified mail, regular mail, overnight delivery + posting of notice on that door of apartment + photo evidence of same.\" Defendant failed to appear for court, and the trial court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of possession and money judgment in the amount of $11,200 in favor of plaintiff. The trial court stayed enforcement of its judgment until September 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On September 23, 2016, defendant filed a combined motion to vacate the trial court's judgment and quash service of process. The trial court granted defendant's motion to vacate and set a briefing schedule on defendant's motion to quash. Defendant filed two memorandums in support of her motion to quash, arguing that service of process pursuant to section 2-203.1 of the Code is improper in an eviction action and that plaintiff failed to serve defendant in accordance with section 9-107 of the Act. The trial court denied defendant's motion, and defendant failed to appear for court thereafter. On December 22, 2016, the trial court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order of possession and a money judgment in the amount of $19,600 in favor of plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Defendant appeals the trial court's judgment arguing that the trial court erred when it (1) ordered defendant to be served in a manner that failed to comply with the constructive service requirements of section 9-107 of the Act and (2) entered a money judgment against defendant though she had not generally appeared\n   and was not served with summons as required by section 9-107 of the Act. As a result of the trial court's errors, defendant argues, the trial court's order of possession and money judgment are void for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 The issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to quash service of process such that its judgment is void for lack of personal jurisdiction.

We highlight the posting and mailing requirements of section 9-107 of the Act here because the trial court did not order defendant to be served by publication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 21 When a plaintiff serves a defendant by posting and mailing of notices, the notices must:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    \"be in the name of the clerk of the court, be directed to the defendant or unknown occupant, shall state the nature of the cause against the defendant or unknown occupant and at whose instance issued and the time and place for trial, and shall also state that unless the defendant or unknown occupant appears at the time and place fixed for trial, judgment will be entered by default, and shall specify the character of the judgment that will be entered in such cause.\" 735 ILCS 5/9-107 (West 2016).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The notices must also be served by the sheriff in accordance with the following procedure:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    \"The sheriff shall post 3 copies of the notice in 3 public places in the neighborhood of the court where the cause is to be tried, at least 10 days prior to the day set for the appearance, and, if the place of residence of the defendant or unknown occupant is stated in any affidavit on file, shall at the same time mail one copy of the notice addressed to such defendant or unknown occupant at such place of residence shown in such affidavit. On or before the day set for the appearance, the sheriff shall file the notice with an endorsement thereon stating the time when and places where the sheriff posted and to whom and at what address he or she mailed copies as required by this Section. For want of sufficient notice any cause may be continued from time to time until the court has jurisdiction of the defendant or unknown occupant.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20N.E.2d%20255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    A plaintiff that strictly complies with the posting and mailing (or publication and mailing) requirements of section 9-107 of the Act properly effects constructive service of process upon a defendant and can obtain an order of possession, only.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b6 22 B. Money Judgment\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 23 Under section 9-107 of the Act, a plaintiff that properly serves a defendant by \"posting and mailing\" or \"publication and mailing\"\n    <em>\n     cannot\n    </em>\n    obtain a money judgment against a defendant for unpaid rent until the defendant \"appears generally\" or \"is served with summons.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20N.E.2d%20255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"court shall not enter judgment as to any rent claim joined in the complaint\" \"until such time as the defendant or unknown occupant appears generally or is served with summons\"). Section 9-107 of the Act's use of the words \"served with summons\" is a reference to section 2-203 of the Code, which allows a plaintiff to serve an individual defendant with summons either personally or by leaving a copy of the summons at the defendant's usual place of abode with either a family member or resident who is at least 13 years old.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20N.E.2d%20255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2-203(a)(1)-(2). Therefore, section 9-107 of the Act does not set out a procedure by which a plaintiff seeking a money judgment on a claim of rent may constructively serve a defendant. However, given section 9-107 of the Act's reference to section 2-203 of the Code, if a plaintiff does not want\n    to wait until a defendant generally appears and has not served a defendant with summons, he or she may comply with section 2203.1 of the Code and serve the defendant by special order of court to obtain a money judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 24 IV. The Trial Court's Order of Possession and Money Judgment\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 25 Moving to the case at hand, we hold that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to quash service of process and its judgment is void for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Equity Residential Properties Management Corp. v. Nasolo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262147\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/364/26/#p32\">\n     364 Ill.

Here, plaintiff's \"Motion for Alternate Service\"\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    the trial court's order granting plaintiff's motion failed to comply with the posting and mailing requirements of section 9-107 of the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b6 26 First, plaintiff asked the trial court for permission to serve defendant in manner clearly out of accord with the strict requirements of section 9-107 of the Act: \"via regular mail to Defendant or by any other means directed by this Court.\" We note that plaintiff's motion even failed to comply with the statutory section under which it was filed, section 2-203.1 of the Code, because plaintiff did not attach the required affidavit to her motion. See 735 ILCS 5/2-203.1 (West 2016) (\"The motion shall be accompanied with an affidavit stating the nature and extent of the investigation made to determine the whereabouts of the defendant and the reasons why service is impractical under items (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of Section 2-203, including a specific statement showing that a diligent inquiry as to the location of the individual defendant was made and reasonable efforts to make service have been unsuccessful.\"). Plaintiff's \"Motion for Alternate Service\" failed to comply with either section 9-107 of the Act or section 2-203.1 of the Code in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 27 Second, the trial court's order specifying the manner in which defendant was to be served (\"certified mail, regular mail, overnight delivery + posting of notice on that door of apartment + photo evidence of same\") failed to comply with the posting and mailing requirements of section 9-107 of the Act. Noticeably absent from the trial court's order is the requirement that the sheriff post three copies of the notice in three public places. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20126\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9-107 (\"[t]he sheriff shall post 3 copies of the notice in 3 public places in the neighborhood of the court where the cause is to be tried\"). The trial court's order also fails to mention the word sheriff, let alone the sheriff's required role in the notification and mailing process. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20126\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"[o]n or before the day set for the appearance, the sheriff shall file the notice with an endorsement thereon stating the time when and places where the sheriff posted and to whom and at what address he or she mailed copies as required\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b6 28 Third, the trial court entered a money judgment against defendant though she had not generally appeared and was not served with summons. The trial court's money judgment, therefore, ran afoul of section 9-107 of the Act's specific requirement that a claim of rent remain pending until defendant \"appears generally or is served with summons.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20126\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"the court shall not enter judgment as to any rent claim joined in the complaint\" \"until such time as the defendant or unknown occupant appears generally or is served with summons\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 29 Accordingly, the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to\n    quash service of process and its order of possession and money judgment are void for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 30 CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 31 We reverse the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash service of process. The trial court's order of possession and money judgment are void for lack of personal jurisdiction. We vacate the trial court's order of possession and money judgment and remand for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    \u00b6 32 Reversed in part and vacated in part; cause remanded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Presiding Justice Pierce and Justice Mikva concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-48\">\n     This standardized form can be found on the Illinois Courts website.
