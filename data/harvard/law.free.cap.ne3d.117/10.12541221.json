Thompson guilty of two counts of endangering children and one count of permitting child abuse of their three-month old infant A.T.. The trial court sentenced them each to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} In this consolidated appeal Fannon and Thompson raise a combined total of eight errors. We reject all of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b63} An Athens County Grand Jury initially indicted Fannon and Thompson on one count of Permitting Child Abuse in violation of R.C. 2903.15(A) and one count of Child Endangering in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A), both third-degree felonies. A superseding indictment added a second count of Child Endangering in violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(1), a second-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b64} The state moved for a joinder of the cases, which Fannon opposed. The trial court granted the state's motion and the case proceeded to a jury trial on Monday, May 8, 2017. On Friday, the fifth day of trial, Fannon and Thompson failed to appear. Trial counsel was unable to locate them or secure their appearance. The trial court recessed trial until Tuesday and issued warrants. At a status conference Monday, May 15, 2017 counsel for Thompson and Fannon advised they had no contact with their clients over the weekend and had no information about their whereabouts. The trial court granted the state's request to proceed without Thompson and Fannon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b65} The jury returned verdicts finding Thompson and Fannon guilty on all counts. Five days after the jury verdict, authorities located Thompson and Fannon several counties away in a motel in Lockbourne, Ohio and took them into custody. Both Thompson and Fannon pleaded guilty to charges of failure to appear. The trial court refused to merge any of the counts and sentenced Thompson to an aggregate prison term of 15 and one-half years and Fannon to an aggregate prison term of 11 and one-half years, each defendant's sentence included an 18-month sentence for failure to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b66} The trial testimony and exhibits established that A.T. was born healthy on November 12, 2013 to Fannon and Thompson. Her health was typical and normal during her first few weeks of life. At A.T.'s two-month appointment, her pediatrician Dr. Zidron identified a small healing bruise on A.T.'s jaw line that is unusual for nonmobile infants. She also diagnosed A.T. with an upper respiratory infection and a failure to thrive. Dr. Zidron scheduled a two-week follow-up appointment to monitor A.T.'s condition but Fannon and Thompson failed to bring A.T. to that appointment. Dr. Zidron did not see A.T. again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b67} On Friday evening, February 28, 2014 at about 9:20 p.m., Fannon took A.T. to the emergency room at O'Blenness Memorial Hospital. Fannon told the emergency\n   room physician, Dr. Nathan Lowien, that a two-year-old cousin had fallen on A.T. on Wednesday, February 26 and caused a bruise on her forehead and swelling of her right foot. Dr. Lowien noted that A.T. appeared more fatigued than normal. Dr. Lowien was concerned that A.T. was abnormal for her age and that her injuries did not add up with the reported event of a two-year-old child falling on her. Fannon did not give any other cause for A.T.'s injuries. Dr. Lowien notified Children's Protective Services because he was concerned that A.T. had suffered abusive injuries. Dr. Lowien testified that A.T.'s condition was serious, so he transferred her to Nationwide Children's Hospital by ambulance for further testing and evaluation. Fannon did not accompany A.T. in the ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b68} During the trip to Nationwide Children's Hospital, the emergency medical technician became concerned because A.T. would not wake up. The technician had to resort to flicking A.T.'s foot firmly to get her to wake up. When A.T. did finally wake up, the technician testified that A.T.'s left eye started moving to the left, which could be indicative of a brain injury. A.T. arrived at Nationwide Children's Hospital at approximately 1:45 am Saturday, March 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b69} A number of physicians treated A.T. during her hospitalization, including Dr. Brent Adler, a pediatric radiologist, and Dr. Megan Letson, a child abuse pediatrician. According to these physicians A.T. suffered a complex skull fracture, going in multi-directions, multiple healing rib fractures on both the front and back portions of the ribs, a healing fracture on the right femur, three broken fingers on her right hand, healing fractures of the pubic bone, a fracture of the left toe, fractured acromions (shoulder blade), a healing fracture on the left tibia, a frenulum tear (the tissue that connects the lip to the gum), and a significant, life-threatening brain injury with swelling and blood on the brain. A.T. suffered \"metaphyseal fractures\" resulting from a shaking or other non-accidental trauma and her brain injury resulted in global developmental delay, which includes delayed speech, gross motor, and fine motor skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b610} Dr. Adler was confident the brain injury was more than twelve hours old and probably twenty-four hours given the degree of definition in the scan and placed A.T. at risk of becoming brain dead. Other fractures were determined to be one week old to four weeks old, depending upon the specific bone fractured. Both doctors testified that the injuries were inconsistent with accidental trauma, extremely unusual in nonmobile infants, could not be explained by the incident involving the young toddler jumping or falling on A.T., and were the result of at least two separate traumatic incidents. Moreover, Dr. Adler determined that A.T. had no features that would indicate she had Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bone disease ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b611} Dr. Letson testified that frenulum tears in a nonmobile infant are caused by a blunt object to the mouth, such as forced bottle or spoon feeding or a punch to the mouth that is accompanied with sudden profuse bleeding. However, Fannon and Thompson told Dr. Letson that A.T. had no history of bleeding of the mouth. Dr. Letson considered A.T.'s injuries to be inflicted, rather than accidental, and her final diagnosis was \"physical abuse which included abuse of [sic]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   head trauma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b612} A.T.'s adoptive mother, Melissa Trombley, testified that she was A.T.'s foster mother before adopting her. Trombley testified that A.T. continues to receive medical care after her release from Nationwide Children's, including orthopedic surgeons, a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, and several doctors at a traumatic brain injury clinic. A.T. suffers developmental delays in mobility and speech and was unable to crawl because she lacks the use of her right arm; she sees an occupational therapist to help her develop motor skills. Trombley testified that A.T. is legally blind, has no depth perception and has no peripheral vision. Trombley testified that A.T walks with her left foot down but on her right toes to the side and that she walks sideways because of her vision problems. Trombley testified that A.T. continues to receive therapy at a special preschool for children with disabilities. Trombley testified that since A.T. has been in Trombley's care A.T. has not broken any bones or suffered any injuries that would require hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b613} Because of the abusive nature of A.T.'s injuries, Detective Brice Fick and Detective John Deak of the Athens County Sheriff's Office became involved. Detective Deak interviewed Fannon and Thompson on March 1, 2014; both detectives interviewed Fannon and Thompson again on March 7, 2014. Deak testified that from his interviews of Fannon and Thompson he learned that Thompson was unemployed. Fannon was employed at a Hocking Hills inn/restaurant but it was a slow period and she worked only 15 hours a week. Fannon and Thompson told both detectives that they were A.T.'s primary caregivers and that A.T. was in their care 98% of the time, though there was an occasional hour or two a week when Thompson would have his mother watch her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b614} Thompson told Detective Deak that on Thursday, February 27, 2014, he had noticed A.T.'s eyes start to cross and slant downward. Thompson explained to Deak that he had learned that A.T.'s injuries were caused the previous day, Wednesday February 26, when an eighteen-month-old cousin had accidentally jumped on A.T. while Thompson's mother was watching her. Thompson told Deak that A.T. was in his mother's care from 11:00 am until 8:30 pm, while he and Fannon helped Thompson's brother move. Thompson told Deak that A.T. appeared normal on Wednesday evening when he picked her up from his mother. Fannon had gone to work at approximately 5 pm Wednesday and returned home at approximately 10:30 pm. Fannon told Deak that when she returned home from work that evening A.T. seemed fine and was sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b615} Thompson's mother, Teresa Tolliver, testified that A.T.'s injuries occurred when a seventeen-month-old cousin\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   jumped on her. Tolliver described how the cousin jumped from the coffee table to the couch, a distance of about one foot, and landed on A.T.'s lower body. Tolliver testified that she picked A.T. up and looked at her and did not believe A.T. had been hurt. Tolliver stated that A.T. was always under her supervision that day and neither Tolliver nor anyone else in the home caused any other injuries to A.T. The jumping incident was insignificant enough to Tolliver that she did not report it to Thompson when he came to pick up A.T. that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b616} Both Fannon and Thompson denied causing A.T.'s injuries and, other than the jumping incident involving the young cousin, had no other explanation for her\n   injuries. Other relatives testified that they did not cause the injuries to A.T. nor did they witness anyone else injure A.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.

Stipulation to \"Serious Physical Harm\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b622} Fannon contends that the trial court erred in failing to sever her case from Thompson's because she was prevented from stipulating that A.T.'s injuries satisfied the definition of \"serious physical harm,\" an element of permitting child abuse under R.C. 2903.15(A). Fannon argues that she was willing to stipulate to this element, but Thompson was not. Thus, she argues that she was prejudiced because evidence of \"heart-breaking details\" of A.T.'s physical impairments, including A.T.'s blindness, academic delays and physical limitations created a strong risk that jury sympathy for A.T. would prejudice Fannon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b623} However the state refused to stipulate to the \"serious physical harm\" element of its case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graves Lumber Co. v. Croft\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

There is no evidence in the record that the state would have accepted either defendant's offer to stipulate that A.T. suffered \"serious physical harm.\" Thus Fannon can show no error, plain or otherwise, in the court's decision not to sever her case from Thompson's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2. The\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   Rule and the Confrontation Clause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b624} Fannon also contends that admission of two of Thompson's statements in the joint trial violated her Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Thompson under\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). She argues that Thompson's statement that A.T. was in their care 98% of the time \"was so high as to be a functional confession - if Sam was with A.T. 98% of the time, then it was likely he was responsible for hurting A.T.\" Fannon also argues that Thompson admitted to hurting A.T. in an \"apology letter\" and she was prejudiced by her inability to confront Thompson about the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b625} The state contends that Fannon's argument is entirely speculative because Fannon and Thompson fled the jurisdiction on the fifth day of trial.

Both co-defendants fled the jurisdiction together in the middle of the trial and Thompson was not present to assert either his right to testify, or his right not to. After the state put on its case Fannon was to present her defense, then Thompson his. According to the record the trial commenced on a Monday, Fannon presented her defense on Thursday and testified in her defense. Based on statements from Thompson's attorney, the trial court decided to stop for the day on Thursday afternoon. Thursday evening Fannon and Thompson fled the jurisdiction. After neither was located over the weekend, the court issued arrest warrants and proceeded without them the following Tuesday. Fannon's trial attorney formally rested Fannon's case, and although Thompson's attorney had previously stated he had witness testimony to present, after Thompson disappeared his attorney rested his case without calling a witness. Thus Fannon was not prevented from cross-examining Thompson because he had asserted his right not to testify. Rather she and Thompson fled the jurisdiction and were absent for the remainder of the trial. Her argument that her right to confrontation was violated is entirely speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b631} The parties have cited no case law, nor have we found any, that has analyzed the\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   rule in this unique situation. Assuming arguendo that the\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   rule applies here, we find no error, plain or otherwise, in the court's decision not to sever her case.\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   applies only to \"testimonial\" statements that are \"incriminating\" or that \"tend significantly to incriminate\" a co-defendant. Thompson's statement to Detective Deak that A.T. was in his and Fannon's care 98% of the time, even though testimonial, was not incriminating in any way. \"Incriminating\" means \"demonstrating or indicating involvement in criminal activity.\" Black's Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004). A.T. was a newborn infant and was three months old at the time of the investigation. There is nothing incriminating about a statement that a three-month-old infant spends 98% of the time in the care and custody of its parents, particularly here where one parent is unemployed. Fannon's own testimony was that she was employed, but it was \"a slow time\" and A.T. was in her care about 85% of the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, according to the investigators, it was a statement Fannon had also made, though she contested this in her trial testimony. And, it did not prejudice Fannon's defense, which was that the toddler's jumping/falling caused A.T.'s injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b633} Thompson's handwritten \"apology letter\" to Fannon was not testimonial and does not implicate Fannon in criminal activity. The state found the apology letter during a search of Thompson\n   and Fannon's residence and used it as evidence they had \"relationship issues.\" In it Thompson apologizes for his \"mouth\" and assures Fannon he would never physically hurt her or A.T.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I've been a real asshole and have said a lot of fucked up shit! * * * I've failed as a man - my job is to keep you and [A.T.] safe and protected but all I've done is hurt you guys by belittling you! * * * Hell I get mad and yell at her and you, more than I say I love you! * * * I need you to help me lose my anger. My mouth was the reason I got hit by a car and now its [sic] affecting my family. When I'm mad I'm sure I don't do things the easiest or safest way either. I just don't want to lose your faith or belief in me. I heard the doubt in your voice today on the phone, I do not hurt [A.T.] intentionally. God strike me dead before I put my hands on my family! I hope you do believe that bc [sic] I'd do anything for you guys. My anger is gone! I need you to help me Kayla. I want to be happy again!

I love you baby girl! * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b634} In determining whether the apology letter is testimonial, we focus on the expectations of the declarant at the time the statement was made. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Thompson wrote this personal apology letter with any expectation that it would be read by anyone other than Fannon. Although the letter is not dated, it was written prior to the investigation and the March 1, 2014 search of the residence. There is no evidence in the record that it was written under circumstances that would cause an objective witness to reasonably believe it would be available for use at a later trial. Therefore, it is not testimonial and does not violate the\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court had no basis under\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   to sever Fannon's case from Thompson and try them separately. The trial court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise, when it did not sever the two cases on\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b636} Fannon contends that prosecutorial misconduct deprived her of a fair trial. She argues that the prosecutor used a slide with \"guilty\" written on it during opening statement, denigrated defense counsel during voir dire, inflamed the passions of the jury during opening statement by showing a picture of A.T., and put Fannon on trial for \"enjoying work.\" Fannon concedes that trial counsel only objected to the \"guilty\" slide and the plain-error analysis applies to the other instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Thompson also contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by the use of the \"guilty\" slide. It is one of the errors identified in his cumulative-error assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   1. Prosecution's Use of \"Guilty\" on a Visual Aid During Opening Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b637} During its opening statement the prosecution used a PowerPoint presentation that included a slide with the word \"guilty\" in large font. Thompson argues this surpassed the permissible threshold of fair comment afforded during opening statements and the result \"was to burn the word 'Guilty' upon the minds of the jurors from the very start of trial.\" Both Fannon and Thompson's trial counsel\n   moved for a mistrial at the conclusion of opening statements, arguing that the prosecution \"can't put a sign in front of the jury\" with the word \"guilty.\" The trial court overruled the motion on the ground that the prosecutor is asking in opening statement that the jury find the defendant guilty and \"merely repeating the word on the board is not inflammatory or prejudicial to the extent that it requires a mistrial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b638} \"The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the conduct was improper and, if so, whether the rights of the accused were materially prejudiced.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecutor may neither misstate the law nor express his or her personal opinion on the merits of the case or the credibility of witnesses.

The state represents that the photograph used in opening statement was among those introduced at trial (included as Exhibit 3-C). Fannon does not refute this in her reply brief. The state argues that the photograph of A.T. was introduced into evidence and showed the seriousness of the injuries.

However, while counsel is afforded wide latitude in the presentation of opening statements, counsel is not permitted to use that opportunity to introduce evidence. The prosecution can summarize evidence, it can describe evidence, it can anticipate evidence; however, it risks a mistrial when it engages in an attempt to actually introduce evidence. Even when that specific evidence is later properly admitted, such a premature use can still potentially result in reversible error.

The prosecutor reviewed the elements of the crimes charged, the state's burden of proof, summarized the nature of A.T.'s injuries,\n   what he expected to show through medical records and witness testimony, and concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   March 1, 2014, this is [A.T.].

Thank you and thank you for your service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b660} Contrary to Fannon's representations, the prosecutor did not describe himself as \"champion\" and did not describe Fannon as \"the person from whom A.T. needed protection.\" When we review the opening statement and the actual words spoken, we find nothing improper or inflammatory about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   4. Fannon on Trial for Enjoying Work\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b661} Fannon also contends the prosecution engaged in misconduct because \"[T]he State put Kayla on trial for enjoying work\" and \"relied upon stereotypes about motherhood to inflame the jury.\" Fannon cites to two places in the record to support her argument. She did not object to either at trial and forfeited all but plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b662} The first instance was during Detective Deak's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Q.

Uh, I believe her favorite thing to do was go to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Next Fannon cites her cross-examination after she had admitted she missed A.T.'s follow-up doctor appointment for the \"failure to thrive\" diagnosis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Q. Okay. So you can follow your work schedule. But you can't follow your doctor's appointment schedule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   A.

No it's not. I had forgotten about the appointment or the car[d] got misplaced or something and I was also looking for a new doctor at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q. Do you remember talking to Detective Deak at the hospital on March 1, 2014?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Q.

I do not recall saying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b663} We find nothing improper about the prosecution's line of questioning. Part of the state's case focused on the lack of medical care Fannon and Thompson sought for A.T., their lack of concern for A.T.'s injuries, their failure to take her to follow-up appointments, and their delay in seeking medical attention for her even though her injuries were severe, permanent, and life-threatening. As the state explained this line of questioning served to highlight Fannon's lack of responsibility for A.T.'s health and medical condition. It was not an improper attempt to rely \"upon stereotypes about motherhood to inflame the jury.\" We find no error, let alone plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b664} We overrule Fannon's second assignment of error. Because Thompson did not identify the \"guilty\" slide issue as a separate assignment of error, we will incorporate this analysis when we address his \"cumulative error\" assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   C. The Admission of Irrelevant, Prejudicial, or Improper Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b665} Both Thompson and Fannon contend that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce certain irrelevant, prejudicial or improper evidence. The trial court has broad discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence; appeals of these decisions are reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In its response to Fannon's motion in limine, the state argued that in 2010 Fannon's parents were awarded temporary custody of sixteen-month-old M.F. In 2011, M.F., then a two and one-half year old, had spent an extended visit with Fannon and Thompson. When M.F. returned to Fannon's parents, she acted dazed and had multiple bruises. Fannon told her mother that M.F. had fallen from a chair and that she had taken M.F. for a C.T. scan. However, Mary Fannon was unable to locate any C.T. results and was advised by M.F.'s primary care physician to take M.F. to a hospital for possible abuse. Mary Fannon took M.F. to Nationwide Children's Hospital where a physician identified multiple bruises and M.F.'s urine drug screen tested positive for amphetamine. Case worker Olvera-Caito interviewed Fannon, who denied any knowledge of all but one bruise, denied injuring M.F., denied knowing who might have injured M.F., and denied having any knowledge of how amphetamine would appear in M.F.'s urine. Fannon acknowledged that her mother told her to take M.F. to the hospital, but she decided not to do it because M.F. seemed better. The agency substantiated a report of neglect and abuse of M.F. who was ordered to remain in her grandparents' custody, Fannon was to have only supervised visitation, and Thompson was ordered to have no contact whatsoever with M.F..\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b670} The state argued based on\n   <em>\n    Blankenship, supra\n   </em>\n   , evidence of M.F.'s prior abuse was relevant and admissible to show identity and absence of mistake or accident.

The trial court allowed the state to introduce other act evidence that Blankenship\n   had abused his older son Joseph and the appellate court agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Testimony concerning Boyd's inability to deal with the needs and demands of Joseph, as an infant, resulting in Boyd's abuse of the child, is therefore relevant. When coupled with Boyd's and Mary's extra-judicial statements disclaiming any knowledge as to the cause of Mark's injuries, and the fact that Mark was at all times solely in their care, we find Boyd's past abuse of Joseph \"tends to show\" both identity and the absence of mistake or accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b671} Here, the trial court determined that although such evidence is not admissible to prove character, it would be admissible here to show identity, absence of mistake or accident, motive, intent, opportunity, preparation, plan and knowledge. The trial court also found that the evidence is more probative than prejudicial under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 403(A). However, the trial court and the state acknowledged defense counsel's concern about potential jury confusion over the agency's \"substantiation of abuse claim.\" The state offered not to introduce testimony of the agency's ultimate conclusion and the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court gave a limiting instruction on other acts evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b672} Fannon contends the evidence had little probative value as the incident of M.F.'s abuse was significantly different from that involving A.T.'s abuse, i.e. M.F.'s abuse was \"of a substantially different quality\" than A.T.'s because \"M.F. had bruises, not broken bones.\" It also differed in that \"the jury heard that M.F. tested positive for a controlled substance\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there were no allegations that A.T. had tested positive. Fannon also contends that even though both she and Thompson had access to M.F. during her visit, Thompson's sister was also living with them at the time. Fannon contends that in M.F.'s case no allegations of abuse or neglect were substantiated by a court and the evidence of harm was not strong enough to justify changing her access to M.F.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, M.F.'s case was so different from A.T.'s that it lacked sufficient probative value to be admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b673} Thompson argues the opposite. He contends that the evidence pertaining to M.F. \"precisely paralleled\" the allegations in A.T.'s case, so much so that it was \"highly suggestive of propensity and action in conformity\" making it \"so highly inflammatory and prejudicial\" not even a limiting instruction would have prevented the jury from drawing damaging inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   {\u00b674} Fannon and Thompson challenge different aspects of the trial court's balancing of the probative value with the danger of unfair prejudice - the third step in the three-part test for the admission of other acts evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Fannon and Thompson had acted in conformity with that prior conduct.\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This instruction lessened any prejudicial effect of the testimony concerning M.F.'s abuse. Considering the broad discretion given a trial court in evidentiary rulings coupled with the trial court's instruction to the jury as to the limited use of other acts testimony, we find nothing \"unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable\" about the trial court's decision to permit the other acts testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b677} Concerning the dissimilarities Fannon argues exist, \"any dissimilarities 'do not mandate exclusion of the other acts evidence' but instead 'go to the weight to be given the evidence by the jury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Blankenship I\n   </em>\n   at *2 quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Human Skeleton Diagrams\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b678} Thompson and Fannon also contend that the trial court erred in allowing the state to admit two human skeleton diagrams - Fannon argues the evidence \"had no probative value\" and Thompson argues the evidence \"held zero probative value and was inadmissible.\" Neither objected to it at trial and forfeited all but plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b679} The state introduced two human skeleton diagrams that Fannon used when she attended a local community college. The diagrams included the scientific names of the bones and Fannon testified that she used them to study for a quiz in a human anatomy class. The state used the diagrams in its closing argument to challenge Fannon's credibility by arguing that Fannon told Detective Deak that her understanding of A.T.'s injuries were too much\n   to remember, yet \"it was obvious from those diagrams at one point and time she had a working knowledge of human anatomy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b680} \"Relevant evidence\" means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The human skeleton diagrams were relevant to Fannon's credibility and were admissible. The trial court did not err in admitting them. Because the diagrams were relevant and admissible, Fannon and Thompson have failed to show plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   3. Photograph of A.T. Hospitalized\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b681} Fannon contends that the trial court committed plain error by admitting a photograph of A.T. while she was intubated, sedated and connected by wire to medical machinery because it was \"neither relevant nor probative to the State's theory of serious harm.\" She did not object at trial and again must show plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b682} The state admitted a series of photographs of A.T.'s injuries taken by Dr. Letson, the child abuse pediatrician at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Dr. Letson testified that the full body photograph of A.T. in the ICU showed her hooked up to an intubator tube for breathing and multiple IV lines in \"because she was very ill\" and suffered brain injuries. The state argues the photograph was relevant to show serious physical harm, an element of the state's case, and was not horrendous or used to inflame the passion of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b683} This photograph of A.T. is relevant evidence that shows A.T. suffered serious physical harm as a result of her injuries. Although it depicts a three-month old sleeping in a hospital crib, hooked up to a number of wires, the photograph is not so gruesome or horrendous that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its danger to inflame the passion of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 403(A) and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, the trial court committed no error, plain or otherwise in admitting the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   4. Fannon's Enjoyment of Work\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b684} We overruled Fannon's argument that the prosecution engaged in misconduct by putting her on trial for enjoying work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section B. 4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Now Fannon contends that the State \"trafficked in stereotypes about gender and motherhood throughout this trial\" and the trial court committed plain error by admitting evidence of her love of work. She argues that there is no reasonable inferential link that connects love of work with abuse of children. The state argues that the evidence shows that Fannon chose to work instead of taking A.T. to the doctor and to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b685} As we determined in reviewing Fannon's prosecutorial misconduct contention, a part of the state's case focused on the lack of medical care Fannon and Thompson sought for A.T., their lack of concern for A.T.'s injuries, their failure to take her to follow-up appointments, and their delay in seeking medical attention for her even though her injuries were severe, permanent, and life-threatening. This line of questioning served to highlight Fannon's lack of responsiveness to A.T.'s health and medical condition. As a result it was relevant under Evid.R. 401 and admissible under Evid.R. 402, 403(A). The trial\n   court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in admitting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   {\u00b686} We have addressed all four issues Fannon presented in her third assignment of error - other acts, skeleton diagrams, A.T.'s hospital photograph, and enjoyment of work evidence - and found them all meritless. The trial court did not commit an error, plain or otherwise, when it admitted this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   5. Text Messages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b687} Thompson has one remaining contention that the trial court erred in the admission of evidence. He contends as part of his cumulative error argument that the admission of both the text messages and the testimony interpreting them was improper under Evid.R. 602 because the witness lacked personal knowledge of the contents of the text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b688} Fannon and Thompson voluntarily turned over their cellular phones to the state. Investigator Molly Katusin testified that she retrieved text messages from one of the phones and identified the text messages on the state's exhibit as those that she obtained from that phone. The text messages were sent from \"Me\"; Katusin testified that she was able to determine who \"Me\" was. Thompson's attorney objected to the testimony on the ground that there was no foundation for its admission. The trial court sustained the objection. Then Katusin explained that she had reviewed a number of text messages from the phone and was able to determine from the context that \"Me\" was Fannon. Consequently, the trial court overruled the objection and stated that both the state and the defense could use cross-examination to explore Katusin's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b689} Katusin testified that the state's exhibit contained photographs of text messages she took from one of the phones Thompson and Fannon turned over to investigators. Thus, Katusin properly authenticated the text messages under Evid.R. 901(A) (\"The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\") and 901(B)(1) (evidence can be authenticated by testimony of a witness with knowledge who testifies that a matter is what it is claimed to be). Katusin had personal knowledge that the photographs of the text messages were from one of the defendants' phones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, even if Katusin lacked sufficient personal\n   knowledge to make her conclusions about the identities of the sender and receiver, the state subsequently established through Fannon's testimony that \"Me\" was Fannon and the messages were between her and Thompson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Fannon argues that because A.T.'s injuries were \"subtle\" and the state did not prove that Fannon saw the injuries occur, a rational trier of fact could not determine that Fannon violated a duty of care by failing to recognize the injuries or assess the extent of them. Her initial contention that injuries were \"subtle\" is incredulous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   {\u00b6102} The state contends that it proved Fannon violated a duty of care because Fannon (1) failed to take A.T. to the doctor after she was diagnosed with a failure to thrive; (2) knew that A.T. was so ill she was not breathing and failed to seek any kind of medical care; (3) knew that A.T.'s eyes crossed and waited until the following day to take her to the emergency room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6103} Fannon admitted that she had a duty to take A.T. to the doctor after the doctor diagnosed A.T. with a failure to thrive but failed to comply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Q.

In her testimony about the messages, Fannon testified that she texted Thompson to tell him A.T. needed to see a doctor because A.T. was not breathing. Fannon's texts to Thompson disclosed that Fannon was \"scared\" and that A.T.'s condition was \"worse than i thought.\" Fannon had to breathe in A.T.'s face three different times to get her to breathe. Although from these texts it appears Fannon was administering infant CPR to A.T., at trial Fannon testified that she was not doing a resuscitation, only \"a light blow.\" Fannon admitted she did not get medical attention for A.T. even though A.T. was struggling to breathe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   {\u00b6105} The state presented evidence that on Thursday, February 27, Fannon and Thompson had concerns because A.T.'s eyes were crossing or slanting downward, yet Fannon did not seek medical attention for A.T.. On Friday, February 28, Fannon noticed A.T.'s right leg was swollen and bruised at about 3:00 pm, but did not seek medical attention for A.T. until about 9:20 pm that evening. A co-worker testified that Fannon called her between 2:00 and 3:00 pm to ask her to work Fannon's shift so that Fannon could take A.T. to the hospital. During that seven-hour window, Fannon called off work, continued to observe A.T., and went to a fast-food restaurant. Fannon explained that she \"didn't think a few more minutes was going to hurt anything\" even though Fannon knew A.T.'s condition was serious, \"It was serious, I just knew it wasn't life threatening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   {\u00b6106} Fannon testified that when she finally did get medical care for A.T. at the local hospital, A.T. was immediately transported to Nationwide Children's Hospital\n   where physicians determined that A.T. had multiple broken bones, a complex skull fracture, and a life-threatening brain injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   {\u00b6107} Citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Miley\n   </em>\n   the state presented no evidence that the defendant observed any outward signs of abuse on the child.

Here the state presented evidence that A.T. suffered multiple abusive injuries over a period of time and that these injuries manifested outwardly in head and leg bruises, severe respiratory distress, and eye-crossing. The state presented evidence that Fannon observed these signs but acted recklessly when she did not seek immediate and appropriate medical care for A.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   {\u00b6108} After viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Fannon violated a duty of care under R.C. 2919.22(A) when she repeatedly failed to get A.T. appropriate and timely medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   2. Physical Abuse\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6109} Fannon contends that the state failed to prove that A.T.'s injuries were caused by abuse, which is an element of endangering children under R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and an element of permitting child abuse under R.C. 2903.15(A). In spite of the almost frivolous nature of this contention, we proceed.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18-25 above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   {\u00b6110} Fannon argues that the testimony of the treating physicians, Dr. Adler and Dr. Letson, who were also qualified to testify as expert witnesses in pediatric radiology and child abuse/pediatrics respectively, did not give their medical opinions \"in terms of possibility or probability\" and therefore their opinions were inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   {\u00b6111} Likewise, Thompson contends that the medical witnesses did not advance their opinions to the \"reasonable degree of medical certainty\" required by Evid.R. 702. He includes this as one of the errors that, while we may conclude is harmless, was cumulatively prejudicial. Thompson argues that the doctors' findings and interpretations \"were improper\" because the foundational requirements of Evid.R. 702(C) were not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   {\u00b6112} Contrary to Thompson's assertion, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thompson concedes that the jury instruction comes directly from the Ohio Jury Instructions but argues that although \"a panel of esteemed members of the bar may have drafted the standard 'reasonable doubt' OJI instruction many years ago, it may be time for the current committee members to revisit the wording.\" He hopes \"some intrepid trailblazer in the judiciary or legislature will see fit to tackle this issue * * *.\" He will have to wait for that visionary action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   {\u00b6124} Under the cumulative-error doctrine, \"a conviction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial even though each of numerous instances of trial court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state charged Thompson with:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   Count 1: R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) : No person shall do any of the following to a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age: (1) Abuse the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   Count 2: R.C. 2903.15(A) : No parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age shall cause serious physical harm to the child, or the death of the child, as a proximate result of permitting the child to be abused, to be tortured, to be administered corporal punishment or\n   other physical disciplinary measure, or to be physically restrained in a cruel manner or for a prolonged period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   Count 3: R.C. 2919.22 (A) : No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age or a mentally or physically handicapped child under twenty-one years of age, shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care, protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian, custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical or mental illness or defect of the child by spiritual means through prayer alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   {\u00b6134} Thompson contends he has problems applying the three-part\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   analysis. He cannot address whether the crimes are offenses of dissimilar import because of \"the broad, vague manner in which the prosecution presented and pursued the case.\" He cannot address whether they were committed separately because \"there is no way to figure this out due to the manner in which the state * * * presented the case against Thompson.\" He cannot address whether there was a separate animus for each offense because \"[a]gain, the vagueness in the record precludes this finding.\" In essence, Thompson argues that there is no way for him to show from the record whether the offenses should merge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   {\u00b6135} At this point it is crucial to point out we are not asked to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of guilt on the two convictions for child endangering or the sole count of permitting child abuse. This assignment of error does not contest the evidence to support who did what, when. It simply argues the state took a \"shotgun approach\" to support each of the three counts against Thompson.

Counts 1 and 3, child endangering under R.C. 2919.22(A) and R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) are not subject to merger because they are dissimilar in import - they involved separate protected societal interests and resulted in separate identifiable harm. The two statutes are designed to protect different societal interests. R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) protects a child from direct abuse by a parent. Subpart (A) enforces a parent's societal duty to provide care and protection for health issues, however they arise.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under Count 1, Endangering Children, R.C. 2919.22(B)(1), Thompson \"abused the child\" when he inflicted physical injuries to A.T. Under Count 3, Endangering Children, R.C. 2919.22(A) Thompson, as a parent, created a substantial risk of physical harm to A.T. and \"violated a duty of care\" when he\n   failed to seek medical care for A.T.'s injuries. And because the medical testimony established that there were multiple instances of abuse over a period of time, the record supports a finding of multiple counts of endangering children, which could fall under either of the two statutory provisions. Moreover, the two endangering children offenses resulted in different harm, i.e. the short term physical harm resulting from direct abuse, i.e. broken bones and tissue injuries, and the long term/permanent injury that resulted from the failure to seek prompt medical attention.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under Count 3, Endangering Children, R.C. 2919.22(A) Thompson violated a duty of care as a parent when he failed to seek timely and appropriate medical care for A.T., i.e. the criminal act under Count 3 was Thompson's failure to seek medical care for the infant's many injuries, which occurred over time. Under Count 2, R.C. 2903.15(A) Permitting Abuse, the jury convicted Thompson of allowing another person to abuse the infant. Because two separate acts of criminal conduct are involved here, Permitting Abuse under R.C. 2903.15(A) and Endangering under R.C. 2919.22(A) do not merge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   {\u00b6139} Likewise Count 1, Endangering Children by abuse, R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and Count 2, Permitting Abuse, R.C. 2903.15(A) should not merge because they also involve separate criminal acts. Under Count 1, Thompson abused the child when he inflicted physical injuries to A.T. and, under Count 2, the jury found that he permitted abuse when he allowed A.T. to be abused by another. Thus, the offenses did not arise from the same conduct. Moreover the different conduct resulted in different and separate physical harm, i.e. the medical experts testified that the multiple injuries A.T. suffered were caused by at least two separate traumatic episodes of abuse over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   {\u00b6140} The record does not support a finding that the crimes were subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25. We overrule Thompson's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   H. Extradition Costs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   {\u00b6141} Thompson contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it waived his court costs in the underlying child abuse case due to his indigent status but refused to waive the costs associated with \"extradition\" for failure to appear. Thompson argues that the trial court's partial denial of his motion to waive court costs \"suggests a punitive purpose or effect.\" However, Thompson cites nothing in the record that supports his hunch. Therefore he has failed to burden to affirmatively show error on the part of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   {\u00b6142} Fannon and Thompson have not established any prejudicial error by the trial court in convicting and sentencing them.

I write separately to\n   comment about what appears to be a disturbing trend of elaborately crafted opening statements that utilize power-point projections, photographs that the prosecution expects to be admitted into evidence and other visual aids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   {\u00b6144} Generally, the purpose of an opening statement is to provide the trier of fact a brief outline or preview of the evidence expected to be presented at trial. Comments about the scheduled witnesses, their expected testimony and the elements of the charged crimes are, of course, appropriate and provide the trier of fact with an important framework about the evidence that will be presented. In the case sub judice, however, during opening statement the prosecution projected the word \"GUILTY\" in large letters on a screen. Although I recognize that this tactic has been used in other courts, this strikes me as a not-so-subliminal message to each juror about their expected role in the proceeding. Also, the prosecution's opening statement included a hospital bed photograph that depicted the child victim's severe trauma. This photograph had not yet been, at this juncture, admitted into evidence. In my view, a party making an opening statement should not display objects that the party anticipates might be admitted into evidence, but has not yet been marked as an exhibit, identified by a witness with knowledge and properly admitted into evidence. Obviously, unforeseen events could arise that could result in the court rejecting a party's request to admit an exhibit into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   {\u00b6145} Finally, I presume that defendants must now be permitted to engage in some sort of pretrial discovery practice to determine the exact nature of the visual aids that the prosecution intends to use during opening statement. This will allow a defendant to prepare a competing number of visual aids to counterbalance the impression the prosecution will attempt to create with the jury. To me, however, this is a waste of time and judicial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   {\u00b6146} In the end, although I recognize these tactics may not always rise to the level of reversible error, I nevertheless believe that the best policy is for courts to exercise their discretion and limit these elaborate opening statement presentations. The ends of justice will be better served in this manner.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
