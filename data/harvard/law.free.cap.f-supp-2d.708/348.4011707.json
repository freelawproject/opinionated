Plaintiffs are eleven California municipalities (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) which bring substantially similar complaints (the \u201cCalifornia Complaints\u201d) alleging federal and state antitrust violations arising out of an alleged unlawful conspiracy on the part of more than forty corporate defendants (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) and others to illegally rig bids, fix prices and manipulate the market for investment instruments known as municipal derivatives. All Defendants except eight now jointly move to dismiss the California Complaints (\u201cJoint Motion\u201d) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (\u201cRule 12(b)(6)\u201d).

Defendants, Syncora, and Goldman Sachs filed memoranda of law in support of their respective motions. In addition, Natixis, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Rabobank, NatWest, PFM, Morgan Stanley, GE Trinity, AIG Financial, BLG, Assured, Dexia, Citibank, First Southwest, and Transamerica filed supplemental memoranda of law addressing the California Complaints\u2019s specific allegations against them. Plaintiffs filed memoranda of law in opposition to the Joint Motion, the Goldman Motion, and the Syncora Motion, as well as memoranda in opposition to the supplemental memoranda filed by individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">B. <em>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHV\">1. <em>Multidistrict Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">In January 2007, BoA entered into the antitrust corporate leniency program administered by the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (\u201cDOJ Antitrust\u201d) under the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004 (\u201cACP-ERA\u201d). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 108-237, tit. II, \u00a7\u00a7 201-221, 118 Stat. 661, 665-669. BoA\u2019s action was prompted by DOJ Antitrust\u2019s investigation into transactions of certain financial institutions involved in the municipal derivatives market. Multiple civil antitrust actions against various defendants were subsequently filed by various municipalities and other entities across the country alleging violations of \u00a7 1 arising from bidding on municipal derivatives offerings. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, the Judicial Panel on MDL transferred all pending and subsequent related actions to this District on June 16, 2008, 560 F.Supp.2d 1386 (Jud. Pan.Mult.Lit.2008), and ordered that they be assigned to this Court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings (the \u201cMDL Order\u201d). In accordance with the MDL Order, fifteen cases were ultimately transferred and consolidated with the designated lead case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">2. <em>Class Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Interim lead class counsel (\u201cClass Counsel\u201d) filed the original consolidated class action complaint (\u201cCAC\u201d) in this action on August 22, 2008 against more than forty corporate defendants (collectively, \u201cCAC Defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The CAC alleged that CAC Defendants conspired to fix, maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>or stabilize the price of, and to rig bids and allocate customers and markets for, municipal derivatives in violation of \u00a7 1. All CAC Defendants except for BoA, Feld Winters and MGIC filed a joint motion to dismiss the CAC. By Decision and Order dated April 29, 2009 (the \u201cApril 2009 Decision\u201d), the Court granted CAC Defendants\u2019 joint motion with leave to replead.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Class Counsel filed a second consolidated amended complaint (\u201cSCAC\u201d) on June 18, 2009, again alleging a \u00a7 1 claim against sixteen corporate defendants. The SCAC plaintiffs (\u201cSCAC Plaintiffs\u201d) purport to represent a class (the \u201cSCAC Class\u201d) consisting of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">All state, local and municipal government entities, independent government agencies and private entities that purchased by competitive bidding or auction [m]unicipal [derivatives directly from a[p]rovider [defendant, at any time from January 1, 1992 through the present in the United States and its territories or for delivery in the United States and its territories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">(SCAC \u00b6 183.) Defendants as named in the SCAC are: BoA; Bear Stearns; JP Morgan; Morgan Stanley; NatWest; Piper Jaffray; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale; UBS; Wachovia; Wells Fargo; Natixis Funding; Investment Management Advisory; CDR; Winters &amp; Co.; Baum; and Sound Capital (collectively, \u201cSCAC Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">All SCAC Defendants except BoA filed a joint motion to dismiss the SCAC, dated September 18, 2009. By Decision and Order dated March 25, 2010 (the \u201cMarch 2010 Decision\u201d), the Court denied SCAC Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss and found that SCAC Plaintiffs had alleged plausible \u00a7 1 claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">In addition, four California municipalities brought a separate class action complaint on December 15, 2009 (the \u201cJSAC\u201d), alleging Cartwright Act claims on behalf of themselves and a class of municipalities against SCAC Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">C. <em>FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">The facts of this case are set forth in the April 2009 and March 2010 Decisions, familiarity with which is assumed. Here, the Court will briefly review the facts relevant to this motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">In a series of complaints brought between September and December 2009, Plaintiffs assert \u00a7 1 claims similar to those alleged in the SCAC and JSAC, as well as Cartwright Act claims similar to those alleged in the JSAC. Plaintiffs bring their \u00a7 1 and Cartwright Act claims against SCAC Defendants and thirty-one defendants not named in the SCAC or JSAC. Defendants not named in the SCAC or JSAC, but which are named in the California Complaints are: AIG Financial Products; Assured; BLG; Citibank; Dexia; FSAI; First Southwest; GE Trinity; Goldman Sachs; Natixis; MBIA; Merrill Lynch; Natixis; PFM; Rabobank; Syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cora; Transamerica; UBS Financial<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; UBS Securities; and XL (collectively, \u201cNon-Class Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Plaintiffs allege that \u201cDefendants\u2019 conspiracy involved, but was not limited to, allocating the market for [m]unicipal [derivatives amongst themselves, rigging the process by which the U.S. public and nonprofit entities acquire [municipal [derivatives, sharing their illegal gains through kickbacks to one another, and making other secret, undisclosed arrangements.\u201d <em>(E.g., </em>Complaint, <em>County of Tulare v. Bank of America, N.A., et al., </em>10 Civ. 628 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 2009) (\u201cTulare Complaint\u201d) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>.). The California Complaints rely on factual allegations similar to those asserted in the SCAC and JSAC. Like the SCAC and the JSAC, Plaintiffs allege that individuals employed by Defendants acted as conduits for communication of pricing and bidding information among Defendants; that Defendants falsely certified that bidding was competitive and in compliance with Treasury Department regulations; that Defendants submitted intentionally losing courtesy bids to assist other co-conspirators to win particular municipal derivative transactions; and that Defendants paid kickbacks to manipulate the market for municipal derivatives. Plaintiffs rely largely on the same sources of information relied upon in the SCAC and JSAC, including the same BoA confidential witness, as well as the antitrust investigations undertaken by DOJ Antitrust, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), and state attorneys general. Plaintiffs also rely on the indictment filed by DOJ Antitrust against CDR on October 16, 2009. <em>See </em>Indictment, <em>United States v. Rubin/Chambers, Dunhill Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>09 Cr. 1058, 2009 WL 3871321 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2009) (\u201cOctober 2009 CDR Indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Plaintiffs supplement the allegations shared with the SCAC and JSAC with averments specific to California municipalities. For example, Plaintiffs assert that several Defendants colluded to fix the pricing for Plaintiff San Mateo\u2019s November 14, 2003 swap transaction (\u201c2003 San Mateo Swap\u201d). Further, Plaintiffs allege that their statistical analysis of bidding patterns in eighty-nine municipal derivatives auctions (the \u201cStatistical Analysis\u201d) \u201creveal[s] probative evidence\u201d that numerous Defendants \u201ctook actions to assist another [Defendant] win a particular auction and/or were pre-selected as winners of particular [municipal [derivative auctions.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 164.) Plaintiffs assert that, in 2005, Mark Scott, the Director of the IRS\u2019s Tax-Exempt Bond Office, articulated a \u201crough guideline for determining when a bid submitted was likely a courtesy bid: \u2018When a bid is 100 to 150 basis points below the market and there is no justification for that being so low, one of the assumptions you can draw is that there are courtesy bids being provided.\u2019 \u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 382 <em>(quoting </em>Mark Scott).) Based on the IRS\u2019s alleged \u201crough guideline,\u201d as well as other facts purportedly gleaned from the Statistical Analysis, Plaintiffs assert that the lowest bids in ten California municipal derivative auctions, occurring between March 1998 and May 2008, were not submitted to compete for the contract on auction, but rather as sham, courtesy bids in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">A. <em>LEGAL STANDARD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), dismissal of a complaint is appropriate if the plaintiff has failed to offer sufficient factual allegations making the asserted claim plausible on its face. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim if the factual allegations sufficiently \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The task of the Court in ruling on a motion to dismiss is to \u201cassess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\u201d <em>In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., </em>383 F.Supp.2d 566, 574 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (quotation marks omitted). The Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">B. <em>PLAUSIBILITY ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Defendants move to dismiss the California Complaints for substantially the same reasons asserted by SCAC Defendants, arguing that (1) Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting an industry-wide conspiracy; (2) Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts connecting each Defendant to the alleged conspiracy; (3) Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to establish standing; (4) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations; and (5) the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations preclude Plaintiffs\u2019 private antitrust claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">As to Defendants\u2019 first, third, fourth, and fifth arguments, the Court incorporates by reference the legal analysis, reasoning, and conclusions of its March 2010 Decision, and finds all four arguments equally unavailing for the purposes of this motion to dismiss. Given the similarity between the California Complaints\u2019 and the SCAC\u2019s allegations against SCAC Defendants, the Court denies the Joint Motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1 claims against SCAC Defendants for substantially the same reasons articulated in the March 2010 Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have stated a plausible Cartwright Act claim against each SCAC Defendant for the purposes of this motion to dismiss. Defendants concede that the Cartwright Act proscribes the same conduct as \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>(See </em>Defendants\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Dismiss the Cotchett Complaints, dated February 9, 2010, at 46.) As a result, the Court denies SCAC Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">Here, the Court will limit its analysis to whether Plaintiffs have satisfied their pleading burden as to Non-Class Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">1. <em>Allegations Arising out of 2003 San Mateo Swap</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Citibank, AIG Financial, UBS, and Piper Jaffray colluded to \u201cartificially depress the terms of the\u201d 2003 San Mateo Swap. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 455.) As the underwriters of the underlying bonds, Citibank and co-conspirator Lehman Brothers (\u201cLehman\u201d) offered to also act as providers for the swap transaction. In this role. Citibank and Lehman proposed a pricing methodology to be used to determine the terms of the swap. Finding the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>terms difficult to verify, San Mateo allegedly sought pricing quotations from UBS and Piper Jaffray, but offered Citibank and Lehman a right of first refusal whereby they would be given the opportunity to match or beat any offer by UBS or Piper Jaffray. Plaintiffs allege that the terms subsequently offered by both UBS and Piper Jaffray were within a few basis points of the pricing terms offered by Citibank and Lehman. Ultimately, on the \u201cPrice Date,\u201d San Mateo agreed to conduct the transaction on the terms offered by Citibank and Lehman. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 451-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In advance of the agreement on the swap\u2019s pricing terms, Plaintiffs allege that San Mateo determined that Lehman\u2019s credit-rating was too low for it to serve as a counter-party to the swap transaction. As a result, Lehman purportedly entered into an arrangement with AIG Financial whereby AIG Financial would replace Lehman as counter-party to the swap.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Plaintiffs allege that such swap transactions are premised on the idea that when parties to swaps exchange cash flows, \u201cthe present values of the exchanged future cash flows should be equal or \u2018netted off against one another.... In other words ... the exchange should be a wash, with the issuer and provider exchanging future cash flows of the same [present] value.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 133.) \u201cNeither party\u2019s motivation for entering the swap should be based on any belief that they have received a more valuable future cash flow in exchange for a less valuable future cash flow.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants colluded to fix the pricing terms offered to San Mateo, which resulted in a spread of \u201capproximately $3.3 million of 245 base points\u201d between the swap terms offered by Lehman and Citibank and the alleged fair market price of such a swap transaction. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 458.) In other words, Plaintiffs allege that the resulting \u201cvalue of [the] cash flows to be paid by San Mateo to Citibank was $2,296,859 more than the value of cash flows that Citibank was obligated to pay San Mateo ... [and] the value of cash flows to be paid by San Mateo to AIG Financial was worth $982,379 less than the cash flows to be paid by AIG Financial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 457-58.) Plaintiffs assert that the resulting spread, viewed in light of the alleged premise of such swap transactions as described above, is highly suggestive of collusion among Defendants. Plaintiffs assert that the most plausible explanation for the similar, supra-competitive offers of Citibank, Lehman, UBS, and Piper Jaffray is pricing collusion. \u201cIndeed, the economically rational thing for UBS and Piper Jaffrey [sic] to do would have been to offer San Mateo terms that would have yielded them a lower but still substantial spread.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> The Court is persuaded that, taken as true, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations plausibly suggest that Citibank, UBS, and Piper Jaffray colluded to manipulate the market for the 2003 San Mateo Swap. The crucial question in a \u00a7 1 case is \u201cwhether the challenged conduct \u2018stems from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.\u2019 \u201d <em>Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm\u2019t, </em>592 F.3d 314, 321 (2d Cir.2010) <em>(quoting Theatre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., </em>346 U.S. 537, 540, 74 S.Ct. 257, 98 L.Ed. 273 (1954)). Allegations that a defendant acted contrary to its economic interest can be suggestive of conspiratorial agreement as opposed to mere parallel pricing. <em>See id. </em>at 324 <em>(quoting In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., </em>385 F.3d 350, 360-61 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cEvidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests means evidence of conduct that would be irrational assuming that the defendant operated in a compet\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tive market.\u201d)) Here, Plaintiffs allege that UBS and Piper Jaffray acted against their economic interests by offering similar pricing terms to those offered by Citibank and Lehman. Although the Supreme Court has cautioned that parallel behavior may be a \u201crational and competitive business strategy,\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955, and the Second Circuit has similarly found that \u201c[s]imilar pricing can suggest competition at least as plausibly as it can suggest anticompetitive conspiracy,\u201d <em>In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., </em>502 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir.2007), the Court views the allegations against Citibank in light of the California Complaints as a whole, as well as the Court\u2019s prior findings in this MDL. The California Complaints, the SCAC, and the JSAC all contain detailed allegations of collusive communications by UBS and Piper Jaffray, which, as discussed at length in the April 2009 and March 2010 Decisions, the Court has found to plausibly implicate both UBS and Piper Jaffray. Accordingly, the Court, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving doubts in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, finds that the similar pricing offers for the 2003 San Mateo Swap render Citibank\u2019s involvement in the alleged conspiracy plausible for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">However, while Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations plausibly suggest that Citibank, UBS, and Piper Jaffray colluded to manipulate the pricing of the 2003 San Mateo Swap, Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts connecting AIG Financial to the allegedly collusive conduct. The California Complaints assert merely that AIG Financial was substituted for Lehman as a counter-party following the agreement on pricing terms. As alleged, it was Citibank and Lehman that proposed the original pricing terms similar to those offered by UBS and Piper Jaffray, and that also ultimately offered the final pricing terms agreed to by San Mateo at the Price Date. Although Plaintiffs allege that San Mateo\u2019s concern regarding Lehman\u2019s credit-rating arose before the Price Date, and it is thus conceivable that Lehman and AIG Financial\u2019s negotiations began before the Price Date, the facts as alleged do not plausibly suggest that AIG Financial was involved in any collusive conduct leading up to the similar pricing offers, or the ultimate agreement on pricing terms on the Price Date. Notably, Plaintiffs do not allege that any negotiations between AIG Financial and Lehman prior to the Price Date implicate AIG Financial in the alleged conspiracy. Instead, Plaintiffs merely allege that \u201cSan Mateo was not made privy\u201d to such negotiations. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 453.) Although such negotiations may have afforded AIG Financial the opportunity to conspire, such an opportunity does not by itself plausibly support an inference of AIG Financial\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy. <em>See Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk Valley Med. Assocs., Inc., </em>996 F.2d 537, 545 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201c[M]ere opportunity to conspire does not by itself support the inference that such an illegal combination actually occurred.\u201d). As a result, the Court is not persuaded that AIG Financial\u2019s agreement to replace Lehman as a counter-party to the swap after the Price Date is suggestive of AIG Financial\u2019s involvement in any agreement to manipulate the pricing terms offered to San Mateo.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Court notes that Plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations against AIG Financial are also insufficient to state a \u00a7 1 claim. The Court previously rejected SCAC Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on a 1989 Oklahoma Turnpike Authority guaranteed investment contract (\u201cGIC\u201d), upon which Plaintiffs also rely here to allege AIG Financial\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy. <em>See Hinds, </em>620 F.Supp.2d at 515. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In addition, the California Complaints allege that AIG Financial participated in numerous municipal derivatives transactions, but fail to allege any associated facts plausibly connecting AIG Financial to the alleged conspiracy. As discussed in the April 2009 Decision, an allegation of mere participation in the municipal derivatives market is insufficient to assert an actionable \u00a7 1 claim. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion as to AIG Financial without prejudice, subject to reinstatement of the claim upon a sufficient showing by Plaintiffs during the course of discovery of facts supporting a plausible inference that AIG Financial participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">2. <em>Allegations Arising Out of the Statistical Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Plaintiffs rely on the Statistical Analysis to allege sham bidding and other collusive practices in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy by several Defendants. As described above. Plaintiffs assert that the IRS assumes that a 100 to 150 basis point spread between low and high bids on a municipal derivatives transaction is indicative of sham, courtesy bidding. Plaintiffs employ this rough guideline and the Statistical Analysis to allege participation in the alleged conspiracy by BLG, MBIA, Rabobank, GE Trinity, Transamerica and XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">a. <em>BLG, MBIA and Rabobank Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Plaintiffs allege that BLG and MBIA participated in the alleged conspiracy based on their respective low and high bids on a May 28, 2004 Riverside GIC (\u201cMay 2004 Riverside GIC\u201d). BLG entered a bid 145 basis points lower than MBIA\u2019s winning bid. Plaintiffs similarly allege participation by Rabobank based on its low bid in an August 1, 2003 Riverside GIC transaction (\u201cAugust 2003 Riverside GIC\u201d). Rabobank\u2019s bid was allegedly 136 basis points lower than the winning bid by Natixis Funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The Court is persuaded that municipal derivatives transactions for which the bidding spread is more than 100 basis points raise a plausible inference that the low and high bidders participated in the alleged conspiracy. Taken as true, the IRS guideline provides a useful metric for evaluating the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations based solely on bidding spreads. The Court thus finds that BLG, MBIA, and Rabobank\u2019s participation to be above the speculative level and plausible for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">b. <em>Transamerica and GE Trinity Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Plaintiffs also rely on the Statistical Analysis to allege that Transamerica and GE Trinity participated in the alleged conspiracy. However, unlike the allegations against BLG, MBIA and Rabobank, Plaintiffs point to bidding spreads of less than 100 basis points to support their \u00a7 1 allegations against Transamerica and GE Trinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Plaintiffs allege that Transamerica submitted a sham, courtesy bid in a March 2002 Los Angeles GIC auction (\u201cMarch 2002 Los Angeles Transaction\u201d) for the benefit of MBIA. Although Transamerica\u2019s bid was 51 basis points below MBIA\u2019s winning bid, Plaintiffs nonetheless argue that their analysis reveals Transamerica\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy. Plaintiffs contend that all of the remaining bids for the March 2002 Los Angeles Transaction were \u201cconcentrated in a tight cluster\u201d at the top, within 1 to 14 basis points of one another. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 443.) Plaintiffs further allege that such a spread is indicative of conspiratorial activity, despite not falling within the IRS\u2019s guideline range, because the median bid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ding spread in the Statistical Analysis was found to be 25 basis points.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Court is not persuaded that a presumption of courtesy bidding or collusive activity should be accorded to a bidding spread that falls below the 100 to 150 basis point IRS guideline range. In alleging conspiratorial conduct against Transamerica, Plaintiffs simply cite the 25 basis point median spread, gleaned from a set of municipal derivative transactions they themselves selected, and ask the Court to find a factual connection between Defendants and the alleged conspiracy based on a comparison between the 25 basis point median spread and the 51 basis point spread in the March 2002 Los Angeles Transaction. Plaintiffs point to no authority supporting the proposition that the median bidding spread is an appropriate metric for evaluating bidding behavior or collusive activity in municipal derivatives auctions. Nor do they allege the statistical significance of the set of municipal derivatives transactions they selected to conduct the Statistical Analysis. As a result, the Court finds Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against Transamerica to be conclusory and insufficient to state a plausible \u00a7 1 claim. The Court dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Transamerica without prejudice, subject to reinstatement of the claim upon a sufficient showing by Plaintiffs during the course of discovery of facts supporting a plausible inference that Transamerica participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Court similarly finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \u00a7 1 claim against GE Trinity. Plaintiffs allege that XL submitted a bid that was 73 points lower than GE Trinity\u2019s winning bid on a July 16, 2003 Riverside municipal derivatives transaction (\u201cJuly 2003 Riverside GIC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Plaintiffs argue that GE Trinity\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy is bolstered by federal investigations into GE Trinity\u2019s conduct in the municipal derivatives market. Plaintiffs allege that GE Trinity has received a Wells notice from the SEC relating to its conduct in the municipal derivatives market, that GE Trinity has been subpoenaed by DOJ Antitrust, and that a June 10, 2004 municipal derivatives transaction between GE Trinity and Riverside is under investigation by DOJ Antitrust. Nonetheless, the Court is not persuaded that these allegations cure Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading deficiencies. Although government investigations may bolster \u00a7 1 allegations, they may not constitute the entirety of nonconclusory allegations against \u00a7 1 defendants. <em>See Hinds, </em>700 F.Supp.2d at 394-95, 2010 WL 1244765, at *10 <em>(quoting In re Tableware Antitrust Litig., </em>363 F.Supp.2d 1203, 1205 (N.D.Cal.2005) (\u201cA plaintiff may surely rely on governmental investigations, but must also ... undertake his own reasonable inquiry and frame his complaint with allegations of his own design.\u201d)) Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs claims against GE Trinity without prejudice, subject to reinstatement of the claim upon a sufficient showing by Plaintiffs during the course of discovery of facts supporting a plausible inference that GE Trinity participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">c. <em>XL and Syncora Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Plaintiffs argue that XL\u2019s low bid for the July 2003 Riverside GIC renders its participation in the alleged conspiracy plausible. XL\u2019s bid was 73 points lower than GE Trinity\u2019s winning bid. For the same reasons discussed above, the Court finds that allegations of a 73 basis point spread are insufficient to state a \u00a7 1 claim. Plaintiffs again attempt to bolster their allegations by alleging that XL received a subpoena from DOJ Antitrust in 2006, and that XL had the opportunity to conspire with other Defendants at industry meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ings. In addition, Plaintiffs allege that XL fits the definition of a \u201cfinancial institution that was a branch or agency of a foreign bank within the meaning of Title 18, United States Code, Section 20,\u201d as defined in the October 2009 CDR Indictment, and is thus implicated in the alleged conspiracy. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 553-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Court is not persuaded and finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegations do not plausibly suggest that XL participated in the alleged conspiracy. As described above, to state a viable \u00a7 1 claim, Plaintiffs must allege a factual connection between each Defendant and the alleged conspiracy, and may not rely solely on government investigations and conclusory allegations based on mere participation in the municipal derivatives market. In addition, the Court has previously rejected SCAC Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Defendants\u2019 mere presence at industry associations and meetings to state a \u00a7 1 claim. <em>See Hinds, </em>620 F.Supp.2d at 513. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against XL without prejudice, subject to reinstatement of the claim upon a sufficient showing by Plaintiffs during the course of discovery of facts supporting a plausible inference that XL participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \u00a7 1 claim against Syncora. Plaintiffs allegations against Syncora are premised entirely on Syncora having provided the financial guarantees for the municipal derivative transactions entered into by XL, and having succeeded to the liabilities of XL. Since the Court has found the allegations against XL to be insufficient, the Court also finds them insufficient as to Syncora.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">3. <em>Assured, FSAI and Dexia Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The California Complaints allege that Assurance is liable as the successor-in-liability to FSAI as a result of Assurance\u2019s acquisition of FSA Holdings. FSAI is allegedly liable in the first instance because of the actions in furtherance of the conspiracy undertaken by three wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cFSA GIC Subsidiaries\u201d). The California Complaints allege that FSAI, during the time period relevant to their allegations, \u201cwas a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSA Holdings, which issued GICs and other reinvestment derivatives through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the FSA GIC Subsidiaries.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 58.) Plaintiffs further allege that all municipal derivative transactions entered into by FSA Holdings were subject to approval by FSAI.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Plaintiffs assert that the Statistical Analysis suggests that FSAI acted in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. FSAI allegedly bid on both the May 2004 and August 2003 Riverside GICs described above for which the bidding spread was well over the 100 basis point threshold. Although FSAI was not the low or high bidder, the California Complaints allege that the IRS views a bidding spread of more than 100 basis points to be suggestive of multiple courtesy bids, not just one low courtesy bid. In other words, it is plausible to infer, on the basis of the IRS guidelines, that a bidding spread above 100 basis points indicates that the entire bidding process for a particular transaction was infected with conspiratorial conduct. While FSAI\u2019s mere participation in such infected transactions may not on its own suffice to render FSAI\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy plausible, Plaintiffs bolster their allegations with averments regarding government investigations of FSAI and their municipal derivatives transactions. Plaintiffs assert that on July 2, 2009 Riverside received a subpoena from DOJ Antitrust seeking documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>concerning various transactions associated with a 2004 bond issuance. Plaintiffs allege that FSAI bid on three of the implicated transactions, and won a May 14, 2008 GIC for which BoA, JP Morgan, Wachovia, and Wells Fargo \u2014 all SCAC Defendants against which this Court previously found \u00a7 1 claims plausible \u2014 were the other bidders. Finally, the California Complaints allege that the Connecticut Attorney General has sought \u201cto compel FSA to turn over 600 hours of audio recordings already released to the SEC and DOJ in connection with their investigation of the municipal derivatives industry,\u201d believing that the tapes are \u201ca rich source of evidence of potential violations of state antitrust laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On the basis of FSAI\u2019s participation in the allegedly infected transactions described above, along with the extensive allegations of federal and state investigations, the Court finds that FSAI\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy to be \u201cabove the speculative level\u201d and that there exists \u201creasonably founded hope that the [discovery] process will reveal relevant evidence to support a \u00a7 1 claim.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 559, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quotation omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Plaintiffs also assert antitrust claims against Assured as the successor-in-liability to FSAI because Assured \u201cis a mere continuation of FSA Holdings and/or the July 1, 2009 transaction was a <em>de facto </em>merger of FSA Holdings with Assured.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 59.) Under New York law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">[t]o determine whether such a de facto merger or mere continuation of the predecessor\u2019s business has occurred, courts consider: (1) continuity of ownership; (2) cessation of ordinary business by the predecessor; (3) assumption by the successor of liabilities ordinarily necessary for continuation of the predecessor\u2019s business; and (4) continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\"><em>Nettis v. Levitt, </em>241 F.3d 186, 193-94 (2d Cir.2001) (applying New York law), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Slayton v. American Express Co., </em>460 F.3d 215 (2d Cir.2006). But \u201c[n]ot all of these elements are necessary to find a de facto merger.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Fahnestock &amp; Co., </em>286 A.D.2d 573, 730 N.Y.S.2d 70, 71 (1st Dep\u2019t 2001). Because Plaintiffs allege that FSA Holdings ceased to exist as a result of the sale of FSA Holdings to Assured, and that Assured continued the business of FSA Holdings and assumed its liabilities, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden as to Assured for the purposes of pleading successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The Court similarly finds that Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim against Dexia as a successor to the FSA GIC Subsidiaries. The California Cona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>plaints allege that, \u201c[a]s part of the transaction by which [Assured] acquired FSA Holdings, ownership of FSA Holdings\u2019 financial products group, including the [FSA GIC Subsidiaries] ... was transferred to Dexia.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 60.) Plaintiffs further allege that, as part of Dexia and Assured\u2019s acquisition of FSA Holdings and FSAI, Dexia \u201cexpressly agreed to assume the liabilities arising from FSA Holdings\u2019 financial products group\u2019s business, including GICs and other reinvestment derivatives.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The Court is persuaded that the California Complaints\u2019 successor liability allegations, taken as true, raise Plaintiffs\u2019 right to relief from Dexia above a speculative level for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">4. <em>First Southwest Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Plaintiffs assert that First Southwest, BoA, JP Morgan, Wachovia, Morgan Stanley \u201ccolluded to manipulate\u201d two Rhode Island municipal derivatives transactions in June 2002 (\u201cRhode Island Transactions\u201d). Plaintiffs allege that \u201c[d]uring the bidding process\u201d for one of the Rhode Island Transactions, First Southwest sent \u201crevised bid information to various [providers including Hertz and MacFaddin of JP Morgan as well as Wachovia and Morgan Stanley.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Defendants argue that there is no indication that First Southwest\u2019s provision of \u201crevised bid information\u201d was in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against First Southwest are conclusory and insufficient to \u201cnudge [ ] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 547, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The Court disagrees. For the reasons discussed in the March 2010 Decision, the Court declines to view First Southwest\u2019s alleged conduct in isolation. Instead, the Court considers the voluminous allegations of bid-rigging in the California Complaints, the SCAC, and the JSAC in finding that First Southwest\u2019s conduct here was plausibly in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. Sharing of bid information during the bidding process is asserted by Plaintiffs and SCAC Plaintiffs to have been an integral part of the collusive scheme at issue. The Court also considers that it has previously found that BoA, JP Morgan, Wachovia and Morgan Stanley \u2014 the providers to which First Southwest allegedly disclosed the revised bid information \u2014 plausibly participated in the alleged conspiracy. As a result, the Court finds the \u00a7 1 allegations against First Southwest plausible for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">5. <em>PFM Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Plaintiffs allege that PFM participated in the alleged conspiracy based on a conversation recorded in July 20, 2004 in which Mike Harris (\u201cHarris\u201d) of PFM requested that BoA \u201cput in a bid on [a municipal derivatives transaction] because a third bid was needed to meet the IRS\u2019s safe harbor conditions.\u201d (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 213.) Defendants argue that Harris\u2019s request is \u201cconsistent only with his doing his job for the benefit of his client\u2014 to get as broad a market as possible and meet the requirements for employing the most efficient demonstration of the fairness of the transaction price.\u201d (PFM\u2019s Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of the Joint Motion, dated February 9, 2010, at 3.) The Court, however, declines to draw such inferences in PFM\u2019s favor. Instead, when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, and resolving doubts in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, it is significant that the allegation against PFM involves collusive communication with BoA. Given the sum of allegations against BoA in this MDL, as well as BoA\u2019s participation in the DOJ Antitrust corporate leniency program, the Court, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>drawing reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, finds that PFM plausibly participated in the alleged conspiracy. The IRS\u2019s safe harbor conditions are designed, in part, to ensure the competitive bidding process for municipal derivative investments, which Plaintiffs allege Defendants conspired to manipulate. Plaintiffs and SCAC Plaintiffs assert that soliciting courtesy bids to satisfy IRS regulations was a consistent tactic employed by Defendants to conceal their bid-rigging and to further the conspiracy. That PFM allegedly asked BoA to enter such a bid renders Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1 claim against PFM plausible for the purposes of a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">6. <em>Goldman Sachs Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Goldman Sachs\u2019s conduct arising out of a 2003 Jefferson County, Alabama swap agreement (\u201c2003 Jefferson Swap\u201d) makes Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of its participation in the alleged conspiracy plausible. The California Complaints rely on filings by the SEC made in connection with its November 4, 2009 settlement with JP Morgan, and a separate civil complaint filed by the SEC against two former JP Morgan managing directors (collectively, the \u201cSEC Filings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">According to the SEC Filings, JP Morgan agreed to make a $3 million payment to Goldman Sachs, at the request of the president of the Jefferson County Commission (the \u201cCounty Commission President\u201d), to ensure that Jefferson County selected JP Morgan and not Goldman Sachs as the provider for the 2003 Jefferson Swap. Goldman Sachs accepted the payment, and paid $300,000 to Blount Parrish &amp; Co. (\u201cBlount\u201d), a Montgomery, Alabama broker-dealer which had solicited the County Commission President to select Goldman Sachs because Blount could not serve as a swap provider under Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Plaintiffs allege that the SEC. Filings reveal that JP Morgan paid $3 million to Goldman Sachs \u201cin exchange for Goldman\u2019s ... agreement not to compete with JP Morgan for a $1.1 billion swap deal associated with the county\u2019s 2003-B sewer bonds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 485.) Goldman Sachs contests this characterization, arguing that the SEC allegations do not reveal a conspiratorial agreement between Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, but rather merely reflect an agreement between the County Commission President and JP Morgan to prevent Goldman Sachs from getting business. <em>(See </em>Reply Memorandum of Law of Defendants Goldman Sachs in Further Support of the Joint Motion, dated April 16, 2010, at 4.) In essence, Goldman Sachs urges this Court to infer that it was merely the recipient of a kickback in a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scheme, not a co conspirator acting in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy in the municipal derivatives market. Plaintiffs, by contrast, argue that Goldman Sachs was complicit in the conspiratorial activity perpetrated by JP Morgan\u2019s Douglas MacFaddin, whom Plaintiffs allege is the target of criminal prosecution by DOJ Antitrust for his conduct in the municipal derivatives industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">While Plaintiffs and Defendants contest Goldman Sachs\u2019s motives, the Court again notes that the inquiry at this stage is not whether Goldman Sachs in fact participated in the alleged antitrust conspiracy, nor is it whether the 2003 Jefferson Swap was an isolated incident of political corruption or part of a larger conspiracy as alleged by Plaintiffs. The parties have posited two factually conflicting theories regarding Goldman Sachs\u2019s conduct. Goldman Sachs in effect urges the Court not only to decide this disputed issue at this point of the litigation, but to resolve any doubt and draw inferences in Goldman Sachs\u2019s favor. Such a ruling would run counter to govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ing standards. Instead, the Court now considers only whether Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts, accepted as true, rendering it plausible that Goldman Sachs participated in the alleged conspiracy to rig bids, fix prices or otherwise manipulate the municipal derivatives market.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Having reviewed Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, as well as the SEC Filings, and drawing reasonable inferences and resolving doubts in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to plausibly connect Goldman Sachs to the alleged conspiracy. Goldman Sachs allegedly received and paid kickbacks in connection with the 2003 Jefferson Swap, conduct which plausibly connects it to the manipulation of a municipal derivatives transaction and the collusive scheme alleged by Plaintiffs. That there was also a corrupted political official involved in the manipulation of the 2003 Jefferson Swap does not preclude the plausible connection between Goldman Sachs\u2019s role in this instance of manipulation and the industry-wide scheme alleged by Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">7. <em>Natixis Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In its March 2010 Decision, the Court found SCAC Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1 claim against Natixis Funding plausible for the purposes of a motion to dismiss. Here, Plaintiffs assert that Natixis, Natixis Funding\u2019s parent corporation, should also be held liable on theories of agency or alter ego liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Plaintiffs assert that Natixis guaranteed all investment contracts issued by Natixis Funding and that these guarantees were a \u201cnecessary pre-condition\u201d of Natixis Funding\u2019s ability to serve as a counter-party to its municipal derivatives transactions. (Tulare Complaint \u00b6 70.) Plaintiffs further assert that Natixis \u201cwholly owns\u201d Natixis Funding, that Natixis \u201cfully consolidates operations\u201d of Natixis Funding into Natixis\u2019s financials, and that Natixis\u2019s registration documents indicate that it \u201conly fully consolidates those subsidiaries that Natixis controls.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Finally, Plaintiffs assert that the two entities \u201cshare [ ] certain executives\u201d including a current Natixis director who was previously president of Natixis Funding. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Under California law, to demonstrate that a parent and its subsidiary are alter egos, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case that the two companies (1) share such unity of interest and ownership that the companies\u2019 separateness no longer exists and that (2) the failure to disregard the separate corporate identities would result in fraud or injustice. <em>See Mesler v. Bragg Mgmt. Co., </em>39 Cal.3d 290, 216 Cal.Rptr. 443, 702 P.2d 601, 606 (1985);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Las Palmas </em>Assocs. <em>v. Las Palmas Ctr.

Unocal Corp., </em>248 F.3d 915, 926 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Natixis argues that no alter ego relationship exists between corporate entities merely because a company guarantees the financial obligations of a subsidiary or shares officers or directors. Indeed, a parent corporation may be involved directly in certain aspects of its wholly-owned subsidiary\u2019s affairs without subjecting itself to alter ego status. For example, as long as it maintains corporate formalities, a parent may provide financing to its subsidiary or approve expenditures or sales by the subsidiary. <em>See Unocal, </em>248 F.3d at 926; <em>Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., </em>68 F.3d 1451, 1461 (2d Cir.1995) (finding no alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ego liability where parent controlled subsidiary\u2019s major expenditures and parent had substantial presence on subsidiary\u2019s board of directors). In support of its motion to dismiss, Natixis points to cases in which courts have found no alter ego status where parent corporations guarantee loans of their subsidiaries. <em>See Kramer Motors, Inc. v. British Leyland, Ltd., </em>628 F.2d 1175, 1177 (9th Cir.1980) (parent guaranteeing bank loans to subsidiary); <em>Calvert v. Huckins, </em>875 F.Supp. 674, 679 (E.D.Cal.1995) (parent guaranteeing subsidiary\u2019s promissory note). But notably, courts have also found a parent corporation\u2019s loan guarantees to be a point of interrelatedness indicative of joint enterprise for the purposes of overcoming corporate separateness. <em>See Tripmasters, Inc. v. Hyatt Int\u2019l Corp., </em>696 F.Supp. 925, 937-38 (S.D.N.Y.1988); <em>Jayne v. Royal Jordanian Airlines Corp., </em>502 F.Supp. 848, 858 (D.C.N.Y.1980). Ultimately, to assess whether a parent so controls its subsidiary as to render it a mere instrumentality, courts weigh numerous considerations, including whether a subsidiary\u2019s obligations are assumed to be those of the parent, segregation of corporate records, inadequate capitalization, commingling of funds and other assets, whether the subsidiary is operated exclusively in the interest of the parent, and whether the parent and subsidiary consolidate financial statements. <em>See, e.g., Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 523, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 836 (2000); <em>Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. v. Superior Court of Orange County, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 248, 70 Cal.Rptr.2d 419, 425 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In essence, Plaintiffs allege that Natixis controlled whether Natixis Funding could participate in all of its municipal derivatives transactions. Taken as true, the Court finds Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations to be materially distinguishable from the parent-subsidiary relationship cases involving loan guarantees relied on by Defendants. Whereas those cases involved isolated loan guarantees offered to enable the subsidiary to further its independent business enterprise, here, Plaintiffs allege that Natixis Funding and Natixis operated in tandem to serve as counter-party to numerous municipal derivatives transactions, including those transactions implicated in the alleged antitrust conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">On the basis of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Natixis controls Natixis Funding generally, and that Natixis and Natixis Funding, in effect, operated as a single enterprise to serve as a counter-party to municipal derivatives transactions, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to plead a prima facie case of alter ego liability. In so doing, the Court also considers that alter ego liability is an equitable doctrine, and that piercing the corporate veil may be appropriate where failing to do so would lead to an inequitable result. <em>See Katzir\u2019s Floor &amp; Home Design, Inc. v. M-MLS.com, </em>394 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.2004) (applying California law); <em>Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 31 Cal.Rptr.2d 433, 443 (1994). The Court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the legal fiction separating Natixis and Natixis Funding was illusory as to the transactions at issue, and that Natixis Funding was merely a conduit for Natixis\u2019s participation in the municipal derivatives market. If in fact Natixis and Natixis Funding operated as a unitary enterprise for the purposes of the municipal derivatives transactions at issue, for Natixis to now assert its corporate separateness to escape liability for any frauds or misdeeds committed by the enterprise would be inequitable and unjust. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims against Natixis.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>III. <em>ORDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">For the reasons discussed above, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">ORDERED that the motion (Docket No. 580) of defendants The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivative Products, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA is DENIED; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">ORDERED that the motion (Docket No. 587) of defendants Syncora Guarantee Inc. and Syncora Holdings Ltd.

(\u201cMBIA\u201d) to dismiss federal and state antitrust claims brought by California municipalities (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Civil Procedure. The Court determined that Plaintiffs had stated plausible Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (\u201c\u00a7 1\u201d), and Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof.Code \u00a7 16720 (the \u201cCartwright Act\u201d), claims against MBIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">MBIA now moves for an order pursuant to Local Civil Rule 6.3 (\u201cRule 6.3\u201d) granting reconsideration. MBIA\u2019s submission in support of the instant motion reiterates essentially the same arguments made in its motion to dismiss, points that this Court fully considered and found meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">II. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Reconsideration of a previous order by the court is an \u201cextraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.\u201d <em>In re Health Mgmt. Sys. Inc. Sec. Litg., </em>113 F.Supp.2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe provision for reargument is not designed to allow wasteful repetition of arguments already briefed, considered and decided.\u201d <em>Schonberger v. Serchuk, </em>742 F.Supp. 108, 119 (S.D.N.Y.1990). \u201cThe major grounds justifying reconsideration are \u2018an intervening change in controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. National Mediation Bd., </em>956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir.1992) <em>(quoting </em>18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 4478 at 790). To these ends, a request for reconsideration under Rule 6.3, which governs motions for reconsideration, must demonstrate controlling law or factual matters put before the court in its decision on the underlying matter that the movant believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court. <em>See Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Rule 6.3 is intended to \u201c \u2018ensure the finality of decisions and to prevent the practice of a losing party ... plugging the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>S.E.C. v. Ashbury Capital Partners, </em>No. 00 Civ. 7898, 2001 WL 604044, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2001) <em>(quoting Carolico Pictures, Inc. v. Sirota, </em>700 F.Supp. 169, 170 (S.D.N.Y.1988)). A court must narrowly construe and strictly apply Rule 6.3 so as to avoid duplicative rulings on previously considered issues and to prevent Rule 6.3 from being used to advance different theories not previously argued, or as a substitute for appealing a final judgment. <em>See Montanile v. National Broad. Co., </em>216 F.Supp.2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y.2002); <em>Shamis v. Ambassador Factors Corp., </em>187 F.R.D. 148, 151 (S.D.N.Y.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">MBIA urges reconsideration on the basis of the same arguments that were raised in briefing on the original motion to dismiss. The motion at hand cites no controlling law or factual matters the Court overlooked that might reasonably be expected to alter the outcome of the April 2010 Decision. Indeed, the Court took into account and rejected the various considerations MBIA asserts as grounds for this motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>MBIA asserts that the allegations regarding MBIA\u2019s winning bid on a May 28, 2004 Riverside GIC (the \u201cMay 2004 Riverside GIC\u201d) do not plausibly suggest MBIA\u2019s participation in the alleged conspiracy. MBIA argues that, despite the 145 basis point bidding spread between MBIA\u2019s high bid and defendant Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale\u2019s low bid, it is implausible that the May 2004 Riverside GIC involved bid rigging or other conspiratorial conduct. In support, MBIA argues that another entity entered an identical high bid on the May 2004 Riverside GIC, and that there were several other competitive losing bids. The Court is not persuaded. As explained in the April 2010 Decision, the Court did not rely on the number of bidders involved in the May 2004 Riverside GIC, nor the competitiveness of losing bids, to find that MBIA plausibly participated in the alleged conspiracy. Rather, as discussed at length in the April 2010 Decision, the Court relied on the spread between low and high bids to consider the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. That two entities entered the same high bid 145 basis points above the low bid, and that MBIA was then selected as the winning bidder, does not undermine the plausibility of MBIA having been preselected as the winner of the May 2004 Riverside GIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">MBIA also asserts that the Court improperly relied on Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the former director of the IRS\u2019s tax-exempt bond office viewed a bidding spread of 100 to 150 basis points in a municipal derivatives auction as indicative of sham bidding. MBIA argues that the Court .improperly characterized the IRS\u2019s purported approach to bidding spreads as an \u201cIRS Guideline.\u201d (MBIA Inc.\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Reconsideration, dated April 30, 2010, at 3.) However, as demonstrated by the Court\u2019s repeated reference to the IRS\u2019s alleged approach as a \u201crough guideline,\u201d the Court fully considered the nature of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. Plaintiffs do not allege, nor did the Court indicate in the April 2010 Decision, that the IRS\u2019s rough guideline has been formalized in any IRS policy statements or regulations. As discussed at length in the April 2010 Decision, the Court accepted Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the IRS\u2019s approach to bidding spreads as true for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, and on that basis found that the 145 basis point bidding spread in the May 2004 Riverside GIC plausibly implicates MBIA in the alleged conspiracy. Further dispute regarding whether the rough guideline has been formally adopted by the IRS, or whether the rough guideline as alleged is an appropriate metric for discerning unlawful conspiratorial conduct in municipal derivatives auctions, is inappropriate at this stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Because MBIA has failed to identify any controlling law or factual matters put to the Court on the underlying motion that the Court demonstrably did not consider, MBIA\u2019s motion for reconsideration is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">IV. <em>ORDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">For the reasons stated above, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">ORDERED that motion of defendant MBIA Inc. for reconsideration (Docket No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>712) of the Court\u2019s Decision and Order dated April 26, 2010 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">.

Defendants assert that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy Rule 8'of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because their claims against FSAI, Dexia and Assured are alleged collectively against \u201cFSA.\" The Court disagrees.

Because Assured is allegedly a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, and because the acquisition agreement at issue is governed, as alleged, by New York law, the Court will apply New York law for the purposes of this motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., Cargo Partner AG v. Albatrans, Inc., </em>352 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir.2003). The Court also notes that California law on successor liability is substantially similar, and the Court\u2019s analysis would thus be analogous under California law. <em>See, e.g., Orthotec, LLC v. Reo Spineline, LLC, </em>438 F.Supp.2d 1122, 1130 (C.D.Cal.2006) (applying California law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. As the transferee Court in a MDL, the Court applies the substantive state law of the jurisdiction in which the action was filed. <em>See De George v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>338 Fed.Appx. 15, 16-17 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. The April 2010 Decision is reported as <em>Hinds County, Miss. v.

MBIA was one among more than thirty defendants that together filed an omnibus motion to dismiss. To the extent MBIA joined in that common motion, the Court took its arguments into account. MBIA correctly indicates that the April 2010 Decision does not list MBIA's separate moving brief and reply memorandum among the supplemental memoranda the Court considered in reaching its decision. In the April 2010 Decision, the Court identified more than twenty other defendants which submitted supplemental memoranda in support of the omnibus motion to dismiss. <em>See Hinds, </em>2010 WL 1727965, at *2. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The omission of MBIA in the specific list of defendants which submitted supplemental memoranda was inadvertent, a clerical error that had no bearing on the Court's consideration of MBIA's motion to dismiss.
