On this appeal, Bashaw makes two contentions: (1) That the District Court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry of Bashaw, while a witness in his own behalf, \u201cDid you recently plead in state court to possession of drugs?\u201d (2) Egregious error by the prosecutor in a comment, made during summation \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s evidence doesn\u2019t meet its burden of showing the defendant did not commit the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">Germane to the first contention is that the prosecutor was apparently not aware that the state charge was a misdemeanor and that the proceedings therein had not terminated. When the mistrial motion was made following the question, the district judge immediately and firmly admonished the jury that the question should be entirely disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">Likewise, when objection was made to the above quoted portion of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the district judge immediately and properly instructed the jury that it \u201cmust not accept the statements of counsel as to the law.\u201d Thereafter, the court carefully instructed the jury that it rested upon the prosecution to prove Bashaw\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">We do not condone the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. In fact, we condemn it, and overzeal on the part of a counsel for the Government of the United States affords no legitimate excuse for his prosecutorial misconduct. In the light of the prompt and careful curative instructions of the district judge, however, and in light of the further fact that the evidence of Bashaw\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, we are impelled to the conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was legally harmless and that the judgment of conviction should be, and it hereby is,</p>\n<p id=\"AAZF\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
