We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that it was not infringed and affirm its order granting summary judgment dismissing the complaint which sought damages, an accounting, injunctive and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-25\">On December 4, 1967, appellant, a designer and manufacturer of jewelry, act<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ing in apparent compliance with the copyright laws, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et seq., secured the issuance by the Register of Copyrights of a copyright of a design of its gold pin, which is in the shape of a turtle and bears an oval cluster of round precious stones on the back shell, or carapace, of the turtle. Some time in 1971 defendant Honora Jewelry Co., Inc. (\u201cHonora\u201d), which is controlled by the two other defendants, began producing and selling a gold turtle pin with jewels in an oval arrangement on its back, similar in appearance to appellant\u2019s pin. In 1973 appellant brought the present suit for infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Appellant concedes that Honora\u2019s pin is not an exact duplicate of its piece and that appellant does not have any evidence of direct copying by defendants. Defendants, while admitting that they knew of appellant\u2019s pin and, indeed, had in 1968 produced an exact copy which led to the issuance of a decree enjoining its sale as an infringement, see Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Grossbardt, 428 F.2d 551 (2d Cir. 1970), contend that the alleged infringing pin in the present case was independently created and is sufficiently different from appellant\u2019s pin to preclude the possibility of copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A comparison of the two pins, which were submitted to us upon oral argument and which are shown in photographic exhibits, discloses that, although there are numerous differences between the two, which have been detailed by the district court, each conforms generally to the shape of a turtle as that reptile appears in nature, with upper shell, legs, protruding head and tail. Each also bears an oval cluster of jewels on its back.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The threshold question is what characteristics of appellant\u2019s design have gained copyright protection. Since all turtles are created more or less along the same lines, appellant cannot, by obtaining a copyright upon one design of a turtle pin, exclude all others from manufacturing gold turtle pins on the ground that they are substantially similar in appearance. Clearly, a copyright does not offer protection of such breadth. \u201cUnlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea \u2014 not the idea itself,\u201d Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217, 74 S.Ct. 460, 470, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954). In Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, 446 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1971), a case involving a claimed infringement of a jeweled bee pin produced by these same defendants, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cWe think the production of jeweled bee pins is a larger private preserve than Congress intended to be set aside in the public market without a patent. A jeweled bee pin is therefore an \u2018idea\u2019 that defendants were free to copy.\u201d (446 F.2d at 742).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Appellant contends that, even assuming the foregoing limitations upon the scope of protection offered by its copyright, the protection nevertheless extends to \u201cthe essence\u201d of its design, which it describes as consisting principally of the utilization of an oval shaped cluster of 10 jewels on the back of its turtle.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">The test of copyright infringement is whether the similarity between the products would lead \u201cthe average lay observer . . . [to] recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work,\u201d Ideal Toy Corp. v. Fab-Lu, Ltd., 360 F.2d 1021, 1022 (2d Cir. 1966); Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1960). Applying this test here, the district court concluded that the average layman would not find sufficient similarity in the parties\u2019 particular expressions of the idea of a jeweled turtle pin to warrant a finding of infringement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">Going beyond the initial observation that both pins are turtles and both are jeweled, we believe the average layman would indeed detect numerous differences, the existence, of which are conceded by appellant\u2019s President, which tend to eliminate any substantial similar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ity of protected expression.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The idea of placing jewels on the back of the cara-r pace is rather obvious. Although the oval arrangement of 10 gems might at first blush appear to possess individuality of expression, further observation discloses that it merely conforms to the normal shape of the turtle\u2019s back and the pattern of its vertebrae segments, of which there are in nature not less than 10 nor more than 12. Accordingly, there being no dispute as to material factual issues, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was no copyright infringement and affirm its order granting summary judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-14\">. The differences between the two pins were described by Judge Brieant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-15\">\u201cHe [appellant\u2019s President] testified that defendant\u2019s pin, which he claims infringes, was lighter, that it was not made of nugget gold, but a reasonable imitation thereof, that the turtle\u2019s tail on Rosenthal\u2019s pin was straight, while the tail on the turtle comprising defendant\u2019s pin was somewhat curved. Plaintiff\u2019s has jewelry stones in the eyes, and the defendant\u2019s pin does not. Plaintiff\u2019s pin has flat, or paddle type feet, while defendant\u2019s pin indicates toe differentiations. Plaintiff\u2019s pin has a gold base holding it together, and defendant\u2019s pin has no such base. Plaintiff\u2019s pin has a matted finish on the head of the turtle, while defendant\u2019s turtle head has a lined finish, but Mr. Rosenthal asserted that this difference in the finish was not observable to the naked eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-26\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s turtle head comes out straight from the body, while the head on defendant\u2019s pin protrudes from the shell of the turtle at an angle from the body. There are twenty-seven little nubs or sections in the shell of plaintiff\u2019s, while defendant\u2019s has only ten rounded sections with straight lines. The body of plaintiff\u2019s pin consists of two pieces, with the top soldered onto the bottom frame, while defendant\u2019s appears to have been manufactured in a single piece. Defendant\u2019s pin is half the thickness or depth of plaintiffs pin (8 millimeters vs. 4 millimeters). Plaintiffs pin has a line for the mouth of the turtle, and defendant\u2019s pin has no mouth on the turtle.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
