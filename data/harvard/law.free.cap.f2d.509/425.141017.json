The Board cross-petitioned for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">We will not stop to repeat facts adequately set forth in the opinion of the Board and of its Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Petitioner asks us to hold that the ALJ erred in the resolution of credibility so as to credit the testimony of Winkworth, the Johns-Man-ville employee relations manager, that on December 14, 1972, union business representative Jannotta warned that Local 705 would throw up a picket line at Johns-Manville\u2019s main gate if it continued to accept deliveries from Trumbull, and that it would take some time to arrange for this picket line to be removed. The ALJ, who heard the witnesses, credited Winkworth as a \u201cwholly believable witness\u201d (ALJ Dec. p. 10) and found Eyster, the other witness for the General Counsel, more believable than the Union witnesses, Jannotta and Taylor. Obviously, the court cannot interfere with such determinations by an administrative agency, and must find there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-18\">The petitioner also contends that the conduct was de minimis and the case was moot before the complaint issued. A single remark may be treated as lacking the force of substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>dence when it is isolated and is depicted against a background of correct conduct. <em>See </em>J. J. Newberry Co. v. NLRB, 442 F. 2d 987, 901 (2d Cir. 1971). But even a single remark may have the implication, in context, of a threat that the Board may condemn. NLRB v. Local 254, Building Service Employees International Union, 359 F.2d 289, 291 (1st Cir. 1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******Here the Board was within its discretion in treating as substantial a threat to picket Johns-Manville\u2019s main gate, with 100 or more trucks passing daily into a facility at Waukegan with limited storage capacity. The context is not one of inadvertence, but of a planned visit paid to Johns-Manville\u2019s purchasing agent by Jannotta, together with union steward Taylor and another representative, Creedon, after receiving instructions from the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">As to the issue of mootness, petitioner relies on the fact that on December 29, 1972, the attorney for the union wired Johns-Manville\u2019s Winkworth that Local 705 had no intention of picketing but merely sought cooperation, which was at Johns-Manville\u2019s choice. This wire states that Local 705\u2019s representatives \u201cwere instructed not to use the word \u2018picket\u2019 and merely to ask for your cooperation\u201d. However, the record also includes Mr. Jannotta\u2019s testimony that he did not receive any instructions as to what action to take if Johns-Manville did not \u201ccooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">While petitioner\u2019s brief claims that the word \u201cpicket\u201d was introduced by Winkworth, this is of no consequence if it was adopted by Jannotta and the substance of the conversation was indeed about the possibility of picketing. Certain .it is that Jannotta did not expressly state that all that was sought was \u201ccooperation\u201d which Johns-Manville was absolutely free to extend or withhold without any reprisal from the Union. And insofar as mootness is concerned, the union wire of December 29 came after the union had received, on December 21, a copy of the charge filed by Johns-Manville on December 19. This has a bearing on the Board\u2019s decision to conclude whether the repudiation was timely and effective, or whether it was really a response to the imminence of the Board\u2019s proceeding and bore a meaningful possibility of renewal in some form.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Board member Penello\u2019s dissent concluded that a remedial order should be withheld. He stressed that the threat of picketing was repudiated before JohnsManville was schedule to receive further Trumbull deliveries. Johns-Manville had shut down its roofing operation for preventitive maintenance between December 16, 1972, and January 2, 1973. And so there were no end-of-December shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The Board has latitude not to burden itself and the courts with \u201cinfinitesimally small abstract grievances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the court had the judgment to make, the present case seems a ripe candidate for informal handling, following formal complaint, without cluttering the dockets for administrative hearings and judicial consideration. But where to draw the line of matters trivial in their impact is primarily a task for the Board and not for the court. We are without warrant to mandate its dismissal in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The union\u2019s petition for review is denied. The Board\u2019s petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-5\">. In that ease, the remark was: \u201cWe have permission to [picket], I didn\u2019t say we were going to, but we have permission to do it.\u201d 359 F.2d at 291 n. 4.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">In another case, the General Counsel decided not to proceed on a charge brought under section 8(b) (4) (ii) that arose out o\u00ed a union\u2019s statement to an employer that picketing would begin \u201cThursday morning, if everything goes well with our -lawyers.\u201d NLRB, Quarterly Report of the General Counsel, pt. II, at 8-13 (Aug. 30, 1974). The General Counsel saw this statement as a \u201cconditional threat to picket consistent with an intent to recommend picketing to the Union\u2019s attorney, a recommendation which could either be accepted or rejected.\u201d NLRB, <em>supra, </em>at 9. In the case under review, the union\u2019s threat to picket was not expressly conditioned on the approval of union attorneys, but could be reasonably understood by the employer to be conditioned only on the employer\u2019s compliance with the union\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-18\">. NLRB v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 409 F.2d 296 (5th Cir. 1969). There liad been no picketing. But of course, the mere fact of picketing, though terminated, would cause trauma, and was indeed the core of the threat. In NLRB v. Columbia Typographical Union No. 101, I.T.U. 152 U.S. App.D.C. 365, 470 F.2d 1274, (1972), the court stated that no suggestion of bad faith is involved where local\u2019s firing of a supervisor is reversed by the international union \u201clong before issuance of the complaint . . . by the General Counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-14\">.

In such cases, discretion may be exercised by the General Counsel in withholding a complaint, or by the Board in finding that there is no substantial evidence of a concrete violation, without contending that after a hearing establishing a violation it lias discretion to waive the provision of \u00a7 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1970), that if the Board shall be of the opinion that a person has engaged in unfair labor practices it shall issue a cease and desist order.
