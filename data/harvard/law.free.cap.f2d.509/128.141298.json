The trial court decided that the policy did not cover Bowerman for a claim asserted by the City of Cranston, R. I., in an action brought against Bowerman and others in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The facts underlying the city\u2019s claim are as follows: In March of 1965 the city engaged Vincent Dimitri, a duly licensed architect, to design and prepare plans and specifications for the construction of a new police headquarters building. When Dimitri had completed the plans and specifications, the construction job was let out for bids. All of the bids for this job exceeded the funds appropriated by the city, and Bowerman, a construction firm, was requested to review certain material including the architect\u2019s plans and specifications to determine if there were any areas where the cost of construction could be reduced. Roland Mather, an estimator in Bowerman\u2019s employ, reviewed the material and suggested certain changes to effect cost savings. Two of his recommendations were to reduce the thickness of the basement floor slab and to substitute mesh for the steel rods that were to be embedded in the concrete slab. The city approved these suggestions and later asked Bowerman to perform a drafting function incorporating into Dimitri\u2019s plans some of the changes suggested by Bowerman as well as other unrelated changes. Bids were again solicited, and in November of 1965 the city awarded the contract to A. DiOrio &amp; Co. and construction began. Bowerman played no part whatsoever in the actual construction of the building and was paid only for the services it rendered in drafting the modified plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The new headquarters building was completed sometime in 1968, and the parties stipulated that the city first noticed a settling of' the basement floor therein on February 19, 1968. Subsequently the city filed suit in the state court on February 28, 1972, seeking damages in the amount of $250,000 against Bowerman and Dimitri as a result of the settling of the basement floor. The complaint alleged that Dimitri was \u201cnegligent in designing a slab on ground type of basement floor rather than a structural type of supported floor . . <em>. </em>\u201cnegligent in designing the basement floor in that he failed to design a structural floor\u201d; \u201cnegligent in agreeing to and acquiescing in aforesaid changes advised by defendant Bowerman . .</p>\n<p id=\"AX_\">It further alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">21. Defendant Bowerman was negligent in advising changes in Dimitri\u2019s original specifications for the basement floor which reduced the thickness of the slab on ground and the amount of reinforcement in the slab.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">22. Defendant Bowerman was negligent in failing to advise the use of a supported basement floor rather than a slab on ground basement floor which it knew or should have known could not be supported by the subsoil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">At all relevant times Bowerman was insured under a series of standard liability insurance policies issued by Maryland, each policy covering a one-year period. These policies provided for coverage with a $50,000 maximum limit. In addition to the policies with Maryland, Bowerman had an \u201cumbrella\u201d insurance policy with American Employers\u2019 in effect at the time of the occurrence under which American Employers\u2019 would pay any amount over and above the coverage afforded to Bowerman under other applicable insurance or, if there was no other insurance, any amount over and above the sum of $25,000. Thus, the elimination of Maryland\u2019s coverage would expose Bowerman and American Employers\u2019 to an additional $25,000 of liability each.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>There is no dispute that damages for the injuries alleged by Cranston fall within the policy\u2019s general coverage for property damage liability. The sole issue before us is the applicability of ex-elusion (k), the standard \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusion, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8a\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201c(k) To bodily injury or property damage resulting from the failure of the named insured\u2019s products or work completed by or for the named insured to perform the function or serve the purpose intended by the named insured, if such failure is due to a mistake or deficiency in any design, formula, plan, specification, advertising material or printed instructions prepared or developed by any insured; but this exclusion does not apply to bodily injury or property damage resulting from the active malfunctioning of such products or work;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We are not impressed by plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the exclusion does not apply because Bowerman\u2019s work was intended solely to cut costs, succeeded in doing so and thus did not fail to serve its intended purpose. If this were Cranston\u2019s only goal it could have handled the job itself. As Bowerman well knew its professional expertise was sought to cut costs without destroying the building\u2019s structural integrity, a purpose it allegedly failed to achieve. Nor are we persuaded of the clause\u2019s inapplicability by the testimony of Bowerman\u2019s employees that its work for the city involved no engineering or design skills. Although Mather\u2019s estimation work may not have required such skills, it is clear from the words of the complaint that \u201cin advising changes in Dimitri\u2019s original specifications\u201d to reduce the thickness and reinforcement of the floor and in failing to advise the use of a supported floor, Bowerman helped determine the building\u2019s \u201cdesign, formula, plan [or] specification,\u201d as the court below rightly x 7 O\u00bb/ concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The applicability of the \u201cactive malfunctioning\u201d exception to the business risk exclusion presents a more substantial question. Although this concept is not without difficulty, Henderson, Insurance Protection for Products Liability and Completed Operations \u2014 What Every Lawyer Should Know, 50 Neb.L.Rev. 415, 439 (1971); Tarpey, The New Comprehensive Policy: Some of the Changes, 33 Ins.Counsel J. 223, 225-26 (1966), its basic intent is clear. Design errors <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in mere \u201cpassive\u201d failure to discharge an intended function are regarded as the insured\u2019s normal business risk and are excluded from coverage, while design errors themselves causing some positive or \u201cactive\u201d harm deemed extraordinary in the insured\u2019s business are covered. Thus, to recite some of the hypotheticals appearing in commentaries dealing with the clause, the policy is not intended to cover liability resulting from the faulty design of an insecticide which fails to kill insects, a hair tonic which fails to prevent baldness, or a rust inhibitor which fails to inhibit rust. On the other hand, the active malfunctioning exception would apply to provide coverage for liability resulting from an insecticide which harms crops to which it is applied, a hair tonic which causes a scalp rash, or a rust inhibitor which corrodes a radiator to which it is added.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>argue, citing language from two cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that any physical damage to property other than the insured\u2019s work product constitutes active malfunctioning. However, the hypotheticals show that there is no active malfunctioning when an insecticide fails to prevent harm to crops from insects even though property other than the insured\u2019s work product is physically damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Here the harm alleged in the city\u2019s complaint \u2014 damage to the building and its fixtures resulting from subsidence permitted by the floor\u2019s weakness \u2014 was precisely the consequence that Bowerman sought to avoid when after \u201cmuch discussion\u201d it recommended its cheaper floor design. As charged in the city\u2019s complaint, Bowerman\u2019s recommended design change simply failed to achieve its intended purpose of cutting costs consistent with structural integrity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A finding of active malfunctioning might be justified if the floor as redesigned had included a less expensive concrete substitute which released noxious vapors, making the basement unusable, but the floor\u2019s failure to keep the building intact is analogous to the tonic\u2019s failure to keep the hair intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Our conclusion that there was no active malfunctioning here is buttressed by a statement in Gowan, <em>supra </em>at 276, apparently available at the time when the coverage here in question was entered into:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cActive malfunctioning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4m\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApA1\">\u201cUnder this exclusion, the insured gets no protection if he is alleged to have caused the collapse of any structure by having purposely designed or selected a steel beam with insufficient strength.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In determining the intention of the parties to the contract, we think it relevant that such \u201cactive malfunction\u201d clauses were commonly used in property damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>policies at the time of the formation of this contract; moreover, plaintiffs do not show that Bowerman thought he was obtaining a general malpractice policy, which is more expensive but which covers errors and omissions, including bad advice. Although we are cognizant of the venerable principle of construing insurance contracts and especially exclusionary clauses strictly against the insurer, the policy in question cannot reasonably be construed to cover Bowerman for this type of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. Maryland argues that the active malfunctioning concept never comprehends design error, but the materials it cites clearly negate this assertion. <em>See </em>W. Obrist, The New Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Policy 9 (Defense Research Institute, Inc. monograph, Nov. 1966). The exception\u2019s application depends not on the nature of the insured\u2019s operation (design vs. production) but on the nature of the resulting harm, as our discussion <em>infra </em>shows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\">. <em>See </em>Long, The Law of Liability Insurance, App. B, \u00a7 13 (1971) (insecticide hypothetical); Gowan, Completed Operations and Products Liability Insurance Coverage of the New Comprehensive General Automobile Policy, 1966 ABA Section of Ins., Negligence &amp; Comp.L. 265, 276 (insecticide hypothetical); Tarpey, <em>supra </em>(hair tonic, rust inhibitor hypothetical); W. Obrist, <em>supra </em>(insecticide, hair tonic hypotheticals).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">. In Haugan v. Home Indemnity Co., 86 S.D. 406, 197 N.W.2d 18 (1972), plaintiff Haugan designed and constructed an airplane hangar and office building which separated from its foundation and became cracked and misshapen. In a declaratory judgment action construing a policy identical to the one issued by Maryland here, the court held that coverage was eliminated by exclusion (m), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">\u201c(m) to property damage to work performed by or on behalf of the named insured arising out of the work or any portion thereof, or out of materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">The court went on to suggest by way of dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">\u201cThe same reasoning and the same result applies to the exception relating to \u2018active malfunctioning\u2019 of products or work appearing in exclusion (k). This exception is likewise limited by the basic exclusion (m). It means there is no liability coverage afforded by the policies for damages caused by and confined to the insured\u2019s own work or product. However, when the insured\u2019s work or product actively malfunctions <em>and </em>causes damage to other property coverage is afforded. . \u201d (emphasis added) 86 S.D. at 413, 197 N.W.2d at 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">In Kyllo v. Northland Chemical Co., 209 N.W.2d 629 (N.D.1973), the court held that exclusion (k) applied to eliminate coverage for damages in the amount of lost profits sought from the insured for the failure of its herbicide to control weeds. The active malfunctioning exception was held inapplicable absent \"actual physical damage caused by application of the product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-16\">While these cases support the principle that physical damage to property other than the insured\u2019s work product is <em>necessary </em>for a finding of active malfunctioning (indeed such a result is required by exclusion (m) anyway), they do not show that such damage is <em>sufficient.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b189-17\">. The purpose of a floor design in such a situation inherently includes avoidance of settling of the floor. Plaintiffs are not helped on this point by arguing that the slab on the floor was defective and that therefore even reinforcing rods and thick concrete (as opposed to the mesh and thinner concrete used according to Bowerman\u2019s suggestions) would not have provided the necessary support. This argument concerns a factual issue that must be determined in the main case to establish the causation element of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b189-18\">. The word \u201cpurposely\u201d here is intended to distinguish the case where a draftsman erroneously alters satisfactory specifications in transcribing them, which would be covered. It does not refer to an intent to have the structure collapse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
