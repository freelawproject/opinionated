ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b373-34\">Cyrus T. Anderson contests his conviction by a jury on three counts of bribery of a United States Senator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His main argument is that he was deprived of a fair trial as the result of surprise and perjury in connection with the testimony of Betsey Shipley Norton, a key witness for the Government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Anderson also ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>vanees other grounds for reversal, each of which we address in the course of this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find Anderson\u2019s arguments unpersuasive, and accordingly affirm the conviction on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">I. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Anderson was a registered congressional lobbyist for Spiegel, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a Chicago-based merchandiser.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since Spiegel conducted its sales primarily through the mails, its financial well-being was directly related to the level of third-class mail rates. Daniel B. Brewster was a United States Senator, and a member of the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. It was the alleged bribery of Brewster by Anderson, as the <em>alter ego </em>of Spiegel, that gave birth to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The theory of the prosecution was that Anderson on several occasions delivered monies to Brewster with corrupt intent to influence his action on postal-rate legislation coming before him in his official capacity. An indictment so charged,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the jury, at Anderson\u2019s trial jointly with Spiegel <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Brewster,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> found Anderson guilty as charged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">The Government\u2019s case against Anderson, and by the same token the jury\u2019s verdict, rested notably upon the testimony of John Francis Sullivan, formerly an aide to Brewster,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Betsey Shipley Norton, a close friend of Anderson.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Primarily through these two witnesses, the Government sought to prove the execution of a scheme designed to route payments from Spiegel through Anderson to Brewster and to a nominal campaign committee for him. We need not recite in full the maze of details comprising the conflicting testimonial versions of the questioned transactions. Rather, we recount only so much of the evidence, pro and con, as will bring into sharp focus the several points Anderson raises on this appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">A. <em>The Sullivan Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution, John Sullivan delineated for the jury a series of contacts between Anderson, Brewster and himself, in the course of which the events germi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>nating the bribery counts against Anderson assertedly transpired.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> What follows is a summary of Sullivan\u2019s testimony in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Late in 1965, a political fundraiser visited Brewster at his Senate office in Sullivan\u2019s presence. Brewster was nearing the end of his term and, though not then an announced candidate, he contemplated a run for reelection. The visitor mentioned a proposal by the Postmaster General to increase mail rates, and Brewster said that he had no fixed opinion on the merits of the proposal. The visitor then told Brewster that if he remained uncommitted on the subject, she could get money for his reelection campaign from Anderson.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Brewster suggested that Anderson call Sullivan in that connection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In January, 1966, Sullivan received a telephone call from Anderson, who stated his understanding that Brewster \u201cwas going to keep an open mind\u201d on the rate-increase proposal and said that he \u201cwas sending something\u201d to the office. A few days later a check for $5,000 arrived, addressed to Brewster\u2019s earlier visitor. The check was drawn by the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union of Cincinnati, Ohio,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and was made payable to the \u201cD. C. Committee for Maryland Education\u201d (DCCME).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The check was deposited in a bank account opened in the name of DCCME, which became a committee to accept campaign contributions for Brewster.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">A year passed without any other known contact by or with Anderson. In January, 1967, however, Anderson conferred with Brewster and Sullivan in their Senate offices. Anderson revealed his connection with Spiegel<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and voiced Spiegel\u2019s opposition to higher postal rates. As the meeting drew to a close, Anderson gave Brewster an envelope containing $5,000 in cash, and Brewster told Anderson that he \u201cwould do all he _ possibly could to be of assistance to Spiegel . . .. \u201d The $5,000 was placed. in a safe in Sullivan\u2019s office, and was subsequently used for cash expenditures.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">On April 5, 1967, a bill seeking postal-rate raises was introduced in Congress. Shortly thereafter, Anderson obtained from Spiegel a check for $13,500 payable to DCCME and, with help from Betsey Norton, converted it into cash.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Later that month Anderson, accompanied by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>man introduced as Morris Spiegel,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> again called on Brewster and Sullivan. There was discussion of the pending bill, during which Morris Spiegel handed an envelope to Brewster. Inside the envelope was $4,500 in cash, which also found its way into the DCCME bank account.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">A third payment was made in July, 1967. On Brewster\u2019s order, Sullivan telephoned Anderson and inquired as to whether any more money would be forthcoming. Anderson answered \u201cyes, he did have some more money, for the Senator \u2014 five thousand dollars \u2014 but he had not received a check from Spiegel in Chicago, yet.\u201d After receiving several more telephone calls from Sullivan, Anderson went to Sullivan\u2019s office and made out a personal check for $5,000, leaving the name of the payee blank.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Sullivan wrote in DCCME as payee and later deposited it in DCCME\u2019s account.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">B. <em>The Norton Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Though, like Sullivan, the recipient of a grant of immunity, Betsey Norton<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> remained an outwardly reluctant witness.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nonetheless, her initial effort to avoid testifying having failed,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Government called her to the witness stand as the second week of trial began. Disregarding for the moment further difficulties in securing her testimony, which generate some of the issues on appeal,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we relate the highlights of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Ms. Norton met Anderson in 1965. A close friendship developed, and she frequently assisted Anderson in his projects. She became aware of his employment by the Spiegel company and attended some of his meetings with Modie Spiegel, its chief executive officer, in Chicago and Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Over a period of three years, at Anderson\u2019s request Ms. Norton cashed a number of Spiegel checks for him, including two related to contributions to DCCME.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On occasion Modie Spiegel, unable to contact Anderson, telephoned her to confirm delivery of \u201cthe package\u201d \u2014money obtained by cashing Spiegel checks, some of which had been ear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>marked for Brewster.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Por her cooperation she was rewarded in 1968 when Anderson importuned Modie Spiegel to arrange a mortgage on her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Anderson, Ms. Norton avowed, canvassed the members of the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in 1967 to ascertain their views on the pending rate-increase legislation. There was also a discussion between Anderson and Modie Spiegel in her presence regarding the response by Brewster, himself a committee member. Brewster had indicated a position favoring low-level third-class postal rates, and had already received $5,000 from Spiegel. Anderson felt, however, that additional payments were needed to insure his continued support.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Ms. Norton remarried<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and moved to New York in September, 1967, but she often returned to Washington, and she continued to see Anderson through the fall of 1968. When the grand jury investigation in the instant case got under way, Anderson told her that she probably would be called as a witness, and reviewed with her the substance of the testimony she should give. Anderson also requested her to name John Criswell, then treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, to convey the impression that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Mr. Criswell was a part of this so it would look like it was part of the Democratic National Committee rather than just a direct thing from Spiegel to Anderson to whomever the monies went for.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">To this end, Anderson arranged for Ms. Norton to meet Criswell in order to assure her ability to identify him if asked to do so by the grand jury. She flew from Washington to Kansas City for that purpose, observed Criswell at an airport there for five minutes, and returned to Washington later on the same day. This testimony was to become an important point in Anderson\u2019s argument for reversal of his conviction.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">C. <em>The Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Anderson took the witness stand in his own behalf.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> He described for the jury the role of a congressional lobbyist, and acknowledged an introduction to Brewster and the campaign contribution to him in January, 1966.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> At the behest of Brewster\u2019s late-1965 visitor,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Anderson said, he solicited the $5,000 check from the Bartenders Union and at Sullivan\u2019s direction had it made out to DCCME.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Anderson denied any meeting with Brewster or Sullivan in January, 1967,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> or any discussion attended by Morris Spiegel in April of that year.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> He admitted, however, an April meeting with Brewster on behalf of the Spiegel company,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and claimed that the cash then given to Sullivan was his own contribution \u2014 and not one by Spiegel \u2014 in the amount of $7,500, not $4,500 as stated by Sullivan.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Anderson also admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in July, 1967, he delivered to Sullivan his personal check for $5,000, on which Sullivan then entered DCCME as payee,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> because Sullivan had called him and urgently requested money.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Anderson further testified that he was given the $13,500 Spiegel check,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> but that he never contemplated its use for Brewster or DCCME. The check was drawn in favor of DCCME, Anderson said, simply as a means of enabling conversion of the cheek to cash. Then, Anderson continued, he turned the $13,500 over to John Criswell in cash, as part of approximately $50,000 which Anderson had pledged to raise for the Democratic National Committee.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Anderson also undertook to explain to the jury the part Ms. Norton played in the affair.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> By his arrangement, she cashed the $13,500 check to DCCME<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and the $5,000 check to the D.C. Committee for Maryland Progress.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Those checks, Anderson said, were funneled through DCCME and cashed by Ms. Norton to avoid any appearance, from his own endorsement thereon, that the monies represented taxable income to him.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Anderson also leveled an attack on Betsey Norton\u2019s credibility,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and not the least her claim that she met Criswell in Kansas City.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Anderson stated that he went to Kansas City and at an airport there discussed with Criswell the grand jury\u2019s interest in Anderson\u2019s fundraising activities. Anderson testified further that Ms. Norton accompanied him on the trip, but declared that she never saw Criswell because, he said, \u201c[s]he was back at the Muhlbach Hotel\u201d at the time.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> John Criswell also testified to the airport meeting, stating \u201c[to] the very best of [his] knowledge\u201d that Ms. Norton was not present.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">The evidentiary and argumentative presentations at trial covered a period of more than two weeks. The trial judge submitted the case against Anderson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Brewster<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> to the jury on six counts\u2014 three counts of bribery against each.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The jury was instructed that the range of permissible verdicts on each of these counts was guilty of bribery, guilty of unlawfully accepting gratuities, or not guilty. The jury found Anderson guilty of bribery on all three counts against him, and Brewster of thrice receiving gratuities unlawfully.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Anderson\u2019s post-verdict motion for a new trial was denied,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> a judgment of conviction was entered, terms of imprisonment and fines were imposed,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and Anderson appealed. We have heretofore entered our judgment affirming Anderson\u2019s conviction, noting that this opinion would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">II. THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Anderson\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin on October 30, 1972, the last day of service scheduled for the District Court\u2019s complement of petit jurors for that month. To avoid difficulty for any juror from a relatively lengthy extension of the period of service, the trial judge addressed to the jurors a general inquiry designed to ascertain how many would be able to serve beyond the normal expiration of their term.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The jurors were told that a trial starting October 30 might require two weeks, and neither the case nor its subject matter was identified. A total of 68 of some 200 to 300 jurors answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The judge then asked counsel whether there was any objection to calling 60 of those indicating continuing availability as the panel from which the jury for the trial would be chosen. Anderson\u2019s counsel stated that he would \u201cabide by the majority vote of defense counsel\u201d but simultaneously suggested that \u201cit might be best to start with a new jury\u201d the next day. There was additional discussion but no further objection,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and the judge proceeded in accordance with the plan he had indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">We are now confronted with Anderson\u2019s contention that the procedure by which the 60-member panel of prospective jurors was obtained deprived him of a trial jury representative of the community. The panel, he says, was composed of \u201cvolunteers\u201d \u201cwho expressed their desire to serve\u201d \u2014 \u201cpeople who had no responsibilities which would be seriously impaired by their absence from their normal routines for a period of several weeks;\u201d a jury so constituted, Anderson argues, \u201cwas not an adequate cross-section of the metropolitan community upon which to try the sophisticated issues of this major criminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">To be sure, Anderson was entitled to trial by a jury selected from a body truly representative of the community.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> However, his characterization of the composition of the jury panel utilized in this case is far from accurate. There is not the slightest hint that the October complement of jurors \u2014 from which came the 60-member panel, and ultimately the jury for his trial \u2014 was other than a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cross-section of residents of the District of Columbia. Neither the panel nor the trial jury became any the less so by reason of the technique the judge employed. To say, as Anderson does, that the trial jurors had no responsibilities in competition with jury service is to indulge in speculation in an area wherein proof is an indispensable prerequisite.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Moreover, jury service in this age involves almost inevitably some sacrifice of personal pursuits; without people willing to devote some of their time and energy, the jury system would grind to a halt. The traditional response of the populace to the call to this public duty belies the notion that those who respond have nothing else of importance to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Nor, by our understanding, was the trial judge\u2019s methodology in this case an appeal to the outgoing body of jurors for volunteers.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The effort, rather, was to avoid imposition of an unexpected burden upon jurors who could ill afford to continue beyond the period for which they had been summoned to serve. Certainly the judge would have been justified in excluding any of those in the 200-odd category who might individually have shown undue hardship, even during the term of regular service.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Here the endeavor was to eliminate the tedious process of examining one by one the obviously large group who would seek to be excused for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In separating those who could from those who could not afford to expand their service, the judge did not exclude anyone or any cognizable group.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The sole criterion he employed was ability to serve longer; the panel from which the jury was drawn was distinguished only by that quality. We think a trial judge\u2019s discretion in jury selection<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> is broad enough to encompass consideration of adverse consequences which might be suffered by jurors suddenly called to a duty prolonged materially beyond their original expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">III. THE WITNESS NORTON</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">We next address a brace of arguments for reversal which center on the testimony and testimonial conduct of Betsey Norton. One relates to the trial judge\u2019s ruling that Ms. Norton would be admitted as a witness, and the judge\u2019s concomitant refusal of a continuance, after it became known that her testimony would be far more extensive than had been anticipated.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Another pertains to the denial of a motion for a mistrial after the judge had held Ms. Norton in contempt.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Still another asserts perjury in her testimony that she met and observed John Criswell at the airport in Kansas City.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We discuss these aspects of the appeal in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">A. <em>The Surprise Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In lieu of formal pretrial discovery procedures, defense counsel utilized a series of discussions with Government counsel as the means of obtaining information. The results of these efforts were incorporated in a jointly prepared \u201cmemorandum of conferences,\u201d upon which the defense relied in preparing for trial. Betsey Norton\u2019s grand jury testimony had been limited to the cashing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>DCCME checks under the name \u201cShipley\u201d and transferring the proceeds to Anderson,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> and seemingly counsel on neither side had reason to believe that she knew more. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 memorandum reflected the expectation that her participation in the trial would be small.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">On the Saturday preceding the opening of trial,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> the prosecutor learned for the first time that Ms. Norton was more than a courier in check-cashing, and that she professed to know a good deal about payments by Spiegel through Anderson to Brewster. At that time she revealed to the prosecutor new information regarding her involvement with Anderson, Spiegel and Criswell in the transfer of funds to Brewster and others. She indicated that her failure to divulge the information sooner stemmed from fear of prosecution, and of banishment from employment for betrayal of a confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Armed with this knowledge, the prosecutor alerted defense counsel on Sunday that he had additional evidence to strengthen the Government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> On Monday morning one hour prior to commencement of trial, the prosecutor conferred with defense counsel and summarized for them Ms. Norton\u2019s amplifications. As soon as a jury was selected, defense counsel moved for a ruling excluding Ms. Norton as a trial witness and, alternatively, invoking Federal Criminal Rule 16(g),<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> also moved for a continuance. The trial judge denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">Anderson does not seriously contest the judge\u2019s finding that the Government came by the new information on the eve of trial and proceeded in good faith to promptly pass it on to his counsel.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Rather, Anderson contends that the judge should have dismissed Ms. Norton as a trial witness, or should at least have granted a continuance to provide an opportunity for them to meet her \u201csurprise\u201d testimony. Anderson advances no reason for a complete ban on Ms. Norton\u2019s testimony, the relevance and materiality of which is apparent, save that he needed time to combat it. Anderson\u2019s protest thus boils down to the position that the trial judge erred in disallowing the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\"> Indubitably, a reasonable time for adequate preparation of the accused\u2019s defense is the first essential of trial fairness,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> and \u201ca myopic insistence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Refusal of a continuance to enable rebuttal of surprise prosecution testimony may produce these very consequences.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> But \u201cit is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process,\u201d <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> nor does \u201cthe fact, standing alone, that a continuance has been denied, . . . constitute a denial of the constitutional right to assistance of counsel,\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> for \u201c[t]he matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court instructs, \u201c[tjhere are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-22\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>(1) to influence any official act . Shall be fined not more than $20,000 or three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>To Anderson\u2019s plea for additional time, the trial judge responded, quite correctly, that the Government was not obligated to disclose every item of Ms. Norton\u2019s expected testimony even had it been known earlier what the content of that testimony would be. The amplifications in her testimony were not exculpatory of Anderson,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and they did not fall within the categories of information which Rule 16(g) makes discoverable.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Beyond those considerations, the question before the trial judge was whether admission of Ms. Norton\u2019s tardy revelations into evidence might have so affected the defensive ability of Anderson\u2019s counsel as to necessitate a continuance to enable additional preparation.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The judge, after a full hearing on that subject, thought not, and while the judgment is ultimately ours,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> we must accord deference to the judge\u2019s informed discretion.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We perceive no cause to upset his judgment in the matter. We can no more in retrospect see prejudice to Anderson than the judge was able to anticipate prospectively.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Anderson\u2019s counsel were already on notice, from the memorandum of conferences and the conversations preceding it, that the Government would undertake to prove the events to which Ms. Norton was to testify. A whole week passed between the prosecutor\u2019s disclosure of Ms. Norton\u2019s newly-found knowledge to defense counsel and the time at which she took the witness stand. Just why that did not afford the opportunity Anderson\u2019s counsel asked for is not explained. Indeed, defense witnesses, including Anderson himself, testified in explicit detail in the effort to contradict Ms. Norton\u2019s description of disputed events and, more fundamentally, to destroy her basic credibility before the jury. In sum, the able and vigorous defense Anderson\u2019s counsel erected against Ms. Norton\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d testimony belies any thought that Anderson was in any way harmed by the trial judge\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">B. <em>The Contempt Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The prosecutor admittedly had been advised by Ms. Norton\u2019s personal counsel that she would decline to answer questions going beyond the scope of her grand jury testimony. Anderson asserts that after that declaration the calling of Ms. Norton as a witness was improper and prejudicial, and that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a mistrial on that account. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The present situation is quite unlike that in cases, cited by Anderson, wherein the prosecutor called a witness in full awareness that the witness would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Here the prosecutor had brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention Ms. Norton\u2019s unwillingness to testify voluntarily, and had sought and obtained for her a grant of immunity from prosecution. Thereafter, the prosecutor had every right to demand and to expect her testimony, under compulsion by the court if necessary, despite her preference to the contrary.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">We perceive no impropriety in the handling of the problem by either the prosecutor or the judge, and no ground for overturning the ruling on Anderson\u2019s ensuing motion. Declaration of a mistrial in a criminal case is a step to be avoided whenever possible,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> and one to be taken only in circumstances manifesting a necessity therefor.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>luctance of a prosecution witness is not such an occasion;<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> rather, the court\u2019s duty is to secure the witness\u2019 testimony if compellable, and to give appropriate curative instructions to the jury, if necessary, to restore order in the trial.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In the case at bar, the trial judge, out of the jury\u2019s presence, warned Ms, Norton of the consequences of the course she was taking, and adjudged her in contempt when she persisted. The judge also instructed the jury not to draw any inference of any kind from Ms. Norton\u2019s recalcitrance, or speculate as to what Ms. Norton\u2019s additional testimony would have been. Those steps fulfilled the judge\u2019s responsibility during the period Ms. Norton remained adamant. When Ms. Norton later recanted and returned to the witness stand for questioning by all counsel, any threat to Anderson\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation and cross-examination \u2014 on account of her pre-contempt testimony\u2014 was eliminated from the trial. We do not find Anderson any the worse off because of this experience, and there is no occasion for us to determine what disposition would have been called for had Ms. Norton remained steadfast in her decision to say no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">C. <em>The \u201cPerjury\u201d Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The remaining prong of Anderson\u2019s attack on Betsey Norton\u2019s testimony is that it was tainted by perjury, a position Anderson derives from the following circumstances. Ms. Norton told the jury that Anderson arranged for her to travel to Kansas City to meet John Criswell so that she could identify him if asked to do so by the grand jury.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> She further stated that she flew to Kansas City, observed him at an airport for a few minutes, and returned to Washington on the same day.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Anderson testified, however, that Ms. Norton was at the Muhlbach Hotel in Kansas City when he met Criswell at the airport,<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> and Criswell said that to the best of his recollection Anderson was alone at the time.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">After the trial had ended, Anderson\u2019s counsel came into possession of a receipted bill indicating that Ms. Norton was a guest of the Muhlbaeh Hotel for the night preceding the day of the airport meeting. On the basis of this discovery, and within the period extended by the trial judge for the purpose, counsel moved for a new trial.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion, and his action in doing so is assigned as error. The argument is that Ms. Norton\u2019s version of her part in the Kansas City incident was a deliberate falsehood vitiating the verdict of Anderson\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">The knowing use of perjured testimony to secure a conviction is a denial of due process of law,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> necessitating, of course, a new trial.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> This is not to suggest that a new trial is in order only upon an occurrence of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>dimension. There is respectable authority for the proposition that a new-trial motion on the ground of false testimony, even without a claim that the prosecutor knew of the falsity, should under some conditions be granted.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Moreover, a new-trial motion based on newly discovered evidence made within the seven-day period following verdict \u2014 which in federal practice is allowed for such a motion irrespective of its grounds<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> \u2014 or, as here,- within an extension of that period, is to be measured in terms of \u201cthe interest of justice,\u201d <footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and not by the stricter standard applicable to motions submitted outside that time frame.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> With these principles in mind, we examine the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The two critical events \u2014 an overnight stay at a Kansas City hotel and a brief meeting with Criswell at a Kansas City airport the next day \u2014 are not inherently inconsistent; put another way, it was easily possible for Ms. Norton to have engaged in each. It follows that the hotel bill had no overpowering tendency to prove that Ms. Norton did not see Criswell at the airport just as she said.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">We are mindful of Ms. Norton\u2019s statement that she flew to Kansas City, met Criswell and returned to Washington on the same day. But the mere fact that witnesses give different testimony \u2014 and that is all we have here \u2014 is obviously insufficient to establish that either is a perjurer. That is the more so where, as here, almost two years elapsed between the airport episode and the testimony at Anderson\u2019s trial. Furthermore, as a constitutional claim Anderson\u2019s complaint fails additionally for the reason that there is not the slightest indication that the prosecutor knew that Ms. Norton testified falsely, if indeed she did.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">We come, then, to the question whether, as a nonconstitutional matter, the unavailability of the hotel bill at trial called so imperatively for a grant of Anderson\u2019s motion \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion on that score should be overturned.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>We answer that question in the negative. Failing as an instance of perjury, the inconsistencies to which Anderson adverts could only impinge upon Ms. Norton\u2019s credibility as a witness.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> A review of the trial record discloses, however, that even without the hotel bill Anderson was able to mount a substantial challenge to her veracity. The jury knew that she was a reluctant and ambivalent witness, and that her grand jury presentation was much less expansive than her statement at trial; the jury saw the clash of her version with a considerable volume of testimony by other witnesses. Demonstration of an additional inconsistency, particularly one of such relatively small stature as the airport story, would not likely have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. By the same token, only dubiously could a new trial for Anderson have served the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">It is well settled that disposition of a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of - the trial judge, and should be disturbed only for abuse or misapplication of the law.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> The circumstances here do not persuade us that the able trial judge was misguided in his conclusion as to the direction in which the interest of justice lay. We accordingly sustain his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">IV. THE TRIAL EVENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We next examine three events occurring at Anderson\u2019s trial, which assertedly require reversal of his conviction. One was a reference by a Government witness to an act of bribery attempted by Anderson some years prior to trial. Another was the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give to the jury two instructions requested by Anderson\u2019s counsel. The third was an unsuccessful challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support Anderson\u2019s conviction of bribery. We find none of these contentions a basis for upsetting the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">A. <em>The Bribery Reference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">John Sullivan testified that when Brewster\u2019s January, 1966, visitor said that she could get campaign funds from Anderson, Brewster suggested that Anderson contact Sullivan in that regard. Somewhat surprised by Brewster\u2019s reply, Sullivan continued, after the visitor\u2019s departure he inquired of Brewster about it. Sullivan then testified that Brewster responded, \u201cI know Cy Anderson and back when I was a Congressman he tried to bribe me and I threw him out of my office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">On objection by Spiegel\u2019s counsel, the trial judge immediately instructed the jury to limit consideration of that statement to Brewster\u2019s fate alone. Anderson now contends that the statement was an impermissible hearsay reference to another crime \u2014 a reference which he could not explore by examination of Brewster,<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> and which the judge\u2019s limiting instruction could not completely meet. We do not find in these arguments a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">As we have had past occasion to admonish, \u201cevidence indicating the accused\u2019s commission of an offense not on trial, because of its potential for prejudice, is generally to be excluded.\u201d <footnotemark>115</footnotemark> We have consistently recognized, however, that this rule is subject to exceptions <footnotemark>116</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>which may come into operation when the probative value of the evidence outweighs its potentially harmful effect.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> A situation possibly justifying invocation of an exception arises when other-crimes evidence tends to prove an intent which is an essential element of the offense on trial.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> Proof of the offense of bribery involves proof, among other things, of corrupt intent to influence or be influenced in official conduct.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> The statement in question tended to show Brewster\u2019s prior knowledge of Anderson and Brewster\u2019s state of mind in accepting money from Anderson. So, upon a balance of that value against possible injury, the trial judge might properly have admitted the statement for the jury\u2019s consideration in connection with the bribery charges then pending against Brewster.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The greater concern, however, is not the admissibility of the statement against Brewster, but the effect of such admission upon Anderson, and in that regard Anderson lodges three complaints. One is that the statement, as to Anderson, was hearsay, and with that premise we readily agree. But the statement, as a purported admission by Brewster, was not hearsay as to him, and the trial judge instructed the jury to confine to Brewster alone any use it might make of the statement. Another complaint registered by Anderson is that since, at the time of admission of the statement, Brewster could not have been examined by Anderson,<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> That difficulty disappeared, however, when later in the trial Brewster took the witness stand himself and denied that he ever made the statement.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Anderson\u2019s remaining complaint is that the trial judge\u2019s limiting instruction did not give him adequate protection. We think the jury\u2019s willingness to heed instructions and its ability to keep separate the evidence against Brewster and Anderson, respectively, is amply shown by the discriminating verdicts it rendered.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">B. <em>The Requested Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">At trial, Anderson\u2019s counsel requested, and the judge refused, two instructions which assertedly were essential to the jury\u2019s understanding of the theory of his defense. One would have told the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">[i]t is not corrupt in itself to influence or to attempt to influence a Senator or other legislator, nor is it corrupt in itself for a Senator to be influenced in respect to his actions, vote or decision on legislation. It is a part of the duty of every Senator to pay heed to and consider the views of all responsible parties on any matter of legislation before him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The other request would have said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aen\">[a] lobbyist is a person who is paid for the purpose of attempting to influence the passage or defeat of legislation by the Congress of the United States. This is neither illegal nor improper. The only legal restriction on a. lobbyist is that he or she must be properly registered with the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the Senate. In this case Mr. Anderson was so registered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We think the judge properly rejected both.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We have no problem with the portion of the first request which spoke to the obligation of legislators to consider responsible views on pending legislation. But we cannot subscribe to an instruction indicating that influencing or attempting to influence a legislator in the performance of an official act cannot amount to bribery. A gift or promise of something of value with intent to exert such an influence <em>is </em>bribery;<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> the influencing is legally innocent only if unaccompanied by that factor. If Anderson\u2019s first request incorporated that qualification, it did so all too subtly,<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> and unless the qualification was clear the instruction asked for was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The second instruction Anderson sought suffers from a similar infirmity. While we do not quarrel with the accuracy as distinguished from the relevance of Anderson\u2019s general definition of a lobbyist, we encounter difficulty with the statement that \u201c[t]he only legal restriction on a lobbyist is\u201d proper registration. It may be that registration is the only precondition to lobbying, but a lobbyist is nonetheless under the same legal restrictions imposed by the bribery laws upon everybody else; in a word, that one who violates those laws is a lobbyist is no defense. Anderson\u2019s second request, like the first, could have misled the jury, and the trial judge rightly declined to give it. Certainly the profession of lobbying is honorable; just as surely influence devoid of unlawful means is innocuous, but Anderson\u2019s instructions implied much more.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We are advertent to the consideration that, as Anderson argues, an accused is entitled to instructions addressed to his theory of the case when properly requested and framed.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> But here the function of the lobbyist was thoroughly ventilated before the jury by Anderson\u2019s testimony, and the instructions the trial judge gave the jury adequately explained the requirement of corrupt intent \u2014 the element toward which Anderson directed his main defense \u2014 even to the extent of exonerating campaign contributions inspired by the recipient\u2019s general position of support on particular legislation. In this fashion the jury was informed of Anderson\u2019s occupational and operational background, and the judge\u2019s instructions furnished the jury with sufficient guidance to enable the distinction of lawful contributions from bribes. These circumstances considered, Anderson is not in position to urge that the judge should have done more.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">C. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Anderson also questions the legal sufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence to support his conviction on the three bribery charges. He contends, as he did on his motion for a new trial, that the Government failed to prove the specific intent prerequisite to a bribery conviction. He asserts that the evidence did no more than portray an active lobbyist who contributed funds for the reelection campaign of a financially hard-pressed legislator, both before and during an effort to assist him in the presentation of a position which he had long espoused publicly as well as in the legislature. Anderson also suggests that the Government showed at most ' the payment of unlawful gratuities and not bribery. We find these arguments unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Certainly, to establish one of the elements of bribery, the Government had to prove that Anderson, directly or indirect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ly, corruptly gave, offered or promised something of value to Brewster, or promised Brewster that he would give something of value to some other person or entity, with intent to influence an official act.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> We need not restate the extensive evidence introduced by the Government for that purpose \u2014 evidence we have already elaborately summarized.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> For present purposes it suffices to note Anderson\u2019s employment by Spiegel and his duty as its lobbyist to protect its vital business interest in low third-class postal rates; Anderson\u2019s contacts, financial and otherwise, with Brewster, after a rate-increase proposal became known; the $5,000 check from the Bartenders Union, sent at Anderson\u2019s request to DCCME in January, 1966, in the understanding that Brewster would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d on the proposal; the $5,000 cash payment in January, 1967, during Anderson\u2019s presentation to Brewster of Spiegel\u2019s opposition to the proposal; the $4,500 cash payment in April, 1967, during a similar discussion; and the delivery in July, 1967, of Anderson\u2019s check for $5,000 with the payee blank, in lieu of the delayed Spiegel check in that amount, after Sullivan\u2019s call for another contribution. We also note that these payments were invariably associated with a communication, express or tacit, of interest in the rate-raise proposal, and in all but one instance were made from Spiegel funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is not our function to retry the case, weigh the evidence, or pass on the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> It is our duty to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence, in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the jury\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Here the evidence warranted the jury in finding, if so inclined, that Anderson, both directly and indirectly, gave Brewster monies originating from Spiegel with intent to influence Brewster\u2019s action on the postal-rate legislation. That intent could be derived from the nature of Anderson\u2019s communications with Brewster, from the professed interest of Anderson\u2019s client in Brewster\u2019s position, and from subterfuge \u2014 delivering two large cash payments \u2014 in negotiating two Spiegel checks, and in preparing Betsey Norton for the grand jury.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> We hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to enable conviction.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">V. THE POST-VERDICT EVENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">There remain for consideration two additional arguments by Anderson. One is that his conviction of bribery is fatally inconsistent with Brewster\u2019s conviction of receiving unlawful gratuities. The other is that the imposition of consecutive sentences was legally erroneous. Like Anderson\u2019s other contentions on this appeal, we find these claims unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">A. <em>The Brewster Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">While the jury found Anderson guilty of bribery, it acquitted Brewster of that offense and fixed his guilt instead at unlawful receipt of gratuities.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> Anderson claims that these verdicts are fatally inconsistent, and that reversal of his conviction is accordingly required. He argues that the Government\u2019s evidence details such a course of conduct between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Brewster and himself that no distinction between their acts or intent could rationally be drawn. He reasons that in the presence of such factual similarity the jury erred in finding that he corruptly intended to give money to Brewster to influence his official action, but that Brewster lacked a corresponding intent in the receipt of such monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We note initially that inconsistent verdicts are not self-vitiating.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Beyond that, the verdicts as to Anderson and Brewster, respectively, are not per se inconsistent. The payment and the receipt of a bribe are not interdependent offenses,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> for obviously the donor\u2019s intent may differ completely from the do-nee\u2019s. Thus the donor may be convicted of giving a bribe despite the fact that the recipient had no intention of altering his official activities, or even lacked the power to do so.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As ever so recently we recognized, these mental elements are the factors differentiating the offense of bribery from the lesser offense of unlawfully receiving gratuities.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Here, on the evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that Anderson gave Brewster monies with corrupt intent to influence his vote on the proposed rate-increase legislation, and that Brewster, though insensitive to any influence, accepted the monies with knowledge that Anderson\u2019s purpose was to reward him for his stance on such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">B. <em>The Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">The trial judge imposed separate sentences on each of the three counts upon which Anderson was convicted, and expressly directed that the terms of imprisonment and fines operate consecutively and cumulatively.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> The allegations of these counts were similar, differing only as to dates and amounts of alleged payments to Brewster. Anderson contends that at best the Government\u2019s evidence showed that his dealings with Brewster were all part and parcel of a single design \u2014 in his words, \u201cthree installments of the same transaction\u201d <footnotemark>139</footnotemark> \u2014 with the result that consecutive sentences were improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">The principles guiding our decision have been fully staked out. \u201c[T]he statutes are first examined to ascertain if they will bear interpretation as creating separate offenses. If so the court then inquires whether Congress also intended \u2018to pyramid the penalties\u2019 . . . or only to establish a different degree or type of offense.\u201d<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> The solutions to these questions \u2014 the appropriate unit of prosecution and the appropriate mode of sentencing \u2014 are first to be sought in the intention of the legislature.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the legislative history of the bribery statute under which Anderson was convicted requires an affirmative answer to each of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The statute was enacted in 1962,<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> and in it Congress consolidated former bribery and unlawful-gratuity laws into one.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Concomitantly, in companion statutes, Congress extensively regulated payments to public officers and conflicts of interest.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> The congressional objective was broad,<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> hardly less comprehensive than that inspiring fore-running legislation.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Very significantly, Congress specifically noted that enactment of the consolidated statute was not designed to narrow judicial interpretations of earlier bribery statutes, but rather to assure that the scope of those interpretations would be accorded universal application.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> Under prior bribery laws consecutive sentences for payments individually made for the single purpose of influencing the same person had been upheld.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">We think the same treatment is a permissible alternative under the present statute. Congress has decided that bribery and kindred practices imperil the very nature of democratic government. It has legislated a vigorous attack on those practices. The only intention we can reasonably ascribe to Congress is that bribers may be punished separately for separate acts of bribery.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> We note, too, that courts construing other bribery laws have discarded the \u201cinstallment\u201d theory of bribery<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> in favor of the view that each bribe warrants a separate penalty.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> We are persuaded to the same action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">And so we conclude our review. Upon careful consideration of Anderson\u2019s contentions in light of the record, we have found no error. For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of his conviction has been affirmed.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\">.

Brewster stated that, as a yet unannounced candidate, he could not accept campaign contributions. The visitor told him that \u201cthat is no problem,\u201d and suggested that he seek advice as to organization of a committee in the District of Columbia \u201cwhere you can put the money.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\">. That suggestion foreran one of the problems presented on appeal, which we discuss in Part IV(A), <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">. Additional details regarding the check were supplied by other testimony. Anderson, the Bartenders Union\u2019s legislative representative in Washington, asked the union to contribute the $5,000, stating that Brewster was interested in the committee and that the money would be devoted to education and voter registration in Maryland. Anderson gave instructions as to the amount of the check, the payee, and to whom it should be sent. There had been no prior dealings between Brewster arid the union, but Anderson had been instrumental in securing passage of legislation favored by the union and for that reason it felt that Anderson\u2019s request should be honored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b375-16\">. The organization known as DCCME was nonexistent when the check arrived, but shortly thereafter Brewster decided to animate it as a District of Columbia campaign organization not, at that time, required to report campaign contributions. Sullivan was made president of DCCME and a political supporter of Brewster became its treasurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b375-17\">. This transaction was the subject of one of the five bribery counts against Anderson, but the count was later dismissed for the stated reason that Spiegel had no connection with it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b375-18\">. See note 5, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b375-19\">. This transaction was the subject of one of the counts on which Anderson was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b375-20\">. Anderson asked Ms. Norton to cash the check for him, and instructed her to endorse the check \u201cB. A. Shipley,\u201d her maiden name, as secretary-treasurer of DCCME. Ms. Norton did that and brought to Anderson the $13,500 in cash.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. No connection between Morris Spiegel and the Spiegel Company is ascertainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">. This transaction was the subject of another count on which Anderson was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. Somewhat later, Anderson received a $5,000 check from Spiegel payable to the \u201cCommittee for Maryland Progress,\u201d a nonexistent organization. Pointing out to Betsey Norton that the check should have been made out to DCCME, and explaining that he had already given his own check to DCCME, Anderson arranged for her to cash the Spiegel check for him. She did so, signing her name as \u201cShipley,\u201d and delivered the cash to Anderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">. This transaction furnished the basis for the third count on which Anderson was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\">. This was the witness\u2019 name at the time of trial. Until her remarriage in September, 1967, her surname, by virtue of an earlier marriage, was Fidler. Shipley was her maiden name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\">. Two days before the commencement of trial the prosecutor learned, for the first time, that Ms. Norton knew a great deal more about payments by Anderson and Spiegel than she had previously disclosed in testimony before the grand jury. This the prosecutor promptly made known to defense counsel and the court. In order that Ms. Norton\u2019s testimony might be compelled, she was granted immunity from prosecution, but thereafter she nonetheless moved to quash the subpoena outstanding for her attendance as a witness. The trial judge, after full hearing, found that the prosecutor had committed no impropriety in obtaining additional information from her, and ruled that her testimony would be admitted. But though sheathed with immunity, Ms. Norton was still recalcitrant; on direct examination, she suddenly announced that she would not testify further. An admonition by the judge out of the jury\u2019s presence did not help, and the judge finally adjudged her in contempt. After overnight incarceration and consultation with her attorney, Ms. Norton recanted and, over objection by the defense, was permitted to resume her testimony. She later explained to the jury that she had been motivated by a desire to protect Anderson, who had always treated her well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b376-17\">.

In an effort to impeach Ms. Norton in this regard the defense exposed her grand jury testimony that Anderson and Criswell told her to cash the $13,500 check and deliver the proceeds to either or both of them.

The contribution was made in cash, Anderson testified, conformably with long standing Capitol Hill custom. Brewster\u2019s testimony acknowledges receipt of $4,500 of the money, and suggested that the contribution was a personal one and that there was no ongoing discussion of postal legislation when the money was handed to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">.

Criswell\u2019s testimony tended to support Anderson in this regard, though Criswell admitted that he had told the grand jury that Anderson raised about $40,000 in 1966-67. Anderson stated that his grand jury testimony that Criswell received the $13,500 check was a product of confusion on his part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">. Anderson said that during 1967 he knew Ms. Norton only as Betsey Fidler, and was unaware of her maiden name \u201cShipley.\u201d See note 26, <em>supra. </em>Anderson was contradicted by three Spiegel checks for campaign committees with which Brewster had no connection, which bore Ms. Norton\u2019s endorsement in the name \u201cShipley.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b378-15\">.

One prong of Anderson\u2019s attack was an allegedly false claim by Betsey Norton that she was pregnant with his child. Anderson stated that the claim was made shortly after her remarriage in 1967 and that thereupon he executed a written acknowledgement of paternity incorporating a guaranty of the child\u2019s support. In this respect Anderson was corroborated by two other witnesses. Four months later, Anderson said, Ms. Norton told him that she had miscarried and he gave her all copies of the acknowledgement, retaining no documentation for himself. At trial, Ms. Norton steadfastly denied any sexual intimacy with Anderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b378-19\">.
