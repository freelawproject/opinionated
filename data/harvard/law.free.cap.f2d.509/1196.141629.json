Ms. Buhr had been a nontenured teacher for seven years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and each year her employment contract had been presented to the school board for renewal. In March, 1973, the school board notified her of its contemplated nonrenewal of her contract. This notification contained no reasons for the proposed discharge but indicated, as required by state law, that she could appear at a meeting of the board to discuss the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She alleges that, at that closed meeting with the board, she was informed that the reasons for the contemplated action were the charges by certain persons that \u201cshe was the cause of certain emotional and nervous stress and tension on the part of some of the students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-16\">Nine days later, Ms. Buhr was notified by letter that the school board had reached a decision not to renew her contract. She thereupon filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>alleging violations of her Fourteenth Amendment rights to both procedural and substantive due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant school district and school officials moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, which was granted by the Honorable Paul Benson, whose supporting memorandum of decision appears at 364 F.Supp. 1225 (D.N.D. 1973). We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">1. <em>Procedural Due Process Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">The pivotal cases in the resolution of Ms. Buhr\u2019s procedural due process claims are Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) [hereinafter <em>Roth], </em>and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) [hereinafter <em>Sindermann]. </em>Equally significant are the Supreme Court\u2019s recent statements in Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (opinion of Rehnquist, J., in which Burger, C. J., and Stewart, J., joined).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Under <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sindermann, </em>a state or public school teacher who is not formally tenured is entitled to procedural due process of law upon termination <em>only if </em>that termination deprives the teacher of an interest in liberty or an interest in property. Deprivation of an interest in liberty occurs where nonretention of the teacher imposes upon him a stigma or other disability foreclosing his future employment opportunities or resulting in significant damage to his standing and associations in the community. Adequate notice of the reasons for nonretention and an opportunity to rebut those charges are required under such circumstances. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701. Procedural due process is likewise required where the teacher whose dismissal is being contemplated, while not formally tenured, has held his job pursuant to a de facto tenure policy under which he had a legitimate claim to continued employment and thus a \u201cproperty interest\u201d therein. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 576-578, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>Sindermann, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 599-603, 92 S.Ct. 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">Invoking this analytical framework, Ms. Buhr first contends that her nonrenewal for the reasons cited at the executive meeting of the school board deprived her of an interest in liberty by foreclosing future employment opportunities in her chosen profession. She argues that being named as the cause of certain students\u2019 nervous tensions not only imposed a stigma on her professional record but also injured her standing in the small community in which she lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">We cannot accept this argument under the factual circumstances of this particular case. Clearly, nonrenewal standing alone does not constitute the deprivation of an interest in liberty. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 574 n. 13, 92 S.Ct. 2701; Arnett v. Kennedy, <em>supra, </em>416 U.S. at 157, 94 S.Ct. 1633; Calvin v. Rupp, 471 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1973). On the other hand, where reasons for nonrenewal are announced publicly or are incorporated into a record made available to prospective employers, such reasons may indeed affect the dischargee\u2019s chances of securing another job. <em>See </em>Wellner v. Minnesota State Junior College Board, 487 F.2d 153 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>cf. </em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971). In the instant case, the reasons for nonrenewal were never publicized. Ms. Buhr was confidentially informed of the reasons only upon her request and then only at a closed meeting of the school board. The confidential nature of these charges was respected even during the trial court proceedings, and we note that Judge Benson made no explicit reference thereto in his summary judgment order and memorandum. <em>See </em>364 F.Supp. at 1228 n. 1. We fail to discover any suggestion in the undisputed facts contained in the record that the defendants prejudiced Ms. Buhr\u2019s ability to secure another teaching position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Nor can we accept Ms. Buhr\u2019s contention that she was entitled to procedural due process as a result of her \u201cproperty interest\u201d in continued employment. <em>See Roth, supra; Sindermann, </em>supra. North Dakota teachers do not work under any formal tenure system. Dathe v. Wildrose School District No. 91, 217 N.W.2d 781 (N.D.1974); Hennessy v. Grand Forks School District No. 1, 206 N.W.2d 876 (N.D.1973). Appellant concedes this point but argues that the state affords its teachers continuous job security through statutory provisions recognizing \u201cthe need to * * * retain qualified teachers\u201d, N.D.C.C. \u00a7 15-47-38(1) (1971), and guaranteeing automatic renewal of each teacher\u2019s yearly contract absent affirmative action by the school board, N.D.C.C. \u00a7 15-47-27 (1971). Yet it is clear that those same statutory provisions, which outline the procedures for terminating a teacher\u2019s employment, do not provide for full-dress procedural due process. Dathe v. Wildrose School District No. 91, <em>supra; </em>Hennessy v. Grand Forks School District No. 1, <em>supra. </em>Where, as here, the only \u201cgrant of a substantive right [to continued employment] is inextricably intertwined with the limitations on the procedures which are to be employed in determining that right, a litigant [challenging the termination of employment] must take the bitter with the sweet.\u201d Arnett v. Kennedy, <em>supra, </em>416 U.S. at 153-154, 94 S.Ct. at 1644. Because Ms. Buhr\u2019s only \u201cproperty interest\u201d in re-employment \u201cwas itself conditioned by the procedural limitations which had accompanied the grant of that interest,\u201d 416 U.S. at 155, 94 S.Ct. at 1645, there is no merit to her claimed right to full procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">2. <em>Substantive Due Process Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Ms. Buhr\u2019s final contention, separate and apart from her procedural due process claims, is that she was denied substantive due process of law because the reasons cited by the school board for her nonretention were totally unsupported by factual evidence. For purposes of review, \u201c[w]e look at the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to * * * the party opposing the motion,\u201d Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 491, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962), and \u201cthe inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in [the record] must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,\u201d United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962). Assuming, therefore, for purposes of this appeal, that the reasons for Ms. Buhr\u2019s nonretention did indeed lack factual support, we proceed to an analysis of her constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">\u201cThe claim that a person is entitled to \u2018substantive due process\u2019 means * * * that state action which depriyes him of life, liberty, or property must have a rational basis \u2014 that is to say, the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as \u2018arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1, 3-4 (7th Cir. 1974). The concept of substantive due process, so defined, has had a long and tortuous history in the federal courts. As was observed in North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy v. Snyder\u2019s Drug Stores, Inc., 414 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 407, 38 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973), the United States Supreme Court once expressly espoused the concept and actively employed it to strike down state action \u201cwhich a majority of the Court deemed unwise,\u201d 414 U.S. at 164, 94 S.Ct. at 412. <em>See, e. g., </em>Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 35 S.Ct. 240, 59 L.Ed. 441 (1915); Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 277, 52 L.Ed. 436 (1908); Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905). Although analysis of recent opinions has led some commentators to conclude that substantive due process still plays a significant, albeit tacit, role in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, <em>see </em>Tribe, Foreword: Toward a Model of Roles in the Due Process of Life and Law, 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1 (1973); Epstein, Substantive Due Process by Any Other Name: The Abortion Cases, 1973 Sup.Ct.Rev. 159; <em>cf. </em>Note, The Irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>buttable Presumption Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1534 (1974), the Court itself has expressly repudiated the use of substantive due process as a vehicle for intervening in choices properly left within the discretion of state officials. <em>E. g., </em>North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy v. Snyder\u2019s Drug Stores, Inc., supra; Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963); cf. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 53-55, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Within the Eighth Circuit substantive due process claims have spawned two distinct views expressed in our opinions. The first would condition the right to federal judicial review of allegedly arbitrary state action upon a showing that a specific constitutional right has been infringed, such as deprivation of freedom of speech, racial discrimination or denial of procedural due process rights where liberty or property interests are at stake.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other line of cases seems to suggest that substantive due process is a specific constitutional right in itself, cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and violated whenever a state acts to the detriment of an individual in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>Having carefully considered both lines of cases within this Circuit, as well as authorities from other jurisdictions, we conclude that under the facts of this case Ms. Buhr is not entitled to relief. Of primary importance is the fact that Ms. Buhr had no right to <em>procedural </em>due process. Since North Dakota law provides only that she be told the reasons for her termination but does not entitle her to a full-dress hearing in order to rebut those \u201ccharges,\u201d we could scarcely overturn the school board\u2019s decision on insufficiency of the evidence grounds. Indeed, although North Dakota law gave her the right to learn the reasons for her nonretention, <em>see supra, </em>her employment could have been terminated for no reason at all without offending the Constitution. <em>Roth, supra; </em>Frazier v. Curators of the University of Missouri, 495 F.2d 1149 (8th Cir. 1974); Scheelhaase v. Woodbury Central Community School District, 488 F.2d 237 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 3173, 41 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1974); Freeman v. Gould Special School District, 405 F.2d 1153 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 843, 90 S.Ct. 61, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969). Without wishing to encourage school boards to retreat behind a veil of silence in such situations, we must conclude that where a teacher can constitutionally be dismissed for no reason, he or she can be dismissed for reasons unsupported by factual evidence. In other words, to the extent that our cases recognize a constitutional right to <em>substantive </em>due process, that right, as expressed by the Seventh Circuit, \u201cis no greater than the right to procedural due process.\u201d Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, <em>supra, </em>492 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">In a well-reasoned opinion by Judge Stevens, the Seventh Circuit analyzed the claim of an untenured elementary school teacher in Indiana that the reasons for her discharge, as given, were illogical or untrue and that the final decision itself was illogical and lacking in reason. The court observed that, as an untenured teacher with no claim of a constitutionally protected \u201cproperty interest\u201d or any impairment of her \u201cliberty,\u201d she had no constitutional right to a fair hearing or to a statement of the reasons for her discharge. Thus, the fact that the school board voluntarily communicated such information to her was \u201cnot in itself sufficient to create a federal right that does not otherwise exist.\u201d 492 F.2d at 3. The court then rejected the argument that the discharge was impermissibly arbitrary and capricious, holding that the absence of either a property or liberty interest was as fatal to the substantive as it was to the procedural due process claim. Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">We adopt the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit, and on this basis our post-Roth and <em>Sindermann </em>cases supporting a right to federal judicial review of school board actions which are arbitrary and capricious, note 5 <em>supra, </em>can readily be reconciled with the main line of our decisions, note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">In Strickland v. Inlow, 485 F.2d 186 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 416 U.S. 935, 94 S.Ct. 1932, 40 L.Ed.2d 285 (1974), we held that a group of Arkansas students had been denied substantive due process when they were suspended from school for \u201cspiking the punch\u201d under a regulation which prohibited the \u201cuse of intoxicating beverages or possession of same [at school] or at a school sponsored activity.\u201d Thus, while in <em>Strickland </em>we did not expressly determine whether the requirement of procedural due process had been satisfied, we first held that the students were entitled to procedural due process under our interpretation of the school regulation before passing on to a consideration of their substantive due process rights. We then held that the absence of any evidence that the beverage was \u201cintoxicating\u201d made the suspension a denial of substantive due process. However, we have never held lack of any evidence (substance of due process) to be grounds for reversing the action of a state agency when the right to a procedural due process hearing was not first shown to exist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>In Fisher v. Snyder, 476 F.2d 375 (8th Cir. 1973), the complaining teacher had in fact been given a hearing required by Nebraska law. The grounds for discharge, that her behavior displayed \u201ca strong potential of sexual misconduct,\u201d were shown to be nothing more than \u201csubtle implication and innuendo.\u201d 476 F.2d at 377. This reasoning is consistent with those cases requiring procedural due process as a result of the \u201cstigma\u201d imposed on an individual as the result of government or agency action. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701; Wisconsin v. Constantineau, <em>supra. See also </em>Wellner v. Minnesota State Junior College Board, <em>supra. Fisher </em>should not be considered authority in this Circuit, however, for the assertion of substantive due process claims where procedural due process rights would not first be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">We think this analysis provides a rational view of our holdings in public school due process cases decided after the Supreme Court\u2019s definitive rulings in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sindermann.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where procedural due process is required, the state agency must pay attention to the evidence adduced and act rationally upon it. On the other hand, we will not inquire into such claims unless a right to procedural due process has first been demonstrated or there has been identified to us some other federally protected right warranting our intervention in school board affairs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Since an evidentiary hearing was not required as a part of the decision-making process, it follows that unpublished reasons for termination, given to Ms. Buhr in confidence, need not be supported by any evidence. No independent federally protected right has been disclosed. A claim of -total insufficiency of evidence, disembodied and cast adrift from procedural due process rights, is not a claim to be addressed in federal court. <em>See </em>Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Adt\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">ORDER ON PETITIONER\u2019S PETITION FOR REHEARING AND SUGGESTION OF REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">We wish to make clear that our holding in this case is bottomed upon our express conclusion that Ms. Buhr possessed neither an interest in liberty nor <em>in property </em>which entitled her to procedural due process. Our quotation from Justice Rehnquist\u2019s plurality opinion in Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), was not intended to intimate that we thought there was any grant by the legislature of a property interest under state law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-13\">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abi\"><em>See </em>Cusumano v. Ratchford, 507 F.2d 980 (8th Cir. 1974).

Appellant concedes this point but argues that the state affords its teachers continuous job security through statutory provisions recognizing \u201cthe need to * * * retain qualified teachers,\u201d N.D.C.C. \u00a7 15\u2014 47 \u2014 38(1) (1971), and guaranteeing automatic renewal of each teacher\u2019s yearly contract absent affirmative action by the school board, N.D.C.C. \u00a7 15-47-27 (1971). The Supreme Court of North Dakota, however, has squarely held that the state statutes do not confer \u201cproperty interests\u201d to public school teachers. Dathe v. Wildrose School District No. 91, <em>supra, </em>217 N.W.2d at 786-87; Hennessy v.

We stated in <em>Strickland </em>that due process was required as a result of the severity of the penalty imposed. 485 F.2d at 190. Further, the regulation authorized suspension of stu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>dents who were \u201cfound to be guilty\u201d of the offense in question, thus intimating some form of evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">. Recent cases arising in other contexts are consistent with this approach. In Wright v. Arkansas Activities Association, 501 F.2d 25 (8th Cir. 1974), plaintiff challenged under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 a disciplinary ruling of the defendant association. As our opinion in that case makes clear, the defendant\u2019s interference with plaintiff\u2019s coaching contract with a local school district (a \u201cproperty interest\u201d) was sufficient to support our consideration of both substantive and procedural due process claims. And in Wilwording v. Swenson, 502 F.2d 844 (1974), wherein we remanded for an evidentiary hearing an inmate\u2019s claim of denial of substantive and procedural due process in a prison\u2019s disciplinary action, an adequate interest in liberty was at stake to support such review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AYd\">. The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the termination was for an impermissible reason. <em>See </em>Calvin v. Rupp, 471 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1973); Wilson v.
