All offenses were committed on June 15, 1971. The principal issues argued on appeal question the admissibility of two items of evidence: First, a wallet belonging to one Wooley, the hold-up man in the robbery, which was found and seized in a warrantless search of appellant\u2019s automobile. Second, evidence admitted on cross-examination that appellant had entered a plea of guilty to a violation of the narcotics laws on which a judgment had not yet been entered against him. As the Government now concedes, the conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon upon the motel clerk must be vacated because it is a lesser included offense of the armed robbery of the same person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm, the remaining convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">Evidence at trial proved that appellant was a dealer in narcotics. Appellant\u2019s alleged accomplice, one Wooley, was a veteran who had become addicted to narcotics while serving in Vietnam. He returned to the United States in April of 1971 and shortly thereafter began purchasing narcotics from appellant on a regular basis. He spent his entire savings of $3700, ran up a substantial debt to appellant and on June 14, 1971, asked appellant to sell him more narcotics on credit. Appellant refused to extend any further credit but suggested that Wooley could make some money by joining him in a robbery of a motel he had \u201clined up\u201d with the motel attendant. Wooley was desperate for narcotics and agreed to the plan. Appellant than gave Wooley a gun and a small amount of heroin to ease his craving and drove him to the motel at about 2 A.M. on June 15, 1971. Before he entered the motel, Wooley, at appellant\u2019s suggestion, left his wallet in the car to avoid losing it during the robbery. Appellant, who had a gun on his person, parked the car down the block and returned to a prearranged location in some bushes \u201cin front of the motel\u201d to \u201ccover\u201d Wooley\u2019s \u201cback\u201d from the outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">Wooley then entered the motel office, held up the attendant, Harry Loss, and fled with a bag of money. As he went out the front door, he almost collided with a police car which was pulling into the driveway. At that time he heard a shot, threw away his gun and ran. He crossed some bushes and passed appellant who was standing below a wall (all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>shown on Exhibit 3). Appellant told him to run in the street, but shortly thereafter Wooley fell on the pavement and was arrested by the officer who had pursued him from the motel. As Wooley fell, he dropped the bag of money which the police officer apparently did not notice. After Wooley had been taken back to the motel, a red and white late model Cadillac with Maryland license plates pulled out from behind a truck at the curb (about where appellant had parked his car), drove up the street, stopped where Wooley had dropped the money bag, removed something from the bag and then drove off.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon returning to the patrol car, the officer discovered that the right front window had been shattered. Wooley's gun was later recovered and tests showed it had not been fired. Appellant\u2019s gun was never found and the spent bullet could not be located in the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">After his arrest Wooley told the police the nickname of his accomplice, described him, recounted what he knew about where the accomplice lived,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and gave a description of the car. About 3 or 4 A.M. the <em>next </em>morning (June 16th), the police found a car which matched the description they had been given of the car used by the accomplice. It was then parked in a Safeway parking lot about one hundred yards away from 238 Rhode Island Avenue, N.W., where the police expected to find appellant. Appellant was arrested shortly thereafter at that address and was informed that the police considered his car to be evidence in a robbery. At their request he gave them the keys to the car. The police then \u201cwent to the car, opened up the trunk, made a quick search, . . . just a check mainly for weapons . We didn\u2019t see anything. We took it to the station. At the station house, we went to the car again, this time [the two policemen] went to the car and a wallet was found\u201d (Tr. 102). This wallet was later identified as belonging to Wooley. No warrant to search the car was ever obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">At his trial appellant admitted his narcotics activities and some narcotics dealings with Wooley, but he denied any involvement in the motel robbery and further relied upon an uncorroborated alibi that he was at \u201cSnooks\u201d gambling establishment at the time of the robbery. He claimed that the wallet must have fallen from Wooley\u2019s pocket when he and Wooley had an argument the evening of June 14th after Wooley had demanded that appellant sell him narcotics on credit. So to this extent he corroborated his relationship with Wooley. The Government was permitted to impeach appellant by introducing a prior conviction and his prior guilty <em>plea </em>on an unrelated narcotics offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Appellant was sentenced on July 14, 1972, and appealed (Case No. 72-1782). This appeal was later held in abeyance at the request of the Government to allow a determination as to whether the admission into evidence of the prior guilty plea violated an alleged bargain that the Government had made in return for that plea in the earlier unrelated narcotics case. Appellant subsequently made a motion for a new trial, terming the alleged plea bargain newly discovered evidence. Following a hearing, this motion was denied on the ground that no plea bargain had been made. Appellant also appeals from this decision (Case No. 74-1305).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that Wooley\u2019s wallet was obtained in an unconstitutional search of his car and that the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion to suppress such evidence. Basically his claim is that the police did not have probable cause for the search and that the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>at the station house which turned up the wallet required a search warrant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In our view appellant\u2019s arguments are authoritatively answered in the negative by the decision in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). In that case, the appellant was apprehended less than an hour after an armed robbery of a filling station and within two miles of the scene of the crime in the company of three other men in a blue compact station wagon which met the description of the robbers\u2019 getaway car. Following the arrest of the occupants, the car was driven to the police station where it was thoroughly searched. The police found two revolvers, certain cards belonging to one of the filling station attendants who had been robbed and other objects which had been taken in the robbery. The Court ruled that probable cause existed to justify the arrest without a warrant, but it noted that the search at the police station could hardly be said to have been made incident to the arrest. It held, however, that there was probable cause to search the car for guns and stolen money and that autos may be searched without a warrant under circumstances that would not justify a similar search of a house. The difference is justified by circumstances</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">399 U.S. at 48, 90 S.Ct. at 1979, citing Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 153, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925). The validity of the search of the car thus depended not upon being incident to the arrest but upon the officer having reasonable cause to believe that \u201cthe contents of the automobile offend against the law.\u201d 399 U.S. at 49, 90 S.Ct. at 1980. The Court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\n<em>Only in exigent circumstances will the judgment of the police as to probable cause serve as a sufficient authorization for a search.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 51, 90 S.Ct. at 1981 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">For constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant. Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">On the facts before us, the blue station wagon could have been searched on the spot when it was stopped since there was probable cause to search and it was a fleeting target for a search. <em>The probable-cause factor still obtained at the station house and so did the mobility of the car unless the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless seizure of the car and the denial of its use to anyone until a warrant is secured. In that event there is little to choose in terms of practical consequences between an immediate search without a warrant and the car\u2019s immobilization until a warrant is obtained.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abe\"><em>Id. </em>at 52, 90 S.Ct. at 1981 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">We find the holding and reasoning of Chambers v. Maroney, <em>supra, </em>to be controlling here. Probable cause existed for the seizure of appellant\u2019s car. It fitted the description given by Wooley and another witness. It was found in the vicinity of a suspect meeting the description given by an accomplice (Wooley). The suspect voluntarily surrendered his keys to the police, and it was evident that they fit the car. This tied the car to the evidence that a car of that description had been driven by Lee to transport Wooley to the scene of the robbery. It was not unreasonable to expect that evidence of the fruits of the crime would still be in a car used in that crime 24 hours after the offense. It cannot be assumed that those participating in the crime would certainly destroy such evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>dence since those who violate our criminal laws do not always act intelligently and often leave incriminating trails.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Nothing more was necessary to justify seizing the car at the scene of the arrest, but appellant argues that \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d were not sufficiently present to justify the search at the station house without a warrant. It seems clear that the police would have been justified in conducting a thorough search of the car on the parking lot since to do otherwise would hazard the loss of a valuable piece of potential evidence. The car was a \u201cfleeting object\u201d found in what might be termed a possibly hostile neighborhood. The police could not know whether appellant had additional accomplices or friends who might have viewed his arrest and might attempt to remove or destroy any incriminating evidence left in the car or wipe off any fingerprints (Wooley\u2019s, if they existed) if the car was not seized. There was also a possibility that incriminating fingerprints may have been obliterated by the elements if the car was left in the lot. In Chambers v. Maroney, the Court could see no difference between seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and carrying out an immediate warrantless search of the car, where exigent circumstances exist. We find that such circumstances existed in the present case as well. Therefore, either action would have been clearly reasonable, and this is the constitutional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We further find, as did the Court in <em>Chambers, </em>that the probable-cause factor still existed at the station house, so the conduct of a search there without a warrant was also reasonable. A quick glance into the trunk and the rest of the car was certainly desirable as a merely precautionary matter before the car was moved, but it was difficult to make a more detailed search of the car where it was found on the parking lot. It was nighttime and poor visibility would interfere with the search. Moreover, any search would necessarily include a fingerprint check of the car and that could be done better at the station house. It was impracticable to obtain a search warrant since it would be some hours before a magistrate would be available. The policemen who had made the arrest and seized the car would probably be going off duty, and it was desirable that they continue their investigation without interruption since they had considerable knowledge of the background facts and knew what evidence might be material. Also, every hour that the search was delayed increased the hazard that something would happen to any material evidence that did exist. For example, incriminating articles could be taken or fingerprints could disappear.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Delay also could affect the value of any evidence that was obtained. Twenty-four hours had already passed since the robbery, and any further delay in the discovery of material evidence could weaken its probative value with the jury. With a longer delay, the defense might more successfully argue to the jury and the court that evidence obtained from the car had resulted from acts that occurred after the robbery and acts by other persons. In addition, appellant was being held under arrest on the basis of a statement by an alleged accomplice. Since this type of evidence is traditionally suspect and needs corroboration, the police had a duty to act as quickly as possible to obtain evidence that might exonerate or incriminate. Thus, we find the existence of sufficient exigent circumstances to justify a thorough search at the station house. Coolidge v. New Hampshire<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and United States v. Collins<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are clearly distinguishable on their facts since neither case presented facts justifying a conclusion that exigent circumstances existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\"> Appellant also contends that reversible error was committed when he was impeached on cross-examination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>admission of evidence of his prior guilty <em>plea </em>in a narcotics case and by the court\u2019s failure to give an immediate cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The statute in the District of Columbia authorizes attacking the credibility of witnesses by the admission of prior <em>convictions.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Under our decisions this obviously requires a \u201cconviction,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>a judgment of conviction and sentence, and a mere plea of guilty is insufficient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The admission of the plea was thus error, but the facts here are such as to cause us to conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Throughout the trial there were many other references to appellant\u2019s involvement with narcotics. <em>In his own testimony </em>appellant stated that he had met Wooley through \u201cother\u201d narcotics dealers and that the only thing the two had in common was \u201cdiscussions of narcotics.\u201d He also testified that the only reason he told Wooley on June 14th that he did not have any narcotics was that Wooley had told him \u201che didn\u2019t have any money.\u201d Testimony as to the guilty plea was thus largely cumulative to this testimony which appellant himself introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">Appellant at trial also consented to the admission of the <em>plea </em>on the \u201cnarcotics charge.\u201d During the discussion between appellant and the court regarding the admission of prior convictions, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-17\">THE DEFENDANT: The only objection I would have is the robbery conviction, he could bring up what we were just speaking of, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-18\">THE COURT: The narcotics charge, the <em>plea </em>to the telephone count [use of telephone in narcotics transactions]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-19\">THE DEFENDANT: <em>Yes, sir. He could do that, Your Honor. I would </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>have no objection to that. </em>He could even speak of the gun charge that I was sentenced to a year on, which I have done ten months and five days of that at Lorton. I don\u2019t think there is anything else he can bring up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Tr. 131 (emphasis added). Because appellant had consented to the introduction of the guilty plea \u2014 in fact he had suggested it \u2014 and because he did not object when the plea was introduced, we do not consider that the point is available to appellant on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Appellant\u2019s status as a dealer in narcotics was relevant and competent to prove part of the offense upon which he was being tried.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Evidence of his other narcotics dealing was an appropriate means in this case of establishing the Government\u2019s theory that appellant had induced Wooley to commit the robbery in order, to obtain additional narcotics and to pay for narcotics that he had previously purchased from appellant on credit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">It has been repeatedly held that the rule [requiring the exclusion of evidence of other offenses] will not be given application to exclude evidence which may incidentally show arrest, incarceration or conviction for some other offense, but which has relevancy and competency otherwise, and which the trial court responsibly deems a necessary or not inappropriate means in a particular situation in establishing some material fact or aspect of the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Bram v. United States, 226 F.2d 858, 863 (8th Cir. 1955), citing Hardy v. United States, 199 F.2d 704, 707 (8th Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">The fact that appellant had <em>contemporaneously </em>entered a plea of guilty to other narcotics dealings was also corroborative of Wooley\u2019s testimony that appellant had sold him narcotics and thus tended to prove a part of the offense. We merely cite the admissibility of this evidence for this purpose to support our conclusion of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Appellant also contends that the case should be reversed because the trial court failed to give an instruction cautioning the jury that the guilty plea was admitted solely for the limited purpose of attacking the credibility of appellant. We do not believe this to be a case that necessarily calls for applying our admonition in United States v. McClain<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that an \u201cimmediate cautioning instruction\u201d is required. The factors we have heretofore cited indicate that this evidence was not highly prejudicial to appellant. Moreover, appellant did not request such instruction notwithstanding that the court had earlier asked counsel to remind him to give a cautionary instruction when evidence was admitted concerning the narcotics dealings between Wooley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and appellant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, in its instructions to the jury the court did give a very fair charge with respect to the use of the prior conviction and the evidence concerning appellant\u2019s involvement with narcotics.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">For all these reasons we refuse to find that any of the arguments urged by appellant relative to the use of the guilty plea and the evidence of his narcotics activities amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The appeal also attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support the guilty verdict against appellant on the charge of assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon. On this charge the testimony established that appellant was present at the scene of the robbery, that he was standing outside the front entrance of the motel near some bushes and a little below a wall (Tr. 42, 49, Exhibit 3), that he had told Wooley he was going to \u201ccover\u201d his back (Tr. 42), that appellant was in possession of a gun at the time (Tr. 42), that a shot was heard (Tr. 44, 45, 73) when the policeman was outside his car \u201cbetween the automobile and the motel\u201d (Tr. 80, 81), that Wooley saw appellant moments thereafter standing a little below the wall (Tr. 49) and that the shot had to come from the 4th Street direction (Tr. 81). Other testimony showed that the right front window of the police car was shattered (Tr. 76, Ex. 2, 7) by what looked like a bullet hole (Tr. 97, 89, Ex. 2, 7), that the car had not previously been damaged (Tr. 78) and that Wooley\u2019s gun had not been fired (Tr. 45, 94). The place where the gun was found negated any inference that it had fractured the car window when Wooley threw it away (Tr. 93). The location of appellant, the police officer, the patrol car and the other objects as marked on the sketch of the area (Ex. 3), when collated with the testimony as to the timing of the shot and the pictures of the shattered car window, indicate that a shot fired from the area near 4th Street where appellant was located and striking the window on the police car would have been aimed in the general direction where Police Officer Hawkins was standing at the time the shot was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">There was thus evidence from which a jury could conclude that a shot had been fired at the police officer from the general area where appellant was standing and that appellant had fired that shot. This conclusion is also consistent with his previously declared intention to \u201ccover\u201d Wooley\u2019s back during the robbery. His possession of the .45 caliber Army gun at the time gave him the means to accomplish what he stated to be his intent and what he was charged with doing, <em>i. e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>assaulting a police officer while armed with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We view the foregoing facts as being more than adequate to support the jury\u2019s verdict that appellant was guilty of assaulting a police officer while armed with a dangerous weapon; even if reasonable minds might differ as to the guilt of the accused, the decision would still be for the trier of facts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The factual findings of the trial court on the motion for a new trial are supported by the evidence. The evidence does not support an allegation that the plea of guilty was used in contravention of any informal or formal agreement that was entered into with the government in connection with the prior narcotics offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the convictions for armed robbery and assault on a police officer while armed with a dangerous weapon and vacate the conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon upon Harry Loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\">.
