Because we agree with the Customs Court that the merchandise at bar is outside the purview of \u201cbraids\u201d or \u201cbraided materials\u201d as used in TSUS, we adopt the Customs Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">The following comments are occasioned by the arguments made here:</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">The legislative history found in the Tariff Classification Study, Schedule 3 (1960), establishes that the term \u201cbraids\u201d had several meanings prior to the 1963 amendment. The parties concur in the present definition of \u201cbraids\u201d as an article of \u201cmaypole construction\u201d wherein at least three lengths of material are diagonally intertwined. The merchandise before us is not of maypole construction and is not, therefore, braid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Appellant argues that Congress\u2019 use of both \u201cbraided materials\u201d and \u201cbraids\u201d requires that the terms have different meanings. Appellant further argues that the amendment to the Tariff Act deleting \u201cin part of braids\u201d and adding \u201cbraided materials\u201d was a change of language without a change of meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">That the two terms have different meanings does not aid appellant. Because the noun \u201cmaterials\u201d is modified by the adjective \u201cbraided,\u201d which in turn requires maypole construction, we conclude that \u201cbraided materials\u201d must be formed of elements which themselves have a maypole construction. Whether the tassels of the imported merchandise are so constructed would thus be immaterial. That braid is a minor component of the instant merchandise does not require classification of the merchandise as braided material. The deletion of \u201cin part of braid\u201d resulted from its difficulty in application and its tendency to cause classification of goods on the basis of unimportant components often present in insignificant amounts. We find no support in the statute or its legislative history for the propositions that the amendment was a mere language change or that braided material is to be construed as material in part of braid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Finally, we are asked to allocate the cost of printing the portion of the record ordered by appellee. We agree with appellee that the portion of the record in question constitutes essential, relevant, and pertinent testimony and conclude that the cost of printing the entire record should be borne by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
