However, by virtue of \u00a7 2 of the McGuire Act, two types of vertical agreements \u2014 those requiring a vendee to resell at prices fixed by his vendor, and those requiring the vendee to require his customers to resell only at fixed prices \u2014 are exempt from the antitrust laws if such agreements are lawful under applicable state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented by this case is whether the state law which governs the legality of the latter type of agreement between a vendor and a vendee is that of the state where the vendee is located or that of the state or states where the vendee\u2019s customers are located. We have no doubt that the vendee\u2019s location is determinative for the latter, as well as the former, type of agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">Corning Glass Works manufactures and distributes various trademarked products used in food preparation and service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Corning sells to wholesalers located in 45 states and the District of Columbia; those wholesalers, in turn, sell to retailers who resell to consumers in all 50 states and the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">Coming\u2019s form contract with its distributors contains a fair trade agreement obligating the wholesalers (a) to sell only at prices set by Corning, and (b) not to sell to any reseller unless such reseller has agreed with Corning to maintain Coming\u2019s fair trade prices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>agreements are only effective \u201cas to each state and as to such sales where it is lawful so to agree.\u201d Since the legal effect of fair trade agreements varies from state to state, the Corning form contract has a varying impact on its wholesalers.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">There are currently 14 states and Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia-in which fair trade agreements are illegal as a matter of state, as well as federal, law; they are described as \u201cfree trade\u201d states.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The remaining 36 \u201cfair trade\u201d states comprise two principal types. In each of the \u201cnon-signer\u201d states the legislature has authorized judicial enforcement of fair trade prices even against sellers who have not signed a fair trade contract and has permitted the use of customer restriction clauses; there are currently 14 such \u201cnon-signer\u201d states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the \u201csigner-only\u201d states \u2014 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>which there are currently 22 \u2014 either the courts have refused, usually on state constitutional grounds,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to enforce the statutory remedy against non-signers, or, in some instances, no remedy against non-signers has been provided by the state legislature. In either event, in such a state a fair trade agreement is lawful although it is enforceable against the \u201csigner only.\u201d With the exception of Maine, each of these \u201csigner-only\u201d states also authorizes the use of customer restriction clauses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The problem presented by this case has assumed significance as the number of \u201cfree trade\u201d and \u201csigner-only\u201d states has increased. For it principally involves the validity of Coming\u2019s customer restriction clause as applied to wholesalers in free trade states who sell to retailers in signer-only states. Does \u00a7 2 of the McGuire Act legalize Coming\u2019s attempt to require those wholesalers to refuse to sell to retailers in fair trade states who have not agreed to maintain Coming\u2019s fair trade prices?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In Count II of its five-count complaint against Corning,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commission took the position that this requirement is a non-exempt restraint of trade forbidden by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, and therefore unlawful under \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Based on a stipulated record, the Administrative Law Judge dismissed all counts of the complaint, but on appeal the Commission unanimously reversed as to Count II and issued its cease and desist order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The case is here on Coming\u2019s petition for review, claiming that the Commission misconstrued the McGuire Act and that, in all events, the Commission\u2019s order was \u201cunnecessarily punitive.\u201d We find no merit in Coming\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The decision of this case depends upon the proper construction of the words \u201csuch resale\u201d as used in the so-called \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause in paragraph (2) of \u00a7 2 of the McGuire Act. Before quoting the relevant language, it is appropriate to note that the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause was originally enacted as part of the antitrust exemption contained in the Miller-Tydings Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in 1937 and was retained verbatim when Congress broadened the vertical price-fixing exemption in 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The principal ways in which the McGuire Act broadened the exemption were (1) by including the non-signer aspects of state fair trade legislation;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) by making the exemption applicable to stipulated, as well as minimum prices;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (3) by adding an exemption for agreements requiring a vendee to limit his resales to persons who agree to maintain fair trade prices.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This last provision \u2014 the so-called \u201cvendee clause\u201d \u2014 is relevant to our problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">To facilitate our explanation of our understanding of the second paragraph of \u00a7 2 of the McGuire Act, we italicize the portions of the paragraph which were not a part of the Miller-Tydings Act, we underline the \u201cvendee clause\u201d and the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause, and we print in bold face the word \u201cresale\u201d which appears once in the phrase following the vendee clause and twice in the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">(2) Nothing contained <em>in this Act or in any of the Antitrust Acts </em>shall render unlawful any contracts or agreements prescribing minimum <em>or stipulated </em>prices, <em>or requiring a vendee to enter into contracts or agreements prescribing- minimum or stipulated prices, </em>for the resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or container of which bears, the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or distributor of such commodity and which is in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others, when contracts or agreements of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions under any statute. law, or public policy now or hereafter in effect in any State. Territory, or the District of Columbia in which such resale is to be made, or to which the commodity is to be transported for such resale. 66 Stat. 632; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">As originally enacted in the Miller-Tydings Act, it is manifest that the word \u201cresale\u201d had the same meaning each time it was used. Since the vendee clause was not then a part of the statute, the word \u201cresale\u201d consistently referred to the first resale by a vendee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>rather than to any subsequent resale by a purchaser from the vendee, for at that time the exemption covered only the terms of the minimum resale price maintenance agreement between a vendor and his immediate vendee, and made no reference to agreements restricting the vendee\u2019s right to choose his own customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We have no doubt, therefore, that if the words \u201csuch resale\u201d as used in the McGuire Act retain the same meaning as they did in the Miller-Tydings Act, the Commission is correct in its view that the legality of a customer restriction clause in an agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler is governed by the law of the state in which the wholesaler resells the trademarked article.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The question, then, is what change, if any, in the meaning of the word \u201cresale\u201d resulted from the insertion of the vendee clause in the forepart of the paragraph. Before attempting to answer this question, it is useful to note that the word \u201cresale\u201d performs two quite different functions. First, it is part of the description of the kind of agreements that are covered by the exemption, and, second, it is part of the identification of the states whose law determines whether the agreement is valid or invalid. There is no doubt about Congress\u2019 intent to modify its description of exempt agreements to include customer restriction clauses as well as price-fixing clauses. There is, however, no indication that Congress intended t,o make any change in the identity of the states whose laws would determine the availability of the exemption, or to have the law of more than one state applicable to any one agreement. We first consider the meaning of the word \u201cresale\u201d as part of the description of covered \u25a0 agreements and then as part of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">To make sense out of the vendee clause, and also to retain the significance of the price-fixing clause, it is necessary to give the word \u201cresale\u201d a double meaning in the phrase immediately following the vendee clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For, to the extent that the phrase modifies the price-fixing clause, it obviously still refers to the first resale by the immediate vendee; but to the extent that the same phrase modifies the vendee clause, it must refer to a resale by a person who has purchased from that vendee.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unless the phrase performs this dual function, either the original price-fixing exemption would have been changed or else the vendee clause would be meaningless. The word \u201cresale\u201d as first used in paragraph (2) of \u00a7 2, therefore, has a different meaning in the two contexts in which it modifies its two antecedent clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">When the same word appears in the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause, logically it might have either of the two meanings it first conveyed, or it might again convey a double meaning. As a matter of pure grammar, there is force to the argument that the word should be given a double meaning every time it is used, particularly since it is modified by the adjective \u201csuch\u201d when it is repeated in the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Under this reading, the word \u201cresale\u201d would have a double meaning every time it is used, and would make the validity of a single agreement between Corning and one of its wholesalers in a free trade state depend upon the law of at least two different states.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although, purely as a matter of literal construction, the word \u201cresale\u201d could be given a consistent double meaning, that reading is certainly not a necessary one. When it is recalled that the original phrasing of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause as it appeared in the Miller-Tydings Act used the words \u201csuch resale\u201d to refer to the first resale by the immediate vendee, it is perfectly reasonable to retain the same construction after the addition of the vendee clause. Indeed, if we were to give the word a double meaning in the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause, we would unnecessarily complicate the statute and broaden the exemption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The basic purpose of the statute was to exempt certain \u201ccontracts or agreements\u201d from the Sherman Act. The statutory language \u2014 in both the prohibitory portion of the Sherman Act and the exemptions found in the Miller-Tydings Act and the McGuire Act \u2014 focuses our attention on the agreement which is challenged.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In this case, that agreement is between a manufacturer and a wholesaler; it restricts the wholesaler\u2019s freedom to resell in two ways: first,- it establishes the prices at which he may resell and, second, it limits the persons to whom he may resell. It would be anomalous, indeed, for Congress to provide that the lawfulness of the two restrictive clauses in the same agreement should be determined by the law of two different states.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is only logical that the law of the same state should control the legality of the entire fair trade agreement and, further, that the state be the one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>which the vendee \u2014 in this case the wholesaler \u2014 is to make the resales described in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Coming\u2019s construction would allow a manufacturer to impose an otherwise illegal restraint upon a wholesaler in a free trade state because of the fair trade policies in effect in a state where some of his customers are located. Such construction would be inconsistent with the basic explanation of both the Miller-Tydings amendment and the McGuire Act as forms of \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d legislation. Thus, in 1937 Senator Tydings noted that the bill under consideration would simply enable the states \u201cto carry into effect <em>their own public policy.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The Amendment was seen as immunizing contracts in restraint of trade where such contracts were lawful under the fair trade acts of the states \u201cwhere made or where they are to be performed.\u201d S.Rep.No.257, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1937). <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep.No. 382, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1937). The focus was on the immunization of specific contracts and not on the immunization of a series of consensual transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">This underlying policy, that a contract\u2019s antitrust immunity is to be determined by looking to the law of the state where the contract is executed or to be performed, was reaffirmed in the passage of the McGuire Act. The preamble of the Act provided that its purpose was \u201cto protect the rights of States . to regulate their internal affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As Representative McGuire, sponsor of the measure, noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">This bill is merely an enabling measure. . . . If a State does not believe in price maintenance, it is not forced to tolerate the practice. In the absence of State legislation authorizing price maintenance, the Federal law remains unchanged. <em>No State need fear any encroachment on its internal affairs by neighboring States pursuing a different policy. </em>97 Cong.Rec. 13404-05 (1951) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Each state has an interest in determining whether its citizens should buy and sell subject to fair trade restraints or free of such restraints. That interest is essentially the same with respect to both types of vertical restraints authorized by the McGuire Act. As Corning recognizes,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> were it to impose a resale price restriction on resales by its Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>wholesaler, such a contract provision would violate the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Missouri is a free trade state; Missouri\u2019s public policy is not to immunize price restrictions placed on the sales of goods by Missouri merchants. It is equally clear that Missouri has not immunized customer restrictions placed on the sale of goods by Missouri merchants.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Corning incorrectly assumes that the significance of the vendee provision in its fair trade contract with wholesalers is limited to price maintenance in fair trade states.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But even if maintaining the retail price may be the ultimate purpose of the vendee clause, it is clearly not the clause\u2019s only effect. The clause seriously restricts the Missouri wholesaler\u2019s freedom of choice in selling to retailers located in neighboring fair trade states. Thus, the clause imposes a restraint of trade in Missouri, and is inconsistent with Missouri public policy. To paraphrase Representative McGuire, a state like Missouri should not be forced to tolerate a practice which its own public policy does not condone; it should not be subjected to encroachment on its internal affairs by neighboring states pursuing a different policy.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause fully respects the public policies of the three classes of states.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">a. In free trade states, the policy of preventing restraints of trade is fully vindicated. Neither a vertical price-fixing clause nor a customer restriction clause contained in a contract governing the resale in the free trade state is exempt from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">b. In signer-only states, the policy of permitting vertical restraints of trade which are voluntarily assumed by contracting parties while prohibiting the imposition of involuntary restraints on non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>contracting parties is fully vindicated. In those states Corning may continue its price maintenance program to the extent that it is able to persuade retailers to enter into price-fixing agreements voluntarily and to induce wholesalers in those states to accept customer restriction clauses in their contracts. But Corning may not restrain the freedom of a non-signing retailer to purchase from accessible wholesalers in neighboring free trade states by imposing customer restriction clauses on such wholesalers. The involuntary restraint resulting from such a clause would offend the policies of both the free trade state and the signer-only state.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As the Commission noted, the fact that signer-only states no longer have or enforce non-signer legislation reflects their desire to protect non-signing merchants from involuntary restraints. It would be inconsistent with that interest to deny those retailers the right to purchase from wholesalers in free trade jurisdictions free of any restraint which they had not voluntarily accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"ASf\">c. In non-signer states, Coming\u2019s fair trade program is essentially unimpaired.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Even though non-signer state retailers may now obtain goods from free trade state wholesalers without first contracting with Corning, they may not lawfully sell these items below the fair trade price. <em>(See, e. g., </em>\u00a7 2 of the Illinois Fair Trade Act, <em>supra </em>n. 5). Corning may continue to insist on vendee clauses in its contracts with non-signer state wholesalers, as such clauses are lawful under the fair trade acts of all non-signer states.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In sum, we agree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the McGuire Act; the exemption of a customer restriction clause in a wholesaler contract depends on the law of the state in which the resale of the product by the wholesaler to the retailer takes place. This interpretation fully respects the public policies of all three types of jurisdictions and accords with the basic federal \u201cpolicy in favor of competition.\u201d Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">With respect to the Order issued by the FTC in this case, Corning argues that it was not given an adequate opportunity to be heard on the terms of the final order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The Commission\u2019s Complaint, issued January 13, 1972, was accompanied by a proposed order, described in the accompanying Notice as \u201cthe form of Order which the Commission has reason to believe should issue if the facts are found to be as alleged in the Complaint.\u201d The Motion for Summary Decision filed by complaint counsel sought \u201cthat the order to cease and desist proposed by the Commission be entered against Respondent.\u201d This motion was served on October 2, 1972, some eight months after the issuance of the Complaint. Corning did not attack the proposed order, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>though complaint counsel\u2019s motion sought a complete disposition of the case. Only in its Motion for Reconsideration, filed after the Commission\u2019s decision, did Corning contest the form of the Order. While concluding that Coming\u2019s contentions were not timely, the Commission nevertheless considered, and rejected, the merits of Coming\u2019s arguments. We feel that Corning was given an ample opportunity to be heard on the propriety of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Corning, finally, contends that the Order is \u201cunnecessarily punitive\u201d in three respects. It objects to the requirements that it mail a copy of the Order to all retailers in the 14 non-signer fair trade states, that it \u201cencourage\u201d its signer-only state retailers to ignore Coming\u2019s fair trade prices, and that it refrain for three years from the use of pre-priced product containers and the use of fair trade prices in advertisements in areas where Corning may not lawfully control resale prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The Commission must be accorded broad discretion in framing its orders to insure the effective termination of any violation. As we stated in L. G. Balfour Co. v. F.T.C., 442- F.2d 1, 23 (7th Cir. 1971),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">It is well settled that the choice of the remedial order is committed to the discretion of the Commission. F.T.C. v. Mandel Bros., Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 392-393, 79 S.Ct. 818, 3 L.Ed.2d 893 (1959); Niresk Industries, Inc. v. F.T.C., 278 F.2d 337, 343 (7th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 883, 81 S.Ct. 173, 5 L.Ed.2d 104 (1960). Except where the remedy selected bears no reasonable relation to the unfair practices found to violate Section 5, the courts will not reverse or modify the Commission\u2019s choice. F.T.C. v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 428-429, 77 S.Ct. 502, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957); National Bakers Services, Inc. v. F.T.C., 329 F.2d 365, 367 (7th Cir. 1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The Commission has met these requirements. While the retailers in the 15 non-signer states will still be required to maintain the fair trade retail prices for Coming\u2019s products, they now may purchase those products from free trade state wholesalers at non-fixed prices.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, by requiring Corning to inform these retailers of the FTC Order, the Commission furthers the goal of removing the vestiges of past Corning violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Similarly, the FTC decision may open a significant source of supply for retailers in signer-only states who do not wish to maintain the fair trade price. Some of those retailers who signed fair trade contracts with Corning may have acted under the compulsion of the illegal Corning customer restriction clause in the free trade state wholesale contracts. The Commission could reasonably conclude that the most effective way to abolish the effects of this violation is to inform those signer-only state retailers whose fair trade contracts were submitted through free trade state wholesalers that \u201cunless and until [they] enter into new retailer contracts, [they] may and are encouraged to\u201d sell Coming\u2019s merchandise at such prices as they wish. This is what the FTC order requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">We also agree with the Commission that any practical problems Corning may have in preventing the use of pre-marked containers and fair trade priced advertisements in areas where Corning may not lawfully fix prices are best resolved as a compliance matter, rather than by revising the language of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"A7_\"> Finally, we note Coming\u2019s challenge to the impartiality of the Commission because of its consistent opposition to resale price maintenance in general and legislative exemptions from the antitrust laws for this form of pricefixing in particular. There is no merit to this challenge. It is certainly proper for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Commission to express the consumer point of view when antitrust amendments, or exemptions, are being considered by the Congress. Its performance of that public service in no way qualifies its status as an independent agency entitled to our respect in the discharge of its quasi-judicial functions. Moreover, contrary to Coming\u2019s argument, the views of complaint counsel as reported in the press certainly may not be used as a basis for questioning the independence of the members of the Commission itself. Indeed, we think our interpretation of the statute is strongly buttressed by the fact that it accords with the expert and experienced views of the agency charged with administration of the statutory scheme of which the McGuire Act is a part.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Accordingly, we affirm and enter judgment enforcing the order of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\">.

Note the inclusion of the phrase \u201cor stipulated\u201d in paragraph (2) of \u00a7 2 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(2), quoted <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b355-17\">.

If the same descriptive language had been used twice to describe two types of vertical agreements, it would be obvious that the word \u201cresale\u201d had two different meanings. Comparable meaning would be conveyed by a provision describing \u201c(a) agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of a commodity . . ., and (b) agreements requiring a vendee to enter into contracts or agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of a commodity. . . \u201d In part (a) of such a provision the word \u201cresale\u201d would refer to the first resale whereas in part (b) the same word would refer to a subsequent resale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\">. Alternatively, the word \u201cvendee\u201d might be interpreted as referring to a retailer who purchased from a wholesaler-party to a fair trade contract with the defendant manufacturer. Under that interpretation, the word \u201cresale\u201d would still refer to the sale by the retailer, rather than to the wholesaler\u2019s resale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\">. Although Corning argues for a literal interpretation of the clause, it does not expressly suggest that the word \u201cresale\u201d should be given a double meaning. On the contrary, Corning argues that the words \u201csuch resale\u201d refer to the first resale the first time they are used in the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>second resale the second time they are used in that clause. It is, however, perfectly clear that any difference in meaning between the first and second portions of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause \u2014 between contracts \u201clawful in any State ... in which such resale is to be made\u201d and \u201clawful ... in any State ... to which the commodity is to be transported for such resale\u201d \u2014 could not have been intended to have any relevance to the problem presented by this case. For, we reiterate, the vendee clause was not a part of the statute when that language was first enacted. We therefore need not express any opinion on the significance, or possible superfluity, of that clause as applied to situations not before us. <em>See </em>the discussion in the Commission opinion, Corning Glass Works, 82 F.T.C. 1675, 1759 (1973). We find neither textual nor historical support for Coming\u2019s suggestion that the word \u201cresale\u201d has one meaning when it is used in the first portion of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause and a different meaning when it is used in the second portion of that clause. If this is not a fair statement of Coming\u2019s argument, and if it is really contending that the word refers to the second, rather than the first, resale in both parts of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause, then the transport clause would be just as superfluous as Corning asserts it to be under the Commission\u2019s interpretation; for in that event, the first portion of the \u201cwhen lawful\u201d clause would compel the result for which Corning contends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">.

It is, of course, \u201ccommon experience that identical words may be used in the same statute, or even in the same section of a statute, with quite different meanings.\u201d Wood v.

Moreover, the language of Coming\u2019s own agreement purports to make its application to the parties depend upon the law of the place \u201cwhere it is lawful so to agree.\u201d One might expect this language to refer to the place where the agreement at issue was either made or is to be performed rather than to the place where persons who are not parties to the agreement conduct their business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\">.

What Rubbermaid ignores is that the determination of the antitrust immunity of an eventual price restriction upon resale in a fair trade state is logically separate from the determination of the immunity of a contractual vendee clause that imposes a serious restraint on the free selection of customers by a free trade state wholesaler. Congress\u2019 express desire to immunize specific \u201ccontracts\u201d should not be broadly read to mean the immunization of a series of contracts simply because the end result, price maintenance, is sanctioned by a state fair trade law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b360-5\">.

We recognize that as a practical matter a fair trade program in a non-signer state may be impaired to the extent that a manufacturer is unwilling to assume the litigation costs associated with enforcement, particularly since such costs include the risk that a non-signer state will be judicially changed into a signer-only state, as recently occurred in North Carolina. Bulova Watch Co., Inc. v. Brand Distributors of North Wilkesboro, Inc., 285 N.C. 467, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974). Although possible infirmity in the state of the law in a non-signer jurisdiction may provide a legitimate explanation for a manufacturer\u2019s decision to avoid litigation and to use customer restriction clauses as a method of enforcing its fair trade program, such possible infirmity is not a factor we may properly assess in considering the impact of our holding in a non-signer jurisdiction. For, if the test of litigation would disclose that some jurisdictions are improperly classified as non-signer states, the policy considerations applicable to free trade and signer-only states should be respected in those states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">.
