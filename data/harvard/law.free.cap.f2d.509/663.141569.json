CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b722-18\">This appeal requires us to review a decision by the Acting Comptroller of the Currency of the United States approving an application for permission to establish a branch bank in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. The district court, on the basis of the administrative record and an affidavit supplied by the applicant, granted summary judgment for the defendant Comptroller. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(b). We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-19\">Defendant-Appellee, Middlesex Bank, N.A., is a national bank operating under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 et seq. It maintains 28 branch offices in Middle-sex County. Plaintiff-Appellant, The First Bank and Trust Company (First Bank) is a Massachusetts Trust Company operating as a commercial bank under M.G.L. c. 172. It has its principal office in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and four branch offices in surrounding towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-20\">On December 6, 1972, Middlesex Bank filed an application with the Regional Administrator of National Banks for the First Bank Region requesting permission from the Comptroller of the Currency to establish a branch office in the Purity Supreme Shopping Center in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.2(b) Middlesex Bank published legal notice of its application, and First Bank requested that a hearing on the application be held in accordance with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.4-5.10.</p>\n<p id=\"Amd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Acting by designation of the Comptroller, the Regional Administrator held a public hearing, having first requested an investigation into the facts by a National Bank Examiner who rendered a written report. At the hearing Middle-sex Bank presented evidence to support its application, First Bank presented opposing evidence, and several other local banks appeared in opposition. The Regional Administrator, without comment, then transmitted the file established pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.3, including a transcript of the hearing, to the Comptroller who, after various levels of staff review, approved the application without stating his reasons. First Bank thereupon brought this action in the district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a), challenging the Comptroller\u2019s action as violative of his statutory duty and authority and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Appellant argues that the Comptroller failed to take into account a statutory requirement that he approve new branches for national banks only \u201cif such establishment and operation are at the time authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question\u201d and \u201csubject to the restrictions as to location imposed by the law of the State on State banks.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute has been held to incorporate by reference state laws governing the establishment of branch banks, First National Bank v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., 385 U.S. 252, 87 S.Ct. 492, 17 L.Ed.2d 343 (1966). Its purpose is to ensure \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d so that national banks may not overwhelm and displace a state\u2019s own banks. By requiring national banks to adhere to the same restrictions on branching, Congress intended to prevent them from enjoying an unfair advantage over state banks. <em>Walker Bank, supra; </em>First National Bank v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969). In passing on each branch application, the Comptroller \u201cis to weigh [it] against the standard imposed by the statute law of the state, and to deny the application if that standard is not met.\u201d First National Bank of Fairbanks v. Camp, 151 U.S. App.D.C. 1, 465 F.2d 586, 597 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1124, 93 S.Ct. 936, 35 L. Ed.2d 255 (1973). The statute law of Massachusetts provides that state banks may establish branch offices only if the Board of Bank Incorporation, a state agency, finds that a city\u2019s or town\u2019s present banking facilities are \u201cinadequate for the public convenience.\u201d M. G.L. c. 172, \u00a7 11. It is this standard, incorporated by reference in the federal legislation, which appellant contends was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Our review of the Comptroller\u2019s action is under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. Neither the National Bank Act nor the APA requires the Comptroller, before approving a branch application, to hold a hearing on the record or to make formal findings. <em>Cf. </em>Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 140-142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1972). Thus, the appropriate measure is simply whether the Comptroller\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The district court so recognized, stating correctly that the Comptroller was under no duty to make findings of fact, and that review was to be based on the full record before the Comptroller when he made his decision. In affirming the Comptroller\u2019s approval, the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-12\">\u201cThere may exist some confusion as to the reasoning process employed by the Comptroller in reaching his decision, but there is sufficient explanation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the administrative record ... to obviate the need for further explanation . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We agree that there would be enough support in the record concerning possible inadequacy and inaccessibility of present banking facilities in Chelmsford to provide a rational basis for the Comptroller\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the record leaves us in doubt whether the Comptroller took Massachusetts\u2019 statutory standard into account. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), a reviewing court must be satisfied that the Comptroller\u2019s decision was \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d While a decision favorable to Middlesex Bank would not be arbitrary or capricious on this record, neither would one turning down its request for a new branch. It thus becomes crucial to determine whether the relevant legal standard was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At the hearing the applicant bank and its opponent made reference to the Massachusetts statutory standard, but the Comptroller\u2019s subordinates later made no reference to it in the written recommendations and reports which formed the basis of the Comptroller\u2019s action. More troublesome, it is by no means clear from the tenor of their official remarks that the materiality of the state standard was understood. Indeed, portions of certain reports suggest the contrary. For example, in response to a question in a U.S. Treasury form whether under the state\u2019s branch banking laws the applicant could legally establish a bank, federal banking officials simply answered \u201cYes\u201d. Given the fact that virtually all of the hearing had been devoted to whether or not applicant could qualify under state law, this response is so meager as to suggest that respondents did not grasp the nature of the legal claim. Both sides call to our attention portions of reports indicating either that there were already too many banks in Chelmsford or, contra, that there was room for appellee. But the point is not whether there is support in the record for the Comptroller\u2019s decision \u2014 we believe there would be, assuming he applied the correct legal standard. The point is whether or not the Comptroller reviewed the facts in light of the Massachusetts statute law. Under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c)(2), the Comptroller had a duty to focus on the controlling state statute; and the contesting banks were entitled to have the application measured against this legal standard. Otherwise their arguments in opposition were an exercise in futility from the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We do not hold the Comptroller to any particular form of record; a conclusory statement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or even a subordinate\u2019s report directed to the relevant standard might have satisfied us that the appropriate legal standard had been recognized and applied. But here there is not only an absence of affirmative recognition of Massachusetts law, there are indications on the face of the record that those with the responsibility for guiding the Comptroller may not have considered it at all. We think the present record to be so deficient as to \u201cfrustrate effective judicial review.\u201d Camp v. Pitts, <em>supra, </em>411 U.S. at 142-143, 93 S.Ct. 1241. Until the Comptroller makes it clear whether or not the applicable state standard was taken into account in rendering his decision, it cannot be determined that his approval was \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">It can be argued, of course, that since the Comptroller can validate his decision by a piece of paper, remand is time consuming ritualism. And it is true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the Comptroller\u2019s good faith representation of compliance will effectively end judicial review. But were we to affirm on the present record, we would abdicate a judicial responsibility; and we will not assume that a senior administrative official such as the Comptroller will take the easy course of certifying that he .considered the state standard if such were not the case. Moreover, we assume that to avoid this problem in future cases, administrative action will be taken to ensure that the requisite consideration of state statute law can be determined from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We vacate and remand for the district court to determine from the Comptroller, following the limited procedures outlined in Camp v. Pitts, <em>supra, </em>411 U.S. at 142-143, 93 S.Ct. 1241, whether or not the Comptroller took into account the relevant state legal standard. If such was the case, his approval of the application should be sustained. If it should appear that this standard was not taken into account, the district court shall conduct such further proceedings and enter such orders as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Remanded for proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201c[a] national banking association may, with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, establish and operate new branches: ... at any point within the State in which said association is situated, if such establishment and operation are at the time authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and not merely by implication or recognition, and subject to the restrictions as to location imposed by the law of the State on State banks.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">. We find no merit in the argument that the Comptroller is bound by earlier decisions of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation refusing to permit a state bank to operate a branch in Chelmsford. The Comptroller is not bound by a state agency\u2019s interpretation of the state\u2019s statutes. First National Bank of Southaven v. Camp, 471 F.2d 1322, 1325-1326 (5th Cir. 1973); Union Savings Bank v. Saxon, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 296, 335 F.2d 718, 723 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">We note further that the Massachusetts courts have held that state agency decisions concerning \u201cinadequacy\u201d are \u201cpolitical questions\u201d and non-reviewable.
