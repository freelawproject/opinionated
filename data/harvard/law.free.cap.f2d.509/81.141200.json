This holding was based on the District Judge\u2019s finding that the unit managers are \u201cemployed in a bona fide executive [and] administrative capacity . . . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">On appeal, the Secretary seeks to avoid the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. by asserting that the district court applied erroneous standards to undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-19\">The decision on this issue depended solely on a determination of whether the unit managers, in the performance of their duties as employees of Westinghouse, met the requirements for exemption from the overtime provisions of the Act. This was a question of fact and there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of the district court. Further, there is no support for the claim that the court misapprehended or misapplied controlling principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-20\">The Secretary also sought an injunction against future violations of the Act by Westinghouse. The parties entered into a stipulation prior to trial which, <em>inter alia, </em>contained the terms of a settlement by which Westinghouse agreed to make overtime payments to four non-exempt employees classified as \u201cDistrict Field Representatives\u201d in the Chattanooga office. The Secretary characterizes this agreement as a \u201cstipulation of violations\u201d and urges it as showing the necessity for an injunction. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>agreement to settle a disputed claim is not an admission of a violation. The record fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that Westinghouse acted in good faith in its compliance efforts and that an injunction was not justified. The issuance of an injunction to prevent violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act lies in the discretion of the trial court. Wirtz v. Atlas Roofing Manufacturing Company, 377 F.2d 112, 116 (5th Cir. 1967). We perceive no abuse of discretion in the denial of the requested injunction in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
