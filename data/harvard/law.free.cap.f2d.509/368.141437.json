In this opinion we consider only issues (1) and (3) and defer any opinion on (2) pending the decisions of the Supreme Court in Alexander v. Virginia, 212 Va. 554, 186 S.E.2d 43, cert. granted, 408 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 2490, 33 L.Ed.2d 332 (1972) and companion eases, involving similar issues which were argued on October 16, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">I. <em>Comparison Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-18\">Appellants were convicted on the basis of eight explicit \u201cmagazines\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> apparent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ly directed at an audience of homosexuals and pedophiles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The particular evidentiary issue on appeal involves appellants\u2019 attempts to introduce allegedly comparable materials <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> into evidence for various purposes. Appellants contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>they were denied due process of law in the District Court\u2019s refusal to admit any of the proffered exhibits. There has been a considerable amount of confusion in the courts as to the admissibility and function of comparison evidence in obscenity cases. Some jurisdictions have held it reversible error to reject such evidence, while others exclude it rather summarily.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Some of this confusion, it seems, stems from an inability to distinguish the various purposes for which comparison evidence is sought to be introduced. In this case appellants urge three distinct purposes which we will consider separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">A. <em>Nonobscenity as a Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellants contend that they should be allowed as a requirement of due process to present the proffered comparison exhibits to the jury as primary autoptical evidence in order that the jury may compare materials previously held nonobscene by other courts (including the United States Supreme Court) to the exhibits which are the subject of the instant prosecution. This is clearly incorrect and involves a basic misconception of the respective roles of judge and jury. In essence it demands that the jury perform the judge\u2019s task of determining whether this issue should be disposed of as a matter of law. That is, it requires the jury to interpret the effect of a previous holding of nonobscenity as it bears on the issues of the present ease. Can it possibly be said that the jury is competent to interpret the <em>stare decisis </em>effect of various decisions, analyze the grounds of their holdings and distinguish them on their facts ?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is clearly beyond the province of the jury and is a basic function of the judge. When presented with a motion for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, the judge properly should compare the evidence in the instant case with that held nonobscene by the controlling authority of that jurisdiction. If the matter held nonobscene by such courts, in his opinion, equals or exceeds <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the evidence at issue, a judgment of acquittal should certainly be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>A number of cases which uphold the refusal to admit comparison evidence have nevertheless approved its use in this manner by the judge. This was noted in this court\u2019s decision in Huffman v. United States, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 470 F.2d 386 (1971), petition for rehearing granted on other grounds Aug. 10, 1972:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">We do not say that decisions involving other publications can play no part in the evaluation of a particular magazine or book. <em>Certainly a judge passing on the legal \u201cobscenity\" of material before him ivill consider whether it is so close to others already passed on by the courts as to require a judicial ruling on obscenity without submission to the jury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">152 U.S.App.D.C. at 255-256, 470 F.2d at 403-404 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, in United States v. 392 Copies of Magazine \u201cExclusive,\u201d 253 F.Supp. 485 (D.Md.1966), aff\u2019d 373 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1967), the court expressly left open the question of comparison evidence in a jury trial but concluded that such material from prior \u201cadjudicated cases, whether held obscene or not obscene, should always be considered by the Court as illuminating the opinions rendered in those cases, and the items offered have been so considered.\u201d 253 F. Supp. at 495. The use of comparative material to determine obscenity as a matter of law also is appropriate at the appellate level.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Therefore the trial court clearly was correct in retaining this comparative legal method solely as his function and refusing to lay it before the jury. Furthermore, on review of the relevant exhibits we hold that the proffered evidence held nonobscene by the Supreme Court is not sufficiently similar to' the exhibits at issue at trial as to have required a judgment of acquittal to be entered as a matter of law nor to require our reversal on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">B. <em>Proving Contemporary Community Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Appellants also sought to introduce comparative evidence to aid the jury in determining the prevailing contemporary community standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Court excluded all of defendants\u2019 proffered exhibits, applying the doctrine enunciated by this court in Womack v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 294 F.2d 204, cert. denied, 365 U.S. 859, 81 S.Ct. 826, 5 L.Ed.2d 822 (1961).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In <em>Womack, </em>a broad range of comparison materials were proffered by the defendant in an effort to show a contemporary community standard of general acceptance of works like his own. The court rejected the comparison evidence as immaterial where the proper foundation had not been shown. Judge Prettyman described the necessary foundation as consisting of two elements: \u201c. . . that the two types of matter are similar. And as another part of his foundation he must show a reasonable degree of community acceptance of works like his own.\u201d 111 U.S.App.D.C. at 10, 294 F.2d at 206. Appellants contend that this should not be the rule in modern obscenity prosecutions since in the <em>Womack </em>case there was such a wide divergence between the proffered exhibits and the materials that were the subject of that prosecution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While it is true that the comparison evidence offered in the instant case is not as vastly different from the materials at issue in the-trial as in <em>Womack, </em>this fact in no way undermines the soundness of the <em>Womack </em>test. The foundational requirements established in that case are eminently logical prerequisites under traditional concepts of materiality and relevancy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the <em>Womack </em>test has recently been applied in this circuit in Huffman v. United States<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and has been explicitly adopted by a number of other circuits as well as in some state jurisdictions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK1\">We are fully cognizant of the notion that expert testimony on contemporary community standards is desirable and may even be a necessary requirement of due process. Most of the impetus behind the use of expert testimony in obscenity cases can be traced to the concurring opinions of Justices Harlan and Frankfurter in Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 160, 169, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959). Those opinions indicated that due process may require some kind of expert testimony to enlighten the court on the community standards element of the <em>Roth </em>test. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion alludes specifically to the use of comparison evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Many other decisions have echoed this position on the need for objective guidelines to help the court reach a rational decision under the admittedly imprecise <em>Roth </em>formula.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Yet it is clear that the <em>Womack </em>test is perfectly compatible with the <em>Smith </em>policy and many cases adopting the <em>Womack </em>rule have excluded comparative evidence while simultaneously recognizing the validity of the <em>Smith </em>rationale.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this case this inherent consistency is exceedingly apparent. There was in fact extensive expert testimony on both sides as to contemporary community standards. That is all that the Harlan and Frankfurter opinions can be read to have required. As the Sixth Circuit has stated in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">[W]e are not unmindful of the relevant observations of Justices Frankfurter and Harlan in their concurring opinions in Smith v. People of State of California, 361 U.S. 147, 164, 165, 172, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959). We do not content ourselves by saying that those concurrences did not necessarily express the majority view, but are agreed that what the District Judge did in this case [excluding eomparison evidence under <em>Womack] </em>does not offend the views of those distinguished Justices. We consider that their suggestions of a legitimate range of admissible expert testimony were satisfied by what the experts here were allowed to tell the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYL\">United States v. West Coast News Co., 357 F.2d 855, 859 (6th Cir. 1966), rev\u2019d sub nom. on other grounds, Aday v. United States, 388 U.S. 447, 87 S.Ct. 2095, 18 L.Ed.2d 1309 (1967). The <em>Smith </em>concurring opinions were in no way intended to eliminate valid, rational rules governing the admissibility of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\"><em>Womack </em>merely requires an adequate foundation to be laid for the introduction of comparison evidence. Since the issue at hand is the nature of contemporary community standards with respect to \u201cworks like his own,\u201d in order for there to be a rational basis for its admission there must be a showing that the proffered evidence (1) is similar to his own, and (2) enjoys a reasonable degree of community acceptance. The burden is on the defendant<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and in the absence of such a showing,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>dence must be excluded as lacking sufficient probative value.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In this regard the trial judge must be allowed \u201cwide discretion as to whether to permit the introduction of such allegedly comparable publications\u201d since \u201cthe admission of a number of different publications alleged to be comparable to the publication in issue might make the trial unmanageably complex and lengthy.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark>-</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We have carefully reviewed the various exhibits involved in this case and hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding all the proffered comparison evidence. Most of the evidence sought to be introduced was simply unsusceptible of a convincing showing of similarity to the defendants\u2019 works. In this connection it is important to realize that \u201cslight\u201d variations in format may well produce vastly different consequences in obscenity determinations. This court, in <em>Huffman, </em>recently surveyed the state of obscenity law and observed with regard to photographs of males that various factors such as indoor activity as opposed to out-door nudism and \u201cduals\u201d as opposed to singles,\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> result in wholly different legal characterizations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Huffman, </em>the defendant sought to introduce magazines picturing \u201csingles\u201d for comparison with his works which included \u201cduals.\u201d We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">These magazines . . . fall within the category of \u201csingles\u201d. As discussed above, this type of magazine is clearly distinguishable from the genre involved here. . . . Once the judge declines to dismiss the prosecution on legal grounds [see part A, <em>supra] </em>we think it becomes a matter of sound discretion, that takes into account relatedness and remoteness, whether it is more likely to be helpful or confusing for the jury to make comparisons with publications passed on in previous cases. In view of the important distinctions between the \u201cduals\u201d photographs in the magazines on trial and the singles in previous cases, we hold the judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling against appellants on this issue. Womack v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 10, 294 F.2d 204, 206 cert. denied, 365 U.S. 859 [, 81 S.Ct. 826, 5 L.Ed.2d 822] (1961).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Turning to the evidence offered by appellants for comparison purposes in this case, we find that two of the magazines are labeled as marriage manuals and depict heterosexual activity between adults. Another magazine portrays heterosexual acts between adult members of different racial groups. Yet another magazine shows nude and partially nude females in various erotic poses. Appellants also proffered an illustrated version of the Report of the President\u2019s Commission on Obscenity containing pictures which run the gamut of bestiality to normal heterosexual activity. The remaining magazines and ten posters depict adult males in various stages of nudity. Many of them portray scenes from the day-to-day life at nudist colonies, while others portray the physiques of weight lifters. Appellant seeks to draw our special attention to certain particular exhibits alleged to be th\u00e9 most similar to those at issue here.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Yet on examination we find that they too are vastly dissimilar to his publications. Unlike the subject matter of this prosecution, there are no pictures of young boys in \u201cduals\u201d caressing and fondling one another in various positions of simulated sexual activity. Some of the proffered evidence does include young boys in groups but only photographed out-of-doors and containing no suggestion of sexual activity.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Under these circumstances we hold the trial judge was well within his wide discretion <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in excluding these exhibits on grounds of insufficient similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Appellant also had sought to introduce eight magazines published by one of their \u201ccompetitors\u201d (Tr. 673) which clearly meet the test of similarity.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> With respect to these eight exhibits the Government contends, however, that appellants failed to meet their burden of showing a reasonable degree of community acceptance as required by the second element of the <em>Womack </em>test. This issue has arisen in a number of obscenity cases in which the defendant has sought to introduce similar material purchased in the community in an effort to show a degree of community tolerance and acceptance for works like his own.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Of course, a determination of the precise point at which a publication is so widely sold and is so generally available in the community as to warrant a finding of community acceptance is difficult to fix with assurance. And a few eases have held that in close cases it is error to exclude such comparison materials.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, it is not difficult to identify that which clearly does not even approach an appreciable level of community acceptance and to exclude that material as possessing so little probative value as to serve only to impede the resolution of the issues. A distinction must be made between a showing of \u201cmere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>availability\u201d and that of \u201ca reasonable degree of community acceptance:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">Evidence of mere availability of similar materials is not by itself sufficiently probative of community standards to be admissible in the absence of proof that the material enjoys a reasonable degree of community acceptance. Womack v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 294 F.2d 204, 206 (1961), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 859, 81 S.Ct. 826, 5 L.Ed.2d 822 (1961). Such proof would normally be supplied by expert witnesses. No such proof was offered. In the absence of this foundation, the allegedly similar pornographic material was properly excluded. Mere availability of similar material by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">United States v. Manarite, 448 F.2d 583, 593 (2nd Cir. 1971). In our case, appellants spoke of the materials as having been easily purchased from certain specific suppliers in New York. Yet such esoteric materials purchased from a few vendors known only to those in the trade with no general circulation are not probative on the issue of contemporary community standards. This was well stated in the <em>\u201cExclusive\u201d </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">The standards of \u201cthe Block\u201d [an area in Baltimore in which there are a number of shops which deal in pornographic materials] are not the standards to be applied in this case, any more than the standards of the most straight-laced persons. <em>Material purchased in such specialized outlets has little or no value in determining contemporary community standards. </em>Ginzburg v. United States, [383 U.S. 463,] 86 S.Ct. [942,] 969 [,16 L.Ed.2d 31] (1966).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">The only evidence appellants offered to show community acceptance of these magazines was the fact that as of the date of this trial, no criminal charges had been lodged against their competitors (Tr. 673-75), but mere failure to prosecute does not begin to constitute a sufficient showing on this issue. We hold that with respect to these magazines, appellants have woefully failed to show a reasonable degree of community acceptance. Without such evidence the trial judge can in no way be said to have abused his discretion in excluding the proferred evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">C. <em>Cross-Examination of Expert Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Finally, appellants argue that at the very minimum, comparison evidence should be allowed to be presented to the various expert witnesses on the issue of community acceptance, particularly for cross-examination purposes.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">The use of comparative evidence for <em>direct </em>testimonial purposes on the issue of contemporary community standards is clearly governed by the resolution of the issue of its use as primary autoptical evidence. <em>See </em>Part B, <em>supra. </em>That is, once the court has determined under the <em>Womack </em>guidelines that the probative value of the comparison evidence is insufficient to be material on the issue of community standards, it is equally within the judge\u2019s discretion, indeed almost incumbent upon him for reasons of consistency, to exclude the introduction of such evidence through the expert, witnesses.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>A more difficult question is whether such materials are to be used for cross-examination purposes. It may indeed be helpful for the jury to know that the expert witness holds an opinion contrary to that of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Apparently one case in this jurisdiction has allowed such use of comparative evidence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, this is definitely a matter in which the trial judge is to be afforded wide discretion. As Judge Wyzanski has- said in a First Circuit decision upholding the trial judge\u2019s discretionary exclusion of allegedly comparable material as well as his refusal to allow expert testimony with respect to them :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">Nor is a judge required to admit as a touchstone for the jury <em>even those books which are admittedly not obscene. </em>The admission of a number of different publications alleged to be comparable to the publication in issue might make the trial unmanageably complex and lengthy. The trial judge must be allowed wide discretion as to whether to permit the introduction of such allegedly comparable publications, <em>and as to whether to allow the witnesses to be examined in detail on publications other than the one directly at issue.</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">Not only do the dangers of excessive trial length, complexity and unmanageability weigh heavily in favor of according the trial judge broad discretion, but also the undesirability of allowing the jury to speculate as to the basis for a Supreme Court holding of nonobscenity. That is, in light of the various factors that enter into a legal finding of obscenity and the generally confusing state of this area of law at the time of this trial,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it is clearly a matter of broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>discretion for the trial judge to balance the dangers of jury confusion against the possible benefits of effectively undermining the credibility of a given witness.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In this case the decisions referred to by appellant in which the comparison evidence was held nonobscene were particularly cryptic and to infer a lack of credibility from any inconsistencies between the expert and that decision would be highly speculative and confusing to the jury. Even absent this factor, the judge is always to be allowed broad discretion as to such testimonial matters.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We hold here that the judge properly exercised that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Therefore, with respect to the issue of comparison evidence as a whole, we affirm the rulings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">II. <em>Search and Seizure Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Appellants raise three objections to the warrant used to seize the various incriminating materials involved in this case. The warrant is claimed to be invalid (1) on its face for overbreadth, (2) for lack of a prior adversary hearing, and (3) as calling for a search for \u201cmere evidence\u201d as distinguished from a search for fruits or implements of crime. We find all three objections to be wholly without merit and decline to reverse the convictions on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> First, there can be no serious claim that the warrant was impermissibly vague as to the items to be seized. The warrant incorporates by express reference the underlying affidavit attached thereto which quite specifically details the records and documents to be obtained in the search. Under these circumstances, we have held the warrant to meet the necessary specificity requirements.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Although during execution of the warrant some other materials were seized, all of them were returned and none were used at appellants\u2019 trial.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This clearly does not affect the validity of appellants\u2019 convictions.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> Second, the requirement of an adversary hearing prior to the issuance of a warrant is derived from Supreme Court decisions<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> holding that the public\u2019s First Amendment rights would be jeopardized if a judge were allowed to suppress large numbers of copies of an allegedly obscene publication simply on the basis of an <em>ex parte </em>decision on the issue of obscenity. This authority is clearly inapposite here since this search warrant- did not authorize the seizure of any materials protected by the First Amendment but only business records and other correspondence relating to the publication, sale and distribution of the magazines listed in the affidavit and the identity of some of the models.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Lastly, appellants\u2019 \u201cmere evidence\u201d argument and citation of the <em>Gouled </em>case<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> is entirely inappropriate in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s complete disavowal of that doctrine in Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 300-310, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1646-1651, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967) in holding there was no valid basis for prohibiting \u201cintrusions to secure \u2018mere evidence\u2019 \u201d and permitting \u201cintrusions to secure fruits, instrumentalities, or contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Had we reached opposite conclusions on either the evidentiary or the search and seizure issues involved in this case, we would have reversed the convictions. However, since we have upheld the trial court on these issues, we release this opinion at this time and order that the case be held in abeyance with respect to the First Amendment issues to await the decision of the Supreme Court in the pending obscenity cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION Filed Dec. 31, 1974</p>\n<author id=\"b441-8\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">On December 7, 1972, this court issued an opinion disposing of the evidentiary issues presented by these appeals. That decision deferred action on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">whether the eight magazines which formed the basis of appellants\u2019 convictions were obscene and not within the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">pending the decisions in several obscenity cases then before the Supreme Court. Original Op., <em>supra,, </em>at 372. The decisions in those cases have since been issued. Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973); Alexander v. Virginia, 413 U.S. 836, 93 S.Ct. 2803, 37 L.Ed.2d 993 (1973). We now dispose of the remaining issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\"><em>Miller, supra,, </em>established the following three tests for determining whether a work is obscene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">(a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\">(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Appellants are entitled to the benefit of any constitutional principle stated in <em>Miller. </em>See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). Only <em>Miller </em>test (b) involves modifications of prior principles which would potentially benefit appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">Appellants were convicted for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (mailing obscene matter) and \u00a7 1462 (interstate transportation of obscene matter). In <em>Hamling, supra, </em>the Court held that section 1461 was not unconstitutionally vague in light of the prior construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of that section in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), and therefore the statute was sufficient to support a conviction under <em>Miller </em>test (b). In United States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123, 130 n.7, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 2670, 37 L. Ed.2d 500 (1973), the Court indicated it was prepared to construe the terms of section 1462 \u201cas limiting regulated material to patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific \u2018hard-core\u2019 sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller </em>. . . .\u201d The Court reaffirmed this intent in <em>Hamling. </em>Thus both statutes under which appellants were convicted satisfy the requirements of <em>Miller </em>test (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Miller, </em>the Court listed certain \u201cplain examples\u201d of the type of material which a statute could regulate under <em>Miller </em>test (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. The magazines which formed the basis for appellants\u2019 convictions are described at note 4 of our original opinion. It is readily apparent that these magazines contain material portraying most of the \u201cplain examples\u201d of obscenity which <em>Miller </em>held sufficient to support a conviction. We find beyond a reasonable doubt that this case would have reached exactly the same result had it been tried using (b) of the <em>Miller </em>tests. See United States v. Gower, 164 U.S.App.D.C. 98, 503 F.2d 189 (1974). Nothing approaching the kind of doubt as to the application of <em>Miller </em>to the materials in question which required remand in Huffman v. United States (Pryba v. United States), 163 U.S.App.D.C. 417, 502 F.2d 419 (1974) is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Appellants argued that the governmental interest in regulating obscenity is limited to the protection of juveniles and the prohibition of public display and pandering of such materials. The Supreme Court has since rejected the argument that the role of the government is so limited. See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57-69, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Appellants\u2019 convictions are accordingly affirmed as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-4\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u00a7 1462.

The eight magazines are: <em>Boys No. 1, Boys No. 2, Boys No. 3, </em>(Government Exhibits Nos. 25, 26, 27) (5,000 copies of each were printed and single issues retailed for $3.00 each; Tr. 1095) ; <em>Chieken Little No. 2 </em>(Ex. 28, 10,000 printed, $3.00 each) ; <em>Phallic Development in the Pre-Adoleseeni, </em>(Ex. 24, 20.000 printed, $5.00 each) ; <em>Phallic Development in the Adolescent </em>(Ex. 21-1, 20.000 printed, $5.00 each) ; <em>Boys Who Seduce Other Boys, </em>(Ex. 30, 20,000 printed, $3.50 each) ; and <em>My Last Time \u2014Never Again </em>(Ex. 31, 20,000 printed, $3.50 each). Appellants were acquitted on counts 5 and 8, which involved the magazines <em>Auto-Fellatio and Masturha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>tion, </em>(60,000-80,000 sold, $7.50 each) and <em>(7heekmate </em>(Ex. 29, 5,000 printed, $3.00 each). Testimony as to printing volume, sales and the various prices charged at the different levels of distribution appear at Tr. 1095-1100. Additionally, under counts 22 and 23, the jury was allowed to consider only those advertising brochures which dealt with the original ten magazines set out in the indictment, i. e., Government Exhibits 21, 21-B, 22-A and 23-C. All other brochures involving other magazines were excluded by the trial court (Tr. 1287-1288).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The eight magazines in question consist of a collection of photographs showing young boys of the adolescent and preadolescent age group in a state of complete or partial nudity. The photographs have been cropped and the youngsters posed in a manner which highlights and emphasizes their exposed genitalia. In several instances, most noticeably on the back covers of both <em>Phallic Development </em>magazines, the cropping has been accomplished in such a way as to show the viewer nothing more than the genitals themselves and a small portion of the surrounding pubic region. Many photographs particularly those of the older boys, depict the penis in full or partial erection. A suggestion of masochism is present in several photographs by depicting totally nude youngsters bound by ropes while another is ensnared in a net. Among those photographs known in the trade as \u201csingles,\u201d i. e., those portraying only one model, several boys are shown fondling their penises while another manually lathers his semi-erect penis with soap. Among those photographs known in the trade as \u201cduals,\u201d i. e., those portraying two models, the youngsters are seen caressing, fondling, kissing, and embracing each other. In many instances the positions of the boys indicate that oral or anal sodomy is imminent. In one photograph <em>{Boys Who Seduce Other Boys </em>p. 33) it appears that anal sodomy is ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Only four of the magazines contain any substantial text. They generally consist of \u201ccase histories\u201d in which certain portions are emphasized with bold face type. These passages deal with such diverse sexual activities as fellatio, anal sodomy and masturbation. The photographs accompanying the text depict nude males embracing and fondling each other and are wholly unrelated to the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">. There was expert <em>testimony to the </em>effect that these materials would appeal to . pedophiles. A pedophile is an adult who has an erotic desire for a child. (Tr. 473-76, 478-80, 480-82, 525-26, 865-67, 903-07, 913, 915-16, 919-21, 933-35). Appellants concede that the magazines were directed at a homosexual audience. (Appellants\u2019 Br. 28-29).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. The appellants offered a variety of materials for comparison to those at issue in this case consisting of thirty-five magazines and ten posters, some of which had been held nonobscene by various courts. Defense Exhibits 23 and 24 are copies of a heterosexual magazine called <em>Exciting </em>held nonobscene in Bloss v. Dykema, 398 U.S. 278, 90 S.Ct. 1727, 26 L.Ed.2d 230 (1970). Nos. 25, 25a and 25b are \u201cphysique\u201d magazines, <em>Grecian Guild Pictorial, Trim; Manual, </em>held non-obscene in Manual Enterprises v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962). No. 26 is also a male physique magazine entitled <em>Hellenic Sun </em>held nonobscene in Potomac News Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 47, 88 S.Ct. 233, 19 L.Ed.2d 46 (1967). Similarly, the materials that were the subject of the reversals of convictions in Felton v. Pensacola, 390 U.S. 340, 88 S.Ct. 1098, 19 L.Ed.2d 1220 (1968), magazines entitled, <em>A Hundred Naked Rebels, Solis Review International </em>No. 1, <em>Review International </em>No. 2 were offered as defendants\u2019 exhibits Nos. 27, 27a, 27b, 27c. The ten posters (Defense Exhibits Nos. 28-281) consisted of large individual photographs of partially nude adult males held nonobscene by the Eighth Circuit in Spinar v. United States, 440 F.2d 1241 (8th Cir. 1971). Appellants also cite to us an unreported District Court decision which held non-obscene a number of copies of magazines of the <em>Butch </em>and <em>Tiger </em>series, depicting nude males in-doors, mostly in \u201csingles\u201d \u2014where there are \u201cduals,\u201d the models are widely separated with no indication of sexual activity. United States v. Spinar, U.S.D.C.Minn. 4-67-Crim. 15 decided July 26, 1967. These magazines <em>(.Butch </em>and <em>Tiger) </em>together with another copy of <em>A Hundred Naked Rebels </em>and <em>Male Nudist Portfolio </em>which were also exonerated in this District Court decision were offered as Defense Exhibits Nos. 33-39. Defense Exhibits 32-32g are magazines appellants claim were purchased from their competitors and are quite similar to those at issue here. They depict nude males, both young and adult engaging in acts of fellatio, anal sodomy and masturbation. As to these publications, appellants admit that no court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ever considered them in an obscenity prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">. <em>Compare </em>Woodruff v.
