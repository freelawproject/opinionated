App. \u00a7 462(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 21, 1974, the district court denied Salas\u2019 post-trial motions for judgment of acquittal pursuant to F.R.Crim.P. 29 and for arrest of judgment pursuant to F.R.Crim.P. 34 on the grounds that they were based on the so-called \u201corder of call\u201d defense and were thus untimely, citing United States v. Strayhorn, 471 F.2d 661 (2 Cir. 1972), and that in any event Salas had not been prejudiced, citing <em>id. </em>and United States v. Griglio, 467 F.2d 572 (1 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-18\">The order of call defense was described in <em>Strayhorn </em>as involving \u201ccontentions by a Selective Service defendant that his order for induction came out of proper sequence, or, conversely, that others who should have been called before him were not.\u201d 471 F.2d at 662. This court went on to say that the trial courts could deem such defenses waived, in trials beginning after January 1, 1973, if they were not raised before trial through a motion for a judgment of acquittal. See 471 F.2d at 665. Salas did not claim, however, that there were other 1 \u2014 A registrants in his local board with higher priorities for call than his \u201cwhose inclusion on a monthly list would have \u2018bumped\u2019 him off.\u201d 471 F.2d at 664. Rather, he claimed that he was exposed to induction as of December 31, 1971, and was not called during the three months which followed, and therefore under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6(c) and (d)(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was entitled to be placed in a nationwide lower priority selection group from which he would not have been drafted. This is not an \u201corder of call\u201d defense, and the district court was in error in holding that Salas\u2019 post-trial motions were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>The Government concedes that under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.25(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Salas was improperly classified 2 \u2014 S on June 3, 1971 because he was over 24 years of age; that he was subsequently and properly classified 1 \u2014 A in November, 1971; that he remained properly classified as 1 \u2014 A on December 31, 1971; and that his draft lottery number (70) had been reached during the 1971 calendar year. Consequently, after December 31, 1971, as specified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6(c) and (d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board was required to place Salas in \u201cExtended Priority Selection Group\u201d and to issue to him an induction order by April 1, 1972, failing which the Board was required to place him in the \u201clower priority selection group.\u201d The Government also concedes that the Board could not deprive appellant of the time limitation for induction under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6(d)(5) by improperly reclassifying him 2 \u2014 S in January, 1972, and that <em>had </em>appellant been placed in the \u201clower priority selection group,\u201d he would not have been drafted. While for policy reasons of the. Secretary of Defense no induction orders were issued during the first three months of 1972, this did not constitute, under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6(d)(5), an \u201cinability of the local board to act\u201d and thereby render the strict time limitations inapplicable. Cf. United States v. Born, 338 F.Supp. 444 (W.D.Mich.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">The Government argues that, in any event, appellant has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s errors and thus cannot now claim that he should be acquitted because the November 1, 1972 induction order was invalid. This argument is fallacious. He suffered the very kind of prejudice 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6(d)(2) and (5) were meant to preclude by establishing a precisely defined and limited time during which a registrant, classified 1 \u2014 A, could be drafted. In conjunction with the random se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>lection plan, they were designed to eliminate the frustrations confronting a large proportion of the vulnerable generation because the uncertainties of each one\u2019s status made futile any plans for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for the entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">. 50 U.S.C.
