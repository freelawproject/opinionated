Florida requires that certain vessels, upon entering or leaving her ports, take on state-licensed pilots, for whose services a fee is charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to discourage noncompliance, Florida holds vessels liable for the fee whether or not pilots actually are utilized. We must determine whether, insofar as the Florida pilotage statute applies to nonself-propelled barges carrying inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk, it is preempted by federal legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-24\">The St. Johns Bar Pilot Association (Pilot Association) instituted this in rem admiralty action to recover a fee of $156.00 for pilot services which were offered to but refused by the tug ESTER \u201cS\u201d and her tow, the barge \u201cAUNT MAME.\u201d The Pilot Association served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>process only on the \u201cAUNT MAME,\u201d which was claimed by Steuart Transportation Company (Steuart).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida heard the case as on cross-motions for summary judgment. In connection with their motions, the parties submitted exhibits and a stipulation of facts, the relevant portions of which we shall summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">The \u201cAUNT MAME,\u201d towed by the ESTER \u201cS,\u201d left Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, bound for Jacksonville, Florida. Although the crew members of the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d were federally licensed, none held a valid federal or state, pilot\u2019s license for the Port of Jacksonville. When the barge and tug reached the mouth of the St. Johns River, the Pilot Association offered to provide a state-licensed pilot for the inbound passage to the Port of Jacksonville. The pilot\u2019s services were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">The \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d is a federally enrolled and inspected tank barge, specially constructed to transport liquid bulk cargo. At the time of its voyage to Jacksonville, the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d was transporting asphalt, an inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">The district court held that the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d was not a \u201ccoastwise seagoing steam vessel\u201d on which federal pilots are required and that, since federal law did not require a pilot, Florida\u2019s pilotage statute is not preempted as applied to the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d and similar vessels. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">The Pilot Association acknowledges that the constitutional grant of power to the federal government to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among states includes the power to regulate pilotage. U.S.Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. It contends, however, that at the time the Constitution was adopted the maritime states regulated pilotage and that Congress in 1789 plainly indicated that state regulation was to continue until Congress specifically provided otherwise. Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 9, \u00a7 4, 1 Stat. 54, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 211 (1970). The Pilot Association asserts that Congress has not withdrawn from the states regulatory power over pilotage of nonself-propelled vessels. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">Congress has required that \u201ccoastwise seagoing steam vessels,\u201d with certain exceptions not here relevant, be manned by federally licensed pilots in coastal waters.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-15\">[E]very coastwise sea going steam vessel subject to the navigation laws of the United States, and to the rules and regulations aforesaid, not sailing under register, shall, when under way, except on the high seas, be under the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-16\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 364 (1970), <em>formerly 52 </em>R.S. \u00a7 4401; <em>see </em>Olsen v. Smith, 195 U.S. 332, 343, 25 S.Ct. 52, 49 L.Ed. 224 (1904); Spraigue v. Thompson, 118 U.S. 90, 96, 6 S.Ct. 988, 30 L.Ed. 115 (1886). Thus, the threshold question is whether the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d is a \u201ccoastwise seagoing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> steam vessel\u201d for purposes of section 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-17\">Congress broadened the definition of a \u201csteam vessel\u201d as that term was employed in title 52 of the Revised Statutes to include barges transporting certain hazardous cargoes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-18\">Sec. 4417a. (1) All vessels, regardless of tonnage, size, or manner of propulsion, and whether self-propelled or not, and whether carrying freight or passengers for hire or not, that shall have on board any inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk, except public vessels owned by the United States, other than those engaged in commercial service, shall be considered steam vessels for the purposes of this title [52] and shall be subject to the provisions thereof</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-19\">Act of June 23, 1936, ch. 729, 49 Stat. 1889, 52 R.S. \u00a7 4417a, as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(l) (1970). Because on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>voyage to Jacksonville the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d was transporting asphalt, an inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk, the district court concluded, as do we, that the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d was a \u201csteam vessel.\u201d The district court went on to hold, however, that, even though Congress expressly expanded the definition of \u201csteam vessel\u201d \u201cfor purposes of this title [52],\u201d it intended the broadened definition to apply only to the inspection provisions of title 52 and not to provisions of the same title governing operation and manning, including piloting, of such vessels. We. disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">We are persuaded that Congress, in enacting section 391a, was concerned with the operation and manning of steam vessels as well as with their inspection. One year earlier, during the first session of the Seventy-fourth Congress, similar legislation was passed which proved inadequate to achieve the objectives intended by its drafters. Act of Aug. 26, 1935, ch. 697, 49 Stat. 868. This legislation, Public 343, as it was known, was intended to \u201cbring about a reasonable and uniform set of rules and regulations concerning . . . operation and manning\u201d of vessels transporting hazardous cargoes. H.R.Rep. No. 2962, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., at 2 (1936). The Solicitor of the Department of Commerce<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ruled, however, that under Public 343</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-6\">no rules and regulations could be made regarding manning or the operation or movement of the vessel, its cargo, or any of its equipment. Inasmuch as these items constituted a great part of the hazard against which protection was needed, it was deemed best to secure this legislation [section 391a].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\"><em>Id. </em>Congress thereupon authorized the Department of Commerce to promulgate regulations \u201cwith respect to the operation of such vessels; and with respect to the requirements of the manning of such vessels and the duties and qualifications of the officers and crews thereof . .\u201d Act of June 23, 1936, ch. 729, 49 Stat. 1889, as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(2) (1970). In so doing, we believe it evinced an overall intent to legislate beyond the sphere of inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">Section 391a(l) expressly provides a broadened definition of \u201csteam vessel\u201d \u201cfor purposes of this title [52].\u201d This language plainly extends the expanded definition to all of title 52, including present section 364 requiring federally-licensed pilots. The Pilot Association has not brought to our attention, nor have we found, legislative history which, in the face of section 391a(l)\u2019s unequivocal language, would justify a more restrictive interpretation. We therefore conclude that the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d was a \u201csteam vessel\u201d for purposes of section 364. Since the \u201cAUNT MAME\u201d is enrolled as a \u201ccoastwise\u201d vessel, we hold that it was a \u201ccoastwise seagoing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> steam vessel\u201d on which a federally-licensed pilot is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">The question remains whether Congress, in requiring that \u201ccoastwise seagoing steam vessels\u201d be under the \u201ccontrol and direction\u201d of federally-licensed pilots, intended to exempt such vessels from state pilotage laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">Congress has provided substantial guidance in this regard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-14\">No State or municipal government shall impose upon pilots of steam vessels any obligation to procure a State or other license in addition to that issued by the United States, or any other regulation which will impede such pilots in the performance of the duties required by title 52 of the Revised Statutes; nor shall any pilot charges be levied by any such authority upon any steamer piloted as provided by title 52 of the Revised Statutes; and in no case shall the fees charged for the pilotage of any steam vessel exceed the customary or legally established rates in the State where the same is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>performed. Nothing in title 52 of the Revised Statutes shall be construed to annul or affect any regulation established by the laws of any State, requiring vessels entering or leaving a port in any such State, other than coast-wise steam vessels, to take a pilot duly licensed or authorized by the laws of such State, or of a State situate upon the waters of such State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 215 (1970), <em>formerly </em>Act of Feb. 28, 1871, ch. 100, \u00a7 51, 16 Stat. 455. We believe section 215 precludes enforcement of Florida\u2019s pilotage statute with respect to \u201ccoastwise steam vessels\u201d such as the \u201cAUNT MAME.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">We are aware that the \u201cAUNT MAME,\u201d in violation of section 364, did not have a federally-licensed pilot on board. However, we do not interpret the proscription against levying a fee against \u201cany steamer piloted as provided by title 52\u201d as exempting from state pilotage laws only those vessels actually piloted in compliance with section 364. The last sentence of section 215, at least by implication, precludes state regulation of pilotage insofar as coastwise steam vessels are concerned. Only state pilotage regulations concerning \u201cother than coastwise steam vessels\u201d are not to be annulled or affected. Moreover, if a state could require a state-licensed pilot on coastwise steam vessels not piloted in accordance with federal law, the state in effect would be arrogating unto itself the role of enforcing the federal pilotage requirement. We are unwilling to ascribe to Congress such an intent. Congress has entrusted the Coast Guard<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with authority to license pilots<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and enforce section 364. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 224 (1970). Congress also has provided penalties for noncompliance with section 364. <em>See id. </em>We therefore conclude that state involvement in overseeing compliance with section 364 would conflict with the regulatory and enforcement scheme created by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">. The Florida pilotage statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-15\">All steamers or vessels entering any port or leaving the same shall be subject to pay to any licensed pilot performing duty on board, or to the pilot who shall first speak to such steamer or vessel, the following rates of pilotage: . . . . These minimum rates shall apply to all steamers or vessels whether owned wholly by citizens of this state or not, except that all steamers or vessel drawing less than six feet of water and having a coastwise license shall be exempt from paying pilotage unless they employ a pilot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-26\">12 Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 310.1 l(Supp. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"ADx\">The vessel involved in this appeal had a mean draft of approximately 18 feet 9 inches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">.

That case concerned the federal Water Quality Improvement Act which imposes liability on shipowners and terminal facilities for cleanup costs incurred by the federal government as a result of oil spills. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161 et seq. (1970). Congress there provided for cooperation with the states and specifically reserved to the states the power to create causes of action to compensate parties other than the federal government.
