We were disturbed at the Tax Court\u2019s refusal to treat the payment of $125,000 received by petitioner Sirbo Holdings, Inc. (Sirbo), from its tenant Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS), in satisfaction of the latter\u2019s obligation to restore, or indemnify Sirbo for the costs of restoring, the leased premises to their pre-lease condition as a long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of property used in the landlord\u2019s trade or business, I.R.C. \u00a7 1231, when, in what appeared to be a considered opinion, Judge Raum had allowed such treatment in a similar case decided only two months later, Boston Fish Market Corp., 57 T.C. 884 (1972), or even to explain the differences in result when Sirbo sought reconsideration. Thinking that the Tax Court\u2019s lack of response to Sirbo\u2019s petition might have been due to deference to dicta in Billy Rose\u2019s Diamond Horseshoe, Inc. v. United States, 448 F.2d 549, 551-552 (2 Cir.), aff\u2019g 322 F.Supp. 76 (S.D.N. Y.1971), which held that a similar transaction involving a series of payments did not qualify for special relief treatment under the installment reporting method of I.R.C. \u00a7 453(a)(1) \u00abfe (b)(1) for \u201ca casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property,\u201d we advanced some suggestions why that decision did not necessarily determine that the transaction here at issue was not a sale or exchange of property used in the trade or business, one of the tests applicable for capital gains treatment under I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(a), but we reserved the question of law pending \u201cthe benefit of the considered view of the Tax Court ... on whether it would follow <em>Boston Fish Market </em>on the facts here.\u201d 476 F.2d at 989 (footnote omitted). In a supplemental opinion by Judge Quealy, 61 T.C. 723 (1974), reviewed by the full court, the Tax Court adhered to its earlier determination, and petitioner has again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">We can now forget about <em>Boston Fish Market. </em>We had noted, 476 F.2d at 987, that in that case the Commissioner was primarily concerned with fending off the landlord\u2019s claim that the tenant\u2019s payment was not income at all under I.R.C. \u00a7 109, which excludes from a lessor\u2019s gross income the value upon termination of a lease of improvements made by the lessee, and had \u201cabandoned his challenge to the propriety of capital gains treatment, see 57 T.C. at 887 n. 2\u201d. But there were statements in Judge Raum\u2019s opinion which we took as possibly meaning that the Tax Court thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>that abandonment of the objection to capital gains treatment was required. See 57 T.C. at 889 (such payments \u201chave generally been regarded as having been received in sale or exchange of the unrestored property.\u201d). The Commissioner now states that his acquiescence in capital gains treatment in <em>Boston Fish Market </em>was not considered policy but rather was an error, and the Tax Court says that \u201cWithout such concession, the <em>Boston Fish Market </em>case may well have been decided differently,\u201d 61 T.C. at 726 n. 4 \u2014 which we take to be a way of saying \u201cwould have been decided differ-'1 ently.\u201d While even-handed treatment should be the Commissioner\u2019s goal, <em>cf. </em>International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 343 F.2d 914, 170 Ct.Cl. 357 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1028, 86 S.Ct. 647, 15 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> perfection in the administration of such vast responsibilities cannot be expected. See Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 17.07, at 600 (1970 Supp.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The making of an error in one case, if error it was, gives other taxpayers no right to its perpetuation. <em>See </em>Wagner v. United States, 387 F.2d 966, 968, 181 Ct.Cl. 807 (1967). <em>Cf. </em>Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 15, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944) (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">On the other hand, appellant Sirbo\u2019s arguments are quite persuasive in support of our intimation in our earlier opinion that the terms \u201ca sale or other disposition of real property\u201d and \u201ca casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property\u201d in I.R.C. \u00a7 453(b) are more restrictive than \u201csales or exchanges of property used in the trade or business\u201d in I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(a). 476 F.2d at 988. The history and literature relevant to \u00a7 453(b) contain many references to contracts of sale and sales on the installment plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all indicating an intention to confine this benefit to conventional sales. Certainly \u00a7 1231(a) has been extended far beyond these. Further force is added on this point by the recent decision in Central Tablet Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 417 U.S. 673, 94 S.Ct. 2516, 41 L.Ed.2d 398 (1974), in which the Court noted that the Government, accepting decisions by the Court of Claims and the Fourth Circuit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had properly conceded that an involuntary conversion constituted a \u201csale or exchange of property\u201d within I.R.C. \u00a7 337(a), and as such was nonrecognized, although it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>held not to come within the then equivalent of I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(a), Helvering v. William Flaccus Oak Leather Co., 313 U.S. 247, 61 S.Ct. 878, 85 L.Ed. 1310 (1941), before that section was amended to include such a conversion. The concession, and the Court\u2019s approval of it, at least serve to show that, where the Internal Revenue Code is concerned, no controlling weight can be given to the usual presumption that, when the same words are used in several sections of a statute, they mean the same thing. Rather the Court will look at the Congressional history and purpose in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">With Sirbo thus deprived of the aid we thought it might get from <em>Boston Fish Market </em>and the Commissioner' gaining little assistance from the decision as distinguished from the dicta in <em>Billy Rose, </em>we must decide the basic question whether Sirbo\u2019s receipt of the $125,000 payment came within I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(a). We hold that not all of it did and that, since Sirbo has twice failed to avail itself of an opportunity to proffer evidence that would support an allocation, the Tax Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">The problem with respect to the tax treatment of payments for the termination of contract rights having a property flavor is among the most frustrating in income tax law. Anyone reading such materials as Professor Eustice\u2019s article, Contract Rights, Capital Gain, and Assignment of Income \u2014 the Ferrer Case, 20 Tax.L.Rev. 1 (1964), Professor Chirelstein\u2019s article, Capital Gain and the Sale of a Business Opportunity: The Income Tax Treatment of Contract Termination Payments, 49 Minn.L.Rev. 1 (1964), or, for those with smaller appetites, the analysis of cases in 1 Surrey, Warren, McDaniel and*Ault, Federal Income Taxation 1049-54 (1972 ed.) must end with deep disappointment at the failure of decisions to fulfill the goals of predictability and of principled decision-making and at the enormous expenditure of professional and judicial time in accomplishing nothing more than a debatable decision of a particular case. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Professor Eustice reminds us, \u201cmatters remain nearly as muddled as ever; and the seemingly unending growth of litigation on this question shows little sign of abating, or, for that matter, of even reaching a general consensus of what the law is, not to mention what it ought to be.\u201d Eustice, <em>supra, </em>20 Tax L.Rev. 1. Yet Government counsel said, in answer to a question from the bench, that little would be gained by an attempt at legislative revision since the variety of problems is too great. Perhaps this is so, although even a quick look at the American Law Institute\u2019s Draft of a study of Definitional Problems in Capital Gains Taxation (1960) makes one wonder whether a new attempt should not be made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we must take the statute as we find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">When the case was last here, we pointed out that the covenant in the lease, see 476 F.2d at 983-984 fn. 2, from which CBS was relieved by the payment of $125,000, contained elements of two different sorts. One element was CBS\u2019 obligation to pay \u201cfor removal or destruction of \u2018property\u2019 such as the theatre seats, carpeting, chandeliers, stage curtains and various structural features of the theatre.\u201d 476 F.2d at 987. If CBS had paid at the time of occurrence for the removal and destruction of fixtures such as seats and the destruction of structural features, the transaction would have come under \u00a7 1231(a). We see no reason why a different conclusion should be reached because the payment was deferred until the end of the lease or because the covenant was settled rather than performed. Indeed, the Tax Court seems to have held as much in Hamilton &amp; Main, Inc., 25 T.C. 878 (1956). We find little force in the emphasis by the Tax Court and the Commissioner on the points that Sirbo had a low or even a zero basis for the seats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>and other fixtures and structural features which have been removed or destroyed, and that some of the seats and fixtures had long since been junked. The \u201csale or exchange\u201d occurred when they were removed or destroyed; it is of no moment that payment came much later. Compare Waggoner v. CIR, 15 T.C. 496 (1950). On this aspect of the case we adhere to what we previously said, 476 F.2d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">We also suggested, however, that CBS\u2019 covenant to remove its own property \u201cclearly was not \u2018property used in the trade or business\u2019 \u201d, 476 F.2d at 987. This covenant related mainly to CBS\u2019 property, not to Sirbo\u2019s; it obligated CBS to remove its property (e. g., control booths, the stage apron extension) so that what had been converted into a TV studio (at some damage to the structure of the premises, an item included in the first element of the covenant) could be returned to a legitimate theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"AEb\">Despite this plain intimation, Sirbo made no effort to supply an allocation on the remand. Perhaps the initial failure to do this had been excusable; within reason a taxpayer should be allowed to contend for the most favorable result in the first instance and to supply an allocation later,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as we allowed in CIR v. Ferrer, 304 F.2d 125, 136 (2 Cir. 1962). But we see no basis for according Sirbo not merely a second but a third bite at the cherry, especially when our prior opinion so plainly apprised it of our tentative views. To be sure, we do not reach affirmance with great enthusiasm since the $125,000 payment received in 1964 represented a payment for acts occurring over a period of nearly twenty years; the effect of denying capital gain treatment would be even harsher if the landlord here were an individual. But \u00a7 1231(a) does not include all payments representing consideration that had accrued over the years; since Sirbo cannot show a compulsory or involuntary conversion, 476 F.2d at 985-986, for purposes of this appeal \u00a7 1231(a) relates only to those payments that constitute \u201csales or exchanges of property used in the trade or business\u201d \u2014 whatever that may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">. Our previous opinion states the facts; familiarity with it will be presumed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">. \u201cFor all tax rulings, it is important that there be like treatment to those who should be dealt with on the same basis.\u201d 343 F.2d at 923.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">. Speaking of the <em>IBM </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>Professor Davis remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-6\">No one would disagree with the principle of equality which the IBM decision advances. The problem of the case is not whether equality is desirable; of course it is. The problem is how much deviation from complete equality must be allowed as a concession to the difficulties of administration. If one taxpayer gets a favorable but erroneous ruling on a specific question, equality requires that every other taxpayer having that same question be allowed the advantage of the error. But is that practical? Do even the best of tax administrators have the capacity to carry the equality principle all the way?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.
