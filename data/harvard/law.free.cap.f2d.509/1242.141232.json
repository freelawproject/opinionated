ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1301-18\">Sapphire Steamship Lines, Inc. (Sapphire), prior to its adjudication as a bankrupt, instituted an action to recover treble damages from several of its competitors for alleged antitrust violations. After bankruptcy intervened, the trustee, J. Read Smith, was substituted as plaintiff and was duly authorized by court order to retain Joseph L. Alioto as special counsel to prosecute the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-19\">Negotiations between the special counsel and counsel for the antitrust defendants resulted in a settlement offer of $1.600,000 in July, 1970. It was the position of the special counsel that, although plaintiff had a strong case on the question of liability, there was insufficient evidence on the issue of damages to warrant further negotiations. Based upon the recommendation of the special counsel that the $1,600,000 was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d, the bankruptcy court issued an order authorizing the trustee to accept that amount in settlement of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-20\">Several creditors of the bankrupt, including the United States and two corporate creditors represented by Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts (Winthrop, Stimson), opposed this settlement and jointly moved for a reconsideration of the order, supporting their motion with legal memoranda relating to the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-21\">The bankruptcy court granted the motion for reconsideration, and \u201c[primarily because . . . [of] evidence produced . - by the Government\u201d at the hearing, vacated the original order and withdrew its approval of the settlement offer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>At various times during the renewed settlement negotiations, counsel for the antitrust defendants requested conferences with the Assistant United States Attorney who was representing the Government\u2019s interest as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding. Defendants argued that the priority claims of the United States would be substantially met if the particular offer then under discussion were approved and for that reason, they urged the Government to withdraw its opposition. Lawyers from Winthrop, Stimson also attended these conferences and participated in the discussions at the request of the Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">When the settlement offer was increased from $1,600,000 to $2,000,000, Mr. Alioto again recommended acceptance but the Government and Winthrop, Stimson were still opposed and the bankruptcy court, therefore, never approved of the new offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">Finally, after continued two-way negotiations \u2014 between defendants and special counsel, and between defendants and the Assistant United States Attorney, who requested and received assistance from Winthrop, Stimson \u2014 a settlement offer was made in the amount of $2,473,070. The Government recommended acceptance of this offer and the settlement was formally approved by the bankruptcy court, although Winthrop, Stimson opposed this offer also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">Thereafter Winthrop, Stimson filed claims for its services with the bankruptcy court in the amount of $175,000, plus disbursements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It claimed that, by reason of its efforts, a better settlement was obtained and the estate was substantially augmented to the benefit of all creditors. None of the creditors opposed this fee application and several affirmatively endorsed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">The bankruptcy court, however, rejected Winthrop, Stimson\u2019s application on two grounds: (1) Winthrop, Stimson could not take full credit for the reconsideration and subsequent disallowance of the first settlement; and (2) at no time did it act as counsel to the trustee, but argued solely for its own clients, to whom it was required to look for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">The United States District Court on petition for review of the decision of the bankruptcy court, remanded the claims with instructions to compensate Winthrop, Stimson for the fair and reasonable value of its services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court found that while Winthrop, Stimson may . not have been solely responsible for the setting aside of the first settlement order, it had made a contribution toward that result and also to the $800,-000 increase in the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">The trustee and Sapphire appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting Winthrop, Stimson counsel fees from the bankruptcy estate. They argue on this appeal that the finding that Winthrop, Stimson\u2019s services contributed to the enhancement of the estate in a specified amount is clearly erroneous. Although it is true, as they point out, that the fund was created by the third offer of $2,473,070 which Winthrop, Stimson continued vigorously to oppose, the district court\u2019s finding that the activities of the Winthrop, Stimson firm contributed to the reconsideration and disapproval of the first two offers is supported by the record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, because the rejections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>the first two offers were prerequisites for the proposal and eventual acceptance of the final settlement, it is a reasonable inference that Winthrop, Stimson \u201ccontributed to\u201d the creation of the additional $800,000 fund. In spite of this finding, however, the district court was in error in holding that Winthrop, Stimson was entitled to fees from the bankruptcy estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">As a court of equity, the district court, sitting in bankruptcy, has the power to order the payment of fees from the estate to compensate counsel who, in advancing their own client\u2019s interest, have benefited all creditors. But equity is grudgingly administered in the award of counsel fees. <em>See, </em>Grace v. Ludwig, 484 F.2d 1262 (2 Cir. 1973). This is especially true in bankruptcy proceedings where responsibility is designed to be centralized in the trustee in an effort to preserve the estate from applications for allowances by numerous importunate claimants. <em>See, </em>In re New York Investors, 130 F.2d 90, 91-92 (2 Cir. 1942). As a rule, therefore, the fee of a creditor\u2019s attorney is not to be paid from the bankruptcy estate. <em>See, </em>Guerin v. Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, 205 F.2d 302 (2 Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Winthrop, Stimson recognize this rule but argue that it is entitled to have its fee paid from the estate under an exception for situations in which (1) the trustee has refused or neglected to act and (2) the applicant has conferred a tangible benefit on all the creditors by acting in the trustee\u2019s stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">To qualify for this exception, however, a creditor\u2019s attorney must satisfy a third requirement, i. e. the bankruptcy court must have formally authorized such attorney to act instead of the trustee. In re New York Investors, Inc., <em>supra; </em>In Re Porto Rican American Tobacco Co., 117 F.2d 599 (2 Cir. 1941); In re Progress Lektro Shave Corporation, 117 F.2d 602 (2 Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">In this case Winthrop, Stimson qualifies under neither the first nor the third requirements of the exception. A trustee \u201crefuses\u201d or \u201cneglects\u201d to act when he fails to satisfy a duty imposed upon him by the Bankruptcy Act, which requires that he marshall the assets of the bankrupt and, as with all his substantive duties, exercise reasonable care in so doing. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 75. The trustee in this case did not refuse or neglect to pursue Sapphire\u2019s antitrust cause of action, nor did the district court find that he violated his duty of care in that pursuit. Although subsequent events established that the strategic decision to recommend acceptance of the first offer of $1,600,000 was \u00e1 mistake of judgment, to conclude therefrom, that the trustee \u201crefused\u201d or \u201cneglected\u201d to act would encourage creditors and their attorneys constantly to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the trustee\u2019s decisions. Such a result would contravene the policy of preserving the estate by centralizing responsibility in the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">Winthrop, Stimson concedes that it failed to secure court approval to act on behalf of the trustee, but argues that the third requirement of the exception should not apply where the trustee has not acted in the best interests of the estate. And, it asserts that its own successful opposition, to the special counsel\u2019s recommendations which the trustee was willing to accept, demonstrates that the trustee in this case defaulted in the fulfillment of his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Although this court has waived prior court approval in \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d and the payment of fees was allowed to objecting counsel who had successfully opposed exorbitant fee applications of the trustee and his counsel, which the trustee obviously would not oppose, In re New York Investors, <em>supra, </em>130 F.2d at 92, Winthrop, Stimson\u2019s services in this case were not brought about by any such \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d To waive the prior approval requirement for all cases in which counsel may successfully oppose the trustee<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would contravene the policy of the Bankruptcy Act, and is not necessary for the protection of creditors. If Winthrop, Stimson or its clients entertained any doubt as to the trustee\u2019s sincerity in the prosecution of the antitrust suit or had lost confidence in the special counsel\u2019s competence to repres\u00e9nt the estate, their remedy was to apply to the district court for appropriate relief \u2014 such as removal of the trustee, or disqualification of the special counsel and substitution of either Winthrop, Stimson or other counsel in the antitrust suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Although the district court found, in effect, that Winthrop, Stimson satisfied the second requirement in that it conferred a tangible benefit on the estate, the general rule governs this case and, despite the purported equities, Winthrop, Stimson does not qualify for the exception to the rule proscribing the payment of fees to counsel for a creditor in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">The order of the district court is therefore reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">. The Government introduced evidence at the hearing that several key witnesses were now available who theretofore were reluctant to testify or were otherwise not available. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>result the Bankruptcy Court found \u201cproving damages was not quite as hopeless as had first appeared.\u201d The Assistant United States Attorney has deposed in the present action and stated that Winthrop, Stimson provided material assistance in locating those witnesses and in uncovering relevant documentary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">. This is 20% of $873,070, the amount by which the original offer was increased, and breaks down to an average of $100 .per man-hour devoted to this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1302-13\">. The district court opinion is reported at 373 F.Supp. 727 (S.D.N.Y.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1302-14\">. Although the evidence produced by the Government \u201cprimarily\u201d influenced the Bankruptcy Judge to vacate his original order approving the first offer, Judge Herzog impliedly recognized that Winthrop, Stimson contributed to his decision when he stated in his memorandum opinion that \u201cthe attorney for the creditors cannot take full credit for the disapproval of the first offer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">. The District Court had remanded the recommendation of the Bankruptcy Judge on the allowances to be paid from and by reason of the creation of the settlement fund for reconsideration and further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. Matter of Sapphire Steamship Lines, Inc., supra, 373 F.Supp. at 734. Only that aspect of the decision dealing with Winthrop, Stimson\u2019s equitable entitlement to fees has been appealed to this Court. The judgment of this Court does not affect the District Court order as it relates to reconsideration of the fees payable to Joseph L. Alioto. The Bankruptcy Judge, therefore, must now reconsider his recommendation as to the fees payable to Special Counsel and decide specifically whether he is entitled to a percentage of the entire fund or only the $1,600,000 to which he directly contributed his services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">. Sartorius v. Bardo, 95 F.2d 387 (2 Cir. 1938), upon which Winthrop, Stimson places great weight, does not warrant a different result. In that case it was held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-7\">. . if a creditor successfully opposes a proposal of the trustee, it is no answer to his demand for payment to say that the trustee was in charge; by hypothesis his intervention was necessary. Hence the judge would not have been justified in denying this part of the petition [even though he had not approved petitioner\u2019s actions in advance] if any substantial advantage could be traced to the services.\u201d 95 F.2d 390.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar4\">This holding was modified, however, by the subsequent decision of this Court in In re New York Investors, 130 F.2d 90, 92, from which time the rule in this Circuit has been that the prior approval requirement is waived only in cases where compensation is sought for opposing allowances to trustees and their counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
