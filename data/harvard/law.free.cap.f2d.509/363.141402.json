(1970), intends to merge with GAC Corporation, a non-banking company. Mergers between bank, holding companies and non-banking companies are generally forbidden by \u00a7 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1843 (1970), but \u00a7 4(c)(8) permits the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether certain non-banking activities are sufficiently related to banking activities such that the purposes of \u00a7 4 would not be fulfilled by prohibiting mergers of companies engaged in such activities with bank holding companies. The class of activities performed by GAC Corporation have been determined to be sufficiently related to banking to permit, in most circumstances, a merger between companies performing such activities and a bank holding company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, each proposed merger between a non-banking company and a bank holding company is to be considered on its individual merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On consideration of Bankameriea\u2019s request for approval of its proposed merger with GAC, the Reserve Board first held that the merger was not consistent with the Act and then on reconsideration held that it was and approved it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Reserve Board had before it the adverse comments of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Reserve Board gave public notice of the proposed merger and requested comments from interested parties both on the merits of the merger under the Act and on the need for a trial-type hearing to consider those merits. Petitioner Martin-Trigona responded to this notice, stating generally that the merger was bad for the country and that a full adversary hearing was required. The Reserve Board requested petitioner to state what particular interest he had in the transaction and to describe what kinds of evidence he would adduce at any hearing into the merits of the merger. The petitioner refused to comply with this request. Therefore, the Board determined that petitioner had no standing to intervene in the administrative proceedings. The Board apparently did not consider petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner seeks review in this Court of the Reserve Board\u2019s refusal to permit intervention in the administrative hearing and from the \u201cdenial\u201d of his request for a hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We treat this as a petition to set aside the Board\u2019s prior order permitting the merger on the grounds that the Board both impermissibly denied intervention and denied a full hearing on the merits of the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The Reserve Board argues against the petition that Martin-Trigona has no standing since he has not alleged any particularized injury to himself or his property flowing from the merger. The Board\u2019s standing argument applies both to petitioner\u2019s standing before this Court and to his standing before the Board\u2019s own proceedings. We first note the salient principles of standing as recently explicated by the Supreme Court. First, the plaintiff must allege that the \u201cchallenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or otherwise. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, this alleged injury in fact must be \u201carguably within the zone of interests . . . protected or regulated by the statute . in question.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>seeking review may not merely allege the existence of an injury, but must allege \u201cfacts showing that he is himself adversely affected\u201d by the challenged action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of this decision, we hold that these tests apply both to standing before this Court and standing before an administrative agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Clearly competitors of either the bank holding company or the non-banking company would be within the zone of interest of \u00a7 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, if they allege injury to their business resulting from a proposed \u00a7 4 merger.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If this is so, we would have no difficulty holding that a potential competitor would also be within the zone of interest of \u00a7 4, if that potential competitor may realistically be viewed as a possible entrant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The more difficult question concerns whether consumers of the banking services of the parties to the proposed merger or of the type of banking services provided by those parties would be within the zone of interest of \u00a7 4. This question poses in turn the question whether the Federal Reserve Board is required under \u00a7 4 to consider the anti-competitive effects of a merger between a bank holding company and a non-banking company. If the Board is so required, then consumers would have standing to challenge a Board action under \u00a7 4 both before the Board and in the courts to the extent the consumers would otherwise have standing under the anti-trust laws.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>It is not clear whether the Board should consider the anti-competitive effect of \u00a7 4 mergers. The Board is expressly obligated under \u00a7 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and under the parallel Bank Mergers Act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to review the anti-competitive effects of mergers of member banks and of bank holding companies. But this obligation does not directly apply to \u00a7 4 mergers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not informed at this time what reasons if any should prevent the Reserve Board from applying the statutory scheme under \u00a7 3 and the Bank Mergers Act to \u00a7 4 mergers. We do note that the legislative history seems to indicate that anti-competitive considerations undergird \u00a7 4 as well as \u00a7 3 <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that antitrust policy is of such national importance that regulatory agencies should apply that policy <em>sua sponte </em>in order to discharge their duty to represent the public interest,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Board is given express authority under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1843(c)(8) to apply anti-trust considerations to \u00a7 4 mergers. This is, to be sure, an authority not fully parallel to the authority granted by the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Mergers Act, both of which assume administrative application of the standards of \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act. However, the authority of \u00a7 1843(c)(8) may be sufficient to authorize consumer standing before the Board. Under the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue and we would be hesitant to do so in any event without the benefit of the Reserve Board\u2019s views. We have, however, felt it necessary to fully address the issues in this case since the petitioner is proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Assuming for purposes of decision that petitioner, as a potential competitor or as a consumer of credit services, might represent an interest within the zone of interests protected by \u00a7 4, it is abundantly clear that petitioner has not particularly alleged an injury in fact within this zone. As stated earlier, this he must do before he may assert standing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The only allegations of injury in fact are some conclusory statements in petitioner\u2019s brief in this Court<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which are clearly not sufficient to obtain standing before the Board and are not, we hold, sufficient to obtain standing in this Court. It follows that petitioner MartinTrigona has no standing at present to seek review of the Board\u2019s order and no standing to request participation as a party in the Board\u2019s proceedings in this case. His petition for review is therefore dismissed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 225.4(a)(1) (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 225.4(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. <em>See </em>Bankamerica Corp., 38 Fed.Reg. 22578 (FRB 1973); <em>id., </em>38 Fed.Reg. 21317 (FRB 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1843 (1970) implemented in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 225.4(b)(2) (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">. <em>See </em>Letter of June 26, 1973, reprinted in the Record at 886-67 which denies petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing because of his failure to show injury in fact, his failure to specify what he would show at a hearing and his failure to demonstrate why his showing could not be made in written form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b423-20\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1848 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b423-21\">.

It is settled that anti-competitive practices forbidden by \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act may give rise to a private damage action under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. <em>See </em>Gottesman v.
