Upon examination of the records along with appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint the court determined that no federal claim had been stated and dismissed the complaint, saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">The medical records of the Cummins Unit reveal that the physician at the Arkansas State Hospital stated that the petitioner might require an exploratory operation, but that he had doubts as to the benefits to be derived from such an operation. These records also reveal that the petitioner has been seen by prison medical personnel several times since his last trip to State Hospital and was examined and Xrayed by the prison physician as recently as June 4, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">In light of this record and inasmuch as it appears that petitioner is receiving medical attention from the respondents, what remains is a mere disagreement between the petitioner and the prison physician as to what treatment is necessary for his care. In such cases, the Court should rely on the reports of the prison physician and leave the matter to his judgment. (Citing cases.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Of course, a prisoner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">This court has recognized that \u201ca charge of deliberate indifference by prison authorities to a prisoner\u2019s request for essential medical treatment is sufficient to state a claim.\u201d Freeman v. Lockhart, 503 F.2d 1016 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>citing </em>Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 251 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Allegations of mere negligence in the treatment of a prisoner\u2019s condition or claims based upon differences of opinion over matters of medical judgment fail to state a federal constitutional question absent exceptional circumstances. Jones v. Lockhart, 484 F.2d 1192 (8th Cir. 1973); Cates v. Ciccone, 422 F.2d 926 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">We find that the district court acted properly in securing appellant\u2019s medical records. <em>Cf. </em>Cates v. Ciccone, <em>supra. </em>It may well be, as the trial court found, that in light of the record what remains is a mere disagreement between the petitioner and the prison physician as to what treatment is necessary. Under such circumstances the petitioner could obviously prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">However, from the record before this court it is impossible to determine the truth or falsity of appellant\u2019s claim that he was \u201cforced to go to work as though he had no injury\u201d without the requisite medical release. Judge Henley made no specific finding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">We remand. The district court should determine on remand whether appellant was returned to work without medical authorization from the prison physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. Other contentions are raised for the first time on appeal. We express no view on these contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-16\">. The Honorable J. Smith Henley, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
