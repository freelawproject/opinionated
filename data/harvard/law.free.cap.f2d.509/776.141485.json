United States v. Bush, 476 F.2d 1094 (7th Cir. 1973); United States v. Bush, 499 F.2d 815 (7th Cir. 1974). Bush was convicted for willfully failing to submit himself for induction under the Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462. He appeals his conviction on the ground that he was improperly denied a conscientious objector classification. We find merit in this contention, and therefore reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">The defendant registered with the Selective Service in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1964. At the time he was an engineering student at Purdue University. Bush was classified II-S, and he held this student deferment for fourteen months, until December of 1965 when he withdrew from the University. On January 4, 1966, he requested an SSS Form 150 in order to apply for classification as a conscientious objector. Bush returned the completed Form 150 on January 11, 1966. On that same day the local board rejected his application for C-0 status and classified Bush I-A. The board gave no reasons for its decision, and Bush did not seek timely review of this classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">Subsequently, on June 29, 1966, Bush notified his local board that he had enrolled at Ohio State University. On August 8, 1967 the board again reclassified Bush I-A and notified him of his rights to consult an appeal agent, seek a personal appearance, and take an appeal. This time he exercised all of these rights, pressing his claim for a student deferment. The local board, after hearing Bush at a personal appearance, again classified him I-A. The appeal board af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>firmed the I-A classification on April 11, 1968. On April 29, 1968 Bush was informed that a new form had been received from Ohio State University and that he would therefore be considered for a II-S deferment at the May board meeting. On May 2, 1968 Bush wrote his board indicating he intended to appeal his I-A classification on the ground that he was a conscientious objector, but later the same day he again wrote his board to say that his primary appeal at that point in time was his student deferment and that his C-0 appeal should therefore be \u201cdeferred\u201d to a later date. In June of 1968 Bush was granted a student deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\">Shortly before his graduation, in December of 1968, Bush was again reclassified I-A. On December 2, 1968 he responded by notifying the board that he might require an additional quarter to graduate and that he therefore would require an extension of his II-S deferment. He also indicated that he might appeal a I-A classification on hardship grounds in the event he did graduate in December. On December 14, 1968 Bush notified the board that because of \u201csome very good luck and hard work\u201d he would graduate from Ohio State on that day. He also indicated that his possible hardship appeal hinged on facts which would not be known until January of 1969, and that while he could not, therefore, assert hardship as a basis for appeal until January, he did desire to \u201copen an appeal on the basis of my beliefs (As explained in a C.O. form on record with your office since 1965) . . . .\u201d He concluded by stating that \u201cthis is an appeal for classification into the C.O. Class.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In furtherance of his desire to appeal his I-A classification on the basis of his beliefs, Bush requested an appearance before his local board. After an exchange of correspondence the board scheduled an interview for February 25, 1969 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Bush was in Detroit, Michigan at this time and notified the board that it would be impossible for him to personally attend the scheduled meeting in Cincinnati. He sent a six page outline of his beliefs for consideration by the board in lieu of his appearance. At its meeting on February 25, 1969 the board reclassified Bush I-A. No reasons were given for this decision. Bush was notified of his rights of appeal and he did appeal. On September 15, 1969, the appeal board affirmed the I-A classification. No reasons were given for the appeal board\u2019s action. On June 29, 1970 Bush received a rescheduled induction order and on August 13, 1970 he reported to the Chicago induction station. When his name was called, Bush refused induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">The defendant contends that his beliefs, as described by his Form 150 filed in 1966 and the six page outline sent to the board in February of 1969, present a <em>prima facie </em>case of conscientious objector status under section 6(j) of the Military Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 456(j). He further contends that in light of this <em>prima facie </em>showing the local and appeal boards could not lawfully reject his 1969 C-0 claim without stating reasons for their decisions in the matter. Our reading of the relevant cases supports this contention and we therefore reverse Bush\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">We believe this case is controlled by our decisions in United States v. Lemmens, 430 F.2d 619 (7th Cir. 1970), and United States ex rel. Hemes v. McNulty, 432 F.2d 1182 (7th Cir. 1970). In the <em>Lemmens </em>case we adopted the <em>\u201cprima facie\u201d </em>rule first clearly articulated by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Haughton, 413 F.2d 736, 739, 742 (9th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">We are persuaded that where the validity of a classification rejecting a claim as conscientious objector is in issue, and where the registrant described a belief which on its face fulfilled the legal requirements, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>board did not state its reasons for rejection, and the court can not otherwise determine with any degree of assurance that the decision really made by the board properly supported the rejection and had a basis in fact, the court should hold the classification invalid. (Footnote omitted.) 430 F.2d at 624.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Under <em>Lemmens, </em>we must undertake a two-step analysis. We must first decide whether the beliefs stated by Bush, taken on their face and without regard to the question of the sincerity with which they are held, qualify under section 6(j) of the Selective Service Act of 1967 as the basis for a conscientious objector classification. If we find that the beliefs stated by Bush meet these statutory requirements, we must further decide whether the record allows us to determine, <em>with any degree of assurance, </em>the actual basis for the board\u2019s decision, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe decision really made.\u201d If the basis for the decision is apparent on the record, we simply proceed to analyze that decision as if the board had stated its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The initial question is whether Bush\u2019s original SSS Form 150 and his subsequent six page memorandum describe a belief or beliefs which qualify under section 6(j).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">(j) Nothing contained in this title . shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. As used in this subsection, the term \u201creligious training and belief\u201d does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">The key element under this section is the concept of \u201creligious training and belief,\u201d and the main thrust of the Government\u2019s argument to us is that Bush\u2019s beliefs fall within the \u201cessentially philosophical\u201d and \u201cmerely personal moral code\u201d exceptions set out in the statute. The contention does not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">On his original Form 150 filed with his local board on January 11, 1966, Bush signed \u201cstatement B\u201d which read, \u201cI am, by my religious training and belief, conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form and I am further conscientiously opposed to participation in noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces. I, therefore, claim exception from both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces.\u201d In the same form, Bush indicated that he did believe in a Supreme Being. He further described his beliefs at that time by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">I believe in the basic Kantian theories (described elsewhere). It is not my belief in a supreme being which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>motivates me to conscientious objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">I came to believe in the Kantian theories by living for 19 years \u2014 many things contributing to this. I believed in what are the Kantian theories long before I found out that that set of beliefs is the Kantian theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">I try to make my every action consistant [sic] with my beliefs \u2014 I do not (as much as possible \u2014 I keep trying to improve on this) lie, cheat, steal, infringe on others\u2019 rights. My life is lived on finding truth and living it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">I shall try to explain what I believe in here in outline form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">I. I believe in categorical imperatives \u2014 There are ultimate truths that are formed not because one is inclined to them but by their intrinsic truthfulness, <em>i.e., </em>killing is wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">(These explanations are very weak because to explain these things would take several hundred pages)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">II. Things should be done from duty things \u2014 right things: Categorical imperatives</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-10\">III. Each man\u2019s actions show what he believes in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">IV. I must live by the truth (right)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">Imminent human imperative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-13\">No man is God, but each must draw a line as to what he will and will not do. In the use of force I think and believe I would draw mine (I have never been confronted with the situation) in the following way: If a murder [sic] were to attempt to kill someone close to me I would attempt to stop him (I would not kill him).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">Almost three full years after Bush filed his initial application for C-0 classification he submitted to his local board a six page memorandum which restated and revised his beliefs relative to formalized religion as that term is commonly understood, and to his personal convictions concerning war. On the first page of this document Bush set out the following outline of his beliefs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-15\">I. God</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-16\">I do not believe in God, I am an atheist. I hold no belief in a super natural [sic] being, nor do I believe in a heaven or hell or in any of the religious, theological teachings of the bible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-17\">II. Man</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-18\">I believe that man stands at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of living things. There is no superior being to man. I do not believe in life forms from other worlds (men from outerspace). In all of the universe we the inhabitants of this planet are the highest form of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-19\">III. Truth</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-20\">That which is correct, real, in accordance with actual existence. Just as there are physical truths which we call laws of science, so there are moral and ethical truths. These truths are invariable, they are constant through all time, they do not change to suit situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-21\">IV. Knowledge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-22\">Because man has powers of the intellect it is possible for him to know truths. Truths do not grow on trees, they must be sought out,, learned. Everything that exists and or happens has a relation to a truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-23\">V. Honor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-24\">Man should live according to the moral and ethical and physical truths of the universe. Only in living according to the truths which a man knows can he obtain personal honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-25\">VI. Human Inadequacy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-26\">Man himself, is not a God; he is not a super natural [sic] being. Man can not know all truths, he can not hold all knowledge, nor can he at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>every moment live according to the truths which he knows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Bush went on to explain the major points of this outline in greater detail in the ensuing pages. Relevant to our discussion are the following passages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">I do not believe in life after death which leads me into a conclusion that whatever I do now with my life is all that there is of meaning to me. Consequently I try to make all of my actions purposeful ones. ... I believe that the present life I am leading is the only one that there will ever be for me and that what I do with it, however I live this particular life of mine will be the measure of my personal worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">All potential for both good and evil lie therefore in man. The final justification of a man\u2019s life comes in two ways; firstly, to extent that he lives up to his capabilities as a man (every gifted artist should be striving to paint his masterpiece); secondly, to the extent that he can trimpuh over evil (do good) when all of the conditions of his life would dictate that he do evil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">I do feel I am my own judge. What does a man judge himself on? I believe there'is only one basis for judgment \u2014 personal honor \u2014 the extent to which a man lives in accordance with his beliefs (those things he knows to be truths). For instance you often hear people giving their \u201cword,\u201d that they will do such and such a thing when in fact they have no real plan to do the thing. When I give my word that I will do something, then only death can stop me from doing it and indeed I give my word most frequently to myself, not to other people. . [T]he only thing I really fear is dieing [sic] without honor. This does not mean that I must die with a sword in my hand but rather than I die upholding things which I believe in. In the final analysis, whatever I do must be in accordance with what I believe for I sit in judgment over myself and to live life without, honor is the greatest crime I could commit and it would be a crime against myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ade\">At the end of his memorandum Bush offered the following summary specifically devoted to his opposition to war: Opposition to War</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">I. Life is sacred \u2014 no man has the right to take another man\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">II. Killing is wrong \u2014 a moral, ethical truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">III. War is mass killing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">IV. It is not enough just to say or believe that war and killing are wrong, you have to live, act in accordance with the knowledge that it is wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-15\">V. Service in the military is in direct support of things which participate in war \u2014 and thereby killing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-16\">VI. I can not in my conscience support the military or its actions by serving in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am5\">As a consequence, I appeal for a classification into the conscientious objector class so that I may fulfill my obligation to my country in accordance with my beliefs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">These beliefs, while unorthodox in relation to traditional, institutional concepts of \u201creligious training and belief,\u201d nevertheless fall well within the confines of the statutory definition of these concepts as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court and our own court. In Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), Justice Black, speaking for a plurality of the Court, set forth the following analysis of the concept of \u201creligious belief\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-19\">What is necessary under <em>Seeger </em>for a registrant\u2019s conscientious objection to all war to be \u201creligious\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6(j) is that this .opposition to war stem from the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong' and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions. . . . If an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual \u201ca place parallel to that filled by . . . God\u201d in traditionally religious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as much entitled to a \u201creligious\u201d conscientious objector exemption under \u00a7 6(j) as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions. 398 U.S. at 339-340, 90 S.Ct. at 1796.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965) referred to by Justice Black in the above passage, the Court had held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition. 380 U.S. at 176, 85 S.Ct. at 859.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">While both of these passages had specific reference to the pre-1967 requirement that an individual\u2019s belief be \u201cin a relation to a Supreme Being,\u201d 62 Stat. 612, the Court\u2019s analyses of the beliefs professed by Seeger and Welsh indicate that in both cases the quoted passages were intended to be given the broadest possible application, not only with respect to the \u201cSupreme Being\u201d requirement, but with respect to the \u201cphilosophical\u201d and \u201cpersonal moral code\u201d exceptions as well. Thus, the Court in <em>Seeger </em>held that a stated \u201cbelief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed,\u201d 380 U.S. at 166, 85 S.Ct. at 854, qualified under section 6(j) even though the petitioner in that case \u201ccited such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza for support of his ethical belief in intellectual and moral integrity \u2018without belief in God, except in the remotest sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly in <em>Welsh, </em>Justice Black held that the petitioner there had met the requirements of section 6(j) even though his \u201cconscientious objection to war was undeniably based in part on his perception of world politics.\u201d 398 U.S. at 342, 90 S.Ct. at 1797. Justice Black continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">Welsh stated that he \u201cbelieve[dj the taking of life \u2014 anyone\u2019s life \u2014 to be morally wrong.\u201d App. 44. In his original conscientious objector application he wrote the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">\u201cI believe that human life is valuable in and of itself; in its living; therefore I will not injure or kill another human being. This belief (and the corresponding \u2018duty\u2019 to abstain from violence toward another person) is not \u2018superior to those arising from any human relation.\u2019 On the contrary: <em>it is essential to every human relation. </em>I cannot, therefore, conscientiously comply with the Government\u2019s insistence that I assume duties which I feel are immoral and totally repugnant.\u201d App. 10. [Original emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Welsh elaborated his beliefs in later communications with Selective Service officials. On the basis of these beliefs and the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that he held them \u201cwith the strength of more traditional religious convictions,\u201d 404 F.2d [1078], at 1081, we think Welsh was clearly entitled to a conscientious objector exemption. Section 6(j) requires no more. That section exempts from military service all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war. 398 U.S. at 343-344, 90 S.Ct. at 1798.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">It is clear beyond any doubt that the beliefs expressed in Bush\u2019s Form 150 and in his subsequent memorandum are of a type that <em>prima facie </em>occupy in his life \u201ca place parallel to that filled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>God of those admittedly qualifying for the exception.\u201d <em>Seeger, supra. </em>Moreover, these documents clearly show the kind of belief which, if sincerely held, \u201cwould give [Bush] no rest or peace if [he] allowed [himself] to become a part of an instrument of war.\u201d <em>Welsh, supra. </em>Certainly Bush\u2019s statement of beliefs cannot be fairly distinguished from the beliefs described in this court\u2019s opinion in United States ex rel. Hemes v. McNulty, <em>supra, </em>where the petitioner referred to his own beliefs as \u201cmy personal moral code,\u201d and described his concept of \u201cGod\u201d as \u201cman\u2019s ability to know love and enter into love relationships.\u201d 432 F.2d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Finally we note that Bush\u2019s statement of beliefs indicates very clearly that his opposition is to war \u201cin any form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We therefore hold that Bush has stated a <em>prima facie </em>case of conscientious objection to war as contemplated by section 6(j) of the Selective Service Act of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Having held that Bush has stated a <em>prima facie </em>case of conscientious objection to war we now must determine whether the record in this case clearly indicates that the decisions of the local board and the appeal board were based on some specific ground having a demonstrated basis in fact and a supportable basis in law. The elements of a claim for C-0 status are set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion in Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 700, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 2070, 29 L.Ed.2d 810 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akz\">In order to qualify for classification as a conscientious objector, a registrant must satisfy three basic tests. He must show that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form. Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, [91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168]. He must show that this opposition is based upon religious training and belief, as the term has been construed in our decisions. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, [85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733]; Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, [90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308]. And he must show that This objection is sincere. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, [75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">Because we have already eliminated the questions of \u201creligious training and belief\u201d and opposition to war \u201cin any form,\u201d our inquiry is limited to whether or not Bush\u2019s stated beliefs were sincerely held. However it is not enough for us merely to find a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for a finding of insincerity. In order to affirm this conviction, and thereby affirm the denial of Bush\u2019s C-0 claim, we would also have to determine <em>with assurance </em>that the local board and the appeal board based their actual decisions on a finding of insincerity and not on an evaluation of the substance of his stated beliefs. <em>Lemmens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">The Government urges five factual bases apparent on the face of the record upon which the local board and appeal board could have determined that Bush was insincere: 1) his participation in a mandatory R.O.T.C. program at Purdue University in 1964, almost two years prior to his initial C-0 claim, 2) an alleged suicide attempt, 3) his employment by Chrysler Corporation, which is a manufacturer of military vehicles and equipment, 4) his failure to reassert his original C-0 claim at every available point instead of relying on student deferments, and 5) his \u201cjuggling of priorities\u201d among his deferment claims. An examination of the record reveals, however, that while it is <em>possible </em>that the local and appeal boards could have concluded that one \u00f3r more of these facts created an inference of insincerity, there is no way of determining <em>with assurance </em>that they did so or that this was the basis for their ultimate rejection of Bush\u2019s claim. We are therefore bound under <em>Lemmens </em>to reverse this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">. Although Bush did in fact initiate an appeal on the basis of hardship, this appeal was withdrawn on April 18, 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-12\">. <em>See also </em>Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 703-705, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 29 L.Ed.2d 810 (1971), and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">. The government urges that other materials in the file are relevant to the determination of whether Bush has stated a <em>prima facie </em>claim. In effect, it urges that since Bush carries a burden to support his C-O claim he must show sincerity as an element of his <em>prima facie </em>statement. We reject this contention. Sincerity is a question of fact as to which reasonable minds may well differ. One of the primary reasons for the <em>Lemmens </em>rule is to insure that such issues are first considered by local draft boards, and that federal courts know when rejection of a C-O claim by a local board rests on such a consideration rather than on an evaluation of the beliefs themselves. To inject any element of sincerity into the <em>Lemmens prima facie </em>test would defeat this fundamental purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">Nor is this inconsistent with our previous opinion in Bresette v. Knutson, 443 F.2d 179 (7th Cir. 1971). In that case the issue was not the sufficiency of a <em>prima facie </em>statement of conscientious objection to war in the <em>Lemmens </em>situation, but rather the sufficiency of such a statement for purposes of reopening a registrant\u2019s classification under Selective Service regulations. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. Moreover, in <em>Bresette </em>the registrant failed to state any <em>beliefs </em>whatsoever, relying instead on a rather emotional, but nevertheless bald assertion of \u201cconscientious objection to the tyranny of your system and the unjust deaths that it enacts.\u201d 443 F.2d at 180. <em>Bresette. </em>is therefore clearly distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
