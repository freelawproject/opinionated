Markey, Chief Judge, United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b895-30\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b895-31\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b895-32\">This case presents the question whether severe chronic alcoholism and related drug abuse, standing alone, can, if serious enough, amount to a disability as defined in the Social Security Act. Section 416(i) of Title 42, United States Code, defines \u201cdisability\u201d as: \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d Section 423(d) contains the identical definition, and adds in subparagraph (3): \u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a \u2018physical or mental impairment\u2019 is an impairment that results from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The decision of the Secretary\u2019s Hearing Examiner denied Griffis\u2019 claim and was approved by the Appeals Council, thus becoming a final decision of the Secretary. The district court upheld the Secretary\u2019s decision. Griffis appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The record is full of evidence that Griffis has long suffered from severe chronic alcoholism and related drug abuse, and the Hearing Examiner so found. Some of his discussion of the evidence in this opinion can be read as finding that Griffis, in spite of his problem, is not unable to engage in any gainful activity as the statute requires. However, in the portion of his opinion entitled \u201cDecision,\u201d the Hearing Examiner stated his findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">(3) The claimant suffers from severe chronic alcoholism and related drug abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">(4) This addiction, rather than any underlying physical and mental impairment is the primary cause of the claimant\u2019s inability to obtain work or remain employed when he does obtain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">(5) Such chronic addiction is, absent underlying physical or mental impairments of sufficient severity, insufficient basis to support a finding of entitlement to disability benefits under the Social Security Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">These findings lead us to conclude that the Examiner applied an improper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The proposition that chronic acute alcoholism is itself a disease, \u201ca medically determinable physical or mental impairment,\u201d is hardly debatable today. The Secretary does not disagree. We know, too, that alcoholism is often accompanied by underlying severe physical or mental impairment, or both, although this is not always the case. The question presented to the Secretary was whether Griffis\u2019 impairment was serious enough to make him disabled \u2014 that is, unable to engage in any gainful activity. The presence or absence of \u201cunderlying\u201d physical or mental impairment as accompaniments or products of the disease may be relevant evidence relating to the decision of that question, but absence of them is not controlling. On this proposition most of the cases are in agreement. Lewis v. Celebrezze, 4 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 398, 400 (dictum); Mullins v. Cohen, W.D.Va., 1969, 296 F.Supp. 260, 263 (similar); Evans v. Richardson, E.D.Cal.1973, CCH U.I.R. If 17,024; Hernandez v. Richardson, N.D.Cal., 1973, CCH U.I.R. 1f 17,-046; c<em>f. </em>Rosas v. Montgomery, 1970, 10 Cal.App.3d 77, 88 Cal.Rptr. 907.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also in point is Marion v. Gardner, 8 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 175, in which Judge Blackmun, as he then was, found that \u201cdespite the apparent absence of any impairment other than his (sexually) deviant tendencies, (the applicant) meets the disability requirement of the statute.\u201d 359 F.2d 181. This decision was made in the face of a regulation . of the Secretary, since repealed (former 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1519(c)(2)), which provided, with specific reference to sexual deviation and alcoholism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-14\">In the absence of an associated severe psychoneurosis or psychosis, a personality disorder does not in itself result in inability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">Because the Hearing Examiner applied an improper legal standard to the evidence, the Secretary\u2019s decision cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>stand. Kovac v. I.N.S., 9 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 102, 104. We express no opinion as to what the ultimate decision in the case should be. There should be a new hearing, at which the proper standard will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to vacate the Secretary\u2019s decision and to remand the case to the Secretary for a further hearing at which the proper legal standard will be applied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-12\">. Three decisions appear to be to the contrary: Thompson v. Flemming, D.Or., 1960, 188 F.Supp. 123; Mays v. Ribicoff, S.D.W. Va., 1962, 206 F.Supp. 170; and Echols v. Gardner, S.D.Tex., 1967, 276 F.Supp. 499. In <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Echols, </em>the court relied on another regulation, since repealed. They are thus not in point now. In <em>Mays </em>there was a determination that Mays could work. In so far as <em>Mays </em>can be read as holding that an alcoholic can never be found disabled because all that he need do is \u201cstop alcohol,\u201d we think it wrong. Some alcoholics can stop; more cannot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
