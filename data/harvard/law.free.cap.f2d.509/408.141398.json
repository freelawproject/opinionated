Second, he asserts that the trial court committed plain error by admitting a reference to appellant\u2019s pri- or criminal record without a cautionary instruction. Finally, he argues that the jury instruction given as to the question of whether appellant\u2019s abnormal mental condition negated the required intent for first degree murder was prejudicial. While we express some dissatisfaction with the latter jury instruction, we find no basis for reversal and hence, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Around midnight on July 27, 1971, decedent Charles Sanders and his friend Jay Washington went out to get something to eat. While walking, they met appellant Peterson who spoke briefly with Sanders. During their meal, Sanders wrote his address on a piece of paper, which Washington later saw him give to Peterson. Tr. 92 \u2014 93. Soon thereafter, the pair separated, Sanders, having asked Washington to telephone him later to see if he \u201cwas all right\u201d, walked in the direction of his apartment. Sanders, an admitted homosexual, had on previous occasions asked Washington to telephone him \u201cwhen he was going home with someone.\u201d Tr. 107, 111. At 3:00 a.m., Washington telephoned Sanders, who indicated that Peterson was with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Sanders\u2019 body was found in the bathtub of his apartment by a building employee two days later; a butcher knife was still embedded in his chest. He had been stabbed twice, once in the back and once in the chest which had caused the more severe injury. Tr. 30, 36 \u2014 37. A trail of blood was discovered leading from the living room to the bathroom, and a glass by Sanders\u2019 bed yielded a fingerprint which was later determined to belong to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">On August 16, 1971, Peterson was arrested as he fled from the scene of a street robbery. Taken to the station-house and advised of his rights, appellant became nervous at the mention of fingerprinting and blurted out, \u201cAs soon as you fingerprint me, you got me. I want to talk to somebody from homicide. I killed a man.\u201d Tr. 117. Peterson then confessed to Officer Ronald Norton that he had gone to decedent\u2019s apartment and, while there, went into the kitchen and procured a butcher knife. Appellant concealed the knife and \u201cwalked around a little bit.\u201d Tr. 118. When Sanders turned his back to him and bent over the bed, Peterson stabbed him once by the spine. At Peterson\u2019s command the decedent staggered to the bathroom where appellant ordered him to turn around and then stabbed him in the chest. Asked to explain his reason for the killing, Peterson told Officer Norton that Sanders \u201chad made fun of him when he was with his women.\u201d Tr. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Appellant was next transported to the homicide squad office, where he gave a written statement. He stated that he had known Sanders \u201cabout two or three months\u201d and on the night of his death had met Sanders \u201cand another sissy.\u201d He recounted that he and Sanders had been unobserved entering the apartment building except by \u201cthe man behind the front desk, but he did not pay any attention to us.\u201d Tr. 132-33. The statement then contained the following description of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">He [Sanders] wanted me because he was sissy. I told him that he would have to pay for it. At this time I told him that he would have to pay me. He stated that he did not pay anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">I then told him that he must not want me if he did not want to pay for it. Then I got up off the bed and started walking around and thinking. Then I went into the kitchen and got a butcher knife. I stuck [it] into my pants so he could not see it and went back into the bedroom. He was bending down fixing his shoe. At this time I stabbed him in the back. The knife went all the way through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">Then I took it out. I then told him to go over and stand by the bathroom. He could hardly make it over there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>but he did as I told him. He was standing up in the doorway to the bathroom, and I stabbed him again. I think it was under his heart. I left the knife in him that time. At this time he fell in the bathtub.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Tr. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">At trial, the only disputed issue was whether Peterson had premeditated and deliberated the killing. The defense presented one witness, Dr. Harold Kaufman, a psychiatrist. He testified that he had interviewed appellant and his mother and had reviewed reports on Peterson by other experts. Dr. Kaufman\u2019s primary conclusion was that Peterson \u201cwas suffering from an explosive personality disorder\u201d which left him unable to premeditate and deliberate under the circumstances of the killing. Tr. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Under cross-examination, Dr. Kaufman retracted some of his testimony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and admitted that previous psychiatrists in 1968 had found their initial diagnosis was erroneous and that Peterson had faked mental illness. Tr. 252-55. In rebuttal the government presented another psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Robertson of Saint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital who testified that he had examined Peterson and opined that at the time of the offense appellant \u201cwas not suffering from any mental disorder\u201d. Tr. 321. Dr. Robertson expressed disagreement with Dr. Kaufman\u2019s finding that Peterson suffered the \u201cmental disorder of explosive personality,\u201d both because his symptoms were inconsistent with that diagnosis and because \u201call people who committed criminal offenses\u201d possessed explosive personalities and it was not at all a \u201csubstantial mental disorder\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The jury returned a guilty verdict of murder in the first degree. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal for first degree murder because of the insufficiency of the government\u2019s proof as to premeditation and deliberation. Appellant places primary reliance on our decisions in Austin v. United States, 127 U.S.App. D.C. 180, 382 F.2d 129 (1967) and Hemphill v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 402 F.2d 187 (1968) for the proposition that in first degree murder cases the jury cannot be left impermissibly free to speculate about the defendant\u2019s mental processes at the time of the offense. He then argues that the government failed to introduce any evidence which took the issue out of the realm of speculation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Our starting point is the distinction between the quantum of proof required for submission of the charge to the jury and that which is necessary for conviction. To grant a motion for acquittal, the court must find that when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence is such that a reasonable juror <em>must </em>have a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any of the essential elements of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Bethea, 143 U.S.App. D.C. 68, 70, 442 F.2d 790, 792 (1971); United States v. Sutton, 138 U.S.App. D.C. 208, 216, 426 F.2d 1202, 1210 (1969); Austin v. United States, <em>supra, </em>382 F.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Under the District of Columbia first degree murder statute, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401 (1973) those essential elements include deliberation and premeditation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>We have noted previously that Congress attempted through these elements to establish a demarcation between the degrees of homicide, which we must strive to preserve. <em>See </em>Austin v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Consequently, the government must introduce facts which provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed not merely intentionally, in sustained frenzy or heat of passion, but with premeditation and deliberation. I'd. at 140. As Judge Leventhal wrote in Hemphill v. United States, <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 191:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axj\">Premeditation and deliberation are facts, susceptible of proof like any other facts in a criminal trial. The jury is not supposed to be rendering a moral judgment of culpability based on whether' it likes the defendant, or is horrified by the brutality of his killing. Whatever the difficulties of proving states of mind . . . the law now puts the burden of proving premeditation and deliberation on the prosecutor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Judge Leventhal correctly identified the problem in this area \u2014 the difficulty of adducing proof as to a state of mind. The statutory elements require courts to hold the government to its burden of proof, but it also allows the flexibility to entertain probative circumstantial evidence from which to infer premeditation and deliberation. That is why in <em>Austin </em>and <em>Hemphill </em>we reversed first degree convictions where the government attempted to establish those elements primarily on the basis of the passage of sufficient time for premeditation and deliberation. Hemphill v. United States, <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 191; Austin v. United States, <em>supra, </em>382 F.2d at 139. That is also why in the absence of other evidence, we have focused on the fact of whether the defendant brought the murder weapon to the scene as highly probative of the requisite state of mind. <em>See </em>United States v. Brooks, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 8, 449 F.2d 1077, 1084 (1971); United States v. Sutton, <em>supra, </em>426 F.2d at 1212; Belton v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 203, 382 F.2d 150, 152 (1967). Moreover, we have held as sufficient to send the question to the jury evidence of \u201cmethodical preparation that reflected planning and premeditation,\u201d Parman v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 399 F.2d 559, 569, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 858, 89 S.Ct. 109, 21 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968) and the passage of time <em>coupled </em>with certain overheard declarations by defendants, United States v. Mack, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 167, 466 F.2d 333, 338, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 952, 93 S.Ct. 297, 34 L.Ed.2d 223 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In the instant case, the government introduced not circumstantial evidence but appellant\u2019s oral and written confessions as to the circumstances surrounding and his state of. mind during the crime. Peterson orally admitted to a police officer that he killed Sanders for ridiculing him when appellant was with women companions. In his written statement, Peterson confessed that after being told that Sanders would not pay, he \u201cgot up off the bed and started walking around thinking\u201d. He procured the butcher knife, secreted it, waited until decedent\u2019s back was turned, and then stabbed him. These facts clearly are probative of a determination to kill reached calmly sometime before the act and of reflection upon the preconceived design to kill, turning it over in the mind. <em>See </em>United States v. Sutton, <em>supra; </em>Austin v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Further, the actual sequence of the killing, the waiting until Sanders\u2019 back was turned and the ordering of the wounded man into the bathroom where the second, fatal blow was struck evidences \u201cmethodical preparation\u201d reflecting planning and premeditation. See Parman v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Appellant responds to these statements by arguing that Peterson\u2019s reference to Sanders mocking of him in front of women was \u201ca wisp of testimony [which] \u2018serves to raise doubts rather than resolve them.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26, <em>citing </em>Hemphill v. United States, <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 190. He argues that the incident is neither fully explored nor corroborated and is a \u201cflimsy foundation\u201d for a jury verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 26 \u2014 27. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>rebutting the written confession, appellant asserts that the version detailed there contradicts the governments\u2019 theory. Instead, the statement, he argues, paints a clear portrait of a crime committed by a man lashing out on impulse, not by premeditation and deliberation. <em>Id. </em>at 27 \u2014 28. Appellant concludes that \u201c[t]hese fragments of evidence, contradictory as well as inconclusive, cannot sustain the prosecutor\u2019s <em>heavy </em>burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Like the trial judge and the jury, we fail to see how appellant\u2019s admissions do not contain any evidence of the mental elements in question. In any event, appellant\u2019s argument misconceives the distinction between the government\u2019s burden of proof to withstand a motion for acquittal and its heavy burden to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We see no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, is not such that a reasonable juror must have a reasonable doubt. The issue was properly left to the jury, which rendered its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction was erroneous in equating premeditation with intent to kill and constituted plain error. The trial court\u2019s first degree murder instruction was given verbatim from the book of recommended instructions published by the District of Columbia Bar Association.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, appellant argues that by equating premeditation with intent to kill the trial court effectively blurred the demarcation between first and second degree murder established by Congress and recognized by this court in <em>Austin. </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 34. While conceding that this often invoked instruction has been generally upheld by the Supreme Court in Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 470, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946) and by this court in <em>Austin </em>and United States v. Bryant, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 72, 79, 471 F.2d 1040, 1046 (1972), appellant contends that the objectionable portion was never specifically considered in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">We find appellant\u2019s argument without merit. The instruction defines premeditation as \u201cthe <em>formation </em>of the intent to kill\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, this court in United States v. Sutton defined premeditation with the jury instruction attacked here. 426 F.2d at 1211.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Belton v. United States, we did not find plain error in a briefer charge than at issue here, a charge which basically instructed that premeditation was \u201cthe formation of the intent or plan to kill\u201d. 382 F.2d at 152-153. The <em>Belton </em>panel took into account that the instruction on premeditation was conjoined with the instruction on deliberation \u2014 requiring \u201creflection\u201d and \u201cfurther thought upon this plan ... to kill.\u201d Similarly, the jury considering appellant\u2019s fate was charged on the need to show deliberation beyond a reasonable doubt, and instructed: \u201cDeliberation involves giving consideration and reflection upon the preconceived design to kill, turning it over in his mind, and giving it a second thought.\u201d Tr. 366. In sum, we find neither prejudice nor plain error in the instructions given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Appellant next asserts that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury as to its leeway to consider whether defendant\u2019s abnormal mental condition negated his ability to form the requisite mental state for first degree murder. Appellant argues that the instruction given conflicted with our <em>en banc </em>opinion in United States v. Brawner, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 30, 471 F.2d 969, 998 (1972), and constituted plain, prejudicial error. Since this is the first case to reach this court since the <em>Brawner </em>decision where the defendant has introduced evidence of an abnormal mental condition as tending to show that he did not possess the requisite mental state, we should briefly review what <em>Brawner </em>established.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Brawner, </em>this court held that expert testimony may be received as competent evidence as to whether defendant had the specific mental state required for a particular crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">We recognize that the receipt of this expert testimony requires \u201ccareful administration by the trial judge.\u201d As Judge Leventhal wrote in <em>Brawner:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4BS\">the judge may, and ordinarily would, require counsel first to make a proffer of the proof to be adduced outside the presence of the jury. The judge will then determine whether the testimony is grounded in sufficient scientific support to warrant use in the courtroom, and whether it would aid the jury in reaching a decision on the ultimate issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1002 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">To capsulize, the threshold issue therefore is the classic question of relevancy. As with any piece of evidence, the trial judge is called upon to weigh the probative versus the potential prejudicial nature of the evidence proffered. The judge must determine whether the evidence is sufficiently grounded in scientific fact and whether it directly addresses the mental element at issue so that its introduction will not unduly distract or mislead the jury from the determination it must make. <em>See generally </em>McCormick on Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 184-85 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">We, therefore, note with approval that the trial judge in the instant case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>insisted on a proffer of defendant\u2019s medical testimony. Tr. 180-87. According to the record, the judge did receive some representations as to the medical conclusions to which the expert witness would testify. Tr. 187-91, 198-200. However, we find nowhere on the record any indication that defense counsel proffered the scientific basis for the witness\u2019 conclusions. We reiterate that only after receiving a complete proffer can the trial judge discharge the responsibilities that the <em>Brawner </em>opinion contemplated the administration of this rule demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Appellant contends that the instruction given on this issue constituted plain error. That instruction, which is reprinted below,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is a modification of the model insanity instructions set out in the <em>Brawner </em>opinion. 471 F.2d at 1008. Appellant argues that the instruction wrongly required the jury to find that the defendant had a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d as defined in McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847 (1962) before they could consider the medical evidence, that the charge confused the jury by referring to the presumption of sanity, and that the instruction erroneously told the jury to decide whether Peterson \u201c \u2018was <em>incapable </em>of the premeditation and deliberation required for murder in the first degree.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41-43 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">We agree with appellant that the instruction was an unnecessarily elaborate application of what the <em>Brawner </em>rule required. The doctrine enunciated in <em>Brawner </em>does not require a jury to consider a new, additional determination necessitating detailed instruction. The jury in this situation has only one factual determination to make \u2014 whether the defendant deliberated and premeditated the killing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What <em>Brawner </em>establishes is that the jury may now be aided in that determination by the receipt of competent medical evidence. When the rule is carefully administered by the trial judge, we think a simple, straight-forward instruction will suffice. As a model,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we believe the inclusion of a single sentence from the proposed <em>Brawner </em>insanity instruction in the standard first degree murder charge is satisfactory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">In determining whether [premeditation and deliberation] has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt you may consider the testimony as to the defendant\u2019s abnormal mental condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>471 F.2d at 1008. Coupled with the approved instruction on the role of an expert medical witness,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think that such a procedure will adequately instruct the jury without undue confusion about the determination it must make.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">While expressing dissatisfaction with the instruction given in this case, we do not believe it requires reversal. The instruction, while proposed by the prosecutor, was the subject of a conference between the prosecutor and defense counsel and after it was delivered to the jury, was approved by defense counsel. Tr. 4 \u2014 5, 192, 198 \u2014 99, 378. Appellant\u2019s first argument is that by incorporating the <em>McDonald </em>definition of medical disease, the instruction omits other medical evidence which the <em>Brawner </em>rule contemplated would be admissible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with appellant as to admissibility, for as our <em>Brawner </em>opinion explicitly stated: \u201cFor example, the defendant may offer evidence of mental condition not qualifying as mental disease under <em>McDonald.\u201d </em>471 F.2d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">However, we do not see how the instruction prejudiced this particular defendant. Appellant\u2019s expert witness testified that Peterson suffered from an explosive personality disorder that substantially affected his emotional and mental responses and distorted his behavior in a way that made him unable to premeditate and deliberate \u2014 a condition that would fall within the definition of mental disease given to the jury. Tr. 212, 233 \u2014 34. The government attempted to impeach the basis of the expert\u2019s conclusion and in rebuttal called its own expert who opined that appellant \u201cwas not suffering from any mental disorder.\u201d Tr. 321. The question for jury resolution, therefore, did not revolve around whether Peterson\u2019s condition did or did not fall within the <em>McDonald </em>definition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but around the credibility and weight to be given to the medical evidence. We find no plain error as regards this portion of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"ABK\">As to appellant\u2019s argument on the instruction\u2019s reference to the presumption of sanity, while we agree that the paragraph is surplusage, we cannot find plain error in light of the instruction\u2019s directive that \u201cthe presumption no longer controls\u201d when evidence of an abnormal mental condition is introduced. Appellant\u2019s final argument is that the charge instructs the jury in terms of whether Peterson was <em>incapable </em>of premeditation. We agree with appellant that the issue was whether appellant in fact premeditated, and the jury was so charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">It is possible that the trial judge was influenced by a statement in <em>Brawner. </em>After discussing the possibility that an abnormal condition might not absolve a defendant of criminal responsibility (because he retained the capacity to control his behavior and appreciate the wrongfulness of his act), but yet might negate the mental state required for a particular crime, the <em>Brawner </em>opinion continued: \u201ce. <em>g., </em>if the abnormal mental condition existing at the time of the homicide deprived him of the capacity for the premeditation required for first degree murder.\u201d That reference to the abnormal condition negating capacity for premeditation at the time of the homicide was identified as an example, and was not meant to be exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">An abnormal mental condition may influence the probability that a defendant premeditated and deliberated \u2014 and so be taken into account by a jury in determining whether those states of mind ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>isted in fact (beyond a reasonable doubt) \u2014even though it did not eliminate the capacity for premeditation. This problem would be eliminated by use of the simple instruction set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">However, we cannot say the charge as given constituted plain and prejudicial error. In the instant case, the key testimony of defendants expert witness was that in view of defendant\u2019s abnormal mental condition, he did not think defendant \u201cwas <em>able </em>to premeditate and deliberate.\u201d Tr. 233. The charge tracked that testimony. No request or objection brought into focus the particular issue now relied upon. Under the circumstances, we do not think this presents a case of prejudicial error in which the instruction detoured the jury from the ultimate factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We think our conclusion that the instruction did not constitute plain error is buttressed by what we perceive is appellant\u2019s failure even to point to such error in the record. Appellant argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEY\">if this Court strains to find that the errors in the charge were nonprejudicial, it will forego the opportunity to establish clearly what the proper instruction should be for use in future cases involving similar use of medical testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 18. We hope that our discussion of the <em>Brawner </em>rule will aid the trial court judges who must administer it. We believe that we have established the type of instruction contemplated by that rule. To do so, however, does not require reversal of this conviction when faced with a record that reveals the absence of plain error or prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Finally, we briefly dispose of appellant\u2019s final argument that the trial court committed plain error by admitting without a cautionary instruction testimony relating to Peterson\u2019s prior criminal activity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The challenged testimony was given by the defense\u2019s own expert witness, Dr. Kaufman. In relating the basis for his medical conclusion, the witness referred to, as one source for his diagnosis, previous' hospital reports made during a period where Peterson was confined after a non-guilty verdict for reasons of insanity. On cross-examination, the witness revealed that the reports indicated that Peterson had been \u201cmalingering\u201d and that he had never had any disorder during the time of confinement or at the time of the 1968 crime. Tr. 252 \u2014 55; <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">This testimony was clearly relevant and admissible both to apprise the jury of the factual foundation for the witness\u2019 conclusion and as evidence as to the credibility of that diagnosis. <em>See </em>United States v. Bennett, 148 U.S.App. D.C. 364, 368, 460 F.2d 872, 876 (1972). The testimony was obviously elicited for that reason; in no way did it impeach the defendant. In fact, the defendant never did testify at trial. Consequently, this situation is simply outside the rationale of the rule enunciated in the <em>Jones </em>and <em>McClain </em>cases, where we held that the failure to give a cautionary instruction was plain error where prior crime evidence was admitted for impeachment of the defendant or to show malice. <em>See </em>United States v. McClain, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 213, 440 F.2d 241 (1971); Jones v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 385 F.2d 296 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">In sum, we have examined carefully each of the arguments that appellant has ably raised, but find that none of them give cause for reversal. The judgment, therefore, is</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">.

The correctness of the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal must be reviewed on the basis of the evidence as it stood at the close of the government\u2019s case. A defendant who puts on a defense after denial of such a motion does not waive his challenge. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v.

In short, premeditation is the formation of specific intent to kill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">The last element involves deliberation.

Peterson, in so injuring the deceased, ha[s] acted with deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">Deliberation involves giving consideration and reflection upon the preconceived design to kill, turning it over in his mind, and giving it a second thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">Although premeditation, which is the formation of a design to kill, may be instantaneous, as quick as thought itself, it is necessary that an appreciable time elapse between formation of the design and the fatal act within which there is, in fact, deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\">The law prescribes no particular period of time. It necessarily varies according to the circumstances of each case. Consideration of the matter may continue over a prolonged period, hours, days, or even longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-18\">Then, again, ladies and gentlemen, it may cover a span of mere minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-19\">If one forming an intent to kill does not act instantly, but pauses and actually gives a second thought in connection to the intended act, he has, in fact, deliberated.
