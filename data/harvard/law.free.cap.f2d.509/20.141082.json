WRIGHT, Circuit Judge;</author>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">This is an appeal from an order declaring invalid certain provisions of the California Labor Code and related orders of the California Industrial Welfare Commission requiring payment of premium overtime pay to covered women employees. The district court found that the provisions in question were in conflict with and superseded by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (1970)].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>that plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the California statute did not give rise to an unlawful employment practice under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Homemakers is an employer of domestic workers and persons who care for the sick in patients\u2019 homes. It initiated this action to restrain appellant state agencies from enforcing against it those women\u2019s premium overtime pay provisions in Cal. Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1350 and 1350.5 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which it claimed would require it to discriminate in favor of women in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In response, appellants reasoned that the challenged statutes and orders presented no inevitable conflict with federal law, since Homemakers could comply readily with both federal and state requirements by extending the benefits of the premium overtime pay legislation to its male as well as to its female employees. Indeed, they argued that state and federal \u201cequal pay\u201d laws, <em>see </em>Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 1197.5 (1970); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (1970), require employers to pay both sexes at the higher overtime pay rates provided for women. Appellants relied also on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] guidelines which make it a violation of Title VII for an employer to refuse to hire female employees in order to avoid payment of overtime, or for an employer to fail to provide its male employees with the same benefits required under state law for its female employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The district court rejected these arguments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and refused to follow an Eighth Circuit decision extending the benefits of the Arkansas women\u2019s premium overtime pay statute to all employees in the state on the same grounds as those advanced by appellants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so holding, the district court also ruled that the EEOC\u2019s power to issue procedural regulations does not include authority to issue regulations which would modify state substantive law to the degree urged by appellants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">Similarly, the district court found that it would be beyond its own power to interpret the challenged statutes in a way which would significantly expand the statutorily designated class of beneficiaries. Although such an interpretation might provide the consistency between the challenged statutes and federal law necessary for upholding the former, it would usurp the legislative power vested exclusively in the state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">Such judicial restraint appears particularly warranted in light of the legislative intent which both parties concede to underlie those portions of the state labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>code of which the challenged provisions are a part. This court has previously relied on this intent (to afford special protection for women employees) in invalidating other \u201cprotective\u201d legislation in the California Labor Code as unlawfully discriminatory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We are persuaded by Judge Renfrew\u2019s historical observation that the premium overtime pay provisions of sections 1350 and 1350.5 were part and parcel of the entire body of state law seeking to provide special protection for women workers. We are also persuaded by his conclusion that it is not within the province of the federal courts to attempt to determine how far, if at all, subsequent state legislation has shown an intent to redirect the original focus of these premium pay provisions, unless that intention is clearly shown.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is particularly true when the reading requested by appellants (to extend the premium overtime pay provisions to male workers) would impose a sizeable economic burden on employers affected by sections 1350 and 1350.5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Finally, we note that the California legislature has recently enacted legislation which will cure the defects of the earlier enactments by expressly allowing the Industrial Commission to prescribe overtime premium pay rates applicable to male and female employees alike. Act of Oct. 1, 1973, Assembly Bill No. 478. Enactment of this legislation, after a similar bill had been vetoed the previous year, would seem to indicate the legislature\u2019s realization that the prior version of the overtime pay provisions inaccurately expressed, or was inadequate to express, its current policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">We agree with the opinion of the district court, and affirm its holding that the statutes and orders in question conflict with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and therefore cannot be enforced against plaintiff-appellee Homemakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">.

At least one state supreme court has recently adopted this view. In Idaho Trailer Coach Ass\u2019n v. Brown, 95 Idaho 910, 523 P.2d 42 (S.Ct.Idaho, 1974), the Idaho Supreme Court found that subsequent state antidiscrimination legislation had repealed that state\u2019s premium overtime pay for women law by implication. Therefore, the Idaho court did not need to consider the trial court\u2019s alternative holding that the challenged statute was also unenforceable because it was in conflict with Title VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b81-24\">. Moreover, it would be particularly speculative for a court to extent the benefits of the statute only to the male employees of these employers covered by the challenged provisions. To do so would seem to assume that the legislature would want the same group of industries subject to premium overtime pay requirements for all employees as had originally been selected as the foci of the maximum hours limitations for women set out in section 1350.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
