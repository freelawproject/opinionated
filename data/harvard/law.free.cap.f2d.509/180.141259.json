FPC, 503 F.2d 844 (5th Cir. 1974).. If LP&amp;L is dissatisfied with the FPC\u2019s decision after remand, it will be free to seek appropriate review from the FPC and the Court of Appeals under the provisions of section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">LP&amp;L\u2019s petition for review by this Court seeks to present us an issue in an unusual posture. The sequence of material events is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">1. On January 12, 1973, FPC entered an Order and Opinion No. 647 which resulted in all of the gas used by LP&amp;L to generate electricity being placed in the lowest priority category of United\u2019s interim gas curtailment plan. Gas ultimately used by domestic customers was given highest priority. LP&amp;L did not seek a rehearing of this decision, although others did and appealed to the court from a denial of rehearing. Louisiana v. FPC, 503 F.2d 844 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">2. Subsequent events led LP&amp;L to question United\u2019s allocation to its resale customers under the interim plan. LP&amp;L asserted that interruptible industrial users, with no more than equal priority to LP&amp;L, were, in fact, receiving gas under a higher priority by buying from United\u2019s resale customers, which obtained such gas under the higher domestic priority. This situation led LP&amp;L to file a motion with FPC on November 29, 1973, basically seeking to have FPC examine the facts underlying United\u2019s allocation plan and if necessary, order United to \u201ccease from not following the plan\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">3. On December 29, 1973, LP&amp;L\u2019s motion was denied by operation of law, FPC not having acted on the motion within thirty (30) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">4. On January 8, 1974, LP&amp;L sought a rehearing of the denial of its motion of November 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">5. FPC denied the motion for rehearing on February 27, 1974, stating that it considered LP&amp;L\u2019s motion an attempt to attack the FPC Opinion No. 647 collaterally, and FPC would not consider the merits presented in that manner, where a proper petition for rehearing of Opinion 647 had not been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">6. On April 26, 1974, LP&amp;L filed in this Court a petition for review of the February 27th denial of rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">7. On August 2, 1974, FPC filed a motion in this Court to dismiss LP&amp;L\u2019s petition as an unauthorized collateral attack on its Opinion 647. The motion to dismiss has been carried with the case by order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">8. On November 8, 1974, this Court issued its decision in Louisiana v. FPC, 503 F.2d 844 (5th Cir. 1974), which remanded Opinions 647 and 647A to the FPC for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-20\">9. On November 25, 1974, FPC filed the instant motion for remand of the record to it for reconsideration of the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s contentions along with the rest of the issues directed to be reconsidered by Louisiana v. FPC. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>motion was supported by United and opposed by LP&amp;L and the State of Louisian\u00e1 and its allied intervenors.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Were this Court to refuse the remand, as LP&amp;L requests, and proceed with the case, it would not reach the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s claim. Instead our review would be limited to one question: was the FPC correct in refusing to consider the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s motion on the basis that such motion was an attempt to attack FPC Opinion 647 collaterally. Were we to decide that FPC was correct, we would merely affirm its decision not to consider the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s claim. On the other hand, were we to decide FPC should have considered the merits, we would remand the entire matter to FPC with directions that it consider the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s motion. We would at that time not consider the merits of LP&amp;L\u2019s claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>FPC v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 393 U.S. 71, 89 S.Ct. 55, 21 L.Ed.2d 55 (1968); <em>cf. </em>J. M. Huber Corp. v. Denman, 367 F.2d 104, 111 \u2014 121 (5th Cir. 1967). There would not be sufficient record before us, even if we were inclined to rule on its claim before the FPC had done so. Such being the case, the most relief that LP&amp;L could receive is a remand for consideration of the merits of its claim, and this is precisely what FPC has requested that it be allowed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We view an immediate remand as in the best interest of all intervenors even those who feel \u201cjustice delayed is justice denied\u201d as to them because of the anticipated winter natural gas shortages. We are giving the only justice these intervenors could receive at this time from this Court faster than they would receive it if we fully considered LP&amp;L\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Therefore, it is ordered that the previous action of FPC concerning LP&amp;L\u2019s motion is vacated and the record in this case is remanded to FPC, with direction that LP&amp;L be allowed to present the merits of its contentions regarding United\u2019s alleged illegal activity for initial consideration by FPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Remanded with direction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
