BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1035-21\">On March 8, 1973, at a point on the high seas approximately 35 miles from the coast of Florida and 11.9 miles from the nearest island of the Bahamas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States Coast Guard officers boarded the American owned M/V Big L which at the time was being towed by the American owned M/V Adventurer III and promptly located over a half a ton of marijuana which they knew to be aboard. The four members of the M/V Big L\u2019s crew, appellants Winter and Davis (both Jamaican nationals), appellant Towne (an American citizen) and co-defendant Saunders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (a Bahamian national) were immediately arrested and brought into the Southern District of Florida. Appellant Parks (an American citizen) was arrested the following morning when he was found concealed aboard M/V Adventurer III in Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-22\">Appellants entered pleas of <em>nolo contendere </em>to an indictment pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 963<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> charging them with conspiring to import 1,130 pounds of marijuana, a schedule I controlled substance, into the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Appellants are before us challenging alleged defects in the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over their persons and over the crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Through separate briefs and oral argument, appellants raise a variety of theories each incorporated by reference by the rest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Essentially, however, the following challenges of significance are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">(1) Were the Jamaican nationals, Winter and Davis, charged with a crime over which the District Court had jurisdiction assuming that they were arrested beyond the territory of the United States, were not alleged to have been within the United States during the pendency of the conspiracy and all the overt acts alleged in the indictment related solely to the conduct within the United States of appellant Parks, an American citizen?</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">(2) May either the Jamaican appellants or the Americans challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over their persons on the ground that they were unlawfully brought within the Court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction following an illegal arrest by the Coast Guard?</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">(3) Were any of the appellants, most particularly Parks, misled into believing that they would be permitted to appeal non-jurisdictional aspects of the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress in contradiction to our decisions in United States v. Sepe, 5 Cir., 1973, 486 F.2d 1044 (en banc) affirming 474 F.2d 784; United States v. Mizell, 5 Cir., 1973, 488 F.2d 97? <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">After indictment, appellants entered pleas of not guilty and moved to dismiss the indictment for a lack of jurisdiction over their persons and the crime and to suppress the contraband seized aboard M/V Big L. The facts we set out were adduced by stipulation and testimony at the hearings before the District Court on the motions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and to suppress and upon the entry of the pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">\n<em>Smuggling By The High Seas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">On January 3, 1973 an individual named \u201cDave\u201d and Michael Force (aka Michael Parks) approached Roy Warren in Miami and offered to pay him $15,-000.00, $2,500.00 in advance, for the use of his boat M/V Adventurer III to import a load of marijuana into the United States from Jamaica. Shortly thereafter, Warren contacted the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) and informed them of the offer. The BNDD advised Warren to cooperate, assisted him in making necessary alterations <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to his boat and provided him with certain navigational equipment required by the enterprise. Not content with assisting in the role of one who victuals and supplies, the Government engaged in man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>ning, <em>cf. </em>46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186, by supplying two BNDD undercover agents to accompany Warren on the voyage as members of the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">\n<em>The Scene Shifts To Land</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Once in Jamaica, Warren met Parks and accompanied him into the hills where he was introduced to a number of Jamaicans, including an individual known as \u201cLouis\u201d (aka Stanton Davis), who was allegedly, involved in \u201cputting the load together.\u201d During the course of the enterprise, Warren kept in close contact with supervisory officials of the BNDD. Warren relayed the message that the boat was loaded and ready to go.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">\n<em>Back To The High Seas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">On Monday, March 5, BNDD agent Cooke received another call from Warren from Grand Cayman in the Bahamas, informing him that they were proceeding with one and one-half to two tons of marijuana on board as well as with \u201cLouis\u201d and another Jamaican who were returning with them to the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Warren further informed Cooke that after refueling on Wednesday or Thursday, M/V Adventurer III would rendezvous at dusk with a 38 foot fishing vessel from Ft. Lauderdale called M/V Big L in the. vicinity of Riding Rocks<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the marijuana would be transferred to that vessel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">\n<em>Seagoing Surveillance And Boarding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">From time to time on the 7th and the 8th, the BNDD maintained aerial surveillance of both vessels while they were tracked by radar from C/G cutter Dauntless. Between 7:30 and 9:30 on the 8th, Warren informed the BNDD agents aboard C/G Dauntless by radio that the contraband and the two Jamaicans had been transferred to M/V Big L. Approximately 30 minutes later, Warren radioed that M/V Big L had developed engine trouble and had been taken under tow by M/V Adventurer III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">Shortly thereafter the C/G Dauntless accosted the vessels. By stipulation, the position of the vessels at the time of the encounter was 35 miles from the closest point on the Florida coast and 11.9 miles from North Cat Cay, the closest point in the Bahamas.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">Upon boarding M/V Big L, the Coast Guard officers and BNDD agents ordered the four individuals aboard to move toward the afterend of the boat. In the process of checking the hold for further crew members, a BNDD agent, to no one\u2019s great surprise, located the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">\n<em>The Conspiracy Terminates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">The four individuals found aboard M/V Big L were immediately placed under arrest,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Parks was arrested the following morning aboard M/V Adventurer III, and all were thereafter indicted in the Southern District of Florida. The enterprise was ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">\n<em>Plea Bargaining</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and suppress were denied. The government disclosed that it intended to use three confidential informers and agreed to make them available to defense counsel for questioning. Apparently after hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ing interviewed at least one of these informers, defense counsel entered into plea negotiations with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">At a hearing before the Court on April 23, 1973 all defendants agreed to enter pleas of <em>nolo contendere. </em>In exchange the government promised to make specific sentencing recommendations to the Court. Before accepting the pleas, the District Court carefully instructed the defendants that while a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>would constitute a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects, challenges to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction could still be pursued on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After accepting the pleas, the Court sentenced Parks to three years, Davis to 18 months, Towne to 9 months, Winter to 6 months, and Saunders to 18 months.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">\n<em>Jurisdiction Over The Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">The Jamaican appellants, Winter and Davis, were arrested on the high seas 35 miles from the coast of Florida aboard a small vessel carrying over a half ton of marijuana. We will assume, as contended by these appellants, that the boarding and arrests occurred beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There has been no contention that either the contraband or the alien defendants were present within the territorial limits of the United States prior to the involuntary termination of the conspiracy. All three overt acts alleged in the indictment related solely to the conduct of American appellant Parks within the state of Florida which took place prior to the events on the high seas.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">' Under these circumstances did the indictment and stipulated facts state a crime against the United States over which the District Court had jurisdiction in regard to Jamaican nationals Winter and Davis? A survey of the precedent compels us to answer affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">In Strassheim v. Daily, 1910, 221 U.S. 280, 31 S.Ct. 558, 55 L.Ed. 735, the Court was faced with the question of whether Daily of Chicago, Illinois was properly extraditable to Michigan as a fugitive from justice, having been indicted in Michigan for bribery and obtaining money from the state bn false pretenses. Acting in concert with Michigan state officials, Daily was alleged to have sold old machinery to the state, while willfully misrepresenting it was new. Assuming at the outset that Daily had not personally committed any pertinent act within the territory of Michigan, Justice Holmes, writing for a unanimous court, observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-11\">If a jury should believe the evidence, and find that Daily did the acts that led Armstrong to betray his trust, deceived the board of control, and induced by fraud the payment by the state, the usage of the civilized world would warrant Michigan, in-punishing him, although he never had set foot in the state until after the fraud was complete. Acts done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it, justify a state in punishing the cause of the harm as if he had been present at the effect, if the state should succeed in getting him within its power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aot\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>221 U.S. at 284-85, 31 S.Ct. at 560, 55 L.Ed. at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">In Ford v. United States, 1927, 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793, the principle was applied to facts more closely resembling those we confront. The defendants were indicted and convicted for conspiring to import liquor into the United States in violation of the prohibition laws. Appellants had been arrested with the contraband aboard a British vessel on the high seas. The jurisdiction of the District Court was challenged on the ground that some of the co-conspirators were never present within the territory of the United States during the pendency of the conspiracy. The Court dismissed this argument noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-6\">The conspiracy was continuously in operation between the defendants in the United States and those on the high seas adjacent thereto, and of the four overt acts committed in pursuance thereof, three were completed and took effect within the United States, and the fourth failed of its effect only by reason of the intervention of federal officers. In other words, the conspiring was directed to violation of the United States law within the United States, by men within and without it, and everything done was at the procuration and by the agency of each for the other in pursuance of the conspiracy and the intended illegal importation. In such a case all are guilty of the offense of conspiring to violate the United States law whether they are in or out of the Country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">273 U.S. at 620, 47 S.Ct. at 540, 71 L.Ed. at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">This Circuit has applied the same principle recently on several occasions. In Marin v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 352 F.2d 174 the Court relied on <em>Ford </em>in affirming a conviction under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 for conspiring to smuggle heroin into the United States despite the fact that the defendant had not set foot within the United States during the pendency of the conspiracy, but a co-conspirator had committed overt acts within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">In Rivard v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 882, cert. denied sub nom. Groleau v. United States, 389 U.S. 884, 88 S.Ct. 151, 19 L.Ed.2d 181, four Canadians had been convicted of conspiring to smuggle heroin into the United States although only one had entered the country during the pendency of the conspiracy. Recognizing that the United States subscribes to the objective view of the territorial principle of jurisdiction \u2014 that is \u201cjurisdiction extends over all acts which take effect within the sovereign even though the author is elsewhere,\u201d 375 F.2d at 886 <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 we sustained the lower court\u2019s jurisdiction over the conspiracy count pointing out that \u201c[tjhere is thus no doubt that the object of the conspiracy was to violate the narcotics laws of the United States; that the conspiracy was carried on partly in and partly out of this country; and that overt acts were committed within the United States by co-conspirators.\u201d 375 F.2d at 886.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, since heroin had actually been smuggled into the United States by one of the co-defendants, the Court affirmed the conviction of another co-defendant as a principal on a substantive count of smuggling although the latter had not entered the United States' prior to the completion of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">And even more recently we upheld jurisdiction over acts of possession, forgery and passing of United States Social Security checks which took place wholly within Mexico since the actions were \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>tended to produce and producing detrimental effects within\u201d the United States. United States v. Fernandez, 5 Cir., 1974, 496 F.2d 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">The case law clearly establishes that the District Court has jurisdiction over a conspiracy and all those proved to be conspirators if the conspiracy is designed to have criminal effects within the United States and if there is sufficient proof that at least one of the conspirators committed an overt act in fur-' therance of the conspiracy within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The indictment in the instant case alleged that co-conspirator Parks committed three seemingly innocuous overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Admittedly in <em>Ford, Marion, </em>and <em>Rivard </em>the unlawful importation of contraband into the United States actually occurred and was thus among the overt acts established. Here the conspiracy was cut short by the long arm of the law before the actual importation could take place. This is a distinction without significance, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-15\">As we recently observed in United States v. Carlton, 5 Cir., 1973, 475 F.2d 104, 106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-16\">The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement and not the commission of the crime which is the object of the conspiracy. United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 35 S.Ct. 682, 59 L.Ed. 1211. It is immaterial to the commission of the crime of conspiracy whether the object of the conspiracy is achieved. <em>Rabinowich, supra </em>Castro v. United States, <em>supra </em>[296 F.2d 540 (5th Cir.)]; and Williams v. United States, 179 F.2d 644 (5th Cir.). There must of course be an overt- act done in pursuance of the conspiracy, but such act need not constitute the very crime which-is the object of the conspiracy, <em>Rabinowich, supra</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-17\">An overt act, seemingly innocent in itself yet in furtherance of the conspiracy, is sufficient under the law of conspiracy. We see no reason why it should be any different for jurisdictional purposes,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to the extent that proof of an overt act is required.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Since appellants were clearly charged with conspiring to engage in conduct designed to have criminal effects within the United States and since an overt act in furtherance of the design was properly alleged in the indictment,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> a crime was stated over which the United States and the District Court had jurisdiction.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">\n<em>Jurisdiction Over The Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Appellants challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over their persons, contending that they were illegally arrested and unlawfully brought before the Court. Appellants contest the legality of the arrests on the following theories.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">(1) By arresting appellants 35 miles from the Florida coast, the Coast Guard exceeded its jurisdiction to arrest as prescribed by statute<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and treaty which at a maximum extends to the high seas within 12 miles of the United States coast.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>(2) By arresting appellants within 11.9 miles of the coast of the Bahamas, and hence allegedly within the exclusive territory of another sovereign foreign state, the Coast Guard violated its jurisdiction as prescribed by statute, treaty and customary international law.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">(3) By arresting appellants by self-help within the territory of the Bahamas, the Coast Guard violated the United States treaty of extradition with the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">(4) Acting in its capacity as an arm <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> of either the BNDD or the Customs Authority,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number><footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the Coast Guard violated the regulations governing those agencies by exceeding their jurisdiction to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">These challenges to the Coast Guard\u2019s jurisdiction to arrest raise interesting and perhaps difficult questions of law, largely unresolved by federal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">We do not find it necessary to decide these questions at this time, however, since we are convinced that under well established case law of the Supreme Court and this Circuit, a defendant in a federal criminal trial whether citizen or alien, whether arrested within or beyond the territory of the United States may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>not successfully challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person on the grounds that his presence before the Court was unlawfully secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Although <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>has been severely criticized,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the Second Circuit, in an extreme case of outrageous governmental conduct of physical and emotional brutality and indignity,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> has held, on the basis of post-1960 due process decisions, that <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>bends,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> in such situations the Supreme Court has not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>ceded from Ker<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> or <em>Frisbie,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and neither has this Court.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Indeed, just recently, we rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Toscanino</em><footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and held <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>applicable to a non-resident alien claiming unlawful abduction from Peru:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">[Herrera] also urges a loss of jurisdiction by reason of the failure of the United States to follow the orderly processes of extradition under the treaty between the United States and Peru.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-13\">It is settled.by both Supreme Court decisions and decisions of this court that these contentions are without merit. Ker v. Illinois, 1886, 119 U.S. 436, 444, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421; Frisbie v. Collins, 1952, 342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541; United States v. Caramian, 5 Cir., 1972, 468 F.2d 1370, 1371; United States v. Vicars, 5 Cir., 1972, 467 F.2d 452, 455; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>United States v. Cotten, 9 Cir., 1973, 471 F.2d 744, 748; Hobson v. Crouse, 10 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 561.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">United States v. Herrera, 5 Cir., 1974, 504 F.2d 859, 860. Bound as we are by <em>Herrera, </em>we think that as the Second Circuit recognized in <em>Lujan, </em>mere errors or the exertion of action by agents beyond the strict territorial limit does not make the conduct so outrageous as to invoke these more drastic remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Despite strenuous efforts by appellants to distinguish <em>Ker </em>and its progeny, we are convinced that they are controlling as to all appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">On its own facts, <em>Ker </em>precludes an attack on the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the American citizens Towne and Parks<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> since Ker himself was an American citizen forcibly abducted out of another foreign sovereign state and returned to the United States to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">\n<em>Ker-Frisbie And Nonresident Aliens</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">The Jamaican appellants Winter and Davis argue that <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>does not preclude nonresident aliens illegally seized outside of the territory of the United States and forcibly brought before a federal District Court from challenging its jurisdiction over their persons despite the fact that American citizens similarly seized would quite clearly be precluded from successfully raising such a defense. We have not discovered any precedent in which the Courts have directly confronted this issue.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">In <em>Ford, </em>the defendants were seized aboard a British vessel 25 miles from the United States coast and brought into the United States where they were indicted and convicted for conspiring to violate the prohibition laws. The United States and Britain had entered into a treaty which permitted the United States to board any British vessel within an hour\u2019s sailing distance of the United States coast and make searches and arrests necessary to the enforcement of the prohibition laws. Since the S/S Quadro was clearly beyond an hour\u2019s sailing distance of the coast, the Court was willing to conclude that the boarding officers had exceeded their jurisdiction to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">With that background it considered the challenge to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants, but ultimately sustained the convictions.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">In <em>Schouweiler </em>and <em>Ferris, </em>the defendants were arrested aboard Panamanian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>vessels well beyond an hour\u2019s' sailing distance of the coast and brought into the United States where they were indicted for conspiring to violate the prohibition laws. The United States and Panama had entered into a treaty similar to the one involved in <em>Ford. </em>Faced with a timely plea to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants, the District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of California dismissed the indictment in reliance on <em>Ford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Despite certain factual similarities, we do not believe that <em>Ford </em>will suffice to rescue the alien defendants from the preclusive grasp of <em>Ker-Frisbie. Ford, Ferris </em>and <em>Schouweiler </em>all emphasized that the arrests in issue were in clear violation of a <em>treaty </em>limiting the right of the United States to <em>board </em>the vessels of another sovereign nation. Our case by contrast involves neither the violation of a treaty<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> nor a reproach to the vessels of another power. We doubt that <em>Ford </em>is at all applicable in the absence of these operative factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">In addition, the continuing viability of <em>Ford </em>may well have been significantly undermined even on its own facts, by <em>Frisbie. Ford\u2019s </em>treatment of the challenge to jurisdiction of the person based on a violation of treaty appears consonant with <em>Ker\u2019s </em>reluctance to find a violation of due process \u201cunless there was some <em>positive provision </em>of the constitution or of the laws of this country violated in bringing him into court . . ..\u201d 119 U.S. at 440, 7 S.Ct. at 227, 30 L.Ed. at 423 (emphasis added). In <em>Ford </em>the violation of the treaty constituted such a violation of a <em>positive provision </em>of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">In <em>Frisbie, </em>however, the Court was willing to assume a violation of the federal Kidnapping Act \u2014 clearly a positive provision of federal law \u2014 and yet still find the <em>Ker </em>doctrine dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">We conclude that <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>applies to the nonresident aliens as well.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">\n<em>The Separate Claims Of Parks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">Due to the individual circumstances of Parks\u2019 arrest<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> he undertakes to assert different attacks from those of his unsuccessful co-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">Parks through his very knowledgeable counsel attempts to lay out a course in the tortuous waters between Scylla and Charybdis. Recognizing that on the porthand, as an American having been arrested within the territorial limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>of the United States, he cannot challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person based on the illegal arrest of others on the high seas,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and, on the starboard hand under Sepe<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the validity of a search and seizure cannot ordinarily escalate to a reserved \u201cjurisdictional\u201d issue, he tries by dead reckoning to steer a middle course. Divining it as best we can, Parks argues that the Coast Guard illegally boarded and searched the vessel, discovered the contraband and then made the arrests, and consequently the arrest of co-appellants aboard M/V Big L, as well as Parks\u2019 own arrest aboard M/V Adventurer III in Miami, were fruits of an illegal search.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">But this theory founders on either the left or right and if \u2014 and it is a big if \u2014 the Odyssean (after Odysseus) course is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d one then it stands on the merits. In the circumstances of this case \u2014 which, like <em>Mizell, supra, </em>proves again the wisdom of Sepe\u2019s limitations \u2014 we decline to transplant the roots of the poisonous tree to the 460 fathom deep seabed westward of the Great Bahama Bank.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> As to the so-called internationally illegal boarding and \u201csearch\u201d of M/V Big L, Parks, on the kind of record <em>Sepe </em>permits, cannot begin to show that his identity or connection with the enterprise was due to the operation \u201cHigh Seas.\u201d He had already been tagged\u2019by the owner of Adventurer III, whose reliability was sufficiently established by his continuous contact with the agents spelling out exact times, places, loading, departure and planned rendezvous. To connect Parks with the enterprise did not depend on what was <em>found </em>aboard M/V Big L.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">At the least, for a <em>Sepe </em>plea-showing this confirmed the existence of the plan \u2014 facts which, independent of the half ton of contraband, could have been proved by the presence of the \u201cplanted\u201d crew members and the close surveillance of hovering agents aloft and aboard C/G Dauntless, \u2014 so close in fact, as to have precipitated all these International law problems with the admittedly High Seas but a tenth of a mile off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">\n<em>Need For Repleading</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">As each of the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d issues asserted by each appellant have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>been found wanting, we have given full faith to the District Court's agreement on the <em>nolo </em>plea.

In addition to reliance on the overt acts of Parks alleged in the indictment, the government asserts that it could readily prove overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within United States territory by each defendant if necessary. This argument proceeds from the fact that all the defendants but Parks were seized along with the contraband aboard M/V Big L, an American owned and registered vessel, coupled with the often employed fiction that for purposes of criminal jurisdiction, a vessel is deemed to be part of the territory of the sovereign whose flag it flies. See Lauritzen v. Larsen, 1953, 345 U.S. 571, 585, 73 S.Ct. 921, 97 L.Ed. 1254; United States v. Flores, 1933, 289 U.S. 137, 155-59, 53 S.Ct. 580, 77 L.Ed. 1086; 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7.

There is little, if any current authority, construing the jurisdictional prerequisites of the statute. Rather, most of the case law regarding enforcement authority dates from the days of prohibition and arose either pursuant to the jurisdictional provisions of the former Customs statutes authorizing boarding, search, seizure and arrest aboard any vessel within four marine leagues of the United States coast or pursuant to bilateral prohibition enforcement treaties which allow the Coast Guard (or predecessor) to board, search and arrest on a vessel of the party state within an hour\u2019s sailing distance of the coast ' (measured by the vessel\u2019s sailing speed).

Appellants reach this conclusion largely in reliance on Article 24 of The Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, 1958, 15 U.S.T. 1606, T.I.A.S. No. 5639, 516 U.N.T.S. 205, to which the United States is \u00e1 party and which provides that a coastal state may exercise control over an area contiguous to its territorial sea but not extending beyond 12 miles from its coast for the purpose of preventing and punishing infringements of its customs, fiscal immigration and sanitary regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">To a lesser extent, appellants rely on Article 6 of the treaty that allows a state to define the limits of its own territorial sea (presumably within the 12 mile maximum provided for the contiguous zone) in which it may exercise exclusive control. The United States has long claimed a three mile territorial sea. See Statement of the Law of Foreign Relations of the United States 2d (1969) \u00a7 15, Reporters Note 1. See also United States v.

The Court held that a defendant who has been convicted in a state court may not challenge the indictment or a conviction thereunder on the ground that he was improperly brought within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law. The Court further held that since the treaty of extradition between the United States and Peru did not confer a right to asylum on the defendant, he could not object to the fact that the state of Illinois had acquired custody over him through self-help rather than legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Eleven years later in Ex Parte Johnson, 1897, 167 U.S. 120, 17 S.Ct. 735, 42 L.Ed. 103, the Court clearly indicated that the <em>Ker </em>doctrine was equally applicable to defendants in federal criminal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">.

They rest on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.

It related to a trial in a state court, and this court found that the illegal seizure of the defendant therein violated neither the federal Constitution, nor a federal law, nor a treaty of the United States, and so that the validity of their trial after alleged seizure was not a matter of federal cognizance.

The proper way of raising the issue of fact of the place of seizure was by a plea to the jurisdiction. A plea to the jurisdiction must precede the plea of not guilty. Such a plea was not filed.
