Molbreak v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 61 T.C. 382 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The basic issue presented on the appeal is whether the appellants held a parcel of real estate which they sold May 19, 1967 for more than six months within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1223. Taxpayers had treated the profit under section 1223 as long-term capital gain. The Commissioner disagreed on the holding period and assessed the deficiencies and the Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The resolution of the basic issue in turn depends upon whether the taxpayers accomplished an exchange of property rights in 1967 within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031. The facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Upon the basis of briefs and oral argument and upon consideration of the record, we are satisfied that the Tax Court reached the correct result for the proper reasons. Accordingly, we adopt as the opinion of this court the decision of the Tax Court and affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
