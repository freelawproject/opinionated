Appellant does not contend that the evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to return a verdict of guilty but seeks reversal of his conviction on the grounds that the government improperly employed subpoenas for the purpose of commanding the attendance of prospective witnesses at a unilateral pretrial interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-16\">In preparation for the trial, the government attorney obtained blank subpoenas from the district court clerk and issued them to prospective trial witnesses commanding attendance at a pretrial interview at his office. When appellant discovered that the government had caused subpoenas to be served for this purpose, he sought an order permitting him to subpoena the same witnesses for a pretrial interview or, alternatively, to require the government to furnish him copies of all written statements given by the witnesses or summaries of the interviews. The district court, in denying the motion, stated, \u201cThis has been a long-standing practice within the Department of Justice which we will allow until directed to do otherwise by a higher court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-17\">Appellant contends that he was prejudiced by this abuse of the subpoena power in three ways: (1) that his former wife was asked questions based upon the pretrial interview for the purpose of impeaching her testimony; (2) that, like his co-defendant, he might have pleaded guilty to the charge and might have received a sentence less severe than eighteen months had he been permitted to attend the pretrial interview; and (3) that a preview of the witnesses\u2019 testimony would have furnished him grounds for moving for a severance of trial on one count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-18\">There is no question that the government\u2019s action of obtaining blank trial subpoenas from the court clerk and of using them to compel witnesses to attend an interview miles from the place of trial and at a proceeding other than an authorized one was highly improper. Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-19\">\u201c(a) ... A subpoena shall be issued by the clerk under the seal of the court. It shall state the name of the court and the title, if any, of the proceeding, and shall command each per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>son to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein. The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed and sealed but otherwise in blank to a party requesting it, who shall fill in the blanks before it is served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-5\">(c) . . . The court may direct that books, papers, documents or objects designated in the subpoena be produced before the court at a time prior to the trial or prior to the time when they are to be offered in evidence and may upon their production permit the books, papers, documents or objects or portions thereof to be inspected by the parties and their attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">This rule permits a subpoena <em>ad testificandum </em>or a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to be issued only for the purpose of compelling the attendance of witnesses or the production of evidence at a formal proceeding. Only in the case of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>may the court direct that the evidence subpoenaed be produced for inspection before trial or before it is to be offered in evidence. The government\u2019s action was clearly unauthorized and improper. United States v. Hedge, 462 F.2d 220 (5th Cir. 1972). <em>See also </em>United States v. Standard Oil, 316 F.2d 884 (7th Cir. 1963); United States v. Stirone, 168 F.Supp. 490 (W.D.Pa.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">We do not, however, reverse appellant\u2019s conviction. He does not offer any explanation why a severance of a single count of the indictment would have been requested or granted had he been permitted to attend the pretrial interview. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that appellant would have pleaded guilty and would have received a less severe sentence had he been permitted to attend the pretrial interview. We do believe, however, that the government\u2019s attempted impeachment of appellant\u2019s former wife based upon statements that she allegedly made at the pretrial interview was prejudicial. A short excerpt from the government\u2019s examination of this witness is sufficient to show the dangers inherent in the impermissible subpoena practice engaged in by the Department of Justice in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-10\">Q. Were you \u2014 have we talked before about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-11\">A. You and I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-12\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-13\">A. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-14\">Q. Uh, did you give any different answers at that time than you did just then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-16\">Q. Are you sure of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-17\">A. Positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-18\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-19\">Q. Did you not say to him that you would positively not go the the Fort Campbell area with him again because you believed that these field jackets purchased by your husband were stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-20\">A. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-21\">Q. You did not say that to Agent Hilliard Thorpe of the FBI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-22\">A. No Sir; I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-23\">Q. And you are telling the truth right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-24\">A. Yes Sir; I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-25\">Q. Are you aware of what the word \u201cperjury\u201d means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-26\">A. Yes Sir; I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-27\">Q. Well, did you tell the truth to Agent Thorpe when you were interviewed by him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-28\">A. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-29\">Q. Did you not tell me last Tuesday, the nineteenth of March, that you inquired of your husband as to whether these jackets were stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-30\">A. I just told you now I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-31\">Q. Okay; and what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-32\">A. He said they were not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-33\">Q. And did you not tell him that you wouldn\u2019t go with him anymore because you thought the jackets were stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-34\">A. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-35\">Q. Did you not tell Agent Thorpe that and did you not tell me that on the nineteenth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>A. I did not tell you that, no Sir; I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-4\">Q. And I would be lying then if I said you did, and Agent Thorpe would be lying if he said you did; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-5\">A. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-6\">Q. Did you not say to Agent Thorpe that you believed that the field jackets were very likely stolen due to the circumstances under which your husband bought them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-7\">A. No Sir; I told him I had no way of knowing if those field jackets were stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-8\">Q. Didn\u2019t you tell him that you believed due to the circumstances that those jackets were stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-9\">A. No Sir; I told him I didn\u2019t like the way the field jackets were bought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-10\">Q. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cstolen\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-11\">A. No Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-12\">Q. That you thought they were stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-13\">A. No Sir; I told him I had no way of knowing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-14\">Q. And you didn\u2019t tell me that then on the nineteenth of March when we talked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-15\">A. No Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-16\">Q. And if I said you did I\u2019d be lying and if Agent Hilliard Thorpe said you did, he\u2019d be lying; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-17\">A. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-18\">Q. So, you are telling the truth and both of us have lied or would lie twice then; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-19\">A. I\u2019m telling you the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-20\">Even though we find that appellant was prejudiced in this respect, he made no objection to the testimony. Accordingly, appellant must be deemed to have waived the error which we regard as harmless in light of the other abundant evidence of guilt. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Hedge, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
