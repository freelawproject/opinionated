Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Although a previous order of this court dated September 7, 1971, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>nied leave to appeal pursuant to provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b), the precise issue posited by this motion has not previously been before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The complaint charged the Singer Company with acts constituting unfair competition, violations of the antitrust laws, and patent infringement. Rankin A. Milliken, one of plaintiff\u2019s lawyers, had previously been employed as a patent attorney for Friden, Inc., a corporation subsequently acquired by defendant Singer. Defendant alleged that, while in Friden\u2019s employ, Milliken represented the company in the matter which is the subject of this lawsuit. The district court refused to disqualify Milliken. from representing plaintiff, but did issue an order prohibiting Milliken from disclosing, using, or providing access to confidential information received by way of his employment with Friden.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The finality <em>vel non </em>of an order regulating an attorney\u2019s trial participation is not a question of first impression in other circuits. The Second and Ninth Circuits have held the <em>Cohen </em>rule inapplicable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit, however, has found sufficient collateral finality to render such an order appealable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have decided that the approach followed by the Fifth Circuit is preferable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The question of the attorney\u2019s participation at trial was \u201cnot an ingredient of the cause of action and [did] not require consideration with it.\u201d Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. 546-547, 69 S.Ct. 1226. Thus, we may consider the second prong of the <em>Cohen </em>test: whether the matter \u201cfall[s] in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">To require appellant to await a final judgment on the merits before testing the legality of the order denying the disqualification may, for practical purposes, deny it the reality of appellate processes. The precise question is whether the prohibitions imposed by the court order are sufficient to protect the interests of the defendant during the course of the trial. If, upon post-trial review, it were held that the safeguards imposed by the district court were too fragile to protect threatened interests, there could be damage inflicted upon the litigant for which the law would provide no practical remedy. Conversely, if the appeal goes forward now, prior to trial, the possibility of irreparable injury would be substantially lessened.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">We do not hold that every ruling relating to conflict of interest by an attorney should activate the <em>Cohen </em>rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decide only that these facts present a compelling argument that the \u201crights asserted in the action [are] too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself\u201d to require a postponement of appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Accordingly, we hold that the June 30, 1971, order of the district court comes within the collateral rule doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <em>supra, </em>and is a final, and, therefore, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">.
