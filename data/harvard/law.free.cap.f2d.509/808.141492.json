The district court dismissed the petition without a hearing and remanded the prosecution to the state courts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">In Georgia v. Rachel, 1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925, the Supreme Court formulated two prerequisites to removal under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1443(1):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (a) the person seeking removal must rely on a specific civil right granted by a law stated in terms of racial equality, and (b) must show that denial of this right would necessarily occur in state court due to the operation of a formal expression of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-20\">Bell satisfies neither prerequisite. No federal statute authorizes or immunizes the conduct with which he is charged. Greenwood v. Peacock, 1966, 384 U.S. 808, 826-27, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944. Moreover, far from alleging a deprivation of rights' arising from the operation of state law, Bell contends that the state court\u2019s action was taken in derogation of his rights under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-21\">Bell finally argues that it was error for the district court to dismiss his petition without a hearing. We disa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>gree. When it plainly appears that the allegations of the petition, even if true, are legally insufficient to state a ground for removal, no hearing into their factual merit is required. Davis v. Superior Court of California, 9 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-13\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1443(2) is inapplicable because it covers only federal officers and those acting under them.
