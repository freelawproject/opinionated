The verified petition shows that Burke was inducted into the United States Army on June 14, 1973. At the Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he supplied the examining physicians with reports of four private physicians purportedly showing that he suffered from allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Burke alleged that his induction was unlawful because it was contrary to those Army Regulations which specifically prohibit the induction of men who suffer from \u201cchronic atrophic rhinitis\u201d or, under certain circumstances, \u201cbronchial asthma.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further alleged that there was \u201cno basis in fact\u201d for the Army physicians\u2019 finding that he was fit for active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-17\">On the following day, the district court enjoined respondents from removing petitioner from the jurisdiction of the court until a judicial decision could be made. The respondents filed a motion to dismiss the petition for writ of habeas corpus on its merits. In an accompanying brief, they stated that the doctors at the Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Station considered Burke fit for military service and therefore certified him as acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-18\">In a decision and order reported at 371 F.Supp. 349 (E.D.Wis.1974), the district court granted the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss, vacated the prior restraining order and remanded Burke to the custody of the respondents pursuant to his induction order. However, the court granted an injunction which prevented the Army from exercising control over Burke pending a determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-19\">In his decision, the district judge noted that Burke had not presented to the court the reports of his four private physicians supposedly demonstrating that he has allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Next, the court held that Burke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>was required to exhaust his administrative remedies within the Selective Service System, citing United States ex rel. Taylor v. Fritz, 446 F.2d 36 (8th Cir. 1971). In that case, the Court of Appeals noted that Taylor had appealed the ruling of the Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Station doctor that he was physically acceptable for induction to the Surgeon General, who affirmed that ruling before Taylor applied for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Taylor </em>case is relevant to show that Burke could have appealed his medical acceptability to the Surgeon General, but inasmuch as respondents have abandoned the exhaustion doctrine as a ground for affirmance, we do not consider whether he was required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Apart from the exhaustion rule, the district judge determined that Burke\u2019s petition must be dismissed because there was \u201ca disagreement as to the existence or degree of the petitioner\u2019s claimed maladies between the army\u2019s doctors and the petitioner and, presumptively, his doctors.\u201d The court held that it should not resolve these conflicting views because a court should not review the discretionary judgment of military officers made within the scope of their authority, citing Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">The following Army Regulations provide the pertinent \u201ccauses for rejection\u201d applicable to inductees during peacetime: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-7\">\u201ca. <em>Allergic Manifestations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-8\">(1) Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). See paragraph 2-38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-9\">(2) Asthma. See paragraph 2-26b.\u201d (U 2-39)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-13\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-14\">\u201ca. <em>Allergic manifestations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-15\">(1) Chronic atrophic rhinitis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-16\">(2) Hay fever if severe; and if not controllable by antihistamines or by desensitization, or both.\u201d (K 2-28)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-17\">* * * * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-18\"><em>\u201cb. Bronchial asthma, </em>except for childhood asthma with a trustworthy history of freedom from symptoms since the 12th birthday.\u201d (112-26b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-19\">Under these regulations Army doctors must decide whether the claimed maladies actually exist and must also make discretionary evaluations, such as whether there is a \u201ctrustworthy history of freedom from symptoms [of bronchial asthma] since the 12th birthday,\u201d whether the rhinitis is chronic and whether the hay fever is controllable by antihistamines or desensitization. Because these regulations require such discretionary medical evaluations, a court cannot properly review the Army doctors\u2019 findings and make its own fact-finding as the arbitrator of differing medical opinions. Byrne v. Resor, 412 F.2d 774, 775 (3d Cir. 1969); see Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842. Absent some highly unusual circumstance, the courts are not permitted to inquire into a registrant\u2019s physical fitness. United States v. Sowul, 447 F.2d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir. 1971), certiorari denied, 404 U.S. 1023, 92 S.Ct. 698, 30 L.Ed.2d 672; United States v. Shunk, 438 F.2d 1204, 1204-1205 (9th Cir. 1971). We hold that presentation of the opinions of private physicians, which are contrary to those of the induction center\u2019s doctors, is not such a \u201chighly unusual circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>Petitioner relies primarily on United States v. Beckett, 457 F.2d 785 (9th Cir. 1972), and Kempf v. Commanding Officer, Fort Des Moines Examining and Entrance Station, 339 F.Supp. 320 (D.Ia. 1972). In <em>Beckett, </em>the examining physician erroneously believed that a generalized allergic reaction to insect bites or stings was not a \u201ccause for rejection.\u201d Because the examining doctor misapplied the regulations, Beckett\u2019s conviction for refusal to submit for induction was reversed. In <em>Kempf, </em>a civilian doctor under contract to the Army found petitioner fit despite his contention that he suffered from strabismus coupled with documented diplopia, which together constitute a \u201ccause for rejection.\u201d The district court held that the examining doctor misapplied the term \u201cdocumented diplopia\u201d because he misunderstood the meaning of \u201cdocumented.\u201d The court reversed the finding of fitness, but made it clear that it could do so only because the doctor misapplied the regulation and because \u201cdocumented\u201d is a legal, rather than medical, term, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-4\">\u201cThe Government has moved to dismiss Kempf\u2019s petition, asserting that the matter of physical examination is a determination made by the military and is not subject to review. The Court notices that there are several federal eases containing language to the effect that courts are not permitted to inquire into a registrant\u2019s physical fitness or into decisions of Army medical examiners and that a letter of a private physician contrary to the Army\u2019s findings is not enough to trigger court inquiry. [Citations omitted.] Insofar as these decisions deal with inquiry into discretionary judgments made by Army medical examiners, this Court agrees with them. It has long been held that federal courts cannot review the discretionary judgment of a military officer made within the scope of his authority. Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953). Thus, if the question before the Court was whether Kempf had strabismus, the Court would be compelled to defer to the judgment of the Army medical examiners, at least if there was a basis in fact for that decision. See United States v. Hansen, 327 F.Supp. 1090 (D.Minn.1971). Of course, the medical examiners indicate that Kempf has strabismus. The issue, then, is whether Kempf has \u2018documented diplopia.\u2019 This is not a pure medical question. Rather, it is a legal question, since, the term documented is a legal, not a medical, term. The Court knows of no case holding that a federal court must defer to the judgment of the Selective Service System or the Army\u2019s medical examiners when the issue involved is a legal issue.\u201d (339 F.Supp. at 326.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Burke has not alleged that the examining doctors misapplied the regulations, nor has he pointed to any legal terms in the pertinent regulations which were misinterpreted. Thus <em>Beckett </em>and <em>Kempf </em>are distinguishable. Burke claims to have certain \u201ccauses for rejection\u201d, the Army\u2019s doctors disagree. In the absence of an allegation that the Army\u2019s doctors misunderstood the regulations, the district court correctly refused to review their discretionary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1286-20\">. See text of regulations infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">. Taylor did not appeal his I-A classification to the Selective Service Appeal Board and to that extent had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. However, the district court and the 8th Circuit considered the merits and decided there was a basis in fact for his I-A classification and that he suffered no denial of due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">. Army Regulation 40-501, Chapter 1, Section II, paragraph 1-3, explains the effect of the presence of a \u201ccause for rejection.\u201d It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-21\">\u201cb. <em>Medically unacceptable. </em>Medical examiners will report as \u2018medically unacceptable\u2019 by reason of medical unfitness all individuals who possess any one or more of the medical conditions or physical defects listed in this regulation as a cause of rejection * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1287-22\">.
