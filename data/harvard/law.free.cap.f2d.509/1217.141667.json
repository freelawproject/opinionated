We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-22\">On December 1, 1971, William Weeks deposited in the commercial checking account which he and his wife maintained at the bank\u2019s Cloverdale branch a check drawn on a Florida bank for $13,-500. On December 3, 1971, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a notice of tax lien against the Weeks\u2019 property and served on the Cloverdale branch a notice of levy (in the amount of $670,190) against the Weeks\u2019 account. Also on December 3, or slightly before that date, Socrates Mamakos, attorney for the Weeks, presented for payment a $13,500 check drawn on their account. The Florida check had not yet cleared, and Mamakos was told that the check could not be honored for want of sufficient funds. Later, the Florida check was paid and $13,500 was credited to the Weeks\u2019 account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-23\">On December 9, 1971, Mamakos wrote a letter to the bank\u2019s attorneys claiming that he was entitled to the money in his clients\u2019 account by virtue of his presentment of their check before the IRS levy. As Mamakos suggested, the bank' then filed an action in interpleader in state court, naming the Weeks, Mamakos, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>the government as defendants. At the government\u2019s behest, the action was removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441(a) and 2410(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">Shortly thereafter, on March 1, 1972, Mamakos disclaimed any interest in the interpleaded funds and advised the bank\u2019s attorneys that his clients no longer contested the government\u2019s right to collect the money. The bank, however, declined the government\u2019s invitation to stipulate to the dismissal of the action, refusing to pay over the interpleaded funds unless it could deduct its costs and reasonable attorneys fees (approximately $547.50). The government then moved for summary judgment, and the bank moved for discharge with a direction to pay over the money to the government less its costs and fees. On November 10, 1972, the district judge granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the bank\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Almost a month later, the bank filed its Rule 60(b) motion, alleging that the district judge\u2019s memorandum opinion was based on an erroneous finding of fact, that the IRS levy occurred about the same time as, or after, the proceeds from the Florida check were credited to the Weeks\u2019 account, and on an incorrect conclusion of law, that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6332(d) provides an absolute defense against a third party claimant for. a stakeholder like the bank which satisfies the government\u2019s tax levy with contested funds. The district judge properly denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Under Rule 60(b)(1), a district judge may grant relief from a judgment predicated on \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d. His ruling on such a motion may not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that he has abused his discretion. Martella v. Marine Cooks <em>&amp; </em>Stewards Union, 9 Cir., 1971, 448 F.2d 729;. Title v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 28, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">Assuming, without deciding, that this is a proper case for entertaining a Rule 60(b) motion, which we seriously doubt, we find no abuse of discretion. The bank argues that because there were no funds in the Weeks\u2019 account at the time the IRS served its notice, the levy was ineffective. <em>(See 26 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the bank failed to raise the point in opposition to the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, asserting it only after judgment had been entered. This alone indicates that denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion. We note also that the argument is incorrect. The IRS, on December 3, 1971, gave notice not only of a tax <em>levy, see 26 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6331-6332, but of a tax <em>lien, see 26 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. This lien attached to all after-acquired property of the Weeks, including their Cloverdale bank account. Glass City Bank v. United States, 1945, 326 U.S. 265, 66 S.Ct. 108, 90 L.Ed. 56; Seaboard Surety Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 855, 859. Thus, had the bank correctly investigated its' legal position before filing its action in interpleader, it would have discovered the government\u2019s paramount and unquestionable right to the disputed funds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-11\">Even were we to hold that the IRS levy was ineffective, the district court on remand would have to disallow the bank\u2019s claims for costs and attorneys fees. Such claims may not diminish the portion of an interpleaded fund to which the government is entitled by virtue of a federal tax lien. Seaboard Surety Co. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>United States v. State National Bank of Connecticut, 2 Cir., 1970, 421 F.2d 519; Spinks v. Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>5 Cir., 1974, 499 F.2d 339. <em>See </em>United States v. R. F. Ball Construction Co., 1958, 355 U.S. 587, 78 S.Ct. 442, 2 L.Ed.2d 510; United States v. Liverpool 6 London &amp; Globe Insurance Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 215, 75 S.Ct. 247, 99 L.Ed. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">. This argument obviously depends on the fact that funds from payment of the Florida check were not credited to the Weeks\u2019 account until after the IRS levy. The bank is correct in asserting that the district court erroneously found that the levy occurred after, or at about the same time as, the Florida funds were credited, but the court\u2019s error was harmless for the reasons stated below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1277-12\">. Even if 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6332(d) does not provide an absolute defense against third party claimants to money paid in satisfaction of a tax lien, but only against taxpayers claiming the funds, \u00a7 6321 and the cases cited above clearly establish the government\u2019s right to the money in the Weeks\u2019 account.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
