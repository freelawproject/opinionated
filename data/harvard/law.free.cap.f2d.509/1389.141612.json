The named plaintiffs are black voters in Commissioners\u2019 Precincts 3 and 4. The defendants are the County Judge and the four County Commissioners. At a pretrial conference on April 16, 1973, it was agreed that the case would be passed until the Commission redistricted itself in August, 1973. A new plan was adopted which plaintiffs alleged failed to cure the defects in the 1971 plan. The case was tried, beginning January 15, 1974. The district court entered its judgment on January 30, 1974, denying relief to the plaintiffs. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-24\">On appeal the plaintiffs-appellants contend that the district court either applied the wrong standard of law or was clearly erroneous in its findings of fact. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-25\">The constitutional test actually applied by the district court was stated in its opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-26\">\u201cIt is well established that to prove the existence of a constitutionally impermissible redisricting [sic] plan in the absence of malapportionment, plaintiffs must show (1) a racially motivated gerrymander, or a plan drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>along racial lines,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>or </em>(2) the apportionment plan would operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political. elements of the voting population.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An apportionment scheme is not constitutionally impermissible merely because its lines are not carefully drawn to ensure representation to sizable racial, ethnic, economic or religious groups.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-11\">(App. p. 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">Though stated in different language, that standard of law does not differ materially from the standard as variously stated by this Court in Zimmer v. McKeithen (en <em>banc), 5 </em>Cir. 1973, 485 F.2d 1297, 1303; Turner v. McKeithen, 5 Cir. 1973, 490 F.2d 191, 193-197; Moore v. Leflore County Board of Election Commissioners, 5 Cir. 1974, 502 F.2d 621, 623, 624; Robinson v. Commissioners Court, Anderson County, 5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-13\">Dallas County contains several incorporated municipalities, the largest being the City of Dallas. According to the 1970 Census, the population of the County was 1,327,321, of which 72.59% were white, 16.61% black, 6.26% Mexican-American, and 4.54% unknown. Approximately 90% of the black population lived in the City of Dallas and were nearly all concentrated in one part of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-14\">The Commissioners\u2019 Court is the governing and legislative body for the County, charged with the County\u2019s \u201cgeneral operation,\u201d with the approval of the budget of county departments and of elected county officials, and with the appointment of members of the boards of the County Hospital and of the County Welfare Department. The Commissioners\u2019 Court is comprised of four commissioners, elected from precincts or districts, and the County Judge, elected from the County-at-large. Historically, the precincts or districts have been formed by dividing the County into quadrants: district one-northwest quadrant, district two-northeast quadrant, district three-southeast quadrant, district four-southwest quadrant. The Commissioners\u2019 Court has authority in odd-numbered years to revise boundaries of the districts. Every even-numbered year two commissioners are elected for four-year terms. Commissioners from districts 1 and 3 run in presidential election years, while those from districts 2 and 4 run in other even-numbered years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-16\">In the 1971 plan, the Commissioners\u2019 Court satisfied the constitutional requirement of \u201cone man, one vote,\u201d but was challenged as being racially discriminatory. Specifically the complaint charged that the north-south boundary line between districts 3 and 4 was a gerrymander which had the effect of removing a square-shaped area, densely populated with black citizens, out of district 3 and placing it in district 4, thus preventing the election of a black resident of district 3 and diluting \u201cthe black vote that existed in old Precinct District Three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-17\">In the 1973 plan, the Commissioners\u2019 Court substantially straightened the 1971 peculiarly shaped boundary line between districts 3 and 4 without creating inequality of population between the two districts. While the 1971 plan had shifted black voters out of district 3 into district 4, the 1973 plan had the opposite effect. The district court found \u201c[u]nder \u2022the 1971 plan, 26.9% of the population in district three and 29.0% in district four were black. Under the 1973 plan 38.6% and 16.9% in districts three and four, respectively, were black. The overall effect of the 1973 plan was to shift approximately one-fourth of the black population from district four to district three.\u201d (App. 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>The district court found no substantial evidence that the adoption of either plan was racially motivated, and that finding is not seriously contested. Certainly that finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">The plaintiffs-appellants no longer claim any constitutional infirmity in the 1971 plan. Their expert political analyst testified that, in his opinion, the 1971 plan did not dilute, minimize or cancel out the voting strength of any minority group in district 3 or 4. The 1973 plan is now the target of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">In our opinion the district court adequately answered that attack as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 contention that the 1973 plan dilutes and cancels out the black vote is principally based on the testimony of political analyst Dan Weiser\u2019s projection of black population growth in Dallas County. According to Weiser the 1973 plan assures that there would not be a possibility of a black majority in any commissioner district until 1985. This forecast is based on two assumptions: (1) that 80% of the black growth from the present until 1985 will be in district four, which under the 1973 plan, has 16.9% of the black population and (2) that the total population growth in Dallas County would be uniform in each district so that the county would not have to be reapportioned again until 1985. While there is some probative evidence to support Weiser\u2019s first assumption, and no evidence to support the second, this court is of the opinion that an apportionment plan that presently passes constitutional muster but which may dilute black voting strength ten years hence, does not compel a determination that the existing plan is constitutionally impermissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-7\">\u201cThe 1973 plan increased the percentage of black voters in district three from 26.9% to 38.6% when the total black population in Dallas County is 16.6%. Also the percentage of minority voters in district three was increased from 36.6% to 46.5% when the total minority population in Dallas County is 23.5%. Further, the existing black and minority composition in commissioner district three is more favorable to blacks and minorities than Congressional and state senatorial districts located in the Dallas County area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-9\">\u201cThis court is of the opinion that the 1973 plan does not dilute the voting strength of black voters. Even assuming that 80% of the black population growth between the present and 1985 will be in district four there is no evidence that the 1973 plan will be the same plan utilized in 1985. The past history of Dallas County reflects that there has not been uniform population growth in the commissioner\u2019s [sic] districts and that commissioners court has had to periodically redistrict to satisfy the constitutional requirement of \u201cone-man, one-vote.\u201d There has been no showing that uneven population growth among the districts and periodical redistricting will not occur in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-10\">\u201cThis court is of the opinion that to require the Commissioners Court of Dallas County to reapportion commissioners districts in 1973 based on projected 1985 population statistics is beyond the constitutional mandate of Burns v. Richardson [384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966)], <em>supra. </em>Such a requirement in this case would result in mathmatical [sic] inaccuracies and the adoption of a plan which would presently dilute the voting strength of blacks in the commissioners districts of Dallas County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-11\">\u201cThere is no evidence that in the elections to be held in 1974 or 1976 that the 1973 plan would operate to minimize, cancel or dilute the voting strength of black voters. Under the record of this case, any determination as to the constitutional validity of the 1973 plan beyond the 1976 elections would be speculative and conjectural. For the foregoing reasons this court is of the opinion that the 1973 plan is constitutional.\u201d (App. 104 \u2014 106.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>It is clear that none of the findings of fact should be set aside as clearly erroneous. See F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). There may, however, be some question as to the sufficiency of the findings, specifically as to whether the district court considered the 1978 plan in the light of the past history of racial discrimination in Dallas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">This appeal is not from the opinion of the district court but from its judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzW\">\u201c . . . the nature of the evidentiary findings sufficient and appropriate to support the court\u2019s decision is for the trial court to determine in the first instance in the light of the circumstances of the particular case. We hold . . . that there must be findings, stated either in the court\u2019s opinion or separately, which are sufficient to indicate the factual basis for the ultimate conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">Kelley v. Everglades District, 1943, 319 U.S. 415, 422, 63 S.Ct. 1141, 1145, 87 L.Ed. 1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-9\">Rule 52(b) provides in part that after the entry of judgment a party may move the court to amend its findings or make additional findings. See Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2582. It does not appear that such a motion was filed in this case. The text writers emphasize that, in cases tried without a jury there should be no formal barriers to appellate review of the court\u2019s findings. See Wright and Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2581; 5 A. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice If 52.11[4]. Indeed the Rule itself provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-10\">When findings of fact are made in actions tried by the court without a jury, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings may thereafter be raised whether or not the party raising the question has made in the district court an objection to such findings or has made a motion to amend them or a motion for judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">Under the circumstances of the present case we attach no significance to the failure of the plaintiffs-appellants, to file a motion in the district court for additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-13\">On the other hand, findings \u201cshould be- construed liberally and found to be in consonance with the judgment, so long as that judgment is supported by evidence in the record.\u201d Zimmerman v. Montour Railroad Co., 3 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 97, 98; Blumenthal v. United States, 3 Cir. 1962, 306 F.2d 16, 17, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-14\">The findings and conclusions themselves are clearly susceptible of the construction that the district court considered the 1973 plan in the light of Dallas County\u2019s past history of racial discrimination. The district court specifically ruled that, \u201cThis court is of the opinion that the 1973 plan does not dilute the voting strength of black voters.\u201d Also in the constitutional test applied by the district court (ante p. 1392) it is recognized that the apportionment plan was subject to attack if it \u201cwould operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population\u201d (language borrowed from Fortson v. Dorsey, 1965, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401). The district court\u2019s opinion opted against \u201cthe adoption of a plan which would presently dilute the voting strength of blacks in the commissioner\u2019s districts of Dallas County.\u201d (ante p. 1392.) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-15\">The district court took judicial notice of the findings of fact in Graves v. Barnes, 343 F.Supp. 704 (W.D.Tex.1972), aff\u2019d sub nom. White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973). Those findings of fact state unequivocably that Blacks in Dallas, Texas, have been subject to blatant discrimination and delimit the most salient aspects of that discrimination as it pertains to the political process. The court also received testimony about racially tinged campaign \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d the effect of Black votes on earlier Dallas County elections, and the number of Blacks winning office. We attach as an Appendix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>a list showing the introductions of evidence relevant to past racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">While the court agreed to consider the evidence only if relevant, the appellant has brought no evidence to this court\u2019s attention to show that the district court failed to consider the evidence. From the record as a whole we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings were sufficient and were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">What counsel for plaintiffs-appellants asked on oral argument was a remand with direction that the Commission fedistriet itself once more, this time so that the majority of voters in at least one district be Blacks. That would be contrary to the settled rule that \u201ca minority group is not constitutionally entitled to an apportionment structure designed to maximize its political advantage.\u201d Turner v. McKeithen, <em>supra, </em>490 F.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">We find no reversible error.

I am not able to agree that the District Court correctly considered the plaintiffs\u2019 alternative theory of \u201cdilution\u201d of the black vote, that is, that redistricting, even if not racially motivated, had the effect of minimizing or cancelling out the voting strength of black citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-14\">The District Court\u2019s brief discussion of the dilution issue states that the plaintiffs\u2019 case was \u201cprincipally based\u201d on the testimony of a political analyst who projected future black population growth in Dallas County and concluded that in neither district three nor district four would there be a black majority within ten years. Having referred only to this statistical evidence of <em>future </em>demography, the District Court concluded: <em>\u201cThere is no evidence </em>that in the elections to be held in 1974 or 1976 <em>that the 1973 plan would operate to minimize, cancel or dilute </em>the voting strength of black voters.\u201d [emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-16\">A redistricting plan not devised with a discriminatory motive may nevertheless be unconstitutional. The test is whether the plan, combined with a past history of racial discrimination and present political realities, gives minority group members \u201cless opportunity than . . . other residents in the district to participate in the political processes and to elect legislators of their choice,\u201d White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 766, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 2339, 37 L.Ed.2d 314, 324 (1973), aff\u2019g in part, rev\u2019g in part Graves v. Barnes, 343 F.Supp. 704, 732 (W.D.Tex., 1972). The rule is a judicial recognition of what common sense commands \u2014 that the effect or impact of a redistricting plan cannot be evaluated accurately when considered in isolation but only when examined against the backdrop of racial discrimination in the community, past and present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-18\">We have followed White v. Regester in a series of cases. Turner v. McKeithen, 490 F.2d 191 (CA5, 1973); Moore v. LeFlore County Board of Election Commissioners, 502 F.2d 621 (CA5, 1974); and Robinson v. Commissioners Court, 505 F.2d 674 (CA5, 1974). <em>Cf. </em>Taylor v. McKeithen, 499 F.2d 893 (CA5, 1974); Reese v. Dallas County, Alabama, 505 F.2d 879, (CA5, 1974); and Bradas v. Rapides Parish Police Jury, 508 F.2d 1109 (CA5, 1975). White v. Regester itself was an affirmance of a three-judge district court decision from this circuit originally styled Graves v. Barnes. In its affirmance the Suprem\u00e9 Court relied heavily on the factual history and existent practices of discrimination found by the District Court to exist in Dallas County, Texas, the very geographical area here under consideration. 412 U.S. at 765-769, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d at 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-19\">The three-judge court in Graves v. Barnes held that \u201ca multi-member [state legislative] district in Dallas County tends to dilute or cancel out the vote of Dallas County\u2019s Negro minority,\u201d and was therefore unconstitutional.

The fact that the black community has been effectively excluded from participation in the Democratic Primary selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">7. The exclusion of black community leaders from the affairs of the Dallas Committee for Responsible Government, without whose endorsement it is difficult to secure a legislative seat or the Democratic Primary nomination. The DCRG decides how many black candidates, if any, it will slate, and then requests black leaders to recruit the candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-11\">8. Negroes in Dallas County are permitted to enter the political process in a meaningful manner \u201conly through the benevolence of the predominant white majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-12\">The foregoing constituted the past history and practices, current through 1970, as found by the three-judge district court in 1972. The trial court in the case before us took judicial notice of these findings. There is additional evidence in the record of more recent political conditions in Dallas County, but to an appellate court it is conclusive neither .that the pre-1972 conditions have been eliminated nor that they retain sufficient vigor to render the proposed districting plan unconstitutional. Taken as a whole the evidence required the trial court to consider in detail whether the 1973 plan, when judged against the backdrop of the past history of racial discrimination and present conditions, is constitutional. But there is not in its opinion any finding, mention or even hint that the court gave consideration to the combination of past history as reflected in Graves v. Barnes and current practice, as it was required to do. To the contrary, it held \u2014 after discussing only the statistics of <em>future demographic trends </em>\u2014 that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the 1973 plan .would \u201cminimize, cancel or dilute the voting strength of black voters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-14\">The result is that plaintiffs here have not been given a proper determination under currently recognized standards of whether their voting rights have been diluted by means of the challenged districting plan. I think the case should be sent back to the trial court for proper findings and rulings by the judge who heard all the testimony and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-15\">With deference to my brothers, I do not understand their determination to perpetuate a result at best dubious. Justice will not be harmed by a remand and entry of more precise findings that will dispel the cloud around this decision. The majority opinion seems to me to reveal on its face that the majority are neither confident nor even comfortable with what they have decided. Nor do I understand the methodology of the salvage effort. Judge Rives has searched the record to find illustrations of past and present practices of racial discrimination, including the judicially noticed facts of Graves v. Barnes. Recognizing that this evidence existed and was before the trial court for its consideration and that the court was bound to consider it, the majority opinion then concludes that the plaintiffs have brought no evidence to our attention (at the appellate level) to show that the District Court failed to consider what it was obligated to consider. I have two points in response:</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-16\">1. One need read only what the District Judge said. After talking of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>future he said \u201cthere is no evidence\u201d that the 1973 plan will produce dilution. <em>There is evidence, </em>substantial evidence, some of it bearing the stamp of approval of the Supreme Court. The majority\u2019s recital of the evidence does not cure the error but more firmly establishes it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">2. General conclusory statements that a burden of proof or standard has been met, <em>vel non, </em>are not adequate for judicial review under Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The requirement of adequate findings does not go to jurisdiction but to our discretion whether \u201ca full understanding of the issues [can] be reached without the aid of [additional] findings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The test is whether the findings provide \u201ca clear understanding of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision [or] whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>nent to the issues to provide a basis for decision.\u201d (Citations omitted.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the trial court\u2019s opinion there is not a single specific reference to any of the facts relating to the dilution theory based on past discrimination and present political realities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is true that we review judgments, not opinions, but a judgment is no better than the supporting facts properly found and the law properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">This case is a classic illustration of the wisdom of Rule 52(a) requiring findings and of the <em>Kelley </em>principle. Here we are, in a case affecting the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of many thousands of black citizens and the political structure of a populous and important county, engaged in a 2 \u2014 1 difference of view between appellate judges who are forced to try to divine what evidence the trial court considered and whether it had in view the correct governing law. Federal rules and practice intended to make this kind of argument as extinct as the dinosaur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">In our prior decisions we have sought to implement impeccably the mandate of the Supreme Court with respect to \u201cbenign\u201d redistricting. This case departs from that tradition. I would reverse the decision and remand to the District Court with instructions to consider the issue of non-discriminatory redistricting in light of the prior history and current political practices and to enter findings accordingly. All will then know whether the chips have fallen where under the law and the facts they should.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">. It is not our task to determine how the case got into its awkward posture. The most likely possibility seems to me to be that the District Court simply was not aware that a background of racial discrminatiori had any evidentiary relationship to dilution, but rather viewed dilution as a concept related only to the future. That is, he knew all the facts but considered only part of them to be significant (hence the discussion of future demography and the conclusion that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of dilution). The trial judge employed the \u201coperate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength\u201d [of minorities] language of Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401, 405 (1963), but cited only Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966), and Howard v. Adams County Board of Supervisors, 453 F.2d 455 (CA5, 1972), cert. denied 407 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 2461, 32 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972). Neither of those cases contains any holding on the issue. White v. Regester and Turner v. McKeithen had spelled out the meaning of minimization or dilution. Neither was cited. Of course, the District Judge could not be aware of our more recent decisions defining those terms, <em>Moore </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>because they were handed down after his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">. The leading case is Kelley v. Everglades Drainage District, 319 U.S. 415, 63 S.Ct. 1141, 87 L.Ed. 1485 (1943), from which Judge Rives quotes. The question there was whether a composition of debts of a bankrupt was \u201cfair, equitable, and for the best interests of the creditors . . ..\u201d The Court declined to reach the merits, holding that it must remand for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcO\">\u201cfindings, in such detail and exactness as the nature of the case permits, of subsidiary facts on which the ultimate conclusion of fairness can rationally be predicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4t\">\"The findings in the present case fall short of that requirement. ... It may be that adequate evidence as to these matters is in the present record. On that we do not pass, for it is not the function of this court to search the record and analyze the evidence in order to supply findings which the trial court failed to make. Nor do we intimate that findings must be made on all of the enumerated matters or need be made on no others; the nature of the evidentiary findings sufficient and appropriate to support the court\u2019s decision is for the trial court to determine in the first instance in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.

The trial court made adequate findings on facts related to the future dilution theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, while making no reference to facts relating to the alternate theory, of which the plaintiffs made a record by securing judicial notice of Graves v. Barnes. Rule 52(a) is not satisfied by hit- and-miss findings on parts of the suit. Moreover, both theories concerned what constitutes \u201cdilution\u201d of minority voting rights by means of non-racially motivated districting plans. In light of the fast development and recent uncertainty of the constitutional doctrines involved, it is especially important that the factual bases of these decisions be spelled out with clarity. The circuit courts and the Supreme Court should have concrete, substantial records and findings if they are to rule intelligently and with a sharp eye to reality in this area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
