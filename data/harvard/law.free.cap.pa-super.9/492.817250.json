J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">It appears from the record and evidence that George Bear died January 10, 1880, intestate, unmarried and without issue. Letters of administration werfe granted to Franklin Bowman, who filed his account October 28, 1880, showing a balance in hand for distribution of $1,350.17, which account was absolutely confirmed January 22, 1881. Auditors were appointed to report distribution, whose report was confirmed February 11,1881, without exception. By their report an award was made to Ann Menge, n\u00e9e Bear (her administrator), of $301.79 (daughter of Benjamin Bear, an uncle, a cousin of decedent). On December 24,1892, Elizabeth Weaver obtained a rule to open the aud itor\u2019s report and distribute the estate, which rule was discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>by the orphans\u2019 court and the decree confirmed as reported in Bear\u2019s Estate, Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 162 Pa. 547. On July 5, 1895, the present rule was taken, in support of which depositions were taken which disclosed, inter alia, that the administrator,- defendant in this case, paid the share or money awarded to Ann Menge\u2019s administrator, $301.77, to Philip D. Baker who had acted as the defendant\u2019s counsel and who reported that he was the administrator of Ann Menge; that an interval of about five years intervened from the time the administrator paid the rest of the shares to Mr. Baker in 1881 to the time that he paid Ann Menge\u2019s portion to Mr. Baker in 1886 ; that daring that time the administrator endeavored to find out if there was any one who knew anything about her; inquired of parties who ought to have known of the Bear family and failing to obtain any knowledge of her, finally paid to Mr. Baker as her administrator or representative of her estate, and took from him no refunding bond or release. It did not appear that Baker had taken out any letters of administration on the estate of the said Ann. Menge. It appeared in evidence that the said Ann Menge died in Chicago on April 8, 1895, and that Mr. Baker lived until 1892. There was no affirmative evidence that he did not pay it to her during her life. The court below held: \u201c The evidence as to the payment of the shares, which was before the court and the Supreme Court in Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 162 Pa. 547, is now before the court on the present application. We have no new evidence before us on that point. There is proof that the shares awarded to her were paid to her proper representative, in 1886, and that he lived some six years after receiving it, and that she lived some three years after he died. We therefore discharge the rule.\u201d Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (2) hr not making the following rule absolute: \u201c Rule on Franklin Bowman, administrator of George Bear, deceased, to pay over the share of Ann Menge (or Plantz) to her administrator, Thomas J.

Portee, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">George Bear died January 10, 1880, intestate. The report of the auditors upon the account of the administrator was confirmed February 11, 1881, and directed distribution to be made to the first cousins of the decedent. As to the share of Ann Menge, the auditors report\u00e9d: \u201c This daughter, Ann Bear, the evidence shows, has been absent and unheard of for a period of years sufficient to raise a legal presumption of her death; but fhe evidence does not show whether the legal period, at which the presumption would arise, occurred before or after the death \u2022of the decedent. Therefore, your auditors would award the share of the uncle, Benjamin Bear, to Ann Bear\u2019s administrator, to be appointed.\u201d In the table of distribution the award reads thus: \u201cAnn Menge, n\u00e9e Bear (her administrator), $301.79 (daughter of Benjamin Bear, and uncle, a cousin of decedent).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">It appears that the administrator held back Ann Menge\u2019s share until April 5, 1886. He then drew a check for the face \u00a1of the award to the order of Philip D. Baker, Esq. (who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the accountant\u2019s attorney), and earmarked the check by reciting that it was for \u201cMenge Bear\u2019s share in George Bear\u2019s estate.\u201d This payment was made on the faith of Baker\u2019s statement that he was the administrator of the estate of Ann Menge, or the attorney of such administrator. This was not a payment in satisfaction of the award. No one but the administrator of Ann Menge\u2019s estate was legally entitled to the money as the record stands. The burden was upon the accountant to show that he had made payment to such administrator, when challenged. That he made payment to some one, who represented himself to be the administrator, is not sufficient. It was for the accountant to see to it that he paid the person entitled. Payment to a stranger is no defense to a claim. Consequently, the accountant is still liable to an administrator, who presents proof of his legal appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The evidence discloses the fact that Ann Menge did not die until April 8, 1893. But the record of the award was not impeached or amended; and a payment had already been made to one who erroneously claimed to be an administrator. There is, therefore, nothing to raise the presumption that payment was ever made to Ann Menge in her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We cannot assent to the proposition that the payment made of this distributive share has been approved and is res adjudicata. The evidence in Weaver\u2019s Appeal, 162 Pa. 547, was that Ann Menge\u2019s money had been paid to Baker as administrator of her estate. The only evidence to contradict the statement was that no letters of administration had been taken out in Lancaster county upon her estate. Here, there is a direct attack made on the validity of the payment to Baker. The evidence that no letters were ever granted to Baker is supplemented by proof that letters have been granted to the present petitioner. Furthermore, neither Ann Menge nor the administrator of her estate appeared in the former litigation, which was an attack upon the general decree of distribution. The decision of the court below, affirmed by the Supreme Court, was upon the main question of the right to reopen a distribution directed and consummated under the order of the orphans\u2019 court, after the limitation fixed by the act of 1840, and in the absence of allegation of fraud. It cannot be that a payment to one who exhibited no letters of administration has been held to be a good payment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>against one who now comes forward with such letters in his hand, making demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The contention that the petitioner is barred by laches is not sound. This is not the case of a failure to demand an account, or to assert rights which have, by reason thereof, been ignored or overlooked. Here is a record by which the right of Ann Menge\u2019s Estate has been determined and preserved. The accountant was not injured or misled by the distributee\u2019s failure to demand payment. His duty was plain. He was required to pay it to a duly appointed administrator. Such a payment would have been a full protection under the compulsion of the decree: Devlin v. Commonwealth, 101 Pa. 278. The report of the auditors warranted him in assuming that Ann Menge was dead. He had no interest in her estate to warrant his application for letters. Indeed, his position as administrator of the one estate prevented his acting personally in the other. The case comes down to this. If Baber had taken out letters, Bowman\u2019s payment would have been a discharge; Baker not having letters, the payment was not a discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315, sec. 19, providing that all suits of an intestate\u2019s relations shall be barred in seven years on failure to present a claim, does not apply here. The claim was before the court, inasmuch as an award was made and a decree entered. This act is \u201c intended to protect administrators .... in the event of the distribution of the estate without notice .... but it never was designed that it should be used for the unjust purpose of- enabling the administrator to put the money .... in his own pocket. The administrator is a trustee for the next of kin, and while a trust subsists, the statute does not continue to run: \u201d Logan v. Richardson, 1 Pa. 372. Here the trust relation of the accountant continued until payment was made to a legally constituted administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">While the accountant must also be held to the payment of interest, we are of opinion that he was entitled to retain the fund for a reasonable time to await the appointment of an administrator. It affirmatively appears that he kept the fund on deposit in bank awaiting the claim of the distributee for a considerable time; and did not apply it to his own use. Under these circumstances, interest should run from one year from the entry of the decree: Walthour v. Walthour, 2 Grant, 102. \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>charge of interest as against an administrator is not a matter of right; a necessary consequence of money being in his hands, but depends on a variety of circumstances, such, for example, as the money being needed for the payment of debts, or other purposes, connected with the settlement of the estate: \u201d Wither\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The decree in this case is, therefore, reversed, and it is ordered that the appellee pay to the appellant the sum of $301.79, with interest from February 11, 1882.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
