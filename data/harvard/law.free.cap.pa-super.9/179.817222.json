Quinn and John M. Quinn, trading as Michael J. Quinn &amp; Sot), to recover damages for personal injuries to plaintiff caused by the alleged negligent driving of defendants\u2019 servant. There was some evidence tending to show that the trespass for which suit was brought was committed by defendants\u2019 agent wi th wilfulness. There was also some evidence tending to show that JolmM. Quinn at the time of the trespass for which the suit was brought was less than twenty years of age. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff and judgment was entered thereon. Writs of fi. fa. and ca. sa. were issued simultaneously. The defendants filed petitions for their discharge under the insolvent laws and gave bond. After hearing, the court dismissed the petition of the defendants for discharge as insolvent debtors. After dismissal of the petitions counsel for defendants in ease of their bond brought defendants to the bar of the court and offered to surrender them into the custody of the court, asking for some formal order which they might show to the keeper of the county jail as authority for the keeping of the said defendants. This order was refused. Rules were then taken to quash the ca. sa. as to Michael J. Quinn and as to John M. Quinn and suit having been brought on the insolvent bond and an affidavit of defense having been filed, the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit having-been entered, these rules were heard together. The court, after argument, discharged the rule to quash the ca. sa. and made absolute the rule for judgment agaiust the defendants in the action of trespass and Joseph C. Hutchinson as surety. All three defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">It appears from the stenographer\u2019s certificate that uo exceptions were taken to the charge of the court, and no request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>was made by counsel to have transcript of the testimony or the charge filed at the time of the trial.

If you do not believe that was so, what happened may be susceptible to two constructions, one of which is that the driver was guilty of carelessness, and the other, that he was not .... If he drove carelessly, your verdict should be for the plaintiff. But if he drove as a careful driver should drive, your verdict should be for the defendant. You have got to consider whether Buffler said, \u2018Look out, bogie, or I\u2019ll run over you,\u2019 in deciding whether or not the driver was careful under the circumstances. You have got to decide first whether the driver drove wilfully over the plaintiff or whether he did it carelessly.\u201d (2) In charging the jury as follows : \u201c The question may arise, however, about the responsibility of John M.

The defense is infancy and the infant need not raise that defense, in actions in which no affidavit of defense is required and indeed he would have no opportunity to do so before the trial; that an infant while an infant cannot be liable as a partner is well settled and needs no authority to support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">The evidence at the hearing of the petition of defendants for discharge in insolvency shows no fraud on the part of Michael J.

The surety, Hutchinson, was the only one who defended. To have saved the bond, the petitioners were bound to have surrendered to the county jail on the day the petition was dismissed. An earlier or a subsequent surrender would not save the bond: Frick v. Kitchen, 4 W. &amp; S. 30; Palethorp v. Lesher, 2 R. 272; Deitweiler v. Casselberry, 5 W. &amp; S. 179; Gallagher v.

L. 476, which did not permit the issuance of a ca. sa. if there was property. The Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755, sec. 31, does permit it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AEd\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">This is an attempt to bring up for review on one appeal the records in three separate proceedings, in each of which a final judgment has been entered. The first is a judgment on a verdict in an action of trespass against Michael J. Quinn and John M. Quinn. They complain of certain instructions given to the jury on the trial of the ease, but as no exception was taken to the charge, or request made to have it filed, before verdict rendered, and as the trial judge has declined to certify the transcript of the stenographer\u2019s notes, these assignments of error could not be considered even if the appeal from the judgment were regular: Curtis v. Winston, 186 Pa. 492. In the same proceeding one of the defendants complains of the refusal of the court to quash the ca. sa. issued simultaneously with a fi. fa. upon the judgment. But as his motion was not made until after the writ had been returned and the defendant had been discharged upon his giving bond to appear and apply for his filial discharge under the insolvent laws, and not until after a hearing had been had on his petition and it had been refused; nor until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>after the bond given in that proceeding had become forfeited, and suit had been brought upon it, it was then too late for him, or his surety to question the legality of the arrest upon the ca. sa. upon the grounds set forth in his affidavit: Winder v. Smith, 6 W. &amp; S. 424; Johnston v. Coleman, 8 W. &amp; S. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The second proceeding attempted to be brought up for rehearing grows out of the joint petition of the two Quinns for discharge under the insolvent laws, and the error assigned is the dismissal of their petition. No exception was taken to this order, and the original petition and schedules have not been printed, so that we are unable to say whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s objections thereto, and to the regularity of the proceedings are well founded. If the petition was dismissed because in the judgment of the court the evidence given on the hearing showed that the petitioners were not entitled to be discharged, the decision is conclusive and not reviewable here; the evidence given on the hearing does not come up with the record: Owen\u2019s Appeal, 140 Pa. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The third proceeding referred to was an action upon the insolvency bond in which judgment by default was entered against the two Quinns and judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was entered against Hutchinson, their surety. As we have already suggested he is not in a position to assail the legality of the arrest under the ca. sa., and none of the other reasons assigned to prevent judgment requires particular notice except that which relates to the breach of - the condition of the bond. The condition of the bond was that if the petitioners failed in obtaining their discharge as insolvent debtors they would surrender themselves to the jail of the county. They did not obtain their discharge, and instead of surrendering themselves to the county jail they appeared at the bar of the court, and through their counsel made application for an order to commit them, which order the court refused to make. This was not a compliance with the condition of the bond. They had not undertaken to obtain an order of court for their commitment, nor was their obligation to surrender themselves conditioned upon such an order being made. Nor was it essential to the exercise of their right of surrender: Marks v. Drovers\u2019 National Bank, 114 Pa. 490. On the-refusal of the court to discharge the petitioner it is his duty to surrender himself to prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in discharge of his bail, \u201c and this without any order of court for that purpose: \u201d Heilner v. Bast, 1 P. &amp; W. 267. \u201c The practice,\u201d said Mr. Justice Black, \u201c which prevails at some places, of noting on the record, that the debtor has appeared and expressed his willingness to surrender himself in discharge of his surety, may be a convenient one, and therefore ought to be encouraged, but the law does not make it necessary; such a record, not followed by an actual and voluntary surrender would leave the bond in full force, and a surrender, though not recorded, would be a perfect performance of the condition: \u201d Mullen v. Wallace, 2 Grant\u2019s Cases, 389. If the jailer will not receive him when he offers to surrender himself in good faith, he is not in default: Saunders v. Quigg, 112 Pa. 546. But he cannot set up a mere report, coming from no authorized source, that the keeper of the jail would not receive him without a commitment, as an excuse for not complying literally with the condition of his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It will be observed that Hutchinson was not a party to the record in the first two proceedings referred to, and had no interest in common with the other parties thereto. It was error to combine in one appeal these independent and collateral proceedings in which only two of the appellants are concerned with the judgment on the bond in which the three appellants are defendants. So far as the appeal and the assignments of error relate to the former proceedings, the motion to dismiss must prevail. We are not prepared to say that it was error to take out a joint appeal in the name of all the defendants from the judgment on the bond See Fotterall v. Floyd, 6 S. &amp; R. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The first four assignments of error, and the appeal, so far as it relates to the judgment in the action of trespass and the proceedings on the petition for discharge under the insolvent laws are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The fifth assignment of error is overruled and the judgment in the action on the bond is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
