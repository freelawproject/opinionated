James Wiley, a terre-tenant, filed an affidavit of defense alleging a tender as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">\u201c City and County of Philadelphia, ss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-7\">\u201c James Wiley, being duly sworn deposes and says, that he is the owner in fee of the premises out of which the ground rent issued, six months\u2019 arrears upon which is the basis of the above suit. That he has a just, true and legal defence to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action of which the following is a statement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-8\">\u201c That on or before the 30th day of August, A. D. 1898, he went to the office of Charles H. Pile, Esq., attorney for the above named plaintiff, and there made him a tender which was refused and the reason for such refusal is set forth in the letter of August 30,1898, from Charles H. Pile, Esq., to Frederick J. Shoyer, Esq., counsel for this deponent, the following of which is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-9\">\u201c \u2018 In re Ground Rent of $57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-10\">\u201c \u2018 Premises S.

P. No. 3, December term, 1896, No. 542. Judgment was entered on February 20, 1897, for two years\u2019 ground rent and interest amounting to $122.50 with interest from that time and the record costs are $48.40. The same have not been paid nor are they included in your tender and until the principal of the ground rent and all arrears, etc., are paid, I am obliged to advise my client not to execute the extinguishment of ground rent nor regard your tender as a payment in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-12\">\u201c * Yours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-13\">[Signed] \u201c \u2018 Chas H.

That said premises were purchased by this deponent from Samuel M. Clement, sheriff, at public sale on the 2d day of November, A. D. 1896, and a deed duly acknowledged and delivered to your deponent for the same. That by operation of law the defendant took said premises, freed and discharged of said judgment and interest and costs therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThat therefore the tender made as above set forth was a good tender in law, and by reason thereof and the refusal by the plaintiff to accept said tender on the ground hereinbefore set forth, there is not due and owing to said plaintiff any sum of money whatever, except as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">\u201c That said tender is hereby renewed, and the defendant is ready and willing to bring into court the said sum of $1,029.85 in full extinguishment of said ground rent and all arrears thereon, and says that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment for the amount claimed in his declaration filed.

The appellant contends that the terms of the deed deny to the grantees or their assigns the right to an extinguishment without the payment of the arrearages of such rent to the time of such payments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">So far as is known there are no authorities to support the contention of either party, and, in fact, it is believed to be an entirely new question, but the prima facies are with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">It is supposable that the covenantor in a ground rent deed, or his assigns, may promote a sale by the sheriff without notice to the ground rent landlord, and purchase for a nominal sum in order to relieve himself of his liability for arrears, and surely in such a case he would not be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-9\"><em>Frederick J. </em>Shoyer, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADq\">-The lien of the arrears for which judgment had been recovered and on account of which the tender was refused was discharged in law from the real estate bought by the terre-tenant at sheriff\u2019s sale: Mather v. McMichael, 13 Pa. 301; Foulke v. Millard, 108 Pa. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">The failure of the owner of the ground rent to protect himself at the sheriff\u2019s sale is a loss that he had no right to impose upon the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AHqj\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">By the 8th section of the Act of April 25, 1850, P. L. 569, if not before, an action of covenant would lie against the assignee of a grantee in a deed reserving a ground rent for arrears which accrued before the assignment, and a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale was an assignee within the meaning of the rule. But this personal liability was removed by the act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205, and in Foulke v. Millard, 108 Pa. 230, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>decided tbat a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale takes the land free from the lien for arrears, and in consequence a subsequent judgment for the same against the covenantor acquires no lien on the property which will support a sheriff\u2019s sale and carry the title. When, therefore, a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale pays the principal and all arrearages that have accrued since his purchase, all liability, so far as he or the land is concerned, is extinguished. Because the acceptance of the tender made by the terre-tenant would have had this effect was the reason, doubtless, why it was refused. Certainly the plaintiff had no reason to fear that it would discharge the original covenantor. The latter\u2019s liability for the rent that accrued before the sheriff\u2019s sale, so far as the proceeds of said sale were insufficient for the payment thereof, would not have been affected. But we do not think the plaintiff could refuse to accept the principal from the terre-tenant and thus indirectly compel him to pay arrearages for which neither he nor the land was liable as the price of freeing the land from the incumbrance to which it was subject. Under a fair construction of the covenant he had a right to free the land from the incumbrance by the payment of the principal and all arrearages for which either he or the land was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We decide this case upon the facts set forth in the statement and the affidavit of defense. If the sheriff\u2019s sale was brought about by fraud or collusion, or if the tender was coupled with a demand for the execution of a deed of extinguishment broader in terms than the terre-tenant was entitled to, it does not clearly appear in the pleadings. The only question before us is, whether the tender of the arrears for which this suit was brought was vitiated and rendered ineffectual by the fact that it was coupled with a tender of the principal. We decide that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant but without prejudice, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
