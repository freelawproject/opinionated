Before Gordon, P.

The third count was for an assault.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AI\">December 15, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">The jury found a verdict of guilty on second count of indictment upon which verdict sentence was entered.

H. Woodward, </em>district attorney, for commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABf\">The only counts submitted to the jury were that charging carrying concealed weapons and that charging assault. The court and jury regarded the count charging assault as the second count, and rendered verdict accordingly. The defendant was clearly guilty, and was properly convicted, and we submit that the judgment should not be arrested.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A661\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The indictment in this case contains three counts, the first charging the statutory offense of carrying concealed deadly weapons with malicious intent; the second charging the carrying of a deadly weapon with no averment of concealment or malicious intent; and the third charging an assault. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment. The court below refused the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">This case discloses one of those accidents that sometimes creep into the trial of a cause despite the care that is exercised in the administration of justice. In this case the second count of the indictment was ill pleaded, charging no crime. When the cause was on trial the learned judge doubtless noticed the defect in the second count and practically ignored it. Throughout his change he treated the cause as if it involved but two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>counts, first, for carrying concealed weapons with malicious intent, and second (third count), for an assault. When, however, the jury returned their verdict, it was \u201c guilty on second count.\u201d The record is all that we may examine in such a case. The record shows a conviction on a count charging no offense under the law. We are thus obliged to reverse the court below because of this technical defect in the record, and without any expression of our opinion as to what may, or may not have been the intention of the jury in returning their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The judgment is reversed and the defendant discharged without day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
