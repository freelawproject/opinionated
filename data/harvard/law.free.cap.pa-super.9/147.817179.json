On March 7, 1898, defendant presented his petition, praying for a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and defendant let into a defense, which rule the court below discharged, allowing the defendant a credit of $30.00. Defendant appealed. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-12\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusing to open judgment and let defendant into a defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-13\"><em>Charles E. </em>Linde, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2t\">The laws of Pennsylvania require that each physician must be registered in the prothonotary\u2019s office of the county wherein he is a practitioner of medicine : Act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 72. See also Act of May 18, 1893, P. L. 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-14\">This contract was illegal per se, and the law will not lend support to a- claim founded on its own violation: Coppell v. Hall, 7 Wallace, 542 ; Mitchell v. Smith, 1 Binn. 110; Seidenbender v. Charles, 4 S. &amp; R. 150.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-15\">The opinion of the court below reported in 7 Dist. Rep. 364, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>indicates, that which was perhaps the truth, that there was nothing the matter with the defendant, the judge saying that it seems to have been a case of \u201c malade imaginaire,\u201d and if that was true, it was the duty of the plaintiff as a reputable physician to inform the defendant, that there was nothing the matter with him, but instead led the defendant to believe he was still suffering from a malady and prescribed for it a year afterwards. This theory is corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Wharton, who practically says that there was nothing the matter with the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">The decision of the question does not depend on the oath of the defendant alone, but to this are added circumstances from which inferences may be fairly drawn corroborative of his petition, which are sufficient to overcome the writing: Stockwell v. Webster, 160 Pa. 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">If the judge is in doubt as to the weight of evidence, or as to credibility of the witnesses, a prudent course would suggest the aid of a jury: Jenkintown Bank\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 337; Crawford v.

L. 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">This very question was decided by the common pleas of Lawrence county, in a recent decision in Commonwealth v. Townley, 7 Dist. Rep. 413, where the reasons for this exception in the act of May 18, 1893, are fully discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-9\">The application of the defendant to the court below to open the judgment was an appeal to the discretion of the court. Prior to the Act of April 4, 1877, P. L. 53, this discretion could not have been reviewed on appeal except for gross abuse. Since that act the appellate court can review the decision of the lower court, but the act did not take away the discretion of the court below and on appeal this court will only decide whether the discretion has been properly exercised: Kelber v. Plow Co., 146 Pa. 485; Smith v. Times Publishing Co., 178 Pa. 481, 505.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-ZO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>December 15, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFE\">William W. Postee, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judgment sought to be opened was entered upon a judgment note given by the defendant to the plaintiff in payment for medical services to be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The grounds of the application were, first, that the plaintiff not being a registered physician, his contract was void. Second, that the medical services and treatment did not result in a cure, and that a cure was guaranteed. Third, that the defendant was not allowed sufficient credit on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he was a physician registered in Pennsylvania according to the laws of Pennsylvania, and that in 1883 he was registered in the x&gt;rothonotary\u2019s office at Pittsburg. This testimony is met by a certificate of search from the prothonotary\u2019s office in Philadelphia, dated May 23, 1898, showing that the plaintiff was not at that date registered as a practitioner of medicine and surgery in Philadelphia county. By the act of J une 8, 1881, every person who shall practice medicine or surgery is required to present to the prothonotary of the county in which he or she resides or sojourns his or her medical diploma, etc., whereupon the prothonotary shall enter the facts in the register. The plaintiff, by his testimony above stated, brought himself within the act by registration in the prothonotary\u2019s office in Pittsburg in 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The act of May 18,1893, requires that no person shall enter upon the practice of medicine or surgery unless he or she has complied with the provisions of the act, and' shall have exhibited to the prothonotary of the court of common pleas of the county in which he or she desires to practice, a license granted as provided by the act, and that thereupon he or she shall be duly registered in said county, and that any person violating the provisions of the act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">This legislation might throw some doubt on the plaintiff\u2019s right to practice medicine in Philadelphia county, were it not that the act of May 18,1893, contains the following exemption: \u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the practice of medicine and surgery within this commonwealth by any practitioner who shall have been duly registered before the first day of March, 1894, according to the terms of the act entitled \u2018An act to provide for the registration of all practitioners of medicine and surgery, approved the 8th day of J une, A. D. 1881,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and one such, registry shall be sufficient warrant to practice medicine and surgery in any county in this commonwealth.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s registry in Pittsburg sufficiently accredited him as a practitioner. This disposes of the defendant\u2019s first ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The second ground laid for the application to open the judgment is the failure of the plaintiff to perform the services which were the consideration for the giving of the note. The defendant\u2019s assertions are supported by his own testimony only and are met categorically by the testimony of the plaintiff in denial. Under these circumstances the court will not disturb the judgment as entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant was given all the credit he claimed in the court below. He was to pay the plaintiff $150. He testifies that he paid $10.00 in cash, and gave the note in suit for $140, and that since the giving of the note he made payments in cash of $30.00. The court below allowed credit to the defendant for $30.00 on the amount of the judgment. '</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">For the reasons above set forth, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
