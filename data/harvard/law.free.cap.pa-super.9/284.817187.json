Judgment was entered a\u2019gainst the defendant September 20, 1897, for want of an appearance and answer. On application, the. same day, the court granted a rule to show cause why the attachment should not be quashed and the judgment opened and set aside. On November 29 the rule was discharged. There are six terms of court each year, commencing the second Mondays of January, March, May, July, September and November, and this action was brought to the May term. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-12\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in discharging the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>M. </em>Kirkpatrick, with him <em>W.

To execute a writ is to obey the instructions contained in it: 1 Rapalje and Lawrence\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 479, sec. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">The defendant is entitled to two full terms after the execution of the writ to appear: Melloy v. Burtis, 124 Pa. 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">If, as contended, the writ is not fully executed until the return day of the term to which it is returnable, then that term must be excluded in the computation. In contemplation of law the return daj' is the time of the execution of the writ. December term was the third term after the execution of the writ in this case and the judgment entered at September term was premature and therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">It is not too late after judgment by default in foreign attachment to move to open the judgment and quash the writ: Keegan v.

Executors of Hudson, 2 Dall. 73, the attachment was dissolved after judgment was entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">In view of the severity of the remedy of foreign attachment the courts have exercised the largest powers to protect the rights of those in interest: Sergeant on Attachment, 134: Bushel v. Ins. Co., 15 S. &amp; R. 173, 182.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">The uniform practice has been for the attorney to indorse, as he does on a capias, take bail in such sum: Ins.

Brock, 18 Phila. 289; Shriver v. Harbaugh, 37 Pa. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-12\">The provision for the entry of bail to dissolve is for the benefit of the defendant, enabling him to obtain the release of his goods, detention of which may be working a grievous and serious injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-13\">In Nicoll v. McCaffrey, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 187, Rice, P.

B. </em>Kemerer, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEDp\">Appellant did not deny the debt; did not ask to have the judgment by default opened, in order to give bail to dissolve; did not even offer that, if judgment were opened, bail would be given, but asked the court below to quash the writ of foreign attachment for the reason that the amount of bail to dissolve was not named in the prmcipe, nor indorsed upon the writ or the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">Judgment having already been properly entered, it was too late to move to quash the writ of attachment: Whiteside v. Oakman, 1 Dallas, 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">Even if the act should apply, and were there some slight irregularity in the proceedings, why should this court reverse the court below for not doing that which appellant never asked the court to do ? The prayer of the petition is not to open or set aside the judgment, but merely to quash the writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that the expression \u201c at and after the third term of court after the execution of the writ,\u201d in the the Act of May 10, 1889, P. L. 183, means that thereby no judgment for default of appearance can be entered until the third term after the return day of the writ. The practice of the courts, as well as the clear reading of the statute itself shows that this is not\"correct: Collins v. Walker, 6 W. N. C. 175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">In Shuster v. Bonner, 7 W. N. C. 17, the writ was issued September 14,1878, returnable the third Monday of September. The sheriff did not serve the attachment however, until on the return day of the writ: Melloy v. Burtis, 124 Pa. 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">In Lane v. White, 140 Pa. 99, two writs were served on garnishees on March 29, 1889, and judgment was entered on December 7, 1889. The first term after the execution of these, writs was June term; the second was September term, and the third was December term. Judgment was entered December 7, 1889.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-11\">The refusal of the court to quash a writ of foreign attachment is not reviewable by the Supreme Court: First Nat.

Judgment was entered against the defendant September 20, 1897, for want of an appearance and answer. On application, the same day, the court granted a rule to show cause why the attachment should not be quashed and the judgment opened and set aside. On November 29 the rule was discharged. There are six terms of court each year, commencing the second Mondays of January, March, May, July, September and November, and this action was brought to the May term.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">It was contended here, on two grounds, that the court erred in discharging the rule: First, that the judgment was prematurely entered, and second, that the writ should have been quashed because no bail was inserted in the praecipe or indorsed on the writ or the record. By the 53d section of the act of 1836, it is provided that \u201c it shall be lawful for the plaintiff at and after the third term of court after the execution of the writ, if he shall have filed his declaration, to take judgment against the defendant for default of appearance, unless the attachment before that time be dissolved.\u201d This was afterward modified as to the time of filing the declaration, but the modification does not affect the present case. In support of the first ground of complaint it is argued that \u201c the writ was not fully executed until the return was made on the return day: .... that in contemplation of law the return day is the time of the execution of the writ,\u201d and, therefore, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>was entitled to two full terms after the May term, in which to appear and prevent judgment by default. The argument is obscure, due evidently to a confusion of terms and a misunderstanding of what constitutes \u201cthe execution of a writ,\u201d \u201c the return of a writ,\u201d and the time when return should be made. The return of a writ is no part of its execution, no matter when made. \u201cTo execute a writ is to do the act commanded in the writ: \u201d Bouvier. The officer is given until the return day to execute process, and is then required to inform the court how he performed his duty. But the return is no part of the execution of the writ. It is simply an account or report of the manner of its execution, rendered to the court whence it issued and is usually indorsed thereon. This return of the writ is made when nothing has been done toward its execution as well as when its mandate has been obeyed; and becomes important to explain or excuse its nonexecution. An official return of process is prima facie proof of- the manner of its execution, and is often made after as well as before the return day. But it is descriptive of that act only. A writ executed but not returned may be shown, by other evidence, to have been duly executed: Smull v. Mickley, 1 Rawle, 95; Hinds v. Scott, 11 Pa. 19; Gibson v. Winslow, 38 Pa. 49; Kelly v. Green, 53 Pa. 302. The act of June 13, 1836, sec. 48, expressly states how \u201c the attachment shall be executed.\u201d According to the sheriff\u2019s return the acts required by the statute to constitute an execution of the attachment had been performed and completed on May 1. It is clear, therefore, that the writ in the present case was duly executed before the commencement of May term, and the judgment was properly entered at the September term, which was the third term after such execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The other objection raised \u201cthat no bail was inserted in the praecipe or indorsed on the writ or the record,\u201d is sufficiently disposed of in the opinion of the learned court below, discharging the rule: \u201c Conceding that this omission is a departure from the almost universal practice, we cannot see how the defendant has been prejudiced by it. It did not deprive the defendant of the privilege of entering bail in such sum as the court or judge might name, and it is safe to say that this sum would not exceed the sum named, by at least a malicious plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Indeed, the practice of stating the amounts of bail demanded in the praecipe seems to be rather for the protection of plaintiffs, than- of defendant. When the amount is thus stated and indorsed on the writ, it is notice to the judge not to accept bail in a less amount without notice to the plaintiff, which is probably the reason of the practice.\u201d It is nowhere alleged that the defendant offered to enter bail or desired to do so; and as the learned judge said no injury accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
