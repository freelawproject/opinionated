Before Woodward, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\">This case originally arose on appeal by defendant from the judgment of a justice for $284.20. The plaintiffs proceeded under the law to arbitration, and the case was regularly tried before arbitrators chosen by the parties for the trial of the case and same day an award was given in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant in the sum of $284.20 and costs. On May 25, 1898, the plaintiffs filed a bill of costs amounting to $22.00, being witnesses\u2019 fees in the case. On June 6,1898, defendant appealed from the award of the arbitrators and on June 8 filed exceptions to the costs, paying in all costs excepted to less $22.00, plaintiffs\u2019 bill of witnesses\u2019 fees. A rule was then taken to strike off the appeal and on November 5 the rule to strike off the appeal was discharged on condition that defendant pay the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019bill for witnesses, to wit: the $22.00 above referred to. Plaintiff excepted to the ruling of the court in discharging the rule to strike off the appeal from the award of arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in discharging rule to strike off the appeal from the award of the arbitrators.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-11\"><em>Abner Smith, </em>with him <em>C.

L. 715, sec. 27 ; Schrenkeisen v. Kishbaugh, 162 Pa. 45; Lagen v. Cadwell, 34 Leg. Int. 331; Myers v. Brown, 38 Leg.

But when their nonpayment is caused by the exclusive fault of the officer in withholding the knowledge of the existence of a portion of them the rule is otherwise, and payment of omitted portion may be enforced by attachment: Palmer v. Wilkinson, 73 Pa. 341.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b435-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The refusal to strike off an appeal from an award of arbitrators is clearly an interlocutory order and from such orders there is no right of appeal before final judgment, unless it is expressly given by statute. This general rule has been enforced in a multitude of reported cases, and its application to orders like the present has been decided several times: Kendrick v. Overstreet, 3 S. &amp; R. 357; Straub v. Smith, 2 S. &amp; R. 382; Wooden Ware Co. v. Howe, 164 Pa. 85; Schultz v. Bear Creek Co., 174 Pa. 287; Yost v. Davison, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 469; Anderson v. McMichael, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The appeal is quashed at the costs of the appellants and the record remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
