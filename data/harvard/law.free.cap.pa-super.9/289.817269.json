In the alleged conversation between Jos. R. Snyder, Jacob S. Snyder and Levi G. Getz, neither the date, the amount nor the maker of the note spoken of was mentioned. Neither was there anything referred to by them in said alleged conversation which would identifjr the note then spoken of as the note in suit, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point we also refuse. We say there is sufficient evidence, if you believe it, to identify this note, that is, that this evidence of the Snyders, if believed, is sufficient to identify the note.\u201d (2) in the charge to the jury in that part which reads as follows (speaking of the testimony of Harriet Hippard) : \u201c Of course, gentlemen, if that was the only evidence here, it would not be sufficient to toll the statute of limitations ; but the testimony of young Mr. Snyder and the elder Mr. Snyder shows there was a distinct acknowledgment of this debt, and a promise to pay it; and if yon believe that conversation had reference to this note in suit, and they say it had, then your verdict must be in favor of the plaintiff in this case.\u201d (3) In not giving binding instructions in favor of defendants.

The making of the note payable to Harriet Donaven, the mother, can be explained that it was intended for the use of her daughter, Hagar Frank. And if the jury believe from the evidence that it was so intended, the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d (13) In answer to defendants\u2019 fourth point, which point and answer aro as follows : \u201c 4. If the jury should believe that Harriet Donaven left any money or valuables in Getz\u2019s hands, in trust for the uso of her daughter, Hagar Flunk, a child then seven years of age., and Getz executed such trust by raising, maintaining and educating said daughter, and by giving her a valuable outfit at the time of her marriage, then there can be no recovery in this case, and the verdict should be for defendant. <em>Answer: </em>The court also refuses this point. There is not a scintilla of testimony here on this point, except the testimony of the brother, and that was not sufficient and, therefore, could not affect the note.\u201d (15) In refusing to affirm defendants\u2019 seventh point, which point is as follows: \u201c 7. The words, \u2018 I will come out West next spring and pay off the note,\u2019 in connection with the words, \u2018 I will come out and settle it off and make it all right,\u2019 in the same conversation, are not a sufficient promise to pay on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the maker of the note to toll the statute of limitation.\u201d (16) In answer to defendants\u2019 eighth point, which point and answer are as follows: \u201c 8. If the jury believe that Harriet Hippard left the money collected of Abner Frank in the hands of Levi G. Getz for the use of her child, Hagar Frank, there can be no recovery now on the note in suit. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused, because there is no evidence to support it.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-5\"><em>Simon P.

Getz, for $350, to the order of Harriet Donaven. The maker having died, the action was duly continued against his administrators. The note was transferred by the payee to the plaintiff after maturity, and is, therefore, subject to any defense which might be made against the payee, growing out of or connected with the note or attaching to it while in the paj^ee\u2019s hands : Long v. Rhawn, 75 Pa. 128. There is no denial that the money for which the note was given was received by the maker in settlement of a claim of the payee against a third person, which settlement had been effected largely through the maker\u2019s assistance. There is no evidence or allegation that the defendant ever paid the note to the payee or to any person at her request. It is asserted in the appellant\u2019s paper-book that the money was expended in the maintenance of the illegitimate child of the payee, but there is nothing in the evidence sufficient to warrant the inference that the maker was authorized, by Harriet Donaven to so apply it. The contention that the note was given in trust for this child and that the latter was entitled to the proceeds, has nothing in the evidence or the law to support it. The note is an ordinary promissory note and is entitled to the protection and subject to the limitations relative to this class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>paper, under the commercial law. There is no proof of fraud or mistake in the execution of the paper and none is alleged. In fact the entire transaction, including the execution and delivery of the note, seems to have been brought about through the voluntary assistance and management of the defendant. It is noticeable also that all suggestions to pay less than the amount of the note came from the defendant and were not assented to by the payee. A careful scrutiny of her letters and her testimony, disclosed a consistent desire to obtain the money from the defendant, without discommoding him or injuriously affecting her child Hagar. In a certain sense the defendant may have displayed a laudable desire to secure a part of the money due on the note for the child, Hagar, but it would be equally creditable to have paid it according to the express undertaking, and referred the question of the rights of the mother and daughter, if they differed on this point, to the proper tribunal, where it could have been judicially settled: Church v. Jones, 155 Pa. 122. It is no doubt true \u201c that where, at the execution of a writing a stipulation has been entered into, a condition annexed, or a promise made, by word of mouth, upon the faith of which the writing has been executed, parol evidence of .this is admissible, though it may vary and materially change the terms of the contract.\u201d But it was not shown or offered to be shown here that any of those conditions existed, and the rule referred to has, therefore, no application. It was for the court to pass upon the letters and instruct the jury as to their pertinence and probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The execution of the note was admitted, and the main question raised by the assignment of errors is the sufficiency of the evidence touching the acknowledgment. of the debt and the promise to pay it, so as to take the claim out of the statute of limitations. The note was due October 4, 1877, and this action was brought May 9, 1894. The testimony relied upon to overcome the bar of the statute was contained in the depositions of Joseph B,. Snyder and Jacob S. Snyder, of Illinois, taken under a commission. From this testimony, it appears that while visiting at Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, the Snyders called on the maker 'January 4, 1883, at his home, and demanded payment of the note on behalf of the payee, telling him that they called at her request. In reply the defendant said: \u201c I suppose Harriet would like to have the money on that note and I wish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>she had it; I wish it was settled up; I am tired of keeping it. You tell Harriet I am going to Iowa this summer, and I will call on her at her home in Benson, Illinois, and pay the money direct to her.\u201d He further said \u201cthathe was going West the following spring and he would stop off and pay her the money and take up the note.\u201d These witnesses also said the conversation \u201c was entirely about this note in suit, the 1350 note, and had no reference to any other note.\u201d It was also shown that no other note or transaction was referred to or existed between the inaker and the payee at that.or any other time. On the question of the measure of proof required to toll the statute, the learned trial judge instructed the jury that \u201c it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show, before there can be any recovery by him in this case, that it has been taken out of the statute of limitations by evidence that the defendant acknowledged the indebtedness and promised to pay it. Such acknowledgment must be clear and unequivocal; it must be certain and unqualified ; it must have specific reference to the note in suit.\u201d This instruction was in no manner modified by the other parts of the charge, and, we think, presented the question as strongly in favor of the defendant as the rule governing the subject required.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It would be useless to notice the assignment of errors in detail. Some of the specifications are in violation of our rules and others relate to immaterial and impertinent matters. We have briefly referred to the material questions presented by the record. The case seems to have been fairly tried and the instructions to the jury covered all matters which their duties required them to consider. No error calling for a reversal of the judgment appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">. The assignment of errors is overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
