Y. R. R. Co., owner or reputed owner, and Wm. B. Shaffer, contractor, and the buildings and fixtures erected thereon; that wage claims against said Helios Dry Color &amp; Chemical Co., numbered from 4,294 to 4,314 inclusive for various amounts, each under $200 \u2014 except that of H.

N. C. 593.\u201d (4) In not sustaining the third exception of Thomas H.

Mars</em>teller, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3qd\">Under the fourth section of the act of 1872, it is provided that \u201cNo lien of mortgage or judgment entered before such labor is performed, shall be affected or impaired thereby.\u201d And the act of 1891 says, \u201c That the act shall not be so construed as to impair contracts existing, or liens of record vested prior to its passage.\u201d The learned court below erroneously holds that under the general provisions of these two acts these labor liens take priority over our mechanics\u2019 liens, on the ground that mechanics\u2019 liens are neither mortgages nor judgments. This ruling, is, in effect, that all other liens on the property, except mortgages and judgments, that would be discharged by the sheriff\u2019s sale in a case where labor liens have been filed, must be postponed in the distribution, to the labor liens. If this be sound construction, then labor liens would supersede in right of distribution such liens as a widow\u2019s dower on land sold after the death of the widow; a charge on land created by the grantor in his deed; a legacy charged on real estate by will; a municipal lien filed for improvements of streets or water mains, for none of these are either mortgages or judgments and would be discharged by operation of a sheriff\u2019s sale. Again, a mechanic\u2019s lien relates back to the beginning of the building, as we have seen. A judgment obtained thereon also relates back to the same time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">We all know that the questions arising out of our acts relating to mechanics\u2019 lidns and labor liens are quite complicated enough, without inviting additional difficulties by their construction. \u2022 -Acts must often be construed by their spirit rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>than by the letter in order to give proper effect to the legislative intent: Improvement Co. v. Com., 94 Pa. 450.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">The object of the legislature was to enable the mechanic or material man, to follow his labor or materials into the building which is pledged for the price without regard to the estate of the owner: Savoy &amp; Salter v. Jones, 2 Rawle, 842. To the same effect is O\u2019Conner v. Warner, 4 W. &amp; S. 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">This is an attempt to transfer the money of the mechanic into the pocket of another class of laborers which is not favored: Lambertson v. Hogan, 2 Pa. 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">In view of what we have said, it seems plain that when the acts of 1872 and 1891 say that laborers \u201cshall be preferred and first paid out of the proceeds,\u201d etc., without saying above what other liens (except judgments and mortgages) preference is to be given, the legislature must have intended to give them preference above unsecured creditors, judgments obtained or executions issued while such labor was being done and such like claims, on substantially the same principle that a landlord has the preference for his rent in arrear when his tenant is sold out under execution; but that it was never intended that these labor claimants should be allowed to reach back and cut out former vested mechanics\u2019 liens, and pocket the money which was the fruit of other men\u2019s labor and materials, without compensation, and against every principle of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-8\">As to the form and substance of the labor-claims filed in this case, they were not sufficient in law to constitute a lien on the leasehold sold. They do not state with sufficient particularity first, the character of the labor or services for which the claims are made; second, nor the time and days when said labor is claimed to have been performed or at what rate of wages; third, nor under what act or by what right these claims-were made. See Hall\u2019s Est., 148 Pa. 121, and McCay\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-9\">In any event there should be no recovery for the labor claimants who have been paid. The action of the bank in this case was but the loan of money to the company to pay its hands : Brick Co.\u2019s Assigned Est., 183 Pa. 96. See also Rheeling\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 161.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-10\"><em>R. E.

L. 47. This act was then amended by the Act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 116, and finally amended and left in its present shape by the Act of May 12, 1891, P. L. 54.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKR\">January 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">The various changes in these several acts from the original-act of 1872 were in the direction of extending the benefit of its provisions to larger and additional classes of employees. The important language of the act as to the preference was the same in all of the acts above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">This act emphasizes the fact that no mortgage, instrument, or lien of any kind shall impair the priority of the labor claim, except that where a lien of a mortgage or judgment has been entered before the labor is performed which shall not be affected by the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">As to the minor questions raised in the case, we presume it will not be disputed that the Allentown National Bank as assignee of these labor claims stands in the same position as the claimants themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">This was decided by the Supreme Court in Riddlesburg Coal &amp; Iron Company\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 58.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">Labor claims for wages under the act of April 9, 1872, and its supplement of June 12,1878, P. L. 207, maybe sold and assigned, and the assignees are thus invested with all the rights the labor claimants themselves would have had if their respective claims had not been so sold and assigned: Riddlesburg Coal &amp; Iron Company\u2019s App., supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">As bearing on the question of whether the property sold by the sheriff was real or personal property, I refer to the Philadelphia Trust Company\u2019s App., 2 W. N. C. 593, where it is decided that the interest of a lessee in a lease and fixtures is personalty and not real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-11\">Under the decisions in this court the requisites in claims of this kind have been frequently discussed: Allison v. Johnson, 92 Pa. 314; Pardee\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 408; Adamson\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 459; Hall\u2019s Est., 148 Pa. 121; Timmes v. Metz, 156 Pa. 384; Hoffa v. Person, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 357.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A13l\">William W. Pouter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The fund in court is the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale of the works, buildings, machinery and lease used in the business of the Helios Dry Color and Chemical Co. There are two sets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>claimants upon the fund. Either set will exhaust it. The first is composed of mechanic\u2019s lien creditors; the second of labor claimants, whose claims are now held by a bank as assignee. The question for decision is, which claimants are entitled to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We have before us an able opinion of the court below affirming a clear, concise and adequate report of a commissioner. The case might well be left with a formal affirmance. The question is, however, new in the form in which it now arises, and we therefore add a confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Something is said, in the argument of the appellant, on the subject of the relative equities of the claims of the two classes of claimants. This subject has no place in the discussion. Each set of claimants is a preferred class. The legislature has -seen fit to give to each of them privileges which have not been conferred upon other classes of creditors. It is a pure matter of determining which is the first preferred, and involves a construction of the act of 1872 and its supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The act of May 12, 1891, provides, that the wages therein described shall be \u201cpreferred and first paid\u201d out of the proceeds of the sale of such real and personal property as is therein described. It is the last supplement to the act of 1872 Section 4 of the latter, provides \u201c that no mortgage or other instrument by which a lien is hereafter created, shall operate to impair or postpone the lien and preference given and secured to the wages and moneys mentioned in the first section of this act. Provided, That no lien of mortgage or judgment entered before such labor is performed shall be affected or impaired thereby.\u201d This section postpones to the labor claims even mortgages, or other instruments by which a lien is created, and the only exception is the preservation of the lien of mortgages or judgments entered before the labor was performed. This language is plain. It clearly gives the labor claimants priority over mechanic\u2019s lien creditors. A mechanic\u2019s lien is not a judgment, nor is it a mortgage. These are the only exceptions named in the act. Nor can the mechanic\u2019s lien claimants ue, by any stretch of reasoning, included among the wage claimants, under the act of 1872. The former claim for work done in construction. The latter claim for work done in the conduct or prosecution of the enterprise. See opinion in Rees v. Hulings, filed this day, and cases there cited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Objection is made to tbe form of tbe notice of the claims of the employees, given to the sheriff. The act requires no particular form of notice. It has certain essentials, which have been indicated in Adamson\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 459, Hall\u2019s Estate, 148 Pa. 121, Timmes v. Metz, 156 Pa. 384, and in Hoffa v. Person, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 357. A careful scrutiny of the form of notice used in this case, satisfies us that all the essentials have been supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">' The title of the bank, acquired by assignment of the labor claims for wages, has not been successfully attacked. There was here, as shown by the testimony, an actual bona fide transfer of the labor claims carrying all remedies, rights, etc., directly from the men when the money was paid to them by the bank: Riddleburg C. &amp; I. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 114 Pa. 58; Phila. Trust Co.\u2019s Appeal, 2 W. N. C. 593. It was not a loan to the company with an assignment of labor claims in payment, or as security.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The act limits the benefits conferred upon labor claimants. \u201c The claim thus preferred shall not exceed two hundred dollars.\u201d In the schedule of claims appears that of H. S. Giles for $217.07. There is no explanation as to the manner in which this claim is made up, but the act evidently intends that claims of a character comprehended by its provisions shall be preferred to the extent of $200. The language does not indicate an intention that the wage earner, who is a creditor to an amount in excess of $200, shall be deprived wholly of preference. The claim thus referred to is properly payable with the other claims, subject to a reduction bringing it within the limitations of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">With this modification, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
