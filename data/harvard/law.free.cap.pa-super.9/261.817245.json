Defendants subsequently, however, notified plaintiff\u2019s broker that they considered that the contract had been broken by reason of the shipment subject to sight draft and bill of lading and stated by letter as follows: \u201cYou having by your own action violated the contract and thus canceled it, any steel you send here will be subject to your order, as I will have no further dealings with you or the parties you claim to represent.\u201d Plaintiff sold the balance of the -steel for $18.50 and sued for the difference between that amount per ton and $22.50 per ton, aggregating $400. Defendants in their affidavit set up that the words \u201c demand draft against bill of lading \u201d liad been scratched out on the contract and the terms changed to cash on receipt of each car as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>.arrived; that no soft steel nail slabs were at any time shipped by the plaintiff to the defendants in pursuance of the contract referred to in the statement, nor did the defendants at any time refuse to accept the steel called for by the contract under the terms of the contract, but for the reason that the plaintiff refused to ship nail slabs in accordance with said contract, or ship any slabs without sight draft against bill of lading attached and consigned to the order of himself, the plaintiff, which was not in accordance with the contract as signed by deponent for and in behalf of the defendant corporation. Deponent further avers that by reason of the breach of the contract defendants\u2019 works were compelled to be shut for several weeks and defendants suffered great loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The court below discharged the rule for judgment, Savidge, P. J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">It seems to me this is not a case in which an affidavit of defense is required. Whilst an executory contract is within the affidavit of defense law, it is only where damages are liquidated and capable of being assessed without the intervention of a jury or the introduction of testimony, that an affidavit is required. In this case the damages are consequential and unliquidated. There is nothing in the contract or appearing from the dealings of the parties that would enable the prothonotary to fix them. We have only the statement of the plaintiff from which to fix she market price of steel at the time of the alleged breach. Being of this opinion, it is unnecessary to go into the question of the sufficiency of the affidavit filed. The rule is discharged. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was discharging the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-8\"><em>A. P. Burgwin, </em>with him <em>J. C. Bucher </em>and <em>Greorge C.

Gordon, 124 Pa. 263, and Landis v. W. P. R. R., 133 Pa. 579.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">The statement sets forth the circumstances under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>claim arises, and states explicitly the amount demanded: Blanchard v. Hunter, 7 Pa. C. C. R. 552.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">No judgment may be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense; plainly implying that if there is a specific statement of the damage sustained, judgment may be entered: Winkleblake v. Van Dyke, 161 Pa. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">The language of the affidavit of defense is vague and ambiguous, and it is doubtful what is meant by \u201cthe contract hereinbefore referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">If it refers to the prior oral agreement, then unquestionably any such prior agreement, even if made, would be merged in the subsequent written contract: Sennett v. Johnson, 9 Pa. 385; Harbold v. Kuster, 44 Pa. 392; Kirk v. Hartman, 63 Pa. 97; Wharton on Contracts, sec. 643; Wharton on Evidence, see. 1014.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-8\">Parol evidence of this prior agreement cannot be received to contradict, vary or alter an instrument of writing, except to reform it on the ground of fraud, accident or mistake: Harbold v. Kuster, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-9\">Consequently, defendants\u2019 attempt is to change a written contract by the addition thereto of an oral, contemporaneous and wholly inferential negative agreement on the part of plaintiff that \u201c the goods were not to be shipped with demand draft against bill of lading,\u201d without alleging that the omission was caused by either fraud, accident or mistake.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-10\"><em>C. M. Clement, </em>with him <em>S. P. Wolverton, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQpR\">Under the law the statement filed by the plaintiff did not require an affidavit of defense. Under the rule of court of Northumberland county the statement and affidavit must clearly show the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover and the exact amount: Byrne v. Hayden, 124 Pa. 170; Louchheim v. Maguire, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 635.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-11\">If the statement of the cause of action was sufficient the affidavit of defense was sufficient. All the plaintiff\u2019s allegations are specially denied touching on their breach of contract. The courts do not encourage judgments for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, when the affidavit of defense shows that the case is one that should go to trial before a jury: Griffith v. Sitgreaves, 81* Pa. 378.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>January 18, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">Nor will the appellate courts sustain an appeal from the action of the court below in discharging the judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense: Ensign v. Kindred, 163 Pa. 638; Murphy v. Taylor, 173 Pa. 317.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Arj\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">This action is founded upon an alleged breach of contract for the sale of certain steel nail slabs. It is, in form, assumpsit. Under the act of 1887, the plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to an affidavit of defense hi reply to his statement of claim: Barr v. McGary, 131 Pa. 401; Market Co. v. Brooks, 163 Pa. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">This appeal is taken from the refusal of the court below to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The Supreme Court have repeatedly said, that an appeal in such a case is intended to reach only clear cases of error in law, and prevent the delay of a trial. \u201c In doubtful cases, especially in those requiring broad inquiry into facts, where the court refuses judgment, the matter in controversy should go to the jury, as the proper tribunal to decide the cause under proper instructions from the court: \u201d Griffith v. Sitgreaves, 81* Pa. 378; Radcliffe v. Herbst, 135 Pa. 568; \u00c6tna Insurance Co. v. Confer, 158 Pa. 598; Ensign v. Kindred, 163 Pa. 638. In the two cases last cited, it was held, that it requires a very plain cause of error in law to sustain such an appeal. The decree being interlocutory, no injury, other than delay, can result to the complaining suitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">There can be no difference of opinion in respect to the propo - sitions thus laid down by the Supreme Court. Appeals, such as this, not infrequently result in greater delay than procedure in due course to a trial. They should not be encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">For the purposes of the present consideration, the plaintiff has set out a good cause of action. To his allegations respecting the breach of contract by the defendant, the latter replies by affidavit, alleging a prior breach by the plaintiff, and that the defendant did not refuse to accept slabs shipped under the terms of the alleged contract. The correspondence (for some reason attached to the statement of claim) shows the necessity for a fuller explanation of the relations and obligations of the parties than the present pleadings disclose. Under these circumstances, the cause must be tried. Adopting the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of Radcliffe v. Herbst, supra: \u201cIn view of the fact that the case may come here again upon another appeal, we decline to discuss its merits. It is sufficient to say that the affidavit discloses some facts that ought to be passed upon by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\">Appeal dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff without prejudice, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
