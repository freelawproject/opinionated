Hill, who resides in this count}', to recover the amount due upon a promissory note for $379.20 made by her, and dated December 28, 1893, payable to the order of Eber E. Hilton at the National Bank of Oxford, and signed by Margaret C. Hill. It is indorsed by Eber E. Hilton and indorsed \u201c John I. Smith \u201d and \u201c John I. Smith Co.\u201d It is now owned by the Liebig Manufacturing Company. This, as shown by the evidence of the surety, was an accommodation note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">Mr. Hilton wanting to purchase and not having the funds, obtained this note from his mother-in-law, and indorsed it over at that time to Mr. Smith on account of, or in payment of phosphate which he was buying or' had bought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">[At the trial of the case defendant was permitted to ask the maker and the payee of the note, over the objection of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, whether any consideration was given for the note.] [1, 2, 3, 8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">The court, Livingston, P.

The law says she would he liable, although she would not be if it was transferred after. That is one of the questions you will have to decide. From the testimony you will have to decide that. Mr. Smith is just as positive as Mr. Hilton; Mr. French also. While Mr. Hilton says Smith had it in his possession after it became due and transferred it. That is the reason I submit it to you. If you find it was transferred before due to this company, then so far as that is concerned they would be entitled to recover from this woman. If you find from the evidence it was not transferred to them until after it became due then they would not be entitled to recover under the law.] [10] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[It appears a judgment bond was given by Mr. Hilton, be says, in payment of these notes.

The Bank of Montgomery Co., 12 S. &amp; R. 382; Appleton v. Donaldson, 3 Pa. 381; Lord v. The Ocean Bank, 20 Pa. 384; Moore v. Baird, 30 Pa. 138; Newbold v. Boraef, 155 Pa. 227; Liebig Mfg. Co. v. Hill, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">Under the authority of Peltz v. Printz Bros., 186 Pa. 347, assignments ten and eleven must be sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-10\"><em>J. Hay Brown, </em>with him <em>W. U. Hensel, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMl\">The language complained of in the tenth assignment of error is certainly not erroneous. The context plainly shows that the court cited simply the general law of negotiable paper; that, if the transferee of it became the holder before it became due, no defense would avail the maker. But, if transferred after it became due, the maker would not be liable, provided there was a good defense between her and the party who accepted the note from the indorser. There was a conflict of testimony upon this subject. The court held that the question involved was one for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the jury to decide, explicitly saying that, if the note was transferred before it became due, the plaintiffs \u201c would be entitled to recover from this woman.\u201d More than that the plaintiff had no right to ask: Newbold v. Boraef, 155 Pa. 232; Patterson v. Moore, 34 Pa. 69.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7Q\">February 17, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ag6\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">When we reviewed a former trial of this case, we said: \u201cWe think the court below erred in permitting the introduction of the evidence showing absence of consideration to the maker. It was not matter of defense.\u201d In the trial now under review such evidence was again admitted, and a considerable portion of the charge is devoted to a submission to the jury of the question, whether the plaintiff company acquired the note before or after maturity. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Smith acquired the note before maturity and for a valuable consideration. As against him the defense of accommodation could not be set up (Moore v. Baird, 30 Pa. 138; Lord v. Bank, 20 Pa. 384; Appleton v. Donaldson, 3 Pa. 381), and if Smith took the note for the plaintiff company, his title was their title.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">But the evidence for the plaintiff company in rebuttal is practically uncontradicted, that the company acquired the note before maturity from Smith, as indorser, and for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">On the other hand, assume that the note passed from Smith to the plaintiff company for value after maturity. Even so, accommodation by the maker is no defense. Smith was not the payee. lie was, as to the plaintiff company, an indorser, who had taken for value and before maturity. His transfer to the plaintiff company, though subsequent to maturity, vested in the latter his rights which could not be defeated on the ground that the note was accommodation paper. \u201c A person, who takes a bill or note after it is due, takes it subject to all objections in respect of want of consideration, illegality and all other objections and equities affecting the instrument itself, and to which it was liable in the hands of the person from whom he takes it: \u201d Wilson v. Bank, 45 Pa. 494. See also Riegel v. Cunningham, 9 Phila. 177, Daniels on Negotiable Instruments, secs. 786, 803, and Byles on Bills, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Therefore, the fact that the note may have been originally given as an accommodation was not matter of defense to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>plaintiff company\u2019s claim. We sustain the first, second, third, eighth and tenth assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The fourth, fifth and sixth assignments are to the admission of questions relating to the purpose of the giving of the judgment bond to the plaintiff company. The objections are based upon the failure to show authority in Smith to act for the plaintiff company in the surrender of the notes. These assignments are not sustained. The bond was given to and retained by the plaintiff company. It was taken by Smith as their representative. It was not alone for the debt in suit, but covered as well a separate.claim against Hilton. It was accompanied by a warrant of attorney to enter judgment, and contained a waiver of exemption. It was not, therefore, a mere release of the defendant given by an agent without consideration. By this, we do not mean to indicate any opinion upon the facts, nor to exclude proper evidence of Smith\u2019s agency, but it seems to us that upon the evideuce as now presented, the only questions for the jury, under proper instructions, were, first, whether the bond was in fact given in payment of the note in suit, as asserted by Hilton, or as a collateral security, as asserted by Smith, and, second, if it was accepted as payment, was Smith authorized as agent so to accept the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The evidence did not warrant the statement' of fact made by the court, which is the subject of the eleventh assignment. This assignment is sustained, and the remaining assignments are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The judgment is reversed, and a new venire is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
