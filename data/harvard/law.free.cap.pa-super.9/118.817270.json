Our contention is that the burgess never signed warrants by virtue of his being a member of council, but that this was one of the general powers properly exercised by him, by virtue of his being the chief executive officer of the borough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">It is further submitted by appellant that even if the council of the borough had legal authority to strip the burgess of the power of signing warrants and vest the power in the hands of its chairman, this could only be done by ordinance or resolution properly passed and signed by the burgess or regularly passed over his veto, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of May 23,1893, P. L. 113. As shown by the record in this case, this provision of the law was not complied with, and therefore, the resolution never had any legal force or effect, even if council had the legal right to pass it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-9\"><em>H.

To this the respondent answered, admitting, in substance, the averments of the petition. \u25a0 The burgess, David Shaw, asked to be allowed to conduct the proceedings in the name of the respondent, in the same manner as if he were an original party, and the court made an order to that effect. Subsequently the court ordered a mandamus to issue as prayed for, and from this decree the respondent, David Shaw, appealed. It is conceded that these warrants had been signed by the burgess of the borough from the time of its organization in 1892, until the adoption of the motion directing that this be done by the chairman of the council.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The duties and privileges of a burgess touching the financial affairs of the borough must be found in the charter, or in existing ordinances or resolutions. Unless required by law, the custom of having the burgess sign warrants issued by the council will not confer upon him the right to its continuance, when that body provides that warrants shall be signed by their presiding officer. The confusion relative to the powers of a burgess, arising out of conflicting provisions of the numerous special charters existing in this State, has been largely removed by the acts of May 28, and of June 6, 1893. Under those statutes the burgess cannot be a member of council or preside at its meetings, and his powers touching the passage of ordinances and resolutions are there defined and limited. The act of May 23, 1893, expressly provides that councils shall annually elect one of their number as president of the council, whose duty it shall be to preside at their meetings. To require the president to sign warrants and other documents agreed upon at council meetings is in perfect consonance with this provision of the law. By the statutes referred to the burgess may approve or veto the ordinances and resolutions passed by the council, but those statutes do not extend his power to other transactions of that body. The authority of a burgess to approve or veto ordinances and resolutions is new to our general laws. It tends to assimulate the powers of the burgess of a borough to those of the mayor of a city; and to some extent to harmonize and simplify the duties of those officers. Prior to 1893, a burgess was required \u201c To sign the several by-laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>rules, regulations and ordinances adopted, after they shall have been duly and correctly transcribed by the secretary;\u201d but he had no authority to veto an ordinance or other measure passed by the council. The pertinent and material question in this case is, therefore, whether a warrant issued by a borough council comes within the meaning of \u201cby-laws, rules, regulations and ordinances,\u201d which, under the act of April 28, 1851, sec. 4, P. L. 320, the burgess is required to sign. The burgess of a borough may exercise judicial, executive and ministerial power in the full discharge of his duties under the law. But his authority to exercise either must clearly appear. The measures passed by council which he has a right to sign are enumerated in the act of 1851, and on the principle, expressio unius est ex-clusio alterius, his power must be confined to such as are there set forth, or are necessarily incident thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It seems clear that the clause of the act of 1851, relative to the burgess signing by-laws, ordinances, etc., when viewed in connection with other provisions of that act, refers to measures which are more legislative in character; such as a permanent rule of conduct for the government of the citizens, or of the borough in general; or the creation of liability, through contract or otherwise. If the measure be legislative in purpose or effect it is immaterial whether it be called an ordinance, resolution, by-law or rule: Howard v. Olyphant, 181 Pa. 191. But the motion adopted in the present case cannot be considered legislative in character. It relates to the orderly transaction of the internal current business of the council, and its due authentication. Acts relating to the daily administration of municipal affairs are ordinarily known as the \u201c business \u201d of the council. They are temporary and ministerial in character and do not require executive approval: Shaub v. Lancaster City, 156 Pa. 362. Payment of the debts of the borough, lawfully incurred in the daily administration of its affairs, is purely ministerial, ordinarily involving no executive action, and devolve upon the council and the treasurer. This construction of the act of 1851 may also be illustrated and fortified by its own provisions relating to the general power of the burgess. His first* prescribed duty is \u201c to enforce the by-laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the corporations; \u201d the precise terms used in the enumeration of what he shall sign. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>indicating that the measures which he shall sign and those he shall enforce are the same, and relate to the governmental control of the borough, rather than its ministerial affairs. Further corroboration of this view may be drawn from the act of May 28, 1893. By this act the burgess is precluded from presiding at, or participating in, the meetings of the council, and is thereby excluded from all voice in the transaction of its business. But the same statute imposes upon him the executive duty of approving or vetoing \u201c every ordinance and resolution passed by said council.\u201d He is given no authority over the action of the council, except in relation to ordinances and resolutions, which he may sign or veto according to his judgment. Under every judicial interpretation of those terms they are synonymous when legislative in purpose or effect, and in the legislative sense do not embrace mere ministerial duties such as current business transactions. It is not denied that the warrant in the present case was given in payment of a lawful debt of the borough incurred in its ordinary business affairs. It was signed by the president of the council in pursuance of the motion in question, and this was sufficient to its due execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The order directing a mandamus to issue is affirmed, the cost to be paid by David Shaw, the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
