Alexander from the judgment entered in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, following a jury conviction of one count of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of sexual assault, both felonies. We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand to the District Court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">Alexander presents two issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-17\">I. Did the District Court err in permitting the jury to hear improper hearsay testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>II. Did the District Court err in refusing to continue the sentencing in order to allow the inclusion of a sex offender evaluation in the Pre-Sentence Investigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Paul A. Alexander (Alexander) was originally charged with two counts each of sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent, all felonies, involving two of his step-grandchildren, a boy and a girl. The boy was eleven years old at the time Alexander was charged with the offenses. The charges regarding the five-year-old girl were later dismissed upon motion by the State that she was not competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The alleged abuse of Alexander\u2019s step-grandson had begun when he was in the first or second grade and had continued until he was in the fourth grade. Testimony showed that the victim was alone with his step-grandfather almost on a daily basis, that they shared a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d and spent a good deal of time together. The victim was often alone in the house with Alexander while his mother, grandmother and other household members were outdoors working horses or otherwise absent. Further, the victim, his parents and older brother had stayed with the Alexanders for a period of nine months in 1988 while their home was being constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In April of 1992, Alexander and his wife separated. The victim\u2019s mother testified that in August of 1992, her son (the victim) came to her very upset, crying and feeling he had done something wrong because of something Alexander had done to him. The mother took him to a counselor and the sexual abuse was subsequently reported to the police. Alexander was tried before a jury on June 16 and 17, 1993, for committing the two offenses involving his step-grandson. On June 17, 1993, the jury returned a guilty verdict for each of the offenses against the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Prior to the trial, on June 16, 1993, Alexander filed a Motion in Limine to bar statements made by the victim to several persons as inadmissible hearsay. Although the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion subject to allowance by the court pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(A) or (B), M.R.Evid., the prosecution made several references to the material covered by Alexander\u2019s motion in its opening statement during the trial. Testimony elicited by the prosecution and objected to by Alexander as hearsay was allowed over his ongoing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">During a recess of the trial, Alexander moved the court for a mistrial based on the following four points: (1) in opening statements, the State violated the Order in limine by referring to statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>made by the victim to Brad Custer, a school counselor, that the abuse had occurred in Alexander\u2019s home; (2) also in opening statements, the State violated the Order in limine by referring to statements made by the victim to Detective Maxine Lamb; (3) Brad Custer\u2019s testimony stating that the victim had told him that the abuse occurred in his step-grandfather\u2019s house; and (4) the testimony by the victim\u2019s mother concerning what her son had told her about the alleged abuse and what a counselor had told her concerning the abuse. Alexander\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Following that denial of his motion, Alexander again objected to statements introduced by Robert Piersall (Piersall), a licensed social worker in private practice in Kalispell, who had treated the victim for sexual abuse when the victim\u2019s parents brought him to Piersall for counseling. The District Court allowed Piersall to testify about a post-traumatic stress disorder which Piersall had concluded that the victim suffered from and which was evident in children who had been sexually abused or had suffered from other traumatic events. Piersall further testified that he knew of no other traumatic events in the victim\u2019s experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">After the jury returned the guilty verdicts against Alexander on both counts regarding his step-grandson, a Sentencing Hearing was set for August 5, 1993. The District Court ordered a presentence investigation. On June 24,1993, Alexander filed a Motion for Evaluation requesting that an evaluation be conducted to assess his amenability to outpatient sexual offender treatment. The District Court ordered such an evaluation to be completed by Northwest Family Recovery in Kalispell and ordered further that it be included in the presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Andy Hudak (Hudak), director of Northwest Family Recovery was conducting the sex offender evaluation of Alexander. Hudak had not completed the evaluation by August 5, 1993, the date scheduled for the Sentencing Hearing. Alexander moved to continue the hearing until the evaluation was completed; this motion was denied by the District Court. The State presented information at the Sentencing Hearing concerning information Hudak had provided to the prosecutor regarding Alexander\u2019s amenability to treatment. In spite of the fact that the evaluation had not been completed, the District Court sentenced Alexander to thirty years imprisonment and designated him a dangerous offender for parole purposes, with the added requirement that he must successfully complete the sex offender program at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the Montana State Prison to be considered for parole. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Issue I: Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Did the District Court err in permitting the jury to hear improper hearsay testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Alexander contends that the District Court\u2019s admission of hearsay statements made by the victim to Brad Custer, Detective Maxine Lamb, his mother and to Robert Piersall was error and resulted in substantial prejudice to him. He contends that the pretrial Motion in Limine and resulting Order acted to enjoin the State from \u201creferring to or using, in any manner, hearsay statements made by the victims to Brad Custer, Maxine Lamb, Robert Piersall and Lauren Langmead, unless and until same are ruled allowable by the court pursuant to Rule 801 (d)(1)(B).\u201d Alexander claims that the court then improperly allowed such hearsay statements during the trial, beginning with statements made by the State during its opening statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Alexander contends that the following statements made by the prosecutor during her opening statements to the jury constitute reversible error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">... And in Late August of 92, [the victim] began approaching his parents saying that he felt he had done something wrong and he would be crying. He would say that Paul would tickle him on his thighs, on his legs. And the parents, as any parent would, investigated. And they went and talked to the school counselor; and the school counselor called Maxine Lamb of the Sheriff\u2019s Department; and Maxine Lamb of the Sheriff\u2019s Department suggested they go see Brad Custer of the Department of Family Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">So Brad Custer interviewed the child, and then referred the case back to the Flathead County Sheriff\u2019s Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">It wasn\u2019t until the 31st of December, New Years eve that Maxine finally interviewed [the victim]... After speaking -with [the victim], Maxine then spoke with the defendant, and he was interviewed by Maxine Lamb also on that day, on New Years eve, 1992.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1E\">Alexander claims that the statements by the prosecutor regarding the contact of the victim with Brad Custer and Maxine Lamb constitute improperly admitted hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In the District Court\u2019s Order concerning presentation of hearsay, the court stated it would not allow statements made by the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>witnesses unless and until it ruled on the statements. The statements made by the prosecutor as detailed above do not constitute hearsay, but rather allude to testimony of certain witnesses to be called during the trial. Hearsay is <em>\u201ca </em>statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">However, citing <em>State v. West </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 38, 42, 617 P.2d 1298, 1300, Alexander contends that certain statements made here are grounds for reversal because the prosecutor\u2019s reference to inadmissible evidence in her opening statement contributed to his conviction. According to the ruling in <em>West, </em>hearsay evidence alluded to in opening statements must be so highly prejudicial that it supports a reasonable probability that the statements led to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>West, </em>617 P.2d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements as quoted above do not contain any statements made by Brad Custer or Maxine Lamb. They merely detail the course of events leading up to Detective Lamb\u2019s interview with the defendant. Her statements chronicle the development and investigation of the case to the point of charging Alexander with the offenses against his step-grandson. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements do not in any sense constitute testimony, nor did they prejudice Alexander by alluding to improper witness hearsay testimony. Thus, Alexander\u2019s objection to the statements on these bases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Alexander also claims certain testimony by witnesses involved inadmissible hearsay statements. He first contends that statements made by Brad Custer, which we quote in their entirety here, were inadmissible hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Q. [by Ms. Wilson] And through your investigation, were you able to establish where the alleged abused [sic] occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">A. [by Brad Custer] Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">Q. And where was that, Mr. Custer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">A. [The victim] told me that the incident he described occurred at his step-grandfather\u2019s house in Kalispell. He listed that as 83 Dern Road in Kalispell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">Q. And would that be in Flathead County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">A. Yes, it would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">The District Court ruled that this testimony was in the nature of foundation and background.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The State contends that this testimony by Mr. Custer was clearly elicited to establish venue in Flathead County and is not hearsay. Alexander claims that there was never any question of or challenge to venue. It is clear from the questions and answers in the transcript that the statements only establish the place where the incidents occurred and do not constitute testimony that Alexander was the person who committed the acts. However, our question is whether or not that can be classed as inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. , provides that hearsay is a statement made by someone other than the declarant offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Clearly, Mr. Custer\u2019s statements as set forth above were offered into evidence to prove that the incident the victim described had occurred in Flathead County and as such constituted inadmissible hearsay as they were being offered by someone other than the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Having determined that error was committed by allowing the prosecutor to present hearsay testimony, we next address whether that error was harmless. Montana follows the United States Supreme Court\u2019s test for determining what constitutes harmless error. <em>State v. Wallace </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 454, 458, 727 P.2d 520, 523. That definition provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">[A]n otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAX\"><em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684. We have also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">This Court must be able to state, in cases of error which we regard as harmless, that beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not affect the outcome of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>State v. Daniels </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 1, 12, 682 P.2d 173, 179, (citing <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 26, 87 S.Ct. 824, 829, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 711 <em>(reh\u2019g denied </em>386 U.S. 987, 87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241)).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Although Mr. Custer\u2019s testimony as to the location where the offenses occurred was presented prior to the victim\u2019s testimony, it did not include any information that was not verified by the victim later during the course of the trial. We conclude that this did not prejudice Alexander and is harmless error according to Montana law as established by our prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Alexander\u2019s next hearsay argument concerns certain statements made by the victim\u2019s mother at trial when she attempted to state what her son had told her about the sexual abuse and what a friend who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>was a counselor had said to her about sexual abuse. The transcript indicates that the victim\u2019s mother did indeed <em>attempt </em>to make inappropriate statements; however, counsel for defendant objected immediately and the District Court sustained the objections. Consequently, there was no hearsay introduced through the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Moreover, the mother\u2019s attempt to introduce hearsay evidence did not result from the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to introduce such comments; rather, it was the witness who tried to do so. The District Court ruled that although some of the other testimony from the victim\u2019s mother may have involved some hearsay in her description of events leading up to filing charges against Alexander and obtaining counseling for her son for sexual abuse, that testimony was also foundational in nature and not substantive enough to be of such prejudice as to warrant granting Alexander\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Alexander\u2019s final argument concerning hearsay relates to the testimony of the victim\u2019s counselor, Piersall. Piersall did not testify about anything the victim said to him. He testified about his diagnosis that the victim was suffering from post-traumatic stress and that such stress is consistent with certain experiences in a child\u2019s life, including sexual abuse. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Q. [By Ms. Wilson] Have you diagnosed [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">A. [By Piersall] Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">Q. And can you tell me what that diagnosis is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">A. Post-traumatic stress disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">Q. And what symptoms did the child display that brought you to that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">A. Well, [the victim\u2019s] tendency was to minimize his symptoms of distress as a coping device, because the more he would become aware of his distress, then the more distressed he would actually become. So his tendency was to down-play them. Part of my making that diagnosis is based on information reported to me by the mother....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">MR. VERNAY: Your Honor, we are in hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">THE COURT: Well, not yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">THE WITNESS: She reported \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">MR. VERNAY: We are in hearsay from [the mother].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-16\">THE COURT: You are objecting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">MR. VERNAY: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-18\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>BY MS. WILSON:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">Q. Can you tell me what symptoms that you directly observed of [the victim] that would be consistent with your diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">A. Well, it was approximately the third or fourth meeting that I had with [the victim] that I questioned him directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">MR. VERNAY: Objection, Your Honor, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">THE WITNESS: Where I questioned [the victim] directly about his allegations of sexual abuse by Paul Alexander toward him. And as [the victim] was describing verbally to me things that he says took place \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. Stop. This is hearsay. I am going to have to sustain the objection. You can\u2019t testify as to [the victim] \u2014 what he said to you or things that he has done that he \u2014 manners other than speech or in addition to speech, where he communicated to you. It is hearsay, and you are not allowed to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">THE WITNESS: Okay. I can say that he was very fearful as he relayed that information. That is something I observed directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">BY MS. WILSON:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">Q. Were there any other physical symptoms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">A. Well I asked him to do some drawings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">Q. I guess I don\u2019t really want to get into the nature of those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">A. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">Q. Doctor, is the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder consistent with children who have suffered sexual abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-17\">Q. Is it also consistent with other traumatic events that occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">Q. Can you give the jurors an example of some other things that might cause post traumatic stress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-20\">A. Well, overwhelming experiences, such as being involved in a car accident and receiving significant injuries, having your house burn down, being physically abused. There are numerous traumatic events that could occur that could cause this type of symptom cluster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">Q. Have any of those type of occurrences been reported to you as occurring to [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A. No, they haven\u2019t been reported to me. I am not aware of any? [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Alexander contends that Piersall\u2019s testimony violates the holding of this Court in <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 405, 808 P.2d 453. <em>Harris </em>dealt with statements about sexual abuse made to a counselor by a minor child who is the alleged victim of sexual abuse for purposes of diagnosis under the medical treatment exception of Rule 803(4), M.R.Evid., and under the residual exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 804(b)(5), M.R.Evid. The <em>Harris </em>case also discussed a counselor\u2019s testimony relating to the credibility of the child victim. <em>Harris, </em>808 P.2d at 455-59. Neither issue is appropriate here and Alexander has cited no other authority to support his argument. Here, there were no statements made by the victim which the State introduced through the counselor and the counselor did not testify as to the credibility of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Expert testimony is permissible to explain the existence of medical or psychological conditions associated with abuse. In <em>State v. Scott </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 454, 465, 850 P.2d 286, 292-93, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Expert testimony relating to the contradictory behavior ... of a child victim of sexual abuse, will be allowed to enlighten the jury on a subject with which most people have no common experience and to assist the jurors in assessing the credibility of the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azy\">We conclude the testimony given by Piersall in this case is the sort of testimony referred to in <em>Scott </em>which pertains to explaining the behavior of the victim and which is intended to assist the jurors in assessing the credibility of the victim. <em>Scott </em>also discussed the testimony of a counselor relating to the credibility of the child victim; this sort of testimony was not used in this case as Piersall did not testify as to the victim\u2019s credibility. His testimony was informative to the jurors on the nature of post traumatic stress disorder and did not impinge on the jury\u2019s determination of credibility of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We hold the District Court erred by admitting the testimony of Brad Custer to establish where the offenses occurred and that such error was harmless. We further hold that none of the other testimony challenged by Alexander constituted improper hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Did the District Court err in refusing to continue the sentencing to allow the inclusion of a sex offender evaluation in the Pre-Sentence Investigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>On June 28, 1992, the District Court ordered an evaluation by a psychologist \u201cfor purposes of ascertaining [Alexander\u2019s] amenability to treatment in an outpatient program.\u201d The evaluation was to be provided to the District Court as part of the presentence investigation. The court ordered that the sex offender evaluation be conducted by Northwest Family Recovery, licensed clinical psychologists. The court further ordered that copies of the evaluation be included in the presentence investigation <em>pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA. </em>When that evaluation was not completed by the time scheduled for the sentencing hearing, the District Court refused to continue the hearing and sentenced the defendant without the benefit of the sex offender evaluation and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">During the sentencing hearing conducted on August 5, 1993, counsel for Alexander advised the court that Andy Hudak of Northwest Family Recovery was working on the evaluation but that it would not be completed for at least another month. He requested that the sentencing hearing be continued until the evaluation had been completed and considered by the court. The prosecutor advised the court that she too had spoken with Hudak and that Hudak had told her that persons such as Alexander who maintain their innocence about the sexual behavior at issue are generally not amenable to treatment in his outpatient program. The District Court acknowledged its own familiarity with such programs, noted the continued denial of the defendant and denied the motion to continue the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Alexander contends that the District Court erred by refusing to continue the sentencing hearing and by sentencing him without considering Hudak\u2019s report. He argues that this violated the presentence investigation requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA. Section 46-18-111, MCA (1991), applies to Alexander\u2019s sentencing and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">46-18-111. Presentence investigation \u2014 when required. (1) Upon ... a verdict or finding of guilty to one or more felony offenses, the district court shall direct the probation officer to make a presentence investigation and report.... The investigation <em>must include an evaluation of the defendant and a recommendation as to treatment </em>by a person qualified under guidelines established by the department of corrections and human services. ... (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Section 46-18-111(1), MCA, was amended by the 1993 Legislature and now specifically addresses perpetrators of sexual crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>involving victims under the age of sixteen years. The legislature amended subsection (1) to include a mandate for an evaluation and a recommendation as to treatment in the least restrictive environment in light of community safety and offender needs. Although Alexander argues that the amended statute is more applicable to this case and should apply, that statute took effect on October 1, 1993, after Alexander\u2019s sentencing. However, the statute as previously written also requires an evaluation and recommendation as to treatment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Nonetheless, the State argues that because the District Court considered placement in a less restrictive environment than the Montana State Prison and recognized Alexander\u2019s rights to continue to claim his innocence, Alexander was not prejudiced by sentencing without the evaluation. The express wording of the 1991 statute, however, requires that the District Court <em>\u201cshall </em>direct the probation officer to make a presentence evaluation and report\u201d and that the \u201cinvestigation <em>must </em>include an evaluation of the defendant and a recommendation as to treatment\u201d by a qualified person.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Sentencing decisions made by a district court are generally discretionary as trial judges are granted broad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hembd </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 407, 411, 838 P.2d 412, 415. However, the appropriate standard of review here as to this issue is whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Strong </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 48, 49, 851 P.2d 415, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In this case, the District Court sentenced the defendant before the presentence investigation was completed. The trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the appropriate punishment in such a case cannot be exercised until and unless the statute concerning presentence investigations has been correctly applied. We conclude that the District Court did not have the discretion to sentence the defendant in this case without considering a complete presentence investigation containing the evaluation and recommendation required by \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">After Alexander\u2019s sentencing, Hudak completed Alexander\u2019s Amenity Evaluation (for purposes of amenability for outpatient therapy) and the evaluation is now part of the record and can be included in the presentence investigation. Thus, on remand, the District Court will have a complete presentence investigation to consider in light of our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>We hold the District Court erred in refusing to continue the sentencing in order to allow the inclusion of a sex offender evaluation in the Pre-Sentence Investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
