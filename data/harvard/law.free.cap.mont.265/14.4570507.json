The assertions of error relate to alleged abuses of discretion by the Municipal Court in granting the City of Missoula\u2019s motion in limine excluding certain testimony and materials from evidence in the underlying criminal trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. Appellants were among numerous people arrested at the Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula on November 23, 1991, as a result of their activities in blocking the Clinic doors and interfering with people desiring to utilize the Clinic. All adult defendants were charged with trespass, criminal contempt and disorderly conduct; the City subsequently amended the charge of disorderly conduct to one of failure of disorderly persons to disperse.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Certain defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges. Anumber of notices of affirmative defenses also were filed. The City of Missoula (City) filed a motion in limine requesting the Municipal Court to exclude evidence purportedly relating to defenses. The court denied the motions to dismiss and granted the City\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">A jury trial was held and Appellants were convicted of the three offenses with which they were charged. They appealed their convictions to the District Court on a variety of grounds, including the granting of the City\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The District Court reviewed the record and questions of law pursuant to \u00a7 3-6-110, MCA. It rejected Appellants\u2019 assertions of error, affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court and remanded to that court for execution of the sentences imposed. On motion of the Appellants, the District Court subsequently stayed execution of the sentences pending appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Did the Municipal Court abuse its discretion in excluding evidence relating to whether life begins at conception?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Appellants\u2019 assertions of error relating to the Municipal Court\u2019s granting of the City\u2019s motion in limine are premised on the principles that criminal defendants have a right to be heard and to present a defense. These principles and their importance in American jurisprudence are so fundamental and well-established as to need no discussion or citation to authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>It is equally clear, however, that limitations exist on the right to be heard and present a defense. \u201cIn the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1049, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In the case before us, the City filed a motion in limine \u2014 primarily on relevance grounds \u2014 to exclude testimony and materials to be offered by Appellants in connection with their \u201cdefenses.\u201d The Municipal Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the introduction of evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>City of Helena v. Lewis </em>(1993), 260 Mont 421, 425, 860 P.2d 698, 700 (citation omitted). We will not overturn a court\u2019s grant of such a motion absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Lewis, </em>860 P.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The admissibility of the evidence to be offered by Appellants at trial is, in the first instance, a question of relevance. \u201cRelevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Relevant evidence generally is admissible; \u201c[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Relevant evidence in this case relates to whether the Appellants committed the charged offenses and whether any recognized defenses are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Defenses to criminal charges generally are matters of statute in Montana. Defenses available include \u201ccompulsion\u201d and \u201cuse of force in defense of person,\u201d sometimes called the justifiable use of force defense, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-212 and 45-3-102, MCA. The compulsion defense merges the common law defenses of necessity, justification, compulsion, duress and \u201cchoice of two evils.\u201d <em>State v. Ottwell </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 376, 379, 784 P.2d 402, 404. Appellants herein do not specifically argue that any of the evidence excluded by the grant of the City\u2019s motion in limine is relevant to these, or any other, statutory defenses. Moreover, they appear to concede that, under <em>Lewis, </em>the compulsion defense is not available here because it does not excuse criminal conduct in response to imminent threat of harm to a third party. See <em>Lewis, </em>860 P.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Appellants do present a lengthy discussion on when life begins. They assert that the Municipal Court abused its discretion in exclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ing evidence of their belief that life begins at conception, without citing to any defense to which that evidence might be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Appellants apparently are attempting to argue that, if life begins at conception, they are entitled to rely on the justifiable use of force defense. Insofar as is relevant here, that defense justifies a person\u2019s \u201cuse of force ... against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend ... another against such other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force.\u201d Section 45-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As best we can construct Appellants\u2019 argument, it is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">1. Appellants\u2019 acts of trespass would be characterized as the \u201cuse of force\u201d against another \u2014 the Clinic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">2. The Clinic\u2019s performing of abortions would be characterized as the \u201cuse of force\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">3. Appellants believe that life begins at conception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">4. Under Appellants\u2019 belief, the fetus would be \u201canother\u201d against whom the use of force was imminent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">5. Thus, Appellants\u2019 \u201cforcible\u201d trespass would be based on their \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that such conduct was necessary to defend the fetus against the imminent use of force by the Clinic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Even assuming (without so holding) that the first two characterizations were appropriate, the statutory justifiable use of force defense is not applicable to Appellants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Section 45-3-102, MCA, requires that the use of force against another alleged to be imminent, and to justify a corresponding use of force, must be \u201cunlawful.\u201d In light of the continued efficacy of <em>Roe v. Wade </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147, the Clinic\u2019s activities cannot constitute the unlawful force required for application of the justifiable use of force defense as defined in \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Appellants contend that our decision in <em>Strzelczyk v. Jett </em>(Mont. 1994), 870 P.2d 730, 51 St.Rep. 206, supports their position that they were entitled to defend against criminal charges by discussing when life begins. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">In <em>Jett, </em>we concluded that a full-term fetus is a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA, for purposes of bringing an action for the tort of wrongful death. <em>Jett, </em>870 P.2d at 733. We did not reference or discuss issues of viability or when life begins. Moreover, the concurring opinion in <em>Jett </em>specifically notes that the case did <em>not </em>relate to abortion in any way, and briefly discusses the differences between acts which might form the basis for a negligence action for wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>death and those which result in a lawful abortion under <em>Roe. Jett, </em>870 P.2d at 733 (Gray, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">We conclude that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Appellants\u2019 evidence on when life begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Did the Municipal Court abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of biblical or moral justification?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Appellants also assert that the Municipal Court abused its discretion in precluding their ability to rely on biblical or moral justification as a defense to the criminal charges against them. As set forth above, defenses to criminal charges are statutory in Montana. Appellants\u2019 individual religious and moral beliefs are neither included in, nor relevant to, those statutory defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In affirming a district court\u2019s rejection of biblical or moral justifications for actions substantially similar to those of Appellants here, we quoted with approval the following language from <em>Cleveland v. Municipality of Anchorage </em>(Alaska 1981), 631 P.2d 1073, 1084:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\u201c[t]hey [philosophers and religionists discussing civil disobedience] have been in general agreement that while in restricted circumstances a morally motivated act contrary to law may be ethically justified, the action must be non-violent and the actor must accept the penalty for his action. In other words, it is commonly conceded that the exercise of a moral judgment based upon individual standards does not carry with it legal justification or immunity from punishment for breach of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\"><em>Lewis, </em>860 P.2d at 702-703. The same reasoning applies here. Appellants\u2019 beliefs are sincere and fervent and Appellants are entitled to hold and act upon them. Those personal beliefs, however, do not provide legal justification for, or immunize Appellants from the consequences of, acts which violate the criminal laws of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">We conclude that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of biblical or moral justification for Appellants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Did the Municipal Court abuse its discretion in excluding \u201ctreaty\u201d or \u201cinternational law\u201d defenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">Several of the Appellants raised an issue of reliance on treaties entered into by the United States in their motions to dismiss in the Municipal Court. The City included reliance on the treaty in its motion in limine, which was granted by that court. In a section of their brief before us entitled \u2018Whether the trial court erroneously excluded the defense of international laws,\u201d Appellants reassert that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>treaty issue here. The City responds that the treaty/international laws issue is not properly before us. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">As set forth above, the District Court reviewed this appeal from the Municipal Court under \u00a7 3-6-110, MCA. Under that procedure, unlike \u201cappeals\u201d for trial <em>de novo </em>from justice court to district court, the district court acts as an appellate court and reviews questions of law presented on the record before it. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-6-110, MCA; <em>In the Matter of Municipal Court Appeals to District Court, </em>Order of the Montana Supreme Court, dated May 12, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Appellants filed a \u201cDefendants\u2019 Opening Brief,\u201d together with an appendix to that brief, in their appeal to the District Court. The City filed a responsive brief. No further briefs were filed. We have scrutinized the Appellants\u2019 brief in the District Court closely. It advances no issue regarding the treaty as paramount law; indeed, the treaty Appellants attempt to rely on here is never mentioned therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The principle that this Court will not address an issue not presented to the trial court is well-established. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 62, 65, 853 P.2d 1188, 1190. The rationale underlying the principle \u2014 while seldom stated \u2014 is that both fairness and judicial economy necessitate bringing alleged errors to the attention of each court involved, so that actual error can be prevent\u00e9d or corrected at the first opportunity. <em>See State v. Applegate </em>(Or. App. 1979), 591 P.2d 371, 373. Here, of course, the \u201ctreaty\u201d issue <em>was </em>presented to the trial court which, in this instance, was the Municipal Court. However, the treaty issue was not presented to the first-level appellate court \u2014 here, the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">While we have little experience in Montana with two-tiered appeals such as that presently before us, the expressed rationale clearly carries over into a two-tiered appeal. Thus, based on the Appellants\u2019 failure to raise the treaty issue at the first appellate level in the District Court, we conclude that the issue is not properly before us. As a result, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-9\">JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, HUNT and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
