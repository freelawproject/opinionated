It ended when Waiters pulled out a revolver and fired repeatedly at Lorenzo, Warren\u2019s adult son who had intervened on his mother\u2019s behalf, injuring both Lorenzo and Warren\u2019s 14-year old daughter, and killing Warren\u2019s aunt and her aunt\u2019s three-year-old grandchild. Following a jury trial, Waiters was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Waiters does not deny engaging in the conduct underlying these crimes. Rather, he contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a medical expert both to interpret\u2014and thereby render admissible\u2014the portion of his medical records documenting his blood alcohol level (\u201cBAC\u201d), and to expound upon the effects of that level of intoxication. With that evidence, Waiters contends, it is reasonably likely that the jury would not have concluded that he harbored the requisite in-' tent to commit his crimes. The state trial court judge who presided over Waiters\u2019s four-day trial rejected this claim, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Waiters had presented nothing \u201cestablishing that medical testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s level of intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ication would have changed the jury\u2019s finding.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 55. The district court (Gleeson, <em>J.), </em>however, disagreed and granted Waiters\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. To establish a <em>Strickland </em>claim, the likelihood of a different result in the absence of the alleged deficiencies in representation \u201cmust be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 112, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011); <em>see also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d). Here, we cannot say with any assurance how the jury might have weighed the proffered expert evidence of the effects of intoxication on the average person\u2019s ability to form intent against Waiters\u2019s own specific behavior and statements, including his admission to Warren, about a year after the incident, that he was <em>\u201caiming </em>after\u201d Lorenzo (and thus intending to shoot) because he felt that Lorenzo \u201cwas trying to come between\u201d them. Trial Tr. at 466 (emphasis added). We are therefore guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that in cases like this one, governed by \u00a7 2254(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the \u201cstate court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as \u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 101, 131 S.Ct. 770 (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004)). Here, the state trial court\u2019s determination that Waiters failed to establish prejudice was not unreasonable; it was not so lacking in justification as to be \u201cbeyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770. The district court accordingly erred in second-guessing that determination and substituting its own judgment for that of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">I. Factual Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">A. The Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">On the afternoon of Saturday, May 6, -2006, Warren threw Waiters a party at her apartment, in which Waiters also resided, to celebrate his 36th birthday.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The party was attended by members of Warren\u2019s family, including her teenage children Derrick and Shatashia, who lived with Warren; her sister and sister\u2019s husband; and her aunt Mary Lee Clark (\u201cClark\u201d) and Clark\u2019s five grandchildren, who ranged in age from only a couple of months old to about ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Waiters had begun drinking earlier in the day, and had additional Bacardi Light and soda with Warren and Clark during the party. According to Warren, she and Waiters drank every day; sometimes a fifth of rum managed to last them two days. Waiters regularly became verbally abusive when he drank, though he did not so behave that afternoon. The party lasted until about 11:00 p.m., when Warren\u2019s sister and brother-in-law left. Clark and her grandchildren stayed the night. Warren\u2019s 23-year-old son, Lorenzo, a letter carrier with the Postal Service who lived at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>apartment but did not attend the birthday party, returned home at about 2:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The next day, Waiters was up before 9:30 and went out to purchase cereal and milk for the crowd. Then, before 11:00 a.m., he resumed drinking with Warren and Clark for about half an hour. Shortly thereafter, Warren took the bottle from Waiters, telling him he\u2019d had \u201ctoo much to drink.\u201d Suppl. App\u2019x at 43. Waiters resisted, exclaiming loudly, \u201cFuck you, bitch,\u201d after which an argument ensued. <em>Id. </em>at 44. According to Warren, the pair feuded for a period, until' Waiters abruptly left the apartment, only to return about 10 minutes later.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Upon his return, Waiters proceeded directly to the couple\u2019s bedroom. He remained there for 15 to 20 minutes before reappearing in the living room, now wearing a jacket. By this point, he was \u201cscreaming[,] ... yelling[,] and ... calling [Warren] names.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46. Clark implored him to calm down. Waiters and Warren exchanged curses before Warren demanded that he leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Lorenzo Warren testified that he heard the arguing and came out from his bedroom to the living room to intervene, telling Waiters to \u201cstep away from [his] mother\u201d and to not \u201cget in [her] face.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 19. Waiters told Lorenzo that the argument did not \u201cconcern\u201d him. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Lorenzo then moved closer to Waiters, at which point Warren and Clark pushed the two men to opposite ends of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Derrick, then 17, and his younger sister Shatashia, 14, by this time drawn to the living room by the commotion, heard, respectively, Waiters tell Lorenzo, \u201cI got something for you,\u201d Trial Tr. at 483, and \u201cyou don\u2019t want me to pull what I got out of my jacket,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 309. Lorenzo nonetheless openly doubted that Waiters had anything in his jacket. Waiters then pulled out a revolver and pointed it at Lorenzo, who, according to his trial testimony, continued to taunt Waiters, saying, \u201cThat gun isn\u2019t loaded. You don\u2019t have any bullets in that gun.\u201d Suppl. App\u2019x at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Waiters thereafter rapidly fired multiple shots. Derrick observed Waiters aim \u201c[straight\u201d at his brother, Trial. Tr. at 504, from a distance of about seven or eight feet. Warren saw Waiters shoot at Lorenzo as \u201che started going toward where Lorenzo was standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. Waiters\u2019s first shot hit Lorenzo in the thigh, and the remainder hit Shatashia in the thigh; Clark in the head, abdomen, and leg; and three-year-old Tajmere Clark, who had run out to her grandmother during the tumult, in the head and chest. Clark was rendered comatose and succumbed to her injuries after trial; Tajmere died at the scene..</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Waiters thereafter attempted to leave. According to Derrick, who stood between Waiters and the front door, Waiters pointed the gun, a .357 revolver, point-blank at Derrick\u2019s face. Waiters then \u201cpulled the trigger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508. When the gun \u201cclicked,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 508, indicating to Derrick that it was out of ammunition, Waiters moved toward the exit but Derrick tackled him to the ground and began punching. Lorenzo, though injured, then got on top of Waiters and instructed his brother to leave, all while Waiters continued squeezing the trigger of his gun and \u201cpointing it wildly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Lorenzo began punch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ing Waiters, but Waiters indicated that Lorenzo \u201cwasn\u2019t strong enough\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t causing him any harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 181, asking him, \u201cIs that all you got?,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 420. Waiters ultimately sustained a concussion after Lorenzo hit him with a fish tank and Derrick hit him with a vase at Lorenzo\u2019s instruction, around which time Waiters yelled to Warren for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Police and paramedics responded to the scene and transported both Waiters and his victims to the hospital. Medical records introduced at trial noted that Waiters was intoxicated when he arrived at Kings County Hospital Center, and that his \u201cCNS\u201d could not be \u201cassess[ed] due to [his] intoxicated state.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Suppl. App\u2019x at 94. Records not before the trial jury but part of the record on appeal indicate that as of 12:83 p.m., approximately an hour after the events in question, Waiters registered an ethyl alcohol level of 386.24, the equivalent of a 0.39 BAC, which the hospital marked as \u201ccritical.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 76. Waiters was alert on admission, but confused and unaware of the time or where he was. He experienced continued disorientation and reported hallucinations in the days thereafter; hospital staff documented his delirium and history of \u201calcohol abuse and dependence.\u201d Suppl. App\u2019x at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">B. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Beginning on May 5, 2008, General Waiters stood trial in New York Supreme Court, Kings County.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its opening statement, the prosecution explained that it would prove that Waiters, in an alcohol-fueled rage, attempted to shoot and kill Lorenzo Warren, and that he was therefore responsible for all of the resulting .injuries\u2014and, at that time, the single fatality <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014under a theory of transferred intent. Waiters\u2019s attorney, Calvin Simons (\u201cSimons\u201d), did not articulate a particular defense in his opening, but he stressed to the jury that Waiters was not charged with intending to kill or injure anyone but Lorenzo: \u201cThe issue which you will focus on, as the People have stated, will be Lorenzo Warren.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">During the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, Lorenzo testified that Waiters appeared drunk during their altercation because his \u201cspeech ... was a little bit slurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Lorenzo indicated, however, that he had previously seen Waiters intoxicated \u201caround maybe ten\u201d times, <em>id. </em>at 27, and that he had been \u201cway worse\u201d on those occasions, <em>id. </em>at 30. Derrick testified that Waiters drank during the party the previous evening, as did the other adults, while Shatashia testified that she did not notice whether the adults were drinking, as she \u201cwas in a room with the kids.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">For her part, Warren testified that Waiters drank on a daily basis, and that it caused him to become verbally abusive. She did not recall, however, how much Waiters had to drink on the day of his party or the next morning, although she testified that she drank with him and with Clark for about half an hour that morning before taking the bottle of Bacardi away.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">Warren further testified that about a year after the shootings, in Spring 2007, Waiters telephoned her. During the conversation, Warren asked Waiters why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>had done what he did. Waiters explained that \u201che was aiming after [Lorenzo] ... [b]eeause he was coming between [them].\u201d Trial Tr. at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">At the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s ease, Simons indicated that the defense would decide over the weekend whether to call Dr. Sanford Drob as part of the defense case. Dr. Drob was a forensic psychologist engaged by the defense to explore a possible affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. During the pretrial period, Waiters was evaluated by both Dr. Drob and Dr. Alexander Sasha Bardey\u2014a prosecution expert\u2014in connection with this defense, for which Simons had served notice. The prosecution responded by noting that Dr. Drob\u2019s testimony might open the door to the admission of a statement made by Waiters to police in the aftermath of the shootings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court advised Simons to \u201cmake Doctor Drob aware of the fact that certainly if he opens the door, and maybe opening a door to a can of worms, that would not be helpful to your client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524. It then recessed for the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The following Monday, Simons informed the trial court that Waiters did not want Dr. Drob to testify. Waiters confirmed that proposition, and further indicated that he did not wish to testify on his own behalf. Simons thereafter sought to introduce certified medical records of Waiters\u2019s hospital visit in support of the argument that Waiters was intoxicated and unable to form intent. The prosecution objected, arguing primarily that the evidence already indicated that Waiters was drinking, intoxicated, and suffered a head injury; that the hospital records would invite speculation absent an explanation of the terms contained therein; and that introducing them might open the door to evidence that General Waiters, \u201cin talking to both Doctor Drob[] and Doctor Bardey, said that he hadn\u2019t been drinking that morning, was not intoxicated, and was able to give a coherent version, his coherent version about what had happened.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Suppl. App\u2019x at 66. The trial court ultimately admitted two redacted pages of the medical records which together indicated, as previously stated, that Waiters arrived at the hospital in an intoxicated state and that hospital staff could not evaluate his \u201cCNS\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>result. The trial court found that all other parts of the medical record \u201cwould not be [relevant] without an explanation by medical personnel.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 73. Simons took exception to the redaction, but rather than seek an adjournment to obtain a medical expert, he indicated that the defense was \u201cprepared to go forward\u201d without the full medical records being admitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In his summation, Simons argued that Waiters was so intoxicated that he did not intend to kill Lorenzo, but rather was merely reckless. He attempted to cast doubt on the testimony of Warren and her family suggesting the contrary by emphasizing discrepancies and omissions in the various witness accounts. He noted, among other things, that Waiters started drinking again that morning; that the medical records indicated that he was intoxicated; that multiple witnesses testified that Waiters changed when he drank; and that Waiters continued to pull the trigger on his revolver even after he had discharged all of its bullets. Simons also attacked the credibility of Warren\u2019s testimony about Waiters\u2019s phone call in Spring 2007, noting that she did not immediately mention the call to the prosecutor, even though she had \u201calready talked to the District Attorney in the case.\u201d Trial Tr. at 607-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In response, the prosecution also focused on Waiters\u2019s intent, noting that Waiters was able to perform the' physical acts necessary to commit his crimes, and that his use of the gun\u2014and specifically the fact that he targeted and successfully shot Lorenzo, \u201ctrackpng] over to\u201d follow him as Lorenzo moved across the apartment\u2014suggested that he was able to intend, and did intend, to kill. <em>Id. </em>at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The prosecution likewise argued that, while Waiters \u201cdrank seriously every day,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, and was voluntarily intoxicated that morning, the witness testimony suggested he was not so severely intoxicated that he was unable to form intent. Indeed, the prosecution explained that Waiters bought cereal and milk that morning; argued with Warren about his drinking; obtained a revolver and hid it in his jacket; argued with and ultimately shot Lorenzo; and attempted to escape the apartment after exhausting his ammunition. Moreover, Waiters\u2019s phone call to Warren, the prosecution contended, clearly demonstrated that he formed the requisite intent to commit his crimes: \u201c[I]f he\u2019s so blown out, if he is so, so soused that he can\u2019t form intent ... when Jackie asked him Why did you do it?\u2019 he would have said, \u2018Honey, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. Instead, the prosecution maintained, General Waiters <em>admitted </em>that he intended to shoot Lorenzo \u201cto eliminate him for corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ing between\u201d Waiters and Warren. <em>Id. </em>at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Thereafter, at Simons\u2019s request, the state trial court: (a) instructed the jury on the relevance of intoxication evidence, describing how it can serve to negate the intent element of the crimes with which Waiters was charged, and (b) instructed the jury on manslaughter in the first degree, as a lesser-included charge of second degree murder. Thereafter, on May 13, 2008\u2014the same day on which deliberations began\u2014the jury found Waiters guilty of one count of murder in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 125.25(1); one count of attempted murder in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00 and 125.25(1); and two counts of assault in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 120.10(1). The trial court ultimately sentenced Waiters to consecutive sentences of 25 years to life for second-degree murder, 10 years for second-degree attempted murder, 25 years and five years for each of the assault counts, respectively, and five years of post-release supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">II. Post-Trial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Waiters filed both a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate his conviction under New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10(l)(h) (the \u201c440.10 motion\u201d) and, with the assistance of counsel, a direct appeal. In his 440.10motion, Waiters maintained that Si-mons was constitutionally ineffective for failing to call an expert witness to interpret his hospital records and testify about his intoxication, and for not requesting that the trial court charge the jury on second-degree manslaughter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On January 26, 2011, the state trial court denied Waiters\u2019s 440.10 motion as procedurally barred, concluding that sufficient facts appeared on the face of the record to permit review of his claims on direct appeal. The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division\u2014 Second Judicial Department (\u201cAppellate Division\u201d) denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Waiters thereafter filed a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief in his direct appeal, dated February 4, 2011, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for the same reasons as those identified in his 440.10 motion. On May 8, 2012, the Appellate Division modified Waiters\u2019s sentence by directing that portions of it run concurrently, but otherwise rejected Waiters\u2019s appeal. <em>See People v. Waiters, </em>95 A.D.3d 1043, 1044-45, 943 N.Y.S.2d 589 (2d Dep\u2019t 2012). The Appellate Division determined that Waiters\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim could not be resolved \u201cwithout reference to matter outside the record,\u201d such that it was, in fact, appropriately raised in a 440.10 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1044-45, 943 N.Y.S.2d 589. The New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. <em>People v. Waiters, </em>19 N.Y.3d 1002, 951 N.Y.S.2d 478, 975 N.E.2d 924 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">A year later, on June 26, 2013, Waiters filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), alleging, once again, that Si-mons was constitutionally ineffective for the same reasons as those identified in his 440.10motion. On November 5, 2013, the district court (Gleeson, <em>J.) </em>appointed counsel and stayed the case to permit Waiters to exhaust his claims through a renewed 440.10motion. The state trial court thereafter held an evidentiary hearing on Waiters\u2019s renewed 440.10 motion on May 28 and 29, 2014\u2014six years after Waiters\u2019s trial\u2014at which Waiters called Dr. Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Stripp, a forensic toxicologist, and Simons, his trial attorney.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Dr. Stripp testified that Waiters\u2019s BAC of 0.39 was \u201csignificantly elevated,\u201d Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 75, and that it meant that Waiters had consumed sixteen alcoholic drinks that morning, or even more if his drinking was spread over a longer period of time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Dr. Stripp further opined that an average person with such a high BAC would suffer \u201cmotor impairment\u201d and \u201csignificant cognitive impairment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 81, including compromised judgment and emotional instability, blackouts, and amnesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Dr. Stripp also recognized, however, that there is \u201cvery significant individual! ] variation\u201d in how individuals are affected by alcohol, such that tolerance is \u201cone of the most important considerations when interpreting a blood alcohol concentration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. Accordingly, he explained that a \u201cvery tolerant drinker [can] have some level of functioning\u201d when intoxicated, <em>id. </em>at 82, such that the effects of intoxication\u2014be they physical or mental, which Dr. Stripp explained do not always manifest in tandem\u2014may be reduced by as much as half. In fact, Dr. Stripp indicated that he had seen individuals with very high BACs who were, despite exhibiting poor <em>judgment, </em>still able to form <em>intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Based on the medical records, Dr. Stripp noted that while hospitalized in the aftermath of the shootings, Waiters suffered from delirium and hallucinations caused by alcohol withdrawal which, together with abnormal liver function, suggested that Waiters had a long-term alcohol problem and consumed large quantities on a daily basis. Therefore, and given the aforementioned \u201csignificant variation\u201d in individuals\u2019 alcohol tolerance, <em>id. </em>at 89, Dr. Stripp concluded that while Waiters\u2019s \u201c[d]efinite[ ]\u201d drunkenness affected his \u201cfunctioning and judgment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 95, 102, Dr. Stripp could not opine on how tolerant Waiters was, or on what effect his intoxication may have had on his ability to form intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Simons, in his testimony, explained that he sought and obtained a subpoena for Waiters\u2019s hospital records within two weeks of his first appearance in the case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Simons and his client initially planned on pursuing an extreme emotional disturbance defense and calling both Dr. Drob and Waiters to support it, but Simons became concerned about the defense\u2019s viability before trial, and it was ultimately not pursued.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Simons further represented that Waiters, on the day of his scheduled testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>mony, decided not to take the stand, despite Simons advising him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Sometime after the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defense settled on an intoxication-based theory and, to that end, Si-mons sought to introduce Waiters\u2019s full hospital records. Simons indicated that he discussed the significance of Waiters\u2019s blood alcohol level with his client \u201ca lot,\u201d but that the \u201cproblem\u201d was that when he asked Waiters about his 0.39 BAC, Waiters told him\u2014consistent with his statements to Dr. Drob and Dr. Bardey\u2014that he was not drunk, and that while he \u201cdrank the night before,\u201d on the morning of the shootings he \u201cdid not feel drunk at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. Further, according to Si-mons, Waiters consistently represented that he fired at Lorenzo to \u201cscare him or ... hit him in the leg,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 182, the same explanation he had provided to the experts. Simons ultimately did not offer a strategic reason for not calling a medical expert, claiming he could no longer remember what he was thinking, though he affirmed he was pursuing a strategy in Waiters\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Following the hearing, on October 14, 2014, the state trial court denied Waiters\u2019s renewed 440.10 motion, finding that Si-mons\u2019s failure to call a medical expert to explain Waiters\u2019s medical records and BAC amounted to a permissible \u201cmere tactical decision\u201d under <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 55. The trial court explained that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s intoxicated state was explored before the jury,\u201d and that, more generally, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Stripp ... could not establish that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was such that his intent to commit the crime was negated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. The trial court accordingly determined that while Simons could have called an expert to explain the medical records, \u201c[particularly in light of the defendant\u2019s claims that he was not intoxicated at the time of this incident,\u201d the failure to do so \u201cunder the particular facts and circumstances of [the] case\u201d did not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 55. Simons, the trial court also noted, was placed \u201cin the untenable position of setting forth a theory which was not consistent with the defendant\u2019s own position,\u201d namely that he was not intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 55. Thus, for each ineffectiveness contention \u201cthere [were] equally plausible explanations why trial counsel proceeded in the manner which he did at the time of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">As to prejudice, the state trial court first observed that Waiters\u2019s intoxicated state and its impact on the defendant\u2019s capacity to form intent had been considered and rejected by the jury, and that expert evidence would not likely have influenced this result given that \u201cDr. Stripp established [that while] the defendant had a particularly high blood alcohol level ... the effects of [that level] could vary greatly depending on the defendant\u2019s tolerance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. There was otherwise \u201cno testimony presented which established that medical testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s level of intoxication would have changed the jury\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that while Simons could have called an expert, \u201chis failure to do so [did] not rise to the level of a course of conduct which was inexplicably prejudicial.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 55. The Appellate Division again denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Waiters thereafter returned to district court. The district court lifted the stay, ordered additional briefing, and held oral argument on Waiters\u2019s habeas petition on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>July 24, 2015. On September 25, 2015, the district court granted Waiters\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding the state court\u2019s rejection of his 440.10 motion to be \u201can unreasonable application of the <em>Strickland </em>standard,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 24, and ordering Waiters\u2019s release within 45 days. The district court also denied the State\u2019s application for a stay pending the appeal. The State thereafter filed an application for a stay in this Court, and on April 5, 2016, we granted the application and stayed Waiters\u2019s release indefinitely pending this panel\u2019s resolution of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>set forth a two-part test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. To warrant relief, a defendant must demonstrate both \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>accord Fischer v.

We review the district court\u2019s grant of a petition for habeas corpus <em>de novo, </em>and its underlying findings of fact for clear error. <em>Ramchair v. Conway, </em>601 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Under AEDPA, when a state court adjudicates a petitioner\u2019s habeas claim on the merits, a district court may only grant relief where the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). AEDPA by its terms requires substantial deference to the state court\u2019s decision in all cases governed, as here, by \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>See Cavazos v.

Stone, </em>221 F.3d 100, 109 (2d Cir. 2000))). Accordingly, to justify relief, Waiters was required to establish \u201cthat the state court\u2019s ruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770; <em>accord Vega v.

To be clear, however, the fact that Simons no longer remembers his reason for this decision does not preclude a determination that Waiters failed to establish constitutionally defective representation. The state trial judge noted that for each argument raised by Waiters supposedly demonstrating his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, \u201cthere [were] equally plausible explanations why trial counsel proceeded in the manner which he did at the time of the trial.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 55. We see no reason to disagree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But, as the Supreme Court ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>plained in <em>Strickland </em>itself, \u201c[t]he object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance\u201d so that \u201c[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>accord Strouse v. Leonardo, </em>928 F.2d 548, 556 (2d Cir. 1991). We conclude that the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in determining that Si-mons\u2019s conduct was not prejudicial, <em>ie., </em>in finding that Waiters failed to demonstrate that it was reasonably likely that calling a medical expert would have changed the outcome of his trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See Carrion, </em>549 F.3d at 588 (noting that a petitioner must \u201c \u2018affirmatively prove prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient representation\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v.

And while a \u201crelatively low threshold\u201d exists to demonstrate entitlement to an intoxication <em>charge, </em>even a charge may not be warranted, despite the defendant\u2019s substantial use of intoxicants at the time of an alleged crime, where \u201cthe uncontradicted record evidence ... supports the conclusion that his overall behavior on the day of the incident was purposeful.\u201d <em>Sirico, </em>17 N.Y.3d at 746, 929 N.Y.S.2d 14, 952 N.E.2d 1006; <em>see also People v.

He further contends, as he must, that the state court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was sufficiently unreasonable such that \u201cthere is no possibility fairmind-ed jurists could disagree.\u201d <em>See Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770. For the following reasons, Waiters is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">B. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">At the close of Waiters\u2019s trial, based on both witness testimony and the two redacted pages of medical records that the district court admitted, the jury was well aware that Waiters had been drinking both during his birthday party and the following morning, and that he was intoxicated when he emptied his revolver in the direction of Warren\u2019s family. The jury was also privy to evidence indicating that Waiters\u2019s intoxication had not rendered him incapable of purposeful action, including testimony documenting his actions and conversations on the morning of the incident, and his subsequent admission to Warren that he had targeted Lorenzo because Lorenzo was \u201ccoming between\u201d them. Trial Tr. at 421. On the basis of this evidence, while the jury was instructed on intoxication, it found Waiters guilty of murder, attempted murder, and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">We are not persuaded that, had the jury also heard from a medical expert and reviewed the full set of medical records, there is a sufficiently strong probability that it would have found differently such that the state trial court\u2019s determination to the contrary was unreasonable. While such evidence could have been proffered, it would not likely have made a difference in light of the strong, specific testimonial evidence indicating that Waiters formed the requisite intent to commit his crimes. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696,104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Lindstadt, </em>239 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Dr. Stripp\u2019s testimony and the medical records offer support for two propositions. First, they demonstrate that Waiters was intoxicated and had a BAC of 0.39, which the hospital deemed \u201ccritical,\u201d Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 76\u2014and which was potentially life 'threatening\u2014approximately an hour after the incident. Second, Dr. Stripp\u2019s testimony establishes that a 0.39 BAC causes significant physical and mental impairment in the <em>average </em>person, and of a sort associated with the incapacity for purposeful conduct (encompassing, for instance, blackouts and amnesia).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">However, the critical deficiency of this evidence\u2014a deficiency which the dissent notably omits to discuss\u2014is that it does not establish how the 0.39 BAC affected <em>Waiters </em>and, more specifically, whether it undermined <em>his </em>ability to form intent. As Dr. Stripp testified, there is \u201cvery significant individual ] variation\u201d among individual responses to alcohol because of variances in tolerance, which is \u201cone of the most important considerations when interpreting [BAC].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. For this reason, Dr. Stripp made clear that he had no opinion as to whether Waiters could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>formed intent and that he could not say \u201cwhen an individual along the continuum of blood alcohol content los[es] the ability to form intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. Indeed, a \u201cvery tolerant drinker [can] have some level of functioning\u201d when intoxicated, <em>id. </em>at 82, to the extent that an individual with a very high BAC can, despite bad <em>judgment, </em>still form specific <em>intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The evidence here suggests that Waiters possessed such tolerance. Warren testified that Waiters drank every day\u2014behavior that Dr. Stripp explained results in alcohol tolerance\u2014and Lorenzo maintained that he had seen Waiters intoxicated \u201cmaybe ten\u201d times, Trial Tr. at 208, and that Waiters was much <em>more </em>intoxicated on those days than he was during the incident. The full medical records likewise indicate that Waiters had a history of \u201calcohol abuse and dependence,\u201d Suppl. App\u2019x at 103, consistent with Dr. Stripp\u2019s testimony regarding Waiters\u2019s delirium, hallucinations, and abnormal liver function.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Further, to the extent that Waiters\u2019s BAC has remaining significance, even given that Waiters habitually abused alcohol and that Dr. Stripp could not opine on the question whether Waiters\u2019s intoxication negated <em>his </em>ability for purposeful conduct, it is still overshadowed, in this case, by the specific testimonial evidence of Waiters\u2019s ability to carry out purposeful acts prior to, and during, the incident. That morning, Waiters (a) purchased cereal and milk for Warren\u2019s family, an errand which necessarily involved purposeful travel and conducting a transaction; (b) argued with Warren when she took a bottle of alcohol from him; (c) obtained a revolver and had the presence of mind to hide it under a jacket; (d) argued with, and taunted, Lorenzo while making oblique references to his gun; (e) aimed and fired his revolver at Lorenzo, striking him in the thigh; (f) put his gun to Derrick\u2019s head and pulled the trigger; (g) attempted to flee the scene; (h) continued taunting Lorenzo while he struggled with him on the floor; and (i) asked Warren for help during that struggle. Collectively, these actions tend strongly to demonstrate that Waiters retained the ability to identify a conscious purpose and to act on that purpose, the intent necessary for conviction. <em>Cf. Beaty, </em>22 N.Y.3d at 921, 977 N.Y.S.2d 172, 999 N.E.2d 535 (finding that an intoxication charge was not warranted because evidence that the defendant \u201ccut a hole in a screen to gain entry [into a house], instructed the victim to be quiet, threw a blanket over her head, and stole her cell phone so she could not call the police\u201d had \u201cestablished that [the] defendant\u2019s conduct was purposeful\u201d); <em>People v. Saavedra, </em>39 A.D.3d 316, 317, 834 N.Y.S.2d 132 (1st Dep\u2019t 2007) (concluding that the \u201c[defendant's intent to cause serious physical injury could be readily inferred from his actions, and there was no evidence that he was so intoxicated as to be unable to form the requisite intent\u201d where the defendant \u201cobserved his friend fighting with [an] unarmed victim, [and thereafter] went to his car and obtained a knife with which he repeatedly stabbed the victim in the back\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Waiters\u2019s own description of the events of that morning corroborates this understanding of his mental state. According to Warren, Waiters admitted in a Spring 2007 phone call that he was \u201caiming after\u201d Lorenzo because Lorenzo was \u201ccoming between\u201d them. Trial Tr. at 421. Waiters appears, moreover, to have reported to Dr. Drob and to Dr. Bardey both that he retrieved his weapon and shot it intending to scare Lorenzo Warren because Waiters felt threatened, and that he did not feel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>intoxicated that morning at all.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The evidence thus strongly suggests that Waiters had the ability to form the requisite intent to commit his crimes. <em>Cf.

Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x at 23. While the evidence in question would certainly have supported a response to <em>this </em>prosecution argument, however, it does nothing to reduce the persuasiveness of other central elements in the prosecutor\u2019s closing, including Warren\u2019s testimony that Waiters admitted to her that he purposefully shot at Lorenzo. As recounted by the prosecution in summation, Waiters admitted to Warren, in \u201cblack and white,\u201d that he \u201cwanted to eliminate [Lorenzo] for coming between [them].\u201d Trial Tr. at 642. Moreover, we also do not presume that the prosecution\u2019s summation would have been identical had Simons introduced the medical evidence on which Waiters relies. Rather, the prosecution would, in that scenario, have emphasized the remaining evidence in the record\u2014evidence that, in any event, the prosecution <em>did </em>reference in its summation\u2014which offered substantial and un-rebutted support for the proposition that Waiters <em>did </em>intend to shoot Lorenzo Warren, regardless of his BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In this vein, the central intoxication case the district court cites, <em>Miller v. Terhune, </em>510 F.Supp.2d 486 (E.D. Cal. 2007), is unavailing.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> First, the ineffectiveness of the defendant\u2019s attorney in <em>Terhune </em>was not limited to a failure to investigate\u2014or to call an expert to testify about\u2014the effect of the defendant\u2019s intoxication, but rather included a failure even to seek an intoxication instruction or pursue an intoxication-based defense in the first place. <em>See id. </em>at 491, 502. Here, the jury <em>was </em>instructed on intoxication and Simons argued the point in his summation, yet the jury still voted to convict. Second, in <em>Miller, </em>the expert that defense counsel could have called clearly opined that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>cognitive abilities were sufficiently impaired to negate his intent to kill, <em>id. </em>at 491, 504-05, whereas here Dr. Stripp refused to draw any such conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In short, we cannot say that the state trial court\u2019s ruling\u2014that Waiters\u2019s defense was not prejudiced by Simons\u2019s conduct\u2014 was objectively unreasonable. This is not a case where Dr. Stripp\u2019s testimony and the full medical records would have so clearly \u201calter[ed] the entire evidentiary picture\u201d that the trial court\u2019s decision is indefensible. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052.

Therefore, in light of the deferential standard of review, we conclude that the district court erred in granting Waiters\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">With respect to the other grounds for habeas relief that Waiters identifies, namely Simons\u2019s alleged failure to (a) ask that the jury be charged on second-degree manslaughter, and (b) impeach Warren with prior inconsistent statements, we do not address them here because the district court did not consider them below. <em>Cf. DiSimone v.

As Simons put it to Waiters in the pretrial period, Waiters's testimony might' constitute \"the only evidence of a [threat] and if a jury does not believe you then you will probably be convicted.\u201d Letter from Calvin J.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has indicated that <em>double deference </em>is appropriate when evaluating <em>Strickland </em>claims governed by \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See, e.g., Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). Whether such heightened deference applies to both prongs of a <em>Strickland </em>claim, or only to the ineffective assistance prong, remains an open question in this Circuit. The Supreme Court has suggested that double deference is appropriate as to both prongs, <em>see Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 202, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (distinguishing two Supreme Court cases because the \u201cCourt did not apply AED-PA deference to the question of prejudice in those cases; each of them lack the important 'doubly deferential\u2019 standard of <em>Strickland </em>and AEDPA\u201d), but the Circuits that have ruled on the issue are split, <em>compare Hardy v. Chappell, </em>849 F.3d 803, 825 n.10 (9th Cir. 2016) (explaining that \"a case considering only [the prejudice] prong is not subject to double deference\u201d); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Sec\u2019y, Dep't of Corr., </em>703 F.3d 1316, 1333 (11th Cir. 2013) (\"[D]ouble deference does not apply to the prejudice inquiry.\u201d) <em>with Foust v.

We need not resolve the question here because the application of AEDPA deference alone is sufficient to conclude that vacatur is the proper course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">. As the state court noted, while Waiters\u2019s repeated insistence to Simons, Dr. Drob, and Dr. Bardey that he was aware of his actions and intended to shoot at Lorenzo did not preclude his attorney from calling a medical expert, Waiters's statements were nonetheless relevant to the question whether Simons provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in electing not to call one. <em>See Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 165, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986) (stressing courts \"must be careful not to narrow the wide range of conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct,\u201d and noting that \"the Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney\u2019s conduct was \u2018reasonably effective\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, the prosecution suggested at trial that introducing medical evidence of Waiters's level of intoxication would open the door to the admission of Waiters's statements to the doctors\u2014evidence that would have been devastating to the defense. <em>See People v. Rodriguez, </em>134 A.D.3d 512, 513, 21 N.Y.S.3d 243 (1st Dep\u2019t 2015) (concluding that the defendant \"was not deprived of effective assistance by counsel's decision\u201d not to put on evidence that might have opened the door to the defendant\u2019s incriminating admissions); <em>see also People v. Fardan, </em>82 N.Y.2d 638, 646, 607 N.Y.S.2d 220, 628 N.E.2d 41 (1993) (explaining that \"when the defendant or a witness for the defense testifies to facts that are in conflict with ... precluded evidence,\u201d the defense \" 'opens the door' on the issue in question\u201d). Moreover, seeking an adjournment to obtain a medical expert would have afforded the prosecution time to seek additional evidence concerning Waiters\u2019s capacity to form intent. The record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>permit a conclusion regarding why exactly Simons chose not to call an expert. The existence of plausible explanations, however, bears on the question (which we need not resolve) whether Waiters satisfied his burden of establishing Strickland's first prong\u2014that Simons\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>See Car-doza, </em>731 F.3d at 178 (noting petitioner\u2019s \u201cultimate burden\u201d of establishing that his rights were violated).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. The dissent maintains that the state trial court\u2019s ruling on prejudice is ambiguous and therefore unworthy of deference. We disagree. The dissent relies on a single sentence at the conclusion of the trial court\u2019s decision, which states that \u201chaving viewed the evidence first hand, there is a little doubt the claims raised by the defendant would have served to change the jury's verdict.\u201d Appellant's App'x at 56. Read in context, however, the trial court plainly did not intend to suggest the existence of prejudice, but rather inadvertently added an \u201ca\u201d and omitted a \"not\u201d (emblematic of several other typos in its opinion). Thus, earlier in the decision, the trial court clearly affirmed that \u201cDr. Stripp, called for the purpose of this hearing, could not establish that the defendant's blood alcohol level was such that his intent to commit the crime was negated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, in the sentences that immediately precede the offending clause, the district court made clear that \u201c[tjrial counsel\u2019s conduct did not constitute egregious or prejudicial conduct. ... The evidence presented established] the defendant received a fair trial with the benefit of effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, even the district court recognized that the trial court \"found there was no testimony establishing that medical testimony about Waiters's level of intoxication would have changed the jury\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. With respect, the dissent obfuscates the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">. Puzzlingly, the dissent relies on <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and not on <em>Strickland, </em>to argue its case, apparently on the theory that if the prosecution had <em>suppressed </em>the medical evidence, we would surely agree that prejudice had been established. But the prosecution did not suppress the evidence, and so this is not a counterfactual we need (or should) address. The <em>Strickland </em>prejudice inquiry partly \"finds its roots in the test for materiality of exculpatory information not disclosed to the defense by the prosecution.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. But the dissent errs in concluding that <em>Brady </em>and <em>Strickland </em>prejudice are, as a result, necessarily identical in their application. As our learned predecessor astutely observed, \u201cwords are chameleons, which reflect the col- or of their environment,\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Nat'l Carbide Corp., </em>167 F.2d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 1948) (L. Hand, <em>J.), </em>such that \"identical language may convey varying content,\u201d <em>Yates v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1082, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015). Thus, rather than look to a body of case law separate from that which governs the claim at issue here, we conclude that under well-established prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>dent specific to Strickland\u2014and particularly .to claims raised in a \u00a7 2254(d) petition\u2014the state trial court's determination that Simons's conduct did not prejudice Waiters\u2019s defense was not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">. The question is thus not, as the dissent suggests, whether Waiters was <em>extremely </em>intoxicated, whether his intoxication affected his <em>aim, </em>or even whether he had a <em>diminished </em>ability to form the requisite intent. Rather, it is whether, with the benefit of the disputed evidence, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have found that Waiters\u2019s intoxication rendered his actions <em>unintended.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. The charge of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, which the jury did not reach, did not require specific intent. See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1); <em>People v. Parrilla, 27 </em>N.Y.3d 400, 405, 53 N.E.3d 719 (2016) (indicating that a defendant \"need only knowingly possess a firearm\u201d to violate the statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">. As noted above, while Dr. Drob and Dr. Bardey were not called at trial, the record suggests that, were the full medical records admitted through the testimony of a medical expert, the prosecution would have sought to introduce evidence of Waiters\u2019s statements to the doctors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">. The remaining cases Waiters cites in his appellate brief on this issue are also unpersuasive because the circumstances at issue in those cases bear little resemblance to those at issue here. <em>See Cox v. Donnelly, </em>387 F.3d 193, 197-99 (2d Cir. 2004) (ineffective assistance for failure to object to unconstitutional intent instruction); <em>Davis v.

He did this in a drunken rage. He is not entitled to much indulgence; but he was entitled to a fair trial. He did not get one because his counsel failed to arrange entry into evidence of a hospital record showing his blood alcohol at a potentially lethal level.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Gleeson, J.) granted a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective, that prejudice was established, and that the constitutional violation survives such deference as is owed to the rulings of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The two elements of ineffectiveness under the federal Constitution are deficient performance by counsel below and prejudice. The majority opinion goes on the assumption that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), but reverses anyway on the ground that the showing of prejudice is insufficient to withstand the deference we owe to state courts in habeas cases. Because I vote to affirm, I need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>consider counsel\u2019s performance as well as prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Defense counsel failed to adduce the only effective evidence in support of the only defense that was pressed on summation. Waiters\u2019s only conceivable defense was lack of intent, and the only conceivable way he could show lack of intent was by alcohol impairment. The jury charge allowed the jury to consider the impact of alcohol on the question of intent; defense counsel on summation argued alcoholic impairment of intent; and the prosecution joined issue on that point at closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On the issue of intoxication, defense counsel held a largely bad hand. The impairment defense was undercut at trial by the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, whose family members were decimated by the gunfire. She testified that, on the morning of the shooting, she was drinking with him for half an hour but she could not say he had imbibed more than a single drink. Her son, whom Waiters shot, testified that Waiters\u2019s words were \u201ca little bit slurred,\u201d but also testified that he had seen Waiters \u201cway worse\u201d at least ten other times. This was the only testimony bearing on intoxication as the case went to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The only hope of the defense (and a potent one) was a hospital record showing that Waiters\u2019s blood alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) was .39\u2014five times the legal limit for driving; indicative (for a person of defendant\u2019s 130 pounds) of sixteen drinks the morning of the shooting; and typically enough to cause \u201csignificant cognitive impairment\u201d including \u201cimpairment on judgment,\u201d \u201cblackouts,\u201d \u201camnestic effects\u201d and \u201cpotentially even unconsciousness.\u201d App\u2019x at 81. And death. This was no mere incremental detail; it was powerful evidence of an otherwise forlorn defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">But defense counsel inexplicably never played that trump card. He did attempt to enter into evidence the defendant\u2019s post-shooting hospital records, but the state trial court allowed in just two lines of them, and excluded the BAC number on the (valid) ground that expert testimony was needed to explain what it meant. The court was more than happy to give defense counsel time to find an expert to introduce and explain the BAC record, and everyone in the courtroom (except defense counsel) seemed to appreciate the import of that evidence: the state trial judge repeatedly urged defense counsel to call an expert to introduce it, and the prosecution was willing to adjourn to allow the defense to find an expert. See infra at 489-90. Defense counsel dug in. When the court informed him that it would not allow the BAC information in unless he called an expert, defense counsel told the court he would not call any more witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Thus the state trial court allowed into evidence just two lines of the medical records, both of which blandly observed that Waiters was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d Neither line included the BAC level, and neither line could answer the crucial question of whether Waiters\u2019s intoxication was sufficient to impair intent. Defense counsel seemed not to understand how much more significant the .39 BAC was than the reference to his client as \u201cintoxicated\u201d: in the evidentiary colloquy with the state trial judge, he failed to zero in on that number; and at the post-conviction hearing, he would not agree that it signified that Waiters had been \u201cvery drunk.\u201d App\u2019x at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Unsurprisingly, the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement on the intoxication defens'e focused on problems that would have been resolved by the BAC record. See infra at 487-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The refusal by defense counsel to introduce his only powerful piece of evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>simply unaccountable. At trial, he offered no explanation. He seems not to have discussed the issue with his client before or during the evidentiary colloquy. At the hearing to vacate Waiters\u2019s conviction under New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10, conducted by the same state trial judge, defense counsel could not recall why he let pass the offered opportunity to call an expert. A pity: I would be deeply curious to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Without deciding the adequacy of counsel\u2019s representation, the majority nevertheless posits several reasons why a lawyer might do what defense counsel did here. None of it washes. It is true that cross-examination of the expert would elicit the concession that Waiters probably built up resistance by long-term alcohol abuse. But every piece of evidence is subject to cross-examination and attack. As Judge Gleeson observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">No reasonable defense attorney would opt to keep the jury ignorant of Waiters\u2019s astronomically high BAC on the off chance that it might not be astronomical enough ... Trial counsel\u2019s decision simply was not a tactical choice; it was incompetence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">App\u2019x at 20, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The majority also speculates that defense counsel may have been afraid to ask for an adjournment because that would have given the prosecution time to seek additional evidence of Waiters\u2019s intent. But the majority does not extend that speculation to come up with any particular piece of evidence the prosecution might have sought out. I can\u2019t come up with one either.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The majority opinion further posits that the expert testimony might open the door to statements Waiters made to psychological evaluators, in which he denied that he had been drunk at the time of the shooting (and the state trial judge made a similar point).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the effect of the admissions is easy to discount. Many drunks profess perfect sobriety, and no rational juror would credit an individual\u2019s statement that he was sober over scientific evidence that he had sixteen drinks in the prior hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The majority opinion relies solely on its conclusion that the showing of prejudice was insufficient even to establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome would have been different\u2014i.e., that the jury might have acquitted, or hung, or convicted on a lesser charge, Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052\u2014and that in any event we owe deference to the state trial court\u2019s ruling after the post-trial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Consider how the prosecution would fare in this ease if it had withheld from the defense a document showing that, one hour after the shooting, the defendant had enough alcohol in his blood to kill a normal person. The prejudice would be seen as obvious and the effect palpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">As a matter of law, the result here can be no different. The standard for gauging prejudice in a case of ineffectiveness is derived from Brady, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (1963); and the Supreme Court has told us that the standard for assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>prejudice is the same in Brady claims as in claims for ineffectiveness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tellingly, the majority opinion does not assert that it would reach the same finding on prejudice if the Strickland and Brady standards were the same. Instead (proceeding by footnote), the majority opinion agrees that the Strickland standard derives from the Brady standard and uses the same words, but holds that the two standards are somehow different. In doing so, it cites no relevant law, and splits from published decisions by every other circuit in the country.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Applying the Strickland standard (as derived from Brady), prejudice is clear because the evidence that Waiters had absorbed a potentially lethal intake of sixteen drinks was the vital corrective to Warren\u2019s testimony that she had seen him have only one drink that morning in about half an hour. It is easy to conclude here, as we would in a Brady case, that the evidence the jury never got to see would have \u201calter[ed] the entire evidentiary picture,\u201d such that acquittal was at least reasonably probable. Strickland 466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>This was not lost on the prosecutor. In summation, the prosecution recalled testimony that one victim smashed an aquarium over Waiters\u2019s head, and discounted the hospital note that Waiters was \u201cintoxicated\u201d with the rhetorical question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">How are you able to tell intoxication from the effects of getting hit over the head with a fish aquarium? Who knows?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Supp. App\u2019x at 86-87. <em>\u201cWho knows?\u201d </em>The prosecutor knows. He knew that the excluded BAC information would establish not only that the impairment was due to alcohol, but that Waiters was so intoxicated he could have fallen over dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The majority opinion advances two arguments to discount the possibility of an acquittal even if the BAC record had been allowed into evidence with an expert explanation. First, the majority opinion claims that the jury was \u201cwell aware ... that [Waiters] was intoxicated when he emptied his revolver in the direction of Warren\u2019s family.\u201d Maj. Op. at 481. A review of the record shows that there was actually very little evidence of Waiters\u2019s intoxication before the jury when it went to deliberate. His girlfriend testified that her fight with Waiters began when she told him he had too much to drink, but (as set forth above) she also testified that she did not know whether he had more than one drink that morning, and her son testified that, though Waiters\u2019s words were \u201ca little bit slurred,\u201d he had seen Waiters \u201cway worse\u201d at least ten other times. The only other evidence of intoxication was the two lines in the medical records saying that Waiters was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d But the prosecutor effectively attacked that medical evidence as unreliable and imprecise in his closing statement. See supra at 487-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">None of that evidence would persuade a jury that Waiters was <em>extremely </em>intoxicated, as required for an intoxication defense. None of it has anything like the force of the BAC record, which (with an expert explanation) would prove that the 130-pound defendant must have had sixteen alcoholic drinks that morning before the shooting started.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">The majority opinion also considers that there was scant hope for an intent defense because Waiters did a number of voluntary acts that show self-possession: he bought milk and cereal; he got the gun; he concealed it on his person; he taunted his target with having it. But when he then shot, he barely wounded the target with whom he stood face to face, and he accidentally shot three others, two of them fatally. In other words, the evidence that Waiters was sober enough to act with intent was vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">The evidence of intoxication that the jury saw did not approach the level deemed necessary in the jury charge (as set out in the margin).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A jury that had the most powerful evidence in Waiters\u2019s favor\u2014a jury that knew he had a .39 BAC and that was told what that meant\u2014could easily conclude that he was profoundly un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>der the influence, and had a diminished ability to form the requisite intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The majority opinion is understandably reluctant to hold on the merits that it was not at least \u201creasonably probable\u201d that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prodigious intake might have changed the guilty verdict. Instead, the majority opinion leans on the concept of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">First, it is of course true that ineffectiveness claims generally involve deference. But the deference due under Strickland is deference to the tactical choices made by defense counsel\u2014the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 5.Ct. 2052. That goes to the \u201cineffectiveness\u201d prong of Strickland, not to prejudice. Since the majority opinion punts on ineffectiveness and relies solely on prejudice, Strickland deference thus does no work for it. See Hardy v. Chappell, 849 F.3d 803, 825 n.10 (9th Cir. 2016); Evans v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 703 F.3d 1316, 1334 (11th Cir. 2013) (Jordan, J., concurring) (\u201c[it] makes no sense to say that initial judicial review as to whether prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s deficient performance\u2014on its own, before adding AEDPA deference\u2014involves any deference\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Nor can the majority rely on deference to the state trial judge under AEDPA. The views of the trial judge are best manifested by her several efforts to focus defense counsel on the need to get an expert to give the testimony that would make admissible medical records containing the crucial .39 BAC. The judge went as far as she could go without committing advocacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">THE COURT: I would agree with [the prosecutor] that the best way would have been to get someone from the hospital to certainly interpret the records as to those limited issues. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t know why, you know, someone wasn\u2019t called or at the very least to get an assessment by the doctor who appeared, even if it was by the people, something that would assist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">THE PROSECUTOR: Well, I\u2019m not in a position of assisting [the defendant] your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-19\">THE COURT: I understand that. Nor should you be. But I\u2019m saying that [expert testimony] is possibly one way that it could have been rectified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-20\">\u2022THE PROSECUTOR: My position is it\u2019s the only way, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-21\">What is [defense counsel] going to get up there and say? That this level means something? That this person\u2019s observation is any better than any other person\u2019s observation? That one person\u2019s in-tox, what does it mean in a medical standpoint? Does it mean that he can\u2019t form intent? I mean, this is all going to be speculation. What\u2019s he going to do, testify? Then it becomes impossible for me to rebut. Nor should I have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Again, you say it might be the better course. We\u2019re still not under a time crunch here, Judge. It can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">[]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">THE COURT: So, if you\u2019re seeking to have blood levels, the amount of ethanol alcohol in Mr. Waiters\u2019s blood stream, then clearly there should be someone to explain it for the edification of the jury as to what, in fact, that would mean. Otherwise, there\u2019s no point to seek to introduce those levels of ethanol alcohol in his blood stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, the defense at this point is not introducing any additional witnesses at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">We would request that the Court permit all the information in, and we\u2019re prepared for the Court to make its ruling based on the defense not presenting any additional witnesses at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">THE COURT: May I see counsel at sidebar. (Off-the-record discussion held at the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">It\u2019s the Court\u2019s understanding- that the defense is not going to be calling any medical witness in order to certainly enlighten the jury as to what the numbers mean contained in the medical records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Supp. App\u2019x 68-69, 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The majority opinion relies on the post-hearing conclusion of the state trial judge. She expressed her conclusion in a single clause, which does not help the majority at all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">[Tjhere is a little doubt the claims raised by the defendant would have served to change the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">App\u2019x at 56. That sentence is best read to reflect that the trial judge declined to rule on prejudice; after all, given her holding that defense counsel was effective, she did not need to decide prejudice. The majority opinion, however, urges that this sentence is afflicted by a pair of typographical errors: if the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d is removed and the little word \u201cnot\u201d is inserted at a likely spot, the finding would coincide with the view of the majority opinion. (The majority opinion justifies its rewrite on the ground that the state habeas opinion\u2014to which it urges deference\u2014is full of typos.) I think it is possible that the state trial judge did intend to say the opposite of what she wrote. The context is ambiguous. But surely it is odd to rewrite a sentence that is grammatically sound in order to make it say something else for the purpose of giving it deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Finally, AEDPA deference does not mean that we use the rubber stamp. When a state court decision is unreasonable, we may grant habeas relief. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 380, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005). So even if the state court had held that there was no sufficient prejudice in this case, that decision would have been -unreasonable for reasons I need not repeat.</p>\n<p id=\"pAUK\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">Defense counsel pursued an intoxication defense, but failed to introduce and explain evidence that his 130-pound client had sixteen alcoholic drinks before committing the crime. He never provided a reason for his omission, and none is conceivable. It is at least reasonably probable that a jury, hearing such potent evidence, would develop reasonable doubt as to the element of intent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. After the post-trial hearing, the state trial court noted that introducing the .39 BAC into evidence would be inconsistent with Waiters's own protestations that he was sober the morning of the shooting. It may be that a defense lawyer is not obligated to argue an intoxication defense when his client denies being drunk; but once defense counsel chooses to argue a defense (and intoxication was the only defense he argued on summation), he has an obligation to do so effectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\">.
