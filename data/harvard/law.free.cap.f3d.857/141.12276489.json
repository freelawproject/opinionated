WALKER, JR., Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">We consider in this case whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>completely preempts an \u201cout-of-network\u201d health care provider\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim against a health insurer where the provider (1) did not receive a valid assignment for payment under the health care plan and (2) received an independent promise from the insurer that he would be paid for certain medical services provided to the insured. We hold that ERISA does not completely preempt such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-19\">Plaintiff-appellant McCulloch Ortho-paedic Surgical Services, PLLC, a/k/a Dr. Kenneth E. McCulloch (\u201cMcCulloch\u201d) filed this action against defendant-appellee Aet-na Inc. and several of its wholly-owned subsidiaries<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in New York State Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Court. McCulloch, an orthopedic surgeon, seeks reimbursement from Aetna for performing two knee surgeries on a patient who is a member of an Aetna-administered health care plan that is governed by ERISA. McCulloch is an \u201cout-of-network\u201d provider under this plan\u2014he does not have a contract with Aetna and is not identified by Aetna as a participating physician who has agreed to abide by a set fee schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Before performing the patient\u2019s surgeries, McCulloch\u2019s office staff called a number listed on the patient\u2019s Aetna insurance card to obtain information about the patient\u2019s coverage. An Aetna representative informed McCulloch\u2019s staff that the patient was covered by a health care plan administered by Aetna, that the plan provided for payment to out-of-network physicians, and that the plan covered the surgical procedures that McCulloch would be providing for the patient. The Aetna representative stated that McCulloch would be reimbursed at seventy percent of the usual, customary, and reasonable (\u201cUCR\u201d) rate for the knee surgeries and that this rate would be based on an industry-standard schedule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Relying on Aetna\u2019s promise of reimbursement, McCulloch performed the two surgeries and billed Aetna at the UCR rate for a total of $66,048. McCulloch then submitted a health insurance claim form to Aetna for each surgery (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Form 1500). The claim form has two sections that concern the assignment of payment for medical benefits. First, in Box 13, the insured must authorize the \u201cpayment of medical benefits to the undersigned physician ... for services described below.\u201d The parties do not dispute that the patient signed both of the completed forms submitted by McCulloch. Second, in Box 27, the form asks if the provider will \u201cAccept Assignment?\u201d. The parties also do not dispute that McCulloch checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to this question on the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">The patient\u2019s health care plan, however, has an anti-assignment provision, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">Coverage may be assigned only with the written consent of Aetna. To the extent allowed by law, Aetna will not accept an assignment to an out-of-network provider, including but not limited to, an assignment of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">\u2022 The benefits due under this contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">\u2022 The right to receive payments due under this contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-16\">\u2022 Any claim you make for damages resulting from a breach or alleged breach, of the terms of this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Despite this provision, Aetna reimbursed McCulloch $842.51 for the first surgery and $14,425 for the second surgery, for a total of $15,267.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">On February 17, 2015, McCulloch sued Aetna in New York State court on a single cause of action: promissory estoppel. McCulloch alleged that Aetna had made a clear and unambiguous promise to reimburse him for seventy percent of the UCR rate for both knee surgeries ($46,233.60), that he had reasonably and foreseeably relied on that promise, and that he had been injured as a result. McCulloch sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>$30,966.09\u2014the difference between seventy percent of the UCR rate ($46,233.60) and what Aetna had paid him ($15,-267.51)\u2014plus interest from August 4, 2011, costs, and other appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On March 17, 2015, Aetna timely removed this action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Aetna invoked federal-question jurisdiction, asserting that McCulloch\u2019s complaint raised a claim for benefits under an employee welfare-benefit plan governed by ERISA. McCulloch then filed a motion to remand the action to state court. On May 11, 2015, the district court (Katherine B. Forrest, <em>J.) </em>issued an opinion and order denying McCulloch\u2019s motion to remand and directing McCulloch to amend his complaint \u201cto assert ERISA eause[s] of action not later than ... May 25, 2015.\u201d App\u2019x at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">On May 21, 2015, McCulloch moved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order. He requested that the district court either remand this case to state court or enter a final judgment dismissing the action for failure to state a claim under ERISA. McCulloch did not file an amended complaint. On June 8, 2015, the district court denied McCulloch\u2019s motion for reconsideration and, \u201c[i]n light of plaintiffs refusal to amend,\u201d dismissed this action. McCulloch timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Montefiore Med. Ctr. v. Teamsters Local 272, </em>642 F.3d 321, 327 (2d Cir. 2011). An action filed in state court may be properly removed by a defendant to federal court in \u201cany civil action ... of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The defendant, as the party seeking removal and asserting federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of demonstrating that the district court has original jurisdiction. <em>See Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 327. Under the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint rule,\u201d a defendant generally may not \u201cremove a case to federal court unless the <em>plaintiffs </em>complaint establishes that the case arises under federal law.\u201d <em>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, </em>542 U.S. 200, 207, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There is, however, an exception to this rule. <em>Id. </em>A defendant may properly remove a state-law claim when a federal statute \u201cwholly displaces the state-law cause of action,\u201d such that the claim, \u201ceven if pleaded in terms of state law, is in reality based on federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 124 S.Ct. 2488 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">ERISA provides for the wholesale displacement of certain state-law claims. Pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), a participant or beneficiary may bring an action \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), <em>codified at </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). This civil enforcement scheme \u201ccompletely preempts any state-law cause of action that \u2018duplicates, supplements, or supplants\u2019 an ERISA remedy.\u201d <em>Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 327 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">In <em>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, </em>the Supreme Court established a two-pronged test to determine whether a state-law claim is completely preempted by ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) (the <em>\u201cDavila\u201d </em>test). 542 U.S. at 209-10, 124 S.Ct. 2488; <em>see Wurtz v. Rawlings Co., </em>761 F.3d 232, 242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>(2d Cir. 2014). The <em>Davila </em>test is conjunctive\u2014a state-law claim is completely preempted by ERISA only if both prongs of the test are satisfied. <em>Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 328. Under the first prong, the claim must be brought by \u201can individual [who], at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\u201d <em>Davila, </em>542 at 210, 124 S.Ct. 2488. In making this determination, we consider: (1) whether the plaintiff is the <em>type </em>of party that can bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and also (2) whether the <em>actual claim </em>that the plaintiff asserts can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). <em>Mon-tefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 328. Under the second prong of the <em>Davila </em>test, the claim must involve \u201cno other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Davila, </em>542 U.S. at 210, 124 S.Ct. 2488.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The district court held that McCulloch\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim was completely preempted by ERISA under the <em>Davila </em>test. The district court found that the first prong of this test was satisfied because McCulloch was assigned the right to receive payment under the plan and because McCulloch\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim could be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). The district court further found that the second prong of the <em>Davila </em>test was satisfied because the Aetna representative\u2019s oral statements did not give rise to an \u201cindependent legal duty\u201d and, instead, that any duty to reimburse McCulloch \u201car[ose] out of the terms and conditions of [the patient\u2019s] plan.\u201d App\u2019x at 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">On appeal, McCulloch argues <em>inter alia </em>that his state-law claim is not preempted by ERISA because: (1) he did not receive a valid assignment and thus is not the \u201ctype of party\u201d that can bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and (2) Aetna\u2019s oral statements gave rise to a duty that was distinct and independent from its obligations under the patient\u2019s health care plan. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">I. <em>Davila, </em>Prong 1, Step 1</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We first must determine whether McCulloch is \u201cthe type of party that can bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\u201d <em>See Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 328. Aetna argues that, despite the health care plan\u2019s anti-assignment provision, it has established a \u201ccolorable claim\u201d that McCulloch was assigned the patient\u2019s right to payment for medical benefits and that, thus, McCulloch is the type of party that can bring a claim under ERISA. We find this argument unpersuasive. McCulloch\u2014an \u201cout-of-network\u201d health care provider who plainly did not have a valid assignment for payment\u2014is not the type of party who can bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Under \u00a7 502(a), a civil action may be brought \u201cby a participant or beneficiary\u201d of an ERISA plan to recover benefits due to him under the terms of that plan. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). ERISA defines a beneficiary as \u201ca person designated by a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan, who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1002(2)(B)(8). Although \u00a7 502(a) is narrowly construed to permit only the enumerated parties to sue directly for relief, we have \u201c \u2018carv[ed] out a narrow exception to the ERISA standing requirements\u2019 to grant standing \u2018to healthcare providers to whom a beneficiary has assigned his claim in exchange for health care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 329 (quoting <em>Simon v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>263 F.3d 176, 178 (2d Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">In <em>Montefiore Medical Center v. Teamsters Local 272, </em>an \u201cin-network\u201d hospital brought state-law claims against a union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>employee benefit plan that was governed by ERISA. 642 F.3d at 324-25. The hospital sought reimbursement for medical services that it had provided to beneficiaries of the plan. <em>Id. </em>at 325-26. We found that the hospital\u2019s state-law claims were completely preempted by ERISA because, among other things, the hospital had received a valid assignment of the beneficiaries\u2019 right to payment and it was, therefore, the type of party that could bring its claim regarding benefits pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). <em>Id. </em>at 328, 333. In making this determination, we noted that the hospital\u2019s reimbursement forms contained a \u201cY\u201d for \u201cyes\u201d in the space certifying that the beneficiary patients had assigned their claims to the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Here, McCulloch submitted claim forms to Aetna indicating that the patient had authorized payment of medical benefits to McCulloch and that McCulloch had accepted this assignment from the patient. As we held in <em>Montefiore, </em>this normally would constitute an assignment to the provider of the patient\u2019s right to payment. <em>See Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 329. Unlike in <em>Montefiore, </em>however, the health care plan in this case has an anti-assignment provision. This provision states that although \u201c[c]overage may be assigned ... with the written consent of Aetna[,] ... Aetna will not accept an assignment to an out-of-network provider.\u201d App\u2019x at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Based on the plain language of this provision, McCulloch\u2019s acceptance of an assignment was ineffective\u2014a legal nullity. <em>See Allhusen v. Caristo Constr. Corp., </em>303 N.Y. 446, 452, 103 N.E.2d 891 (1952) (holding that a \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cdefinite\u201d no-assignment provision \u201cmay be construed in no other way but that any attempted assignment of either the contract or any rights created thereunder shall be \u2018void\u2019 as against the obligor\u201d); <em>see also Physicians Multispecialty Grp. v. Health Care Plan of Horton Homes, Inc., </em>371 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[W]e are persuaded by the reasoning of the majority of federal courts that have concluded that an assignment is ineffectual if the [ERISA benefit] plan contains an unambiguous anti-assignment provision.\u201d) (collecting eases).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Aetna does not dispute that this provision renders invalid McCulloch\u2019s attempt to enforce the purported assignment. Instead, Aetna argues\u2014and the district court found\u2014that in determining whether preemption applies, we should ignore that the health care plan prohibits any assignment to McCulloch. The. district court noted that \u201c[w]hether the assignment is valid <em>under the terms of the ERISA plan at issue </em>is a question to be decided once an ERISA claim is before the Court\u201d and that the attempted assignment between the patient and McCulloch was \u201call that [was] required to render [McCulloch] \u2018the type of party that can bring a claim pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B)\u2019 for purposes of complete preemption.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App\u2019x at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The first prong of the <em>Davila </em>test, however, requires that we must assess wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>er a party has standing to pursue an ERISA claim. <em>See Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 328 n. 7. We have noted that, \u201c[a]bsent a <em>valid </em>assignment of a claim, ... non-enumerated parties lack statutory standing to bring suit under [ERISA] even if they have a direct stake in the outcome of the litigation.\u201d <em>Conn. v. Physicians Health Srvs. of Conn., Inc., </em>287 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2002) (emphasis added); <em>see also Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n v. Anthem Health Plans, Inc., </em>821 F.3d 352, 361 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201c[W]e have allowed physicians to bring claims under \u00a7 502(a) based on a <em>valid </em>assignment from a patient.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">If we were to ignore that the health care plan prohibits an assignment to McCulloch in determining whether his claim is preempted, this would lead to a result that is both unjust and anomalous: McCulloch would be barred from pursuing state-law claims in state court on preemption grounds and from pursuing an ERISA claim in federal court for lack of standing. McCulloch\u2014and other third-party providers in similar situations\u2014would be left without a remedy to enforce promises of payment made by an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Such a rule would not further the principal purpose of ERISA to protect plan beneficiaries and participants. As the United States Department of Labor noted in its <em>amicus </em>brief,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this risk of non-payment might lead medical providers to decide not to treat, or to otherwise screen, patients who are participants in certain plans. <em>See Lordmann Enterprises, Inc. v. Equicor, Inc., </em>32 F.3d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[HJealth care providers [must] be able to rely on insurers\u2019 representations as to coverage. If ERISA preempts their potential causes of action for misrepresentation, health care providers ... must either deny care or raise fees to protect themselves against the risk of noncoverage.\u201d); <em>Hospice of Metro Denver, Inc. v. Grp. Health Ins. of Okla., Inc., </em>944 F.2d 752, 756 (10th Cir. 1991) (\u201cDenying a third-party provider a state law action based upon misrepresentation by the plan\u2019s insurer in no way furthers the purposes of ERISA.\u201d); <em>Mem\u2019l Hosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d 236, 247-48 (5th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[Discouraging health care providers from becoming assignees would undermine Congress\u2019 goal of enhancing employees\u2019 health and welfare benefit coverage.... This does not serve, but rather directly defeats, the purpose of Congress in enacting ERISA.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, as the Fifth Circuit has concluded, \u201c[i]f providers have no recourse under either ERISA or state law[,] ... providers will be understandably reluctant to accept the risk of non-payment, and may require up-front payment by beneficiaries\u2014or impose other inconveniences\u2014before treatment will be offered.\u201d <em>Mem\u2019l Hosp. Sys., </em>904 F.2d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In sum, while the patient attempted to assign McCulloch the right to payment for the surgeries that McCulloch performed, this assignment was prohibited under the terms of the patient\u2019s health care plan. Aetna\u2014which has not argued on appeal that the anti-assignment provision does not apply\u2014has failed to establish that McCul-loch is the \u201ctype of party\u201d who may bring claims pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>II. <em>Davila, </em>Prong 1, Step 2</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">Although Aetna\u2019s failure to meet any part of the <em>Davila </em>test requires that we reverse the district court\u2019s ruling, we briefly address why Aetna has failed to satisfy the remaining requirements as well. Under the <em>Davila </em>test, we next must determine \u201cwhether the <em>actual claim </em>that [McCulloch] asserts can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\u201d <em>Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 328. A colorable ERISA claim exists when the claim \u201cimplicates coverage and benefit determinations as set forth by the terms of the ERISA benefit plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325. On appeal, Aetna argues that McCulloch\u2019s claim \u201cgoes to the heart of administration of the Plan and necessarily implicates the patient\u2019s assigned right to payment under the Plan.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 26. We disagree and conclude that the actual claim asserted here cannot be construed as a colorable ERISA claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In <em>Montefiore, </em>we determined that the \u201cin-network\u201d hospital provider\u2019s suit against the ERISA plan, seeking reimbursement for medical services that the hospital had provided to beneficiaries of the plan, were \u201ccolorable claims for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The hospital had entered into agreements with preferred provider organizations that it would offer medical services to the plan\u2019s beneficiaries at certain rates. <em>Id. </em>at 326. The preferred provider organizations, in turn, had contracted with the ERISA plan to set reimbursement rates and terms. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the hospital\u2019s state-law claims of breach of contract and quasi-contract concerned the hospital\u2019s right to be reimbursed as a valid assignee under the ERISA plan and that deciding whether the hospital should be reimbursed would implicate the plan\u2019s coverage and benefits determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The instant case differs from <em>Montefiore </em>for several reasons. First, because McCul-loch is not a valid assignee and has no plan-related relationship with Aetna, the benefits under the health care plan belong to the patient, not to McCulloch. The health care plan simply provides the context for McCulloch\u2019s claim\u2014if no plan had existed, McCulloch\u2019s office would not have called Aetna to inquire about the patient\u2019s coverage and Aetna likely would not have made such representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Second, unlike the contract and quasi-contract claims at issue in <em>Montefiore, </em>McCulloch\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim does not depend on the specific terms of the relevant health care plan or on Aetna\u2019s determination of coverage or benefits pursuant to those terms. The Aetna representative\u2019s statements to McCulloch may have been a mere summary of the patient\u2019s health care plan and the coverage and benefits that would apply to an \u201cout-of-network\u201d provider.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But McCulloch\u2019s claim rests on whether Aetna promised to reimburse him for seventy percent of the UCR rate, whether he reasonably and foresee-ably relied on that promise, and whether he suffered a resulting injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The claim does not implicate the actual coverage terms of the health care plan or require a determination as to whether those terms were properly applied by Aetna. <em>See Stevenson v. Bank of N.Y. Co., </em>609 F.3d 56, 61 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding promissory-es-toppel claim not preempted by ERISA where, <em>inter alia, </em>the claim\u2019s \u201cresolution does not require a court to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>propriety of an administrator\u2019s or employer\u2019s determination of benefits under such a plan\u201d); <em>see also Wurtz, </em>761 F.3d at 242 (finding state-law claim not preempted because \u201cthe terms of plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA plans are irrelevant to their claims\u201d); <em>Franciscan Skemp Healthcare, Inc. v. Cent. States Joint Bd. Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund, </em>538 F.3d 594, 598 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding action arising from insurer\u2019s \u201calleged misrepresentations made ... in response to [provider\u2019s] inquiry\u201d was not an action \u201cto recover benefits due to [a patient] under the terms of his plan, to enforce [a patient\u2019s] rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify [a patient\u2019s] rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan\u201d); <em>DaPonte v.

Aetna argues that its \u201conly duty arises out of the terms and conditions of\u2019 the ERISA plan and that our decision in <em>Montefiore </em>\u201csquarely foreclose^]\u201d that an independent duty may arise from a provider\u2019s conversation with an insurer to confirm a plan\u2019s coverage. Appellees\u2019 Br. at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We conclude that any legal duty Aetna has to reimburse McCulloch is independent and distinct from its obligations under the patient\u2019s plan. McCulloch\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim against Aetna arises not from an alleged violation of some right contained in the plan, but rather from a freestanding state-law duty grounded in conceptions of equity and fairness. <em>See generally </em>57 N.Y. Jur. 2d <em>Estoppel, Ratification, and Waiver </em>\u00a7 51. Aetna is correct that, in <em>Montefiore, </em>we found that an insurer\u2019s statements in response to a provider\u2019s phone inquiry about plan coverage did not create a \u201csufficiently <em>independent </em>duty.\u201d <em>Montefiore, </em>642 F.3d at 332. In making this determination, however, we noted that the \u201cpre-approval process [of calling the insurer] was <em>expressly required by the terms of the Plan itself </em>and is therefore inextricably intertwined with the interpretation of Plan coverage and benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We did not, as Aetna argues and the district court found, establish a <em>per se </em>rule that pre-approval calls with an insurer could not give rise to an independent legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Here, unlike in <em>Montefiore, </em>McCulloch\u2019s phone call with Aetna was not in furtherance of an ERISA plan. McCulloch was not a valid assignee of the plan, he had no preexisting relationship with Aetna, and he was not required by the plan to pre-ap-prove coverage for the surgeries that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>performed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, McCulloch called Aet-na for his own benefit to decide whether he would accept or reject a potential patient who sought his out-of-network services. McCulloch\u2019s conversation with Aet-na, therefore, is not governed by the plan\u2019s terms or \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with an interpretation of the plan\u2019s coverage and benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><em>Franciscan Skemp Healthcare, Inc. v. Central States Joint Board Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund </em>is illustrative. <em>See </em>538 F.3d at 594. In that case, the health care provider called the plan administrator \u201cto verify [its] coverage of [a particular patient] and the relevant services\u201d before providing medical services. <em>Id. </em>at 596. A plan representative \u201cmade oral representations that they were covered,\u201d and the provider treated the patient. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit found that the provider\u2019s state-law claims of negligent misrepresentation and estoppel, based on \u201calleged shortcomings in the communications\u201d between the provider and insurer, did not duplicate, supplement, or supplant the ERISA exclusive remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 598-601. The court made such a determination in part because these claims were not brought by the plaintiff \u201cas a beneficiary, nor [as a party] standing in the shoes of a beneficiary\u201d and the plaintiff was not \u201carguing about plan terms\u201d or \u201cseeking to recover plan benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601; <em>see also Marin Gen. Hosp. v. Modesto &amp; Empire Traction Co., </em>581 F.3d 941, 950 (9th Cir. 2009) (finding provider\u2019s state-law claims based on oral contract not completely preempted where claims \u201care in no way based on an obligation under an ERISA plan, and ... would exist whether or not an ERISA plan existed\u201d); <em>cf. Lone Star OB/GYN Assocs. v. Aetna Health Inc., </em>579 F.3d 525, 532 (5th Cir. 2009) (finding independent obligation existed under a contract between provider and insurer and noting provider\u2019s state-law claim\u2019s \u201cmere reference to or consultation of an ERISA plan\u201d does not mean such claims \u201cduplicate, supplement, or supplant ERISA\u201d); <em>cf Geller v. County Line Auto Sales, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 18, 23 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding, in context of \u00a7 514, state-law fraud claim not preempted by ERISA where \u201cthe essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 ... claim does not rely on the ... plan\u2019s operation or management\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">For similar reasons, McCulloch\u2019s promissory-estoppel claim is not completely preempted by ERISA. McCulloch does not seek to enforce the patient\u2019s right to reimbursement. He is suing in his own right pursuant to an independent obligation. In other words, this is simply a suit between a third-party provider and an insurer based on the insurer\u2019s independent promise. <em>See Stevenson, </em>609 F.3d at 60 (finding promissory-estoppel claim not preempted by ERISA where defendant\u2019s promise to insured gave rise to legal liability, not defendant\u2019s obligations under ERISA plan).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>In sum, we conclude that because any legal duty Aetna has to reimburse McCul-loch is independent and distinct from its obligations under the patient\u2019s plan, Aetna has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Davila </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Because we find that ERISA does not preempt McCulloch\u2019s state-law promissory-estoppel claim, we VACATE the district court\u2019s orders denying McCulloch\u2019s motion to remand and dismissing McCulloch\u2019s complaint. We REMAND this action to the district court with instructions to remand the case to New York state court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\">. In addition to Aetna Inc., the following subsidiaries were named as defendants in this action: Aetna Health Inc., Aetna Health and Life Insurance Company, Aetna Life Insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>anee Company, and Aetna Health Insurance Company of New York. We refer to all of the defendants collectively as \"Aetna.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">. McCulloch alleges that he charges UCR rates in accordance with those established by Ingenix, now known as the Optumln-sight/FAIRPLAN program. Aetna does not dispute that this is an industry-standard schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. The district court also stated that, \u201cAetna in fact sent two payments ... for [the] surgery directly to [McCulloch] despite the anti-assignment provision\u201d which \"is sufficient for purposes of the complete preemption analysis.\u201d App\u2019x at 241. There are several district court cases in this circuit that have held that where an ERISA plan either permits assignment with the consent of an insurer or the plan is ambiguous as to whether assignment is permitted, direct payment is sufficient to demonstrate a patient\u2019s assignment for preemption purposes. <em>See, e.g., Neuroaxis Neuro-surgical Assocs., PC v. Cigna Healthcare of N.Y., Inc., </em>No. 11 CIV. 8517 (BSJ) (AJP), 2012 WL 4840807, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2012). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these cases reach the correct holding, we find that they are not analogous to the instant case, which involves a benefit plan that clearly prohibits assignments to out-of-network providers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">. This <em>amicus </em>brief was filed in support of McCulloch in a companion case with identical <em>issues\u2014McCulloch Orthopedic Surgical Services, PLLC v. United Healthcare Insurance Co. of New York, </em>No. 15-2144-cv. Although the parties ultimately withdrew this case, we may take judicial notice of the brief. <em>See In re Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Securities Litig., </em>391 F.3d 401, 410 n.8 (2d Cir. 2004) (taking judicial notice of Securities and Exchange Commission <em>amicus </em>brief in another appeal addressing similar issues).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\">. The health care plan, for example, covers seventy percent of an out-of-network provider\u2019s surgical procedures after a calendar year deductible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\">. We note that Aetna made two payments to McCulloch and it does not contest that it had a legal duty to make these payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">. Although the plan states that the insured is \"responsible for obtaining the necessary pre-certification from Aetna prior to receiving services from an out-of-network provider,\u201d it does not require an out-of-network provider to make a pre-approval call. App\u2019x at 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Aetna relies on <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Transportation Communications International Union, </em>173 F.3d 94, 102 (2d Cir. 1999) in support of its contention that \"state law promissory estop-pel claims are not immune from ERISA preemption.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 32-33. This case is inapposite. There, we affirmed the district court's determination that a promissoiy-es-toppel claim could not be pursued by the beneficiaries and participants of a health care plan\u2014not a third-party health care provider\u2014 under ERISA \u00a7 514. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 101. We did not address whether such an action would be completely preempted under ERISA \u00a7 502, and we affirmed the district court\u2019s determination in part because we found that plaintiffs had not presented \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d to pursue both an ERISA claim and a claim for promissory estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
