J., Yellott, Stone, Miller, Robinson, Irving, and Bryan, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYA\"><em>Benjamin Kurtz, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-12\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, the daughter was over twenty-one years of age at the time of the alleged seduction, and was also under a contract of employment with another from whom she received wages ; and though living under the same roof with her father, she was there in the capacity of a <em>boarder, </em>and not in any manner subject to her father\u2019s control or command. \u201cWhen not employed at the mill she was her own mistress, and was at liberty to come and go as she pleased.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-13\">The alleged services were rendered to the <em>mother ; </em>and though it may he contended they enured to the benefit of the father, they were entirely voluntary and gratuitous on the part of the daughter, and the natural and usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>outcome of her filial relation. There was no <em>legal right </em>in the father, based upon support furnished the daughter, or any other consideration, which entitled him to command her services. ' On the contrary the daughter seemed to be supporting the father. She was not, therefore, his servant, <em>de facto, </em>and he cannot maintain this action. <em>Mercer vs. Walmsley, </em>5 <em>Harr. &amp; J., </em>27; <em>Keller vs. Donnelly, 5 Md., </em>216, 218; <em>Greenwood vs. Greenwood, </em>28 <em>Md., </em>381; 2 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., Secs. </em>572, 573; 2 <em>Selw.

And the mere fact that the seduced was the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, a\u2019nd was <em>living with him, </em>rendering voluntary service, does not signify. She must be living with him <em>as his servant, </em>though the service rendered may be inconsiderable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">Drop from the record in this appeal that Rachel A. Lamb was the plaintiff's daughter; and consider her only as a factory girl <em>boarding </em>in the house in which the plaintiff lived, and rendering his wife the voluntary services referred to, and who would then contend that this action could he maintained? <em>Mercer vs. Walmsley, 5 Harr. &amp; J., </em>33, 34; <em>Postlethwaite vs. Parks, </em>3 <em>Burr., </em>1878; <em>Satterwaite vs. Dewhurst, </em>4 <em>Doug., </em>315; <em>McDaniel vs. Edwards, </em>7 <em>Iredell, </em>412; <em>Sutton vs. Huffman, </em>2 <em>Vroom, (N.

It allowed the jury to take into consideration the probable expense of supporting the illegitimate child, and to award damages therefor to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>plaintiff, which they are not entitled to do. 1 <em>Sedgwick on Damages, </em>146 <em>note (a); </em>2 <em>Sedgwick on Damages, </em>516; <em>Hitchman vs. Whitney, </em>9 <em>Hun, (N. </em>Y.,) 512; <em>Sargent vs. </em>-, 5 <em>Cow., </em>106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">And also to award damages for the breach of promise of marriage, for which the daughter had her separate right of action. This evidence, though admitted without objection, it was the duty of the Court, <em>ex mero motu, </em>to exclude from the consideration of the jury in awarding the plaintiff damages. 2 <em>Addison on Torts, </em>1096, 1097; 2 <em>Sedgwick on Damages, </em>516, <em>side page </em>544; <em>Sauer vs. Schulenberg, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>288; <em>Dodd vs. Norris, </em>3 <em>Camp., </em>519; <em>Elliott vs. Nicklin, </em>5 <em>Price, </em>641; <em>Tullidge vs. Wade, </em>3 <em>Wilson, </em>18; <em>Gillett vs. Mead, </em>7 <em>Johns., </em>193; <em>Foster vs. Scoffield, </em>1 <em>Johns., </em>296; <em>Brownell vs. McEwen, </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>367; <em>Whitney vs. Elmer, </em>60 <em>Barb., </em>250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">The broadest rule of damages yet suggested in actions of this kind, allows the jury to consider evidence outside of the loss of services and expenses for medical treatment, <em>&amp;c., </em>only to compensate the plaintiff for the injury done to his feelings as parent, &amp;c. 3 <em>Sutherland on Damages, </em>739; <em>Phelin vs. Kenderline, </em>20 <em>Pa.

Hobbs, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-9\">Stone, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">This was an action brought hy the plaintiff, Taylor, against the' defendant, Lamb, for the seduction of his daughter Rachel. The declaration is in the usual form, alleging loss of service, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The evidence shows that the daughter was over twenty-one years of age; that she was living and always had lived with her father and mother, but from the age of fourteen had been working during the day in the cotton mills at Woodberry, returning to the house of her father at night; that she received her own wages, and out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>them clothed herself and paid her board to her mother, and sometimes assisted her mother in paying her rent;v that the family consisted of the plaintiff and his wife and two daughters; that his daughter gave birth to a child at home, and was kept there about two months, and the doctor who attended her in her confinement, had charged' the hill to the plaintiff, which he had not paid. It was further proved by the daughter that she was seduced at home and that when not working in the mill her father had no control over her, and that whatever service she rendered was entirely voluntary. The evidence relating to the service is as follows: The plaintiff says:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u201c That the said Rachel after returning from the mill in the evening, would assist her mother in the work about the house, and when her mother was taken sick she made up her bed for her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The daughter herself says; \u201c In the morning bfefore going to wo'rk at the mill, and in the evening after returning, she would assist her mother in her work about the house, and when her mother was taken sick she made up her bed for her.\u201d This is the evidence as to the services of the daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">It is well said by a learned author, <em>(Sutherland on Damages,) </em>that slight evidence is sufficient to establish the relation of master and servant, and that the allegation and proof on that point is <em>almost </em>an unmeaning formula \u2014 an obeisance to a shadow o.f the past \u2014 to reach the actual grievance. So in the case of <em>Mercer vs. Walmsley, </em>5 <em>Harr. &amp; J., </em>27, the Court said, \u201cany slight service will he sufficient to raise the inference of fact that she was his servant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">So in <em>Keller vs. Donelly, </em>5 <em>Md., </em>218, the Court said, \u201c the slightest evidence will suffice to prove the relation of master and servant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u25a0The evidence of the service rendered so as to establish the merely technical relation of master and servant, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>certainly in this case sufficient. According to her testimony she daily did some of the ordinary woman\u2019s work about the house. There are many cases to be found where the action has been sustained where the evidence of the service was much less than we find in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Nor does it matter that the daughter was over twenty-one years of age. If the daughter is living with her father rendering service, that connection is sufficient although she is over twenty-one years. <em>Mercer vs. </em>Walmsley, 5 <em>Harr. &amp; J., </em>27.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">It has been settled by this case, and many others both in England and this country, that a father may maintain an action for the seduction of an adult daughter provided she is living with him, and rendering him any service, however slight. This law we do not understand to he questioned; but it is insisted that these services must not he voluntary, and that the fact that the daughter was in service elsewhere, will defeat the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">But the services of an <em>adult </em>daughter to the father must he voluntary, as he has no legal right to require them after her majority. It is immaterial whether the services so rendered by the child are paid for or not, or, whether any special contract existed. <em>Lipe vs. Eisenlerd, </em>33 <em>N. Y., </em>229; <em>Badyley vs. Decker, </em>44 <em>Barbour, </em>577.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The other question argued by the appellant, that because the daughter in this case was engaged in the cotton mills, and paid her board at home, the plaintiff could not recover, is not tenable upon authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">It was said in <em>Mercer vs. Walmsley </em>above q\u00faoted, that where the daughter is over twenty-one years and' <em>living </em>with her father, any slight act of service is sufficient to establish the relation of master and servant. In the common acceptation of the term, the place where the daughter hoards and lodges, is the place where she is said to live. She may work out by the day, but where she eats and sleeps is her home, and there she lives; more espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cially where that place is her father\u2019s house which has always furnished her with shelter. But ample authority is not wanting on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The case of <em>Rist vs. Faup, </em>4 <em>Best &amp; S., </em>was this: The daughter lived in her father\u2019s family, and was always at home from six o\u2019clock in the evening until seven o\u2019clock in the morning, and while there assisted in the house-work. That from seven o\u2019clock in the morning to six in the evening she was in the service of the defendant as a laborer on his farm.. Held by the Court <em>unanimously </em>that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury. .</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The case of <em>Badgley vs. Decker, </em>44 <em>Barbour, 577, </em>was this: The mother kept a hoarding house, and the daughter who was over twenty-one years of age kept a milliner\u2019s shop in her own name, hut lived with her mother and helped her to do the work about the house; and it was held that the mother could recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">So in the case of <em>Villepique vs. Shular, </em>3 <em>Strobhart, </em>462, the daughter, over twenty-one, owned the house and furniture in which she and her mother lived, hut she performed services for the mother. Held,'that the mother was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In this last case the Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u201c That the daughter was owner of the establishment may serve to show her merit and her mother\u2019s destitution, hut did not render the injury more tolerable to the mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">So in the case before us, the fact that the daughter paid her hoard and sometimes aided in paying the rent, shows that she was <em>rendering a service </em>to the family more important and commendable than the mere formal averment of the loss of service required in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">From the cases above cited, we are of opinion that the Court below committed no error in the ruling on the first hill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The second exception contains a prayer of the defendant, which was refused, and a prayer of the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>which was granted. We do not understand the appellant to make any serious contest about his second prayer which the Count properly refused, b\u00fat he insists that the prayer of the plaintiff contained in that exception, should not have been granted. This prayer of the plaintiff so granted, instructed the jury that it was competent for them to find such damage for the plaintiff as they might deem right and proper <em>under all the evidence in the cause, </em>provided they found the facts as stated in the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The reason assigned why this prayer should not have been granted, is, that, the jury might, under it, have taken into consideration, the expense of supporting the child, or damage for the breach of a promise to marry, as something was said in the evidence about the defendant having been required to give bond for the support of the child, and a breach of promise to marry, was proved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">If, in a case of this sort, only legal testimony is before the jury, the instruction is clearly correct. But a prayer cannot properly be made to perform the office of an objection to illegal testimony. If any of the testimony, offered by the plaintiff was not legal testimony in the cause, it was the duty of the defendant'to object to its admissibility, at the time it was offered. When the objection is to the evidence, if it is known or apparent, it must be taken before, and not after, it has gone to the jury. If unaware of the objection to the admissibility of such evidence at the time of its offer, he must raise his objection within a reasonable time thereafter. It is too late after the prayers have been granted by the Court, based upon the evidence, or the argument before the jury has coinmenc'ed. <em>Dent vs. Hancock, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>120; <em>Davis vs. Patton, </em>19 <em>Md., </em>120.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">No such objection having been made in the Court below, this Gourt, even if it were to concede that any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>evidence was inadmissible, (which we by no means do,) could not remedy the error.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b126-9\">(Decided. 16th March, 1887.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u25a0 It was very ingeniously argued by the counsel for the appellant, that although the Court could not now decide the question of admissibility, the Court had fhe right to examine and see if it, or some of it, might not have <em>improperly </em>affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">But this is not so. If the evidence <em>is in the case, </em>it must be considered and allowed its full force. <em>Gibbs vs. Gale, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>76.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Perceiving no error in the ruling of the Court below, on the second exception, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
