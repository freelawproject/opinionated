The rule in regard to marshalling of assets does not apply to a case where a creditor, having originally, .equally with all the other creditors, the right to proceed against the real as well as the personal estate of the debtor, loses by <em>lachts </em>the right of recourse against the realty.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-10\">STATEMENT 0E THE CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-11\">This was a creditor\u2019s suit commenced by a bill in equity against the administrator of the heirs-at-law of Florian E. Hitz, deceased, having for its object to compel the distribution of personal estate among creditors <em>pro rata, </em>and to procure a sale of the real estate in order to supply the deficiency of personal assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-12\">The creditor\u2019s bill was filed by Groot on the 28th day of \u25a0\u2022July, 1882, and on the 26th of October, the same year, Daisy F. C'asparis filed her petition to be made one \u2019 of the complainants in the cause, and the -controversy before the court . related entirely to her claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-13\">The circumstances out of which-..her claim grew, are the ..following: She was a minor, and John Hitz, her uncle, was \u25a0 appointed her guardian, on the 20th of April, 1869, and . gave his bond as guardian, with Florian Hitz, his brother, as surety. On the 28th of September, 1874, the petitioner \u2022\u25a0became 21 years of age.. On the 9th of April, 1880, she instituted a suit on this bond against Florian Hitz, the surety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>He died intestate, and an administrator was appointed who was made party to the suit in the usual way,, and there was finally a judgment for assets against the administrator. This was on April 4th, 1882. In July, as already stated, this original bill was filed, and in October of the same year the petition of Daisy F. Casparis was filed. The defendants, the heirs-at-law of Florian Hitz, by their guardian, filed a plea of limitations to the claim, and there was a general demurrer to this plea by the petitioner. The case was referred to the auditor who made two alternative statements of the administrator\u2019s account, and of the distribution of the personal and real assets, in one of which he included the claim of the petitioner, and from the other he excluded it; and the petitioner excepts to the account which excludes her claim, and the heirs to the other alternative statement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-4\">Enoch Totten for Casparis.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">1. The plea of the Statute of Limitations, interposed by the administrator, ought to be disregarded or stricken out. It does not lie in the mouth of an administrator, who is a public officer, with duties defined and prescribed by law, and the first of them is to pay all the just debts of his intestate, if he have the means. The statute prescribes that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of all executors and administrators to pay all just claims against the deceased, exhibited to them, or a just proportionable part thereof, according to the assets.\u201d Thompson\u2019s Digest, page 38, \u00a7 19.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">This case does not come within the principle of the cases relied upon in behalf of the heirs-at-law. The equity court had, by decree, declared that the assets were insufficient for that purpose, and had decreed-that the realty should be sold to pay the debts. It had jurisdiction for this purpose and for no other. This decree had been passed, and the sale had actually taken place. At the time when the- case was referred to the auditor for the distribution of the proceeds, the sale had been finally ratified by the court, and the funds were in its hands, and constituted equitable assets for the sole purpose of paying <em>the just </em>debts of the intestate.

In this case, the petition of this creditor was filed, after the conversion, in contemplation of' equity, of the realty into equitable assets. The equity court was bound to convert this realty into assets to pay the debts, because every man\u2019s property, real as well as personal, is bound for the payment of his just debts. After the conversion, the only question as to this creditor, was, whether or not her judgment debt was a \u201cjust \u201d one. She did not pray for a sale of realty, because the sale had already been made ; she could only ask for an application of a fund, created by the court for that purpose, to the payment of the debt due her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">\u201cIn equity, money directed to be laid out in land, will, before investment, be considered as land; and land directed to be sold and converted into money, will, before sale, be considered as money, and pass as such.\u201d Leadenham <em>vs. </em>Nicholson, 1 H. <em>&amp; </em>Gr., 267.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">The plea of the Statute of Limitations in this particular case should not be regarded with favor. The action at law was instituted long before the statute had run. The default of the guardian or the breach of the bond was not declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>until the 2d day of April, 1880, when he rendered his final account, showing a balance due to his ward of $5,194.25, and the action was instituted on the bond on the 9th of the same month. If the intestate had not died, there would have been no obstacle in the way of making his realty respond. Can a just debt be cancelled by the death of the debtor who leaves a large estate in realty ? Will a court of equity go out of its way to uphold such a doctrine ? The Court of Appeals of Maryland, in a kindred case, and upon this very subject of the accident of death, uses the following language :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-4\">\u201cIf relief in the mode in which he has now sought it be denied to the appellant, he is wholly without remedy. And what is it that has placed him in this lamentable condition? The simple accident that, before payment of his claim has been ordered, and notice given and demand made, the trustee has departed this life. To place himself in a condition to assert his rights in a legal forum has, by that accident, become impracticable. Can a stronger case than that now before us, for the interposition of a court of equity upon one of its well-established heads of equitable jurisprudence, be well imagined?v Brooks <em>vs. </em>Brooks, 12 G. <em>&amp; </em>J., 320.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">The statute laws in force in this District are ample to prevent the abatement of actions at law, and to carry them on for or against administrators.

Should the court feel bound to sustain the position taken in behalf of the heirs-at-law, then this creditor is entitled to all the assets in the hands of the administrator; or, in other words, she is entitled to have the funds marshalled, and to have the $1,206.44 in the hands of the administrator wholly applied to the payment of her judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">This is upon the well-known principle of equity, that where some of the creditors of an estate may resort, for the satisfaction of their debts, to either of two or more funds, whilst others are confined to one only, a court of equity will marshal the funds and thus enable those who are confined to one fund to receive due satisfaction.

The duties of the administrator are confined to the personal estate, and never beyond it. If that be insufficient to discharge the debts, and it be necessary to resort to the realty of the deceased for that purpose, a proceeding against the heir must be instituted. In that event, whatever has been done by the administrator is without effect as to the property sought to be charged. A judgment against the administrator is not evidence against the heir. The demand must be proved in all respects as if there had been no prior proceedings to effect its collection; and the Statute of Limitations may be pleaded with the same effect as if there had been no prior recovery against the personal representative.

A judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>assets against an administrator has no priority over a simple contract creditor, even in the administration of the personalty.

If the claimant be allowed to absorb the personalty, she would throw the other creditors, whose debts are not barred, on to the realty, and thereby indirectly establish a claim against the heirs expressly barred by the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">The rule that where one of two creditors has a <em>lien </em>and the other has not, the latter can compel the former to <em>resort to his lien, </em>-in order that the general creditor may be paid off out of the other assets of the debtor, is not applicable here.

After making the foregoing statement of the case, he proceeded:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">It should be remarked here that there is an irregularity in the form in which the auditor has made his report. He files alternative statements of account, but does not adopt either as his report. The, proper way is for him to decide which statement is correct and adopt that, and allow it to be excepted to. That is, however, not rei-y material.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The whole question turns on the defence of the Statute of Limitations to this claim of Daisy F. Oasparis. The law upon the subject is found in the act of assembly of Maryland of 1729 and the additional one of 1798, the testamentary act. The first provides, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201c All actions upon administration and testamentary bonds shall be commenced within twelve years after the passing of the said bonds, and not alter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Gi-uardians\u2019 bonds are put on the same footing by the act of 1798. Then there is this provision in the same act of 1729 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to bar any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>within the age of twenty-one years, <em>feme covert, non compos mentis, </em>or imprisoned, or persons heyond seas, from bringing an action or actions within six years after their coming to or being of full age, <em>uncovert, </em>sound memory, at large, or returned from beyond seas, upon any administration or testamentary bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u2022 The bond in this case is dated April 20th, 1869, and the present suit was commenced July 28,1882, which was nearly thirteen years after the date of the bond, or \u201cafter the passing\u201d of the bond, in the words of the act of assembly. On the face of it it would appear to be barred by the Statute of Limitations. There is a question as to the date of the birth of this petitioner, and whether she does not come within the exception of persons <em>under age. </em>It is claimed, on her part, that she was horn in the autumn of 1854, and by the defence it is claimed sir; was born in September, 1858. If the former were true, then the suit was brought within the time, because the six years would not have elapsed after she became of age. But we are satisfied that the weight of testimony shows very clearly that her birth was in 1853, so that she came of age on the 28th of September, 18'T4. She then had not only six years, but seven years after she became of age for the institution of this suit, before the twelve years of the life of this bond had expired. So that this exception does not avail her anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The petition of Daisy F. Casparis proceeds upon the theory that she had recovered a judgment, and that that judgment is her cause of action; that the judgment is good against the real estate, the real assets, as well as against the administrator. But it is perfectly well settled in this jurisdiction, by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland, and by a decision of this court, in Keefe vs. Malone, 3 Mac Arthur, 236, and, above all, by a decison of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Ingle vs. Jones, 9 Wallace, 495, that a judgment recovered against the administrator is not even <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the heir-at-law, but the plaintiff must commence <em>de novo </em>against the heir upon his or her original cause of action, as if no suit had been instituted against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>administrator. Not only that, but the heirs-at-law are at liberty to make any defence that any one else could make to such new suit, and, among others, the defence of the Statute of Limitations. It, therefore, seems to us very plain that the defence of limitations must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Another point made on the part of the petitioner is that these assets ought to be marshalled; that is to say, that inasmuch as she has no recourse against the real assets, and the other complainants have against both personal and real, the latter ought to be excluded from participation in the personal assets, and these should he applied to her claim, and the other creditors thrown on the proceeds of the real estate. The rule undoubtedly is that if one creditor has a lien upon, or has a resort to, two different funds belonging to the debtor, and another one may only resort to one of them, the law, in order to save the latter, will throw the creditor having the larger and more ample remedy on the fund not common to both, in order to save the other debt. But that hardly applies to a case like this. This is a case in which all the creditors have, at law, a similar recourse to all parts of the debtor\u2019s estate, and one of these creditors lost it by her own laches. That is, she had as much right as these other claimants to proceed against the real assets, but failed to bring her suit in time. We never have known a case where the law marshalling assets applied to a case like that, and the contrary is laid down by the Lord Chancellor, in 10 Hare\u2019s Reports, 229, in the following language :</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u201cIt is said next, that under the doctrine of marshalling, the right of the plaintiffs must be considered to subsist for the period of twenty years; and Vickers <em>vs. </em>Oliver and Gibbs <em>vs. </em>Ogier are relied on upon that point. But upon examining the case of Vickers <em>vs. </em>Oliver, it will, I think, he found that the judgment does not at all bear out the marginal note as to the simple contract creditor not being barred by the lapse of less than twenty years; and in Basby <em>vs. </em>Seymour (1 J. <em>&amp; </em>L., 527), that case seems to me to be referred to the true ground on which by the judgment it was rested. And with reference to the case of Gibbs <em>vs. </em>Ougier, it goes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>no further than to decide that the court will marshal the assets, although the right to marshal may not be distinctly raised by the pleadings; it does not at all affect the question which arises in the present case, whether the court will do so at the instance of a plaintiff whose immediate right against the real estate is barred by the Statute of Limitations. I can find no authority which goes to that extent. Simple contract creditors have now a direct right against the real estate in case of a deficiency of the personal. They do not require the aid of this court to marshal the- assets in order to give them a remedy against the real estate; and for whatever purpose the doctrine of marshalling may be necessary to be kept on foot, I do not think that it ought to be kept alive for the purpose of giving indirectly a right which could not be asserted directly. The consequence would be that, in all cases where there are any specialty debts, the simple contract creditors would be entitled to sue the real estate at any time within which the specialty creditors could have sued; in effect, to create in equity the same limitations as\u2018to simple contract debts as the statute has prescribed as to specialties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">It does not seem, therefore, that, the doctrine of marshalling could apply to this case, and we must, therefore, sustain the exceptions of the defendant to the alternative statement made by the auditor in which the claim of this petitioner is allowed, and overrule the exception of the petitioner to the other alternative statement from which it is excluded. The case was certified to be heard here in the first instance, and the order will have to be drawn in that form.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"unanimous\">\n<author id=\"b267-5\">The Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AiB\">We are unanimous in this opinion, although it involves a very great hardship. This estate belonged to a party who died pending a suit against him in a court of law, and the law steps in and says that the suit shall not abate, but survive, and directs that the administrator shall be made a party to it, and the suit proceed to judgment. In the meantime the heirs assert their estate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the real property of the deceased, as they have a right to do, subject to the incumbrances and the indebtedness of the intestate. At the same time the plaintiff proceeds to judgment, and gets it \u2014 a judgment, which if it had preceded the death of the party twenty-four hours would have been a lien -upon all this real property. But inasmuch as the defendant did not live to the end, instead of the right of action surviving, it really only partially survives, that is to say you have the interposition of a statute which says that a judgment against an administrator shall only go into effect against the personal assets of the intestate. It seems to me this is a solecism in legal remedies. First, the law declares that a party\u2019s rights shall not be forfeited by death, but shall survive, and they do survive, but they do not take effect on the substance of the defendant. In the meantime the heirs, who derive, all their estate through and in subordination to the claims of the defendant in judgment, take possession of the substance and leave the cast-off shoes of the estate to the creditor. Now, that is reversing the general proposition that inheritors of property take it <em>ewn onere; </em>under this statute they take it absolved, absolved of debts created by the intestate, debts that are anchored in the substance and created on the faith of the property of the party. Still, I do not know how we can fender any other decision in this case under the light of authority as it exists, than the decision which has just been pronounced. I have been, myself, fighting this incongruity earnestly, in the interest of sensible construction, but I cannot escape the duty of uniting in this opinion under the circumstances, for the express authority is that this judgment under no circumstances takes effect on other than personal assets of the deceased. That is the line of authority beyond question, and especially in this jurisdiction. But in establishing that line of authority, both in legislation and upon the bench, evidently the protraction of the right of survival of the action, with all its energies, in the execution which is to issue on the judgment has been overlooked, or to that extent it does not survive; it is merely protracted to hunt after the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>sonalty of the deceased. It is a fraud, legal, not judicial, for it comes from the law makers; the judiciary have nothing to do with it. It is dogmatically provided by the legislative authority that you shall only have judgment against the personal assets of the decedent as against an administrator, and under the language of the statute I do not know how the courts can decide other than they have done.</p>\n<author id=\"b269-4\">Mr. Justice Mac Arthur:</author>\n<p id=\"AVm\">While I give my assent to the decision which has been announced, I must acknowledge that I sympathize with almost every expression that the Chief Justice has just uttered.. I think this case demonstrates that there should be exceptions made to a general principle of law which, as a general principle, may be very proper in its application, since no general principle can exist without inflicting, in special instances, great inconvenience, and, perhaps, apparent injustice. This, I think, is one of those, cases, and that is the reason why I am in accord with the views expressed by the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">As has been stated,-the action in this case was commenced in the lifetime of the ancestor, and he' died before it was perfected in judgment. Of course, the general principle comes in that a judgment, against the administration is not evidence against the heirs. But we all know, and all concede, that that was a personal action, and that the heirs are .interested in the personalty as much as in the real estate, and why they should be considered as being represented by the administrator in relation to one kind of property.and not in relation to the other kind of property, appears to be a mere figment of the brain. But such is the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">If the action had been commenced against the administrator instead of against the party himself, there might be less objection to the denial of justice. But that was not the case. This young woman commenced her suit before the statute had run against it, and she did all she could to get judgment against the man who, unfortunately for himself as well as for this woman, died.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Another special circumstance in this case which ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>make it an exception to the application of the rule, if that were possible \u2014 and I certainly would make an exception.on that ground if I could \u2014 is the fact that a creditor commenced his suit upon his claim. The court took possession of that suit, pronounced a decree for the sale of this real estate, sold it, took the proceeds into its possession in the form of personal property, and just at this stage of the proceeding, this woman comes in with her petition for the purpose of sharing in the distribution of that personal property. But the law steps in again with its general principle, and says that although it has been converted into personal property, in contemplation of law, it is still real estate and must go 'to the heirs. So that this party who has prosecuted her claim throughout as well as she could, has been, by circumstances, swindled out of her claim. I wish that the Chief-Justice and myself could make an exception to these general principles and take hold of this case by main strength, but I do not see how we can do it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
