The duty of the Commissioner of Patents, on the application, to him to register a label, is a purely ministerial one, as much so as the act of a recorder of deeds in placing upon a public record a muniment of title. The statute has not defined what shall be considered a label, whether it shall be descriptive of the article to which it is affixed, or Whether it may bo a mere arbitrary design. If the applicant presents it as a label, and appeals to the Commissioner to give it the protection which the law provides for It as a label, the duty of the Commissioner is to register it, and in doing so he gives It only the protection which the statute provides. It is not protected as a trade-mark nor as a copyright. The public at large may use and enjoy it, but <em>qua </em>label it is restricted to the use\u2019 of the party who has registered it for that purpose and no other. With the character of the device the Commissioner is not at all concerned. His function is as purely ministerial as it is capable of being.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-10\">STATEMENT ON THE' CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-11\">Petition praying a mandamus against the Commissioner of Patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-12\">The petition set forth that the relators being copartners, and the owners and producers of a certain new label designed to be attached to cigar boxes, delivered to the Commissioner of Patents five copies of said label, together with a statement showing that the same was to he used as a label on cigar boxes.

If not so limited, it is in excess of the power of Congress. If its main purpose be to establish a regulation applicable to all trade, to commerce at all points, especially if it is apparent that it is designed to govern the commerce wholly between citizens of the same State, it is obviously the exercise of a power not confided to Congress.\u201d * * * \u201c Here is no requirement that such person shall be engaged in the kind of commerce which Congress is authorized to regulate.

It is his duty, therefore, to \u25a0determine in every case whether or not the application preferred under that law presents proper subject matter for registration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">In the exercise of this duty it is necessary for him to determine the character of the matter offered for registration, and to ascertain that if is a lawful label within the meaning of the act. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-9\">The fact that a public officer is charged with the ministerial duties of signing, sealing, registering, and the like, carries with it, <em>proprio </em>vigore, the preliminary duty of ascer-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The Commissioner of Patents is required by said act to register a label, but not a design, a mechanical invention, or a trade-mark. It would introduce endless confusion into all questions of title if the allegation of the interested party as to the application of certain provisions of law to the facts of his case, were to be taken as conclusive. The respondent does not understand with the relators that the decision in the case of the United States, <em>ex rel. </em>The Willcox &amp; Gribbs Sewing Machine Company vs, E, M, Marble (1 Mackey, 284), is at variance with the views here expressed. The decision ujion the facts of the case was to the effect that a label which is otherwise a proper subject for registration, under the act in question, is not excluded from registration by the fact that it bears upon its face matter which might become a lawful trade-mark. The court did examine into the reasons which led the Commissioner to refuse the registry, and determining after investigation that the judgment of the Commissioner was erroneous, ordered the <em>mandamus </em>to issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">It is respectfully submitted, therefore, that a fanciful design of the character of the one in question, not descriptive or suggestive of any trade or article of manufacture, and which might be applied as an ornament with equal propriety to a box of cigars, a bolt of cloth, a barrel of flour, or to an indefinite variety of articles of merchandise, or which might be preserved for its intrinsic merits as a work of art, or which might become a lawful trade-mark by its association with a particular brand or manufacture, is not a label within the meaning of the act of June 18, 1874. The statutory provisions relating to the same matter existing at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of the passage of this act, were as follows: Section 493T of the Bevised Statutes provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">\u201cAny person or firm domiciled in the United States and any corporation created by the authority of the United States, or of\u2019any State or Territory thereof, and any person, firm, or corporation resident of or located in any foreign country which, by treaty or convention, affords similar privileges to citizens of the United States, and who are entitled to the exclusive use of any lawful trade-mark, or who intend to adopt and use any trade-mark for exclusive use within the United States, may obtain protection for such lawful trade-mark by complying with the following requirements:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">First. By causing to be recorded in the. Patent Office a statement specifying the names of the parties, and their residences and place of business, who desire the protection of the trade-mark; the class of merchandise, and the particular description of goods comprised in such class, by which the' trade-mark has been or is intended to be appropriated; a description of the trade-mark itself, with fac similes thereof, showing the mode in which it has been or is intended to be applied and used; and the length of time, if any, during which the trade-mark has been in use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">\u25a0 Second. By making payment of a fee of twenty-five dollars in the same manner and for the same purpose as the fee required for patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">Third. By complying with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\">Section 4939 provided that: \u201cThe Commissioner of Patents shall not receive and record any proposed trade-mark which is not and cannot become a lawful trade-mark, or which is merely the name of a person, firm, or corporation unaccompanied by a mark sufficient to distinguish it from the same name when used by other persons.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-9\">Section 4952 provided that: \u201cAny citizen of the United States or resident therein, who shall be the author, inventor, designer, or proprietor of any book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph or negative thereof, or of a painting, drawing, ehromo, statue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>statuary, and of models or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine arts, and the executors, administrators, or assigns of any such person shall, upon complying with the provisions of this chapter, have the sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing,finishing, and vending the same/\u2019 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\">Under these provisions of law the designer, or those deriving legal title from him, might register a new and fanciful cut, print and engraving, as copyright matter, irrespective of the use or purpose for which it was designed; or he might register the same as a trade-mark to be applied to articles of^merchandise by making the proper declarations to that effect, as provided in section 4&amp;3Y.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">There is no reference in either or any of these sections of law to anything in the nature of a label. The designer of cuts, prints, and engravings, in common with authors, artists, &amp;c., are rewarded for their ingenuity by a limited monopoly in the use of their productions. The proprietors of existing or prospective trade-marks are permitted to make registry of their marks, which are guaranteed a certain measure of protection forever, or so long as the registry shall be renewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">The Librarian of Congress having brought it to the attention o\u00ed Congress that great numbers of prints and cuts designed for the purpose of ornamenting and distinguishing, and thereby facilitating the sale of articles of merchandise, and valuable only in that connection, were being offered for registry under the copyright act, the law was amended by the act of June 18, 18-Y4. The third section of that act provides :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">\u201c That in the construction of this- act, the words \u2018 engraving,\u2019 \u2018cut/ and \u2018print/ shall be applied only to pictorial illustrations, or works connected with the fine arts, and no prints or labels designed to be used for any other articles of manufacture shall be entered under the copyright law, but may b\u00e9 registered in the Patent Office. And the Commissioner of Patents is hereby charged with the supervision and control of the entry or registry of such prints- or labels, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>conformity with the regulations provided by law as to copyright of prints, except that there shall be paid for recording the title of any print or label, not a trade-mark, six dollars, which shall cover the expense of furnishing a copy of the record under the seal of the Commissioner of Patents, to the party entering the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">In the first clause of this section it is declared that no print, cut, or engraving, shall thereafter be registered as copyright matter which is not applied to pictorial illustrations or works connected with the fine arts. By this provision the law withdraws all protection from those spurious works of art now commonly attached to boxes and bundles \u25a0of all descriptions, and which are not esteemed for their intrinsic value, hut as lending a temporary and cheap adornment to perishable articles of merchandise. They may be more properly regarded as a commercial device than as a \u201cwriting\u201d by an \u201cauthor\u201d tending to promote the advancement of science.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\">The succeeding clauses of the section in question, provide for the registry of prints and labels designed to be used for other articles of manufacture not connected with the fine arts; and charge the Commissioner of Patents with the supervision and control of the entry and registry of such labels. It is expressly declared that such prints or labels are \u201c not to be entered under the copyright law,\u201d such registration not being regarded apparently as being within the sanction of the copyright'and patent clause of the Constitution. What constitutional provision there is, or whether there is any, which authorizes legislation of this character, it is not now necessary to discuss. The act itself furnishes no definition of what constitutes a print or label. The word \u201c label,\u201d as commonly understood, denotes a slip of paper or other suitable material attached to goods, giving a short description of their character, directions for their use, and other facts of interest to the purchaser. As defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary, \u201c a label is a narrow slip) of silk, paper, parchment, &amp;c., affixed to anything denoting its contents \u25a0 ownership, and the like, as a label of a bottle or package.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In the practice of the Patent Office a label has been regarded as consisting either of a written description or of a pictorial representation of the article itself, its mode of \u25a0ma:rufacture, or manner of use. As thus understood the section in question provides that a cut, engraving, or print may be registered as a work of art under the copyright law, and that a print of a descriptive character to be affixed to an article of commerce in the nature of a label may be registered in the Patent Office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\">In further providing that only those prints and labels, \u201c not a trade-mark,\u201d shall be registered, the act furnishes another indication that it is descriptive prints and labels alone which are the proper subject-matter for registry. A merely fanciful sketch or print when affixed to articles of commerce is, or may become by use, the lawful trade-mark of the owner. Such marks by excess of caution are discriminated in the act itself from the descriptive prints which form labels proper. As no examination is to be had under the provisions of the act as to any facts outside of the record, viz.: whether the purported label has or has not been used and, as the allegation of the applicant that his proposd label has not been used or published, is conclusive for the purposes of registry, it is evident that the Commissioner must determine from inspection only whether the alleged label seems to be, or is adapted by its nature to become by use, a trade-mark. It would be unlawful, therefore, for him to register as a label a mark which by use in commerce would become a trade-mark, or from its nature would inevitably lead the public, whether truthfully or by deceit, to assume that it is a veritable mark of trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">It is apparent upon inspection, that the alleged label offered for registration in this case is purely fanciful and arbitrary in its proposed application. Whether or not it might in the hands of the designer be registered as a work of art under the copyright law, or as a trade-mark in the hands of the manufacturer who applies it, or intends to ap.ply it to goods of his manufacture, it is not a label, as that word is commonly understood, nor as used in the 3d section of the act of June 18, 1814.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Wi. H. Brereton for relator:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\">The defendant bases Ms refusal to register tliis label on the ground that the same is not, in his judgment, a label, but is a trade-mark, and that the act of Congress, which changes the place of registry of labels from the office of the Librarian of Congress to the Patent Office, confers upon the Commissioner the right to determine whether the subject-matter of an application is properly registrable as a labeL or should be registered as a trade-mark.

Pat-Off., No. 15, page 1291.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">Before the passage of the act of June 18, 1874, all prints and labels were registered in the office of the Librarian of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">The statutory provisions under which prints and labels were then registered, and which governed and controlled the registry thereof and the rights of the parties thereunder, are found in sections 4948 to 4971 of the Revised Statutes. Sections 4956 and 4957 relate to the.recording of such prints and labels, and the furnishing by the Librarian of a copy of such record. Section 4957 is in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-7\">\u201c The Librarian of Congress shall record the name of such copyright book, or other article, forthwith, in a book to be kept for that purpose, in the words following: \u201cLibrary of Congress, to wit, Be it remembered * * * * * * And he shall give a copy of the title or description, under the seal of the Librarian of Congress, to the proprietor, whenever he shall require it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-9\">A careful inspection of these various sections will show that the Librarian of Congress never had any power given him to exercise his discretion as to what labels or prints he should register, and what he should not, but, on the contrary, that, as to these matters, he merely occupied the position, and was to \u00a1oerform the duties of, a recording officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-10\">The proprietor of the print or label was the one to decide whether or not he desired to place Ms title thereto on record, and by so doing secure to himself the protection which the law afforded. And if he so elected, he was to furnish the necessary copies and pay the prescribed fees to the Librarian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of Congress, and otherwise to perform such acts as the law required as being necessary to the. proper registry thereof. These things being done, the Librarian was to record said print or label, and was to furnish a copy, under seal, if the proprietor desired it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-4\">The Librarian of Congress had no more right to refuse to record a print or label \u2014 on the ground that, in his opinion, it constituted a trade-mark \u2014 than a comity clerk would have to refuse to record a deed on the ground that, in his opinion, it was not so drawn as to secure to the parties asking the record thereof the rights sought to be secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">And we may say that, so far as we are aware, the Librarian of Congress never pretended to exercise any judicial powers in the registry of labels or prints, or of books or pictures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\">Such being the law, Congress, on June 18, 1874; by the act referred to in the petition (18 Stats, at Large, p. 78), changed the place of registry of prints and labels designed to be attached to articles of' manufacture from the office of the Librarian of Congress to the Patent Office. Section 3 of that act is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 3. That in the construction of this act (the copyright act), the words <em>\u2018 </em>engraving, cut, and print,\u2019 shall be applied only to pictorial illustrations or works connected with the fine arts, and no prints or labels designed to be used for any other articles of manufacture shall be entered under the copyright law, but may be registered in the Patent Office. And the Commissioner of Patents is hereby charged with the supervision and control of the entry or registry of such prints or labels, in conformity with the regulations j&gt;rovided by law as to copyright of prints, except that there shall be paid for according to the title of any print or label, not a trade-mark, six dollars, which shall cover the expense of furnishing a copy of the record, under the seal of the Commissioner of Patents, to the party entering the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">It will be apparent that the duties of the Commissioner of Patents as to the registry of prints and labels are not changed by the act of June 18, 1874, from the duties exercised by the Librarian of Congress under the then existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>laws; the duties still remain the same, the only change being' in the official by whom they are to be performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-4\">The same laws govern the registration of prints and labels in the Patent Office as prevail in the recording of copyrights in the office of the Librarian of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-5\">In the case of Marsh <em>vs. </em>Warren, reported in 14th Blatchf., p. 264, his honor, Judge Blatchford, said: \u201cThe statutory provisions which confer the rights and regulate the remedies of persons who register in the Patent Office, under the act of June 18, 1874 (18 U. S. Stats, at Large, 78), prints or labels designed to be used for any other articles of manufacture than pictorial illustrations and works connected with the fine arts, are those which are contained in sections 4948 to 4971 of the Revised Statutes, in regard to copyrights.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-6\">The acts of Congress relating to patents, also those relating to the registration of trade-marks, give the Commissioner the right to regulate the modus of applications, and the right to decide on the propriety of issuing patents or certificates of registration of trade-marks; but the act relating to labels and prints, bearing close analogy to the acts relating to copyrights generally, and being in truth but a branct. of the latter, carefully abstains from granting, but a receiving and receipting, power to each of the recording tribunals. The evident intention of Congress was, in view of the multiplicity of business connected with the matter of securing copyrights, to place the burden of showing the legality of all the proceedings upon those who claim to have acted in obedience to the law. If one deposits with the Librarian of Congress the title of a book, claiming that he owns it, and that he is a citizen of the United States, or that'the thing which he calls a book is in reality a book, it is not for the Librarian to inquire into the truthfulness of these assertions, but he issues his receipt, receives the papers and fees submitted, and leaves the party to such relief as owing to the proceedings had before him, and his other statutory rights the law entitles him to enjoy. Hence, it has frequently happened that persons, litigants in court, seeking relief for violation of their copyrights, were told by the court that their copy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>rights were not lawfully recorded; that the steps essential for the purposes of protection under the. law, had not been correctly taken. Clayton <em>vs. </em>Stone, 2 Paine, 383.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\">Strictly analogous to this should be the proceedings relating to prints and labels. The act (June, 1874) does not say that the Commissioner shall exercise any discretion in this matter, does not say that he should make an examination into the matter, does not say that he should issue a certificate to the party recording a label, but simply provides that labels may be registered in the Patent Office, that the Commissioner is charged with the supervision and control of the entry of the registry of such prints or labels, and that when the fee of $6 is paid this shall also cover the expense of furnishing \u201ca copy of the record under the seal of the Commissioner of Patents,\u201d to the party entering the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">The questions in the present case are not new, but have already been determined by this court in the case of The United States, <em>ex rel. </em>The Willcox&amp; Gibbs Sewing Machine Co., <em>vs. </em>E. M. Marble, 1 Mackey, 284. The case now before the court is one of many of the same character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">Heretofore it has always been a rule of the Patent Office that the decisions of one Commissioner were binding upon his successors in office in cases where the same questions arose again, and were to be followed by them. But the defendant seems to diregard this rule, and either ignores decisions of his predecessors or else fails to avail himself of that ready means of acquainting himself with them which the Government places at his disposal. In the case of Schumacher &amp; Ettlinger, reported in the printed volume of \u201cDecisions of the Commissioner of Patents and U. S, Court\u201d for the year 1876, page 75, Mr. Spear, acting Commissioner, held as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">\u201c It appears from the record that these applicants applied for the registration of a certain print, the proper number of copies of which were attached to the application.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-8\">\u201c The print is made up of a combination of colors, figures and words. * *. *\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cc A certificate of registration was refused by the examiner, first, because the print amounted to a trade-mark, being purely an arbitrary symbol, and not in any one of its features descriptive ; second, because it may become a trademark by adoption and use; and as applicants desire to multiply and sell copies of it, it would seem that protection should be sought under the law as a new and original design ; and that to entitle the label to registration under the act of June 18, 1874, it must be \u00a3 intended to be used for some article of manufacture.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-3\">\u201c The position taken by the examiner that the print is not intended for use for any article of merchandise, and therefore not capable of registration as a print or label, does not appear to me tenable. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-4\">\u201c It appears from an inspection of the print, as well as from the statements of counsel for the petitioners, that this print is not\u00a3 connected with the fine arts,\u2019 but that it is designed for articles of manufacture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-5\">\u201cNow, if it is not connected with the fine arts as an engraving, cut, print or photograph, or painting, or any such thing recognizable at once as belonging to the fine arts, then these joetitioners could have no protection by registration with the librarian of Congress. If they have- none here, then none is provided for in,law. But the registration of trade-marks in the Patent Office is an offshoot of the copyright law, and I understand that these prints or labels, whenever they are intended for use with articles of manufacture, may be registered in the Patent Office on exactly the same terms and conditions, except that a larger fee is paid, as works of art may be registered with the librarian of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">- \u201c The fact that these parties make and sell these prints, and do not themselves apply them to articles of manufacture, should not, in my judgment, deprive them of\u2019 protection in the right of exclusive manufacture of the thing which they have produced. There is no such requirement in the law, all that is there prescribed is that the prints or labels must be such as are \u00a3 designed for use \u2019 for articles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>manufacture. Nor in this case could the print be considered a trade-mark, inasmuch as it is not appropriated to any particular class of goods. The protection which they seek, and which a certificate of registration will give them, is no more than protection in the exclusive right to make and sell this particular print. The decision of the examiner is reversed.\u201d See also' Com. Dec., vol. 8,'Off. Graz. Pat. Off., 21*7; <em>In re </em>Orcutt <em>&amp; </em>Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\">The Commissioner of Patents, .when he undertook to exercise his discretion in registering this label, must also have been aware of Ju&lt;jlge Blatchford\u2019s opinion in Marsh <em>vs. </em>Warren. Indeed, this opinion was considered of so great importance that it has been reported twice in the same volume. It will be found at page 161 of the Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents for the year 1878, and again at page 394 of the same volume.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">The relators have not changed their business since the decision of Commissioner Spear, above quoted, and the label which they now seek to have registered is of exactly the character as that which he then held to be a label and not a trade-mark, and their exclusive right to make and sell which he said could only be secured by such registration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">But the present Commissioner says that what the relators have produced is a trade-mark, and that if they desire to protect their rights under the same, they must register it as a trade-mark; they can\u2019t pay six dollars to the government for a label when a trade-mark costs twenty-five dollars, and thus secure to themselves the same rights, as the Commissioner seems to imagine, that they would have under a trade-mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">Another way of putting the present Commissioner\u2019s decision, is this: these relators make and sell certain labels (pictures) ; this is their business, and these labels are their goods; now, the'Commissioner would compel these parties to register these goods as a trade-mark \u2014 that is, the goods themselves would be trade-marks of themselves. Such a position of affairs was never contemplated by any act of Congress, and never could arise but in the fertile brain of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Aside from this, however, the picture sought to be registered is purely a label, and has not that essential characteristic of a trade-mark, <em>i. e., </em>that which distinguishes the \u25a0goods of one manufacturer from those of another; there is no arbitrary name applied to this picture that would indicate origin or ownership of the goods to which it might be applied. Indeed, the relators can with perfect propriety sell this label to various merchants, its use being merely an ornament or finish to the boxes or packages containing goods, and in no way indicating that such goods are of a particular make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-3\">We think that we have shown clearly that it is not the intention of the statute to invest the Commissioner of Patents with discretion in the registry of labels; that such has been the views of former Commissioners and that such has been the decision of this court; and further, that if he were clothed withjudicial powers he could not refuse to register the label here so ught to be recorded, as the same is, without a doubt, a label or prini). and not a trade-mark.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b59-4\">Mr. Chief Justice Cartier,</author>\n<p id=\"ACd\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It is objected in behalf of the Commissioner of Patents that the act of Congress of June 18, 1814, providing for the registration of labels is unconstitutional and therefore void. A very elaborate, ingenuous, and perhaps, under appropriate circumstances, successful argument, has been made to sustain this position. But we think the point raised has no application to this case. We- do not think it lies in the mouth of a government official to call in question the constitutionality of a law directing him to perform a purely ministerial duty. If the question was raised between other parties, as for instance, in a suit for infringement in the use of a label, and the constitutional rights of the parties were involved in it, that is to say whether one man was prohibited from using it because another man had regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tered it as a label, tbe argument might b\u00e9 pertinent, but we do not think it is a question which can be raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">The next reason assigned by the Commissioner for his refusal to comply with the petitioner\u2019s demand is that the design offered for registration is a mere fanciful sketch which, while it may be used as a trade-mark, has none of those descriptive features about it characteristic of a label. A label, it is contended, consists of a pictorial representation or a written description of the article to which it is affixed ; and that a fancy picture, such as this, having no connection with its proposed use or application, cannot be registered as a label. This question has been settled by this court in the case of the Sewing Machine Co. <em>vs. </em>Marble.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We decided in that case that the duty of the Commissioner of Patents, on the application to him to register a label, is a purely ministerial one, as much so as the act of a recorder of deeds in placing upon public record a muniment of title. The statute has not defined what shall be considered a label, whether it shall be a picture or a writing; whether it shall be descriptive of the article to which it is affixed, or whether it may be a mere arbitrary design. If the applicant presents it as a label, and appeals to the Commissioner to give it the protection which the law provides for it as a label, the duty of the Commissioner is to register it, and in doing so he gives it only the protection which the statute provides. It is not protected as a trade-mark nor as a copyright. The public at large may use and enjoy it, but <em>qua </em>label it is restricted to the use of the party who has regis- \u25a0 tered it for that purpose and no other. With the character of the device the Commissioner is not at all concerned. His function is as purely ministerial as it is capable of be ing. The writ will issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-4\">1 Mackey, 284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
