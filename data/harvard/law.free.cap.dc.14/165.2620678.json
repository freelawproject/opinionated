They rendered accordingly a verdict for the possession, and damages for the detention at the rate of $10 per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The case then came to the General Term on a motion for a new trial, on the exception to the ruling of the court in instructing the jury to find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">The bill of exceptions embodied all the testimony, which was substantially as stated above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-7\">H. E. Davis for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\">H. O. Claughton for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">The proof in this case is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-10\">The deed of trust prescribed the manner in which the sale should be made, including the period during which the sale should be advertised, and the number of times the notice should be published, to wit, for the period of three weeks, and notice to be published at least three times a week during that period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-11\">The sale was advertised to take place on the 26th day of March, 1883. On the .21th day of March, the defendant stated to one of the trustees that he expected to be able to arrange the matter on the 9th of April, and requested that sale should not be made on the 26th of March.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-12\">In the paper of date the 21th of March, the sale was postponed till the 9th of April, and the notice was published only four times between the 21th of March and the 9th of April \u2014 a period of sixteen days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The law, as applicable to the facts thus proved, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">1. When, the sale does not take place on the day appointed, for any good reason, the trustee at the j&gt;l&amp;ce and time may adjourn the sale, for a period shorter than that named in the deed; but in such case, the notices must be given during that period, in accordance with the provisions of the deed. Richards <em>vs. </em>Holmes, 18 How., 143; Jackson <em>vs. </em>Clark, I Johns., 21*7 ; Perry on Trusts, sec. 602 <em>a.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">2. If the day of sale is changed before the time appointed in the original advertisement, then it must be readvertised for the whole of the period, in accordance with the terms of the deed. Bennett <em>vs. </em>Brendap, 8 Minn., 385.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">In this case the time was changed before the day of sale, and the notice of sale should have been for the period named in the deed, and in the manner prescribed by the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">If the evidence tended to prove that the defendant consented that the sale should take place on the 9th of April, which is denied, even then, though the period of advertisement was shortened, there was no change in the number of times the notice should be published weekly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">The new period was sixteen days, and there were only four publications of notice during that time, when there should have been at least seven out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">The distinction between the case of an adjournment on the day of sale and a postponement before the sale is evident. In the first case, the sale is advertised for the period named in the deed, and the adjournment is o.nly a prolongation of that period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\">In the second case, after postponement is made, before the expiration of the period, and for a shorter time, then there never was a notice of the day of sale for the period prescribed by the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\">In this case, even if it could be presumed from the evidence that the period was shortened by consent of the defendant, there is no evidence proving or tending to prove that he consented that the notice should be published less frequently than three times a week.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AT_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>;Mr. Justice James,,</author>\n<p id=\"AYg\">after' stating tbe case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">It is contended that the advertisement of the projDOsed sale should have followed the provisions of the deed of trust for the original advertisement,-.namely,-for three weeks, three times a week, whereas it. was published only from the 24th of March to the 9th of April, and consequently the sale having been made without following the provisions of the trust, it was absolutely void and gave no title whereon to support an action of ejectment by the purchaser. A number 'of authorities were cited by defendant\u2019s counsel, to the effect that where the power prescribed in the deed of trust is. not followed, the sale is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We do not regard that point as material in this case, and there is, therefore, no necessity to decide it, for, whatever may be, the law in that respect, we have given weight to a circumstance which takes the case out of that discussion. It appears from the testimony, which is very brief, that the defendant, when the property'was about to be sold, called Upon one of the trustees, and informed him that he would be able to settle the matter by the 9th of April.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">All the evidence offered in the case is set out in the bill of exceptions, and we are, therefore, authorized to treat it as a case stated. We think that, upon the whole case, the suggestion of the defendant was that the trustees should wait until the 9th of April; and then if he did not make the provision for the debt which he hoped to do, the sale should take place on that day. Clearly, where the owner of the property agrees that' the advertisement may be for a shorter period than that expressed in the deed, he is estopped from setting up the objection that the provision made in the deed 'as to advertising was not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">His defence is an equitable one, which he is allowed to make in an action of ejectment, although the plaintiff must 'show a legal title. But he has no equitable defence against the plaintiff\u2019s taking possession, if he himself authorized the trustees to postpone the sale less than three weeks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to advertise accordingly. The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
