But this provision shall not prevent the said board of directors from carrying out the principles of the society or corporation, viz., to the <em>widow, orphans, heir, assignee or legatee </em>of a \u2022deceased member, as many dollars as there are members in good standing on the boohs of the corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-3\">The by-laws make no provision as to how the person shall he named who is to receive the benefit of this contribution of one dollar from each survivor, on the death of 'a member ; but the contract for its payment is one between the member \u2022and association only, and may be forfeited by default of the member in various ways, and can only be kept in force by payments made by the member, and his continued good standing as a Mason. The practice has been to allow the member to name the beneficiary, either in his application or afterward, and to change the same at his pleasure, if approved by the directors. One by-law provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\">\u201c That no change of beneficiary can be made or .recognized until submitted to and approved by the board of directors,\u201d Should this by-law be construed as applying to an appointment of a payee by will ?

And in this case, where \u2022a payee is named <em>conditionally, </em>and such conditional nomination is accepted and acquiesced in by the association, has the member not reserved to himself the same right of appointment by will ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">The by-law was evidently made for the benefit .of the .association, and not to give any additional title to a payee, named; and if it is constitutional, it is a rule that the-association might waive, if so disposed; and its waiver, or rep.eal, could not be prohibited by any beneficiary before designated.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbF\">The right of a man who contracts with a corporation for the payment of money to another person after his death, to \u2022change the beneficiary, has been the subject of much co.ntro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>versy. If the contract is one between him and the insurer-only, and he pays the consideration therefor, it seems to us-that in natural justice and right he should be allowed to change the object of his bounty at any time during his life, while he retains testamentary capacity, as freely as he might-change the legatees in a will; and certainly with the prior-consent of the company, or its subsequent acquiescence. In. either case the gift is not effectual, no benefit accrues to the donee until after the death of the donor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-3\">' The right of a beneficiary in a policy of insurance, or of a-legatee named in a will, is only an <em>expectancy, </em>during the life of the insured or testator, subject to be determined any-day by forfeiture of policy, or change of will, or, in this \u2022 association, by change of beneficiary by the member and. board of directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-4\">1.

Hopkins became insured in the Masonic Mutual Relief Association, he became a member of the association, and was bound by its constitution and bylaws, though they were not recited in the policy. One of those by-laws was that there should be \u201c no change of beneficiary \u201d without the approval of the directors of the association. (Art. YI, sec. 4.) \u201cIt is not within the power of the company,\u201d says the court in Duvall <em>vs. </em>Goodson, <em>supra, </em>\u2022\u201c or the members, or both, to alter the rights of those who by the charter are declared to be the beneficiaries, except in the mode and to the extent therein indicated.\u201d In that case Crofoot, at the time of his death. held a certificate of membership in the Kentucky Masonic Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>an association for mutual relief, substantially like our Masonic Mutual Eelief Association. Th\u00e9 stipulation in the certificate in the Kentucky case was to-pay to said Crofoot\u2019s daughters, Anna and Lou May Crofoot, or his assigns, <em>or as he may direct by will.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-4\">5. Again, Miss Hopkins, in her answer says, \u201cher brother\u2019s love and affection for her was very great; that he sympathized deeply with her, because he thought her father, while living, had not been as liberal with her as he had with the rest of the children (especially with himself), and therefore he proposed to effect said insurance for. her benefit, with a view, as he expressed it, of putting her, in the event of his death, on an equal footing as near as-he could, with her brothers and sisters. After the deceased had thus spoken, he applied for membership in said association, and was accepted, of which he at -once informed her and delivered said' certificate to her, which she accepted.\" This is not denied. It may well be questioned, then, whether the assured, Miss Hopkins, had not acquired such a vested right on said insurance as to put it beyond the power of the insured to deprive her of it. It dogs seem to us that even on this the appellant is entitled to the proceeds of the certificate in controversy.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-5\">Mr. Justice James</author>\n<p id=\"AiY\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The testator, George N. Hopkins, was a member of the Masonic Mutual Eelief Association. In his application for membership, he designated his sister, Mary E. Hopkins, as the beneficiary, in the following words:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201c I direct that in case of my decease while a member of the above-named association, all moneys to which I may be entitled as such member shall be paid to my sister, Mary E. Hopkins, unless I should hereafter otherwise direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Subsequently he made a will, naming his illegitimate child as the beneficiary. It apjiears that one of the by-laws of the association provided that \u201c no change of beneficiary can be made or recognized until submitted to and approved by the board of directors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The naming of this illegitimate child as his beneficiary was made without such previous consent, and it has been insisted on the part of Mary E. Hopkins that this attempt to change the beneficiary was invalid because forbidden by the by-laws, unless done with the consent of the company, which consent it was admitted was not obtained; that consequently Mary E. Hopkins remains the only person designated to take this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The executor, who appears to have sued in his title of' executor, but who really was the trustee, sets up these facts. Mary E. Hopkins, who seems to have intended to claim the fund, merely filed an answer asserting that for want of any subsequent valid designation, she was the beneficiary and entitled to the money, but she rather singularly winds up her answer by praying hence to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The company reply that they have no interest in the money, and are ready to pay it to whomsoever the court shall direct it to be paid. The decree below was that the company should pay the fund to the plaintiff, saying nothing, about Mary E. Hopkins, but, in effect, that was a decree against her, and she brings the case here on appeal. The association took no appeal, so that the case is here simply on the appeal of Miss Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">One of the questions raised was whether she could bring the case before us. In an ordinary case of a decree against two joint defendants, one of them cannot separately appeal, as the Supreme Court has heretofore decided in a number of cases. But this is not a case of that character. The decree was virtually a decree in favor of this executor, and against this appellant. They were the contesting parties, and when the decree said that the association should pay the plaintiff, it was really a decree against her. So that we think the case is properly here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The validity of this new designation is, therefore, presented as a question for the determination of the court. A very full discussion of the law of the case was made by counsel, but we think we can dispose of the matter very briefly upon one principle. The power of the association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to make by-laws was limited by the charter itself to such by-laws as should not be in violation of the laws and Constitution of the United States. And this would have been the \u25a0case even had it not been provided for in the charter. Now, one of the laws of the United States is this very charter, the second section of which provides that \u201cthe particular business and objects of such society or corporation shall be to provide and maintain a fund for the benefit of the widow, orphans, heirs, assigns or <em>legatees </em>of a deceased member, immediately upon proof of such decease.\u201d That provision recognizes fully and completely the right of a member of the association to designate the beneficary by his will. And that power cannot be cut off or diminished by a by-law. So far, then, as this by-law attempts to d\u00f3 so, it is itself inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">It may be observed that the power of the association to make by-laws seems to be somewhat restricted, and at any rate hardly to reach this subject, for while the fourth section of the charter declares that \u201c the directors shall have full power to make and prescribe such by-laws, rules and regulations as they shall deem needful and proper for the disposition and management of the funds, property and effects of the society,\u201d it does not go so far as to say that they may regulate the manner in which beneficiaries are to be designated. In making this by-law, then, the association seems to have gone beyond its power, and if its effect is to prevent a party from freely designating by his.will the legatee of his benefits as a member of the association, it is in conflict with the second section of the charter, which is, as we have said, a statute of the United States. We must, therefore, give effect to the recognition contained in that statute of the power to make a bequest, and we cannot cut it down by any construction that we might give to this by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The opinion of the court, therefore, is that this bequest was a valid one, and the decree below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
