The complaint was in the form prescribed by the act, alleging that the liquors therein complained of were then kept in a store therein spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>cified by Mallett, the present plaintiff, and were intended by him to be sold in violation of said act; but the complaint contained no other description of the liquors than that expressed by the following words, viz: \u201ccertain intoxicating liquors, <em>to wit: </em>several casks of French brandy, containing twenty-five gallons, more or less ; several casks of gin, containing twenty-five gallons, more or less; also several casks of intoxicating wines, containing twenty-five gallons, more or less.\u201d The warrant was likewise in the form prescribed by the act, and followed the language of the complaint in describing the liquors to be seized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">To the admission of this evidence the plaintiff objected, but the court admitted it. The plaintiff thereupon prayed the court to charge the jury that the complaint, warrant and other proceedings constituted no justification of the injuries complained of, because by the said warrant the defendant was authorized only to enter said store and search for and seize \u201c French brandy,\u201d \u201c gin \u201d and \u201c intoxicating wines,\u201d with the casks containing the same, and was not authorized to enter and search for or seize other liquors than those thus specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">The court did not so charge the jury, but instructed them that \u201c if the officer be directed in the process to seize <em>\u2018intoxicating liquors </em>\u2019 kept in a place particularly described, and only a portion of the liquors thus kept are known to the complainants, and consequently can not be described in the process by the name by which they are usually called, and there be other intoxicating liquors found by the officer, kept in the same place, belonging to the same person, which are not described, the officer may seize all such intoxicating liqt\u00edors so found by him in such place, and the fact that all the different kinds of intoxicating liquors found and seized by the defendant were not otherwise described in the process in question, than by the term \u2018 intoxicating liquors,\u2019 will not prevent the process under which he acted from being a justification for his acts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-7\">The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant, and thereupon the plaintiff moved for a new trial for errorin the admission of the evidence objected to, and in the charge to the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Beardsley </em>and Seeley, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">1. <em>The </em>defendant is justified by the warrant only to the extent of the seizure of the liquors which are specified in the complaint and warrant. It makes no difference that the specification is under a videlicet. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Andrews, 1 </em>Saund., 170, <em>note. Dakins case, 2 </em>id., 291. 2 Sw. Dig., 473, 474. <em>King v. Stevens, 5 </em>East., 214. <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>4 Conn., 265. <em>Mix </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>12 id., 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">2. The statute requires that some description should be given, in order to confer jurisdiction on the magistrate to issue the warrant. Stat. (Comp, of 1854,) 822, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">3. Without this description the warrant would be void on the face of it, as being in violation of the constitution. Amendments to U. S. Const., art. 4. Const, of Conn., art. 1, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">4. If the defendant seized liquors which by his warrant he was not authorized to seize, he became a trespasser <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-9\"><em>Sturges, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-10\">1. The complaint and warrant were admissible. The process was valid upon the face of it; and if the defendant pursued its authority he is to be protected. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>6 Wend., 367. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-11\">2. It was unnecessary to describe in the warrant exactly the kind or quantity of the liquors, much less was it necessary to give them their true names. Stat. (Comp. of 1854,) 831, \u00a7 24. Id., 822, \u00a7 12. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dana, 2 </em>Met., 329.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-12\">3. The specification of certain particular kinds of liquor under a videlicet did not limit the authority to seize, to those specified. <em>Droper </em>v. <em>Garnett, 2 </em>B. &amp; C., 2. <em>Stoddart </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>10 id., 4. <em>Bray </em>v.

Her natural and proper use is, to particularize that that is before general.\u201d\u2014\u201c It may work a restriction when the former words are not express and special, but so indifferent as they may receive such restriction without apparent injury, though those former words by construction of law would have had a larger sense if the videlicet had not been.\u201d <em>Stukeley </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>Hob., 172. <em>Dakins case, </em>2 Saund., 291 a, <em>note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In this complaint and warrant the videlicet is, (in the language of Lord Hobart) put to \u201c her natural and proper use,\u201d \u201cto particularize that that is before general;\u201d and its effect is to make a restriction of the meaning of the former words \u201c intoxicating liquors,\u201d though those former words by construction of law would have had a larger sense if the videlicet had not been.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Intoxicating liquors\u201d is the name of a genus, of which brandy, gin, &amp;e., are species, and although we agree with thp judge who tried the cause, that the particular species of liquor, when the species is unknown, need not be stated in the complaint or warrant, yet the objection in this case is, not that all the liquors' seized were not designated by their specific names, but that the genuine name \u201c intoxicating liquors,\u201d was <em>by the videlicet </em>restricted to the species particularly described under it, so that no intoxicating liquors besides those designated by their specific names, were complained of, or proceeded against, under any name general or specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s objection to this complaint and warrant, as not affording a justification for the seizure of liquors not specified therein, was well taken, and the charge to the jury on this point was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">A new trial is advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">New trial advised.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
