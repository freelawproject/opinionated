Waterman, Trustee : Appeal from Probate.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-15\">F. &amp; G. copartners in the business of making railroad cars, owning $440,000 of real and personal property used by them in their business, and being indebted to the amount of $205,000, for the purpose of making their property available for the payment of their debts proposed to their creditors that they (F. &amp; G-.) should form a joint stock corporation to take their business with a capital of $200,000, of which they should subscribe the entire amount, and transfer to the corporation their whole property, of which $200,000 should constitute the capital, and the remainder a pledge for the payment of their debts, and the avails thereof be applied by the corporation for that purpose\u2014 that they would sell to each creditor an amount of the stock of the corporation equal to one-half his claim, taking the negotiable notes of such creditor therefor, which stock so transferred should be made preferred stock\u2014and that the remainder of the stock should be transferred to a trustee as a further security for the payment of their debts ; to which proposition the creditors (except a few) acceded, stipulating with each other that the earnings and avails of the property should be appropriated to the payment of their several claims against F. &amp; G. in the order of their future maturity, with a provision that the agreement accepting the proposition should not take effect till signed by all the creditors of F. &amp; G. whose claims exceeded $200. The agreement was not in fact signed by all the creditors who held claims of that amount, but this fact was well known to F. &amp; G. and to the corporation at the time of their action on the subject. F. &amp; G. proceded to form a corporation as proposed, associating with themselves for the purpose a nominal member, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and transferred all their property to the corporation, in accordance with their agreement. The corporation at its first meeting passed the votes necessary to carryout the arrangement agreed on, that with regard to thepaymentof the debts of F. &amp; G. being as follows: \u201c that the directors are hereby authorized to apply the earnings and avails of the property of the corporation toward the payment of the liabilities of F. &amp; G. in accordance with their contract with their creditors, entered on the records of this corporation.\u201d The directors thereupon held a meeting and voted to accept the property of F. &amp; G., the same to be applied in part to the payment of the subscription of F. &amp; G. to the stock of the corporation and the surplus to the extinguishment of the liabilities of F. &amp; G. in accordance with the contract before mentioned. All the property thus conveyed to the corporation was necessary for its business. A certificate was lodged by the directors with the secretary of the state and the clerk of the town, in accordance with the statute, stating among other things the capital of the corporation to be \u201c \u00a7200,000, the entire amount of which has been paid in.\u201d The corporation commenced business, and paid the debts of F. &amp; G. as they matured for about two months, the amount thus paid being about \u00a750,000, when it ceased paying them, and soon after made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, having contracted debts of its own to the amount of \u00a719,000. The appellees were creditors of F. &amp; G. who had subscribed the agreement, and had not been paid by the corporation. The commissioners on the assigned estate allowed their claim, and the trustee appealed from their report to the superior court.

The corporation was located at Hartford. Its capital was fixed at the sum of $200,000 and divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>into shares of twenty-five dollars each.

The property conveyed was all of the real and personal estate of Fales &amp; Gray, and was necessary for the business of the corporation. A certificate was lodged by the officers of the corporation in accordance with the statute, with the secretary of the state and with the town clerk of the town of Hartford, stating among other things the capital of the corporation to be <em>\u201c </em>$200,000, the entire amount of which has been paid in.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-9\">The corporation took possession of the property thus conveyed to them and commenced business. They began to pay the debts of Fales &amp; Gray in the order of their maturity, and continued to do so until the 21st of October, 1854, after which they paid only such as were secured by collaterals. On the 21st of October, they had paid of these debts between fifty and sixty thousand dollars, being all the debts of Fales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>&amp; Gray matured up to that time, among which was a note of Fales &amp; Gray to the appellees of $180.54. The indebtedness of Fales &amp; Gray on the 4th of October, 1854, was about $205,000. They were at that time indebted to the appellees by book account in the sum of $255. No credit had been given to Fales &amp; Gray on the books of the appellees, nor had they charged the amount to the Grove Car Works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The appellees delivered in the month of September, 1854, their note of two hundred dollars to Fales &amp; Gray, dated September 1st, 1854, payable six months after date, to the Grove Car Works, and received a certificate of eight shares of stock, which they still held. Their note was paid by them at maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">The Grove Car Works on the 6th of March, 1855, made an assignment of all their estate, both real and personal, for the benefit of all their creditors, under the statute with regard to insolvent estates, and are now insolvent, and unable to pay the debts allowed by the commissioners ; the appellant was appointed trustee of the estate, and commissioners were appointed to receive the claims of creditors of the corporation. The amount of claims presented to and allowed by the commissioners for debts originally contracted by the corporation is $18,909.64. The amount of claims presented and allowed against the corporation for debts originally contracted by Fales &amp; Gray is $98,893.19.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">The committee found the appellees to be creditors of Fales &amp; Gray who had signed the agreement of the 5th of September, 1854, and that' the Grove Car Works were indebted to them, if upon the foregoing facts, the court should be of opinion that they had assumed and become liable to pay the debt, otherwise not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">The superior court reserved the questions arising on the report of the committee for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-9\"><em>Chapman </em>and <em>Fellowes, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">The claim presented to the commissioners, allowed by them, and appealed from, is a book debt against Fales &amp; Gray. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The appellees claim that the Grove Car Works, a corporation, entered into a contract to pay this book debt, and are liable to them on this contract. We say in answer to this claim,</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">1. That the facts found by the committee do not show that the corporation had the legal capacity to make such a contract, and it is incumbent on the appellees to prove this fact. <em>N. Y. Firemens\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>5 Conn., 560. <em>Same </em>v. <em>Ben</em>nett, id., 574., <em>Hood </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; N. Haven R. R. Co., 22 </em>id., 1; id., 502. Rev. Stat., tit. 3, sec. 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\"><em>2. </em>The facts found do not show that any such contract was in point of fact made, but an entirely different contract if any, to wit: a contract that certain property of Fales &amp; Gray in their hands might be applied to the payment of their debts. This was not the claim made before the commissioners, nor is it the claim made here. This is entirely a different thing from the assumption of the debt by the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">3. If the facts found were sufficient to prove a contract on the part of this corporation to pay this debt of Fales &amp; Gray, the statute of frauds intervenes and excludes them from the consideration of the court. It is an agreement to pay the debt of a third party and is not in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">4. The agreement of September 4,1854, was by its express terms not to take effect unless signed by all the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray whose claims exceeded $200. And it is found that all the creditors holding claims of that amount did not sign it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">5. Tt is a fraud upon the direct creditors of the corporation, who, having trusted the corporation on the strength of its certificate that its capital was all paid in, ought not to be compelled to lose a part of their claims, to enable the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray to receive a part of theirs, the property being insufficient to pay in full.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-10\"><em>T. C. Perkins </em>and <em>Hooker, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">The creditors of Fales &amp; Gray had originally a claim on all this property, andcould have appliedit allto the paymentof their demands, and for the sole purpose of the better obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>payment, they consented that the Grove Car Works should take the property, agreeing themselves to take stock in the company to half the amount of their claims, and looking to the corporation for payment. All parties concerned agreed to this. The company received the consideration and voted to carry out the arrangement. No substantial reason can be shown why it should not now perform its agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">1. It is said that the company never agreed to pay. But the company took the property on the condition of payment, and it can not now keep the property and refuse to perform the condition. Besides, it did expressly agree to pay. By its vote it agreed to apply all its earnings and the avails of its property to the payment of these debts. And what has a corporation in any case to pay with, except its earnings and the avails of its property ? It can not make a more absolute promise to pay, than by agreeing to apply these to the payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">2. Again it is said, that the corporation had no power to make a contract binding itself to pay these debts. But it clearly had power to buy this property. It is found to be property necessary to the prosecution of its business. If it could buy the property of Bales &amp; Gray, and pay them cash for it, which it clearly had the power to do, it could agree to pay their debts of a specified amount instead of paying cash. It is only a mode of paying for property purchased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">3. It is further said that the contract is within the statute of frauds and inoperative because not in writing. But it is in writing. The -vote is written. The entry of the vote on the records of the company is tantamount to signing. Ang. and Ames on Corp., sec. 237. The record is always signed by the secretary, who is for this purpose the !&lt; agent \u201d of the company within the statute. If not thus, signed, yet the name of the corporation in the body of the vote is equivalent to a signature at the bottom. <em>Schneider </em>v. Norris, 2 Maule &amp; Sel., 286. 2 Pars. on Cont., 1st Ed., 287. <em>Trueman </em>v. <em>Loeder, </em>11 A. &amp; E., 589. But this case is not within the statute, because the funds with which to pay the debt were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>placed by the debtor in the hands of the party promising. 1 Sw. Dig., 253. It is thus a promise made on a new consideration. Further, it is not within the statute because the promise is made to the debtor and not to the creditor. <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>21 Maine, 410. <em>Pratt </em>v. Humphrey, 22 Conn., 317. But the matter has no connection with the statute of frauds. It is, as before suggested, a mere purchase of- goods and a promise to pay for them in this particular mode.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">4. Again it is said, that the agreement of September 4,1854, which is the basis of the whole undertaking, never took effect because not signed by all the creditors who by its terms were to sign it. But the corporation having taken the property under that agreement and still retaining it, can not now be heard to say that the agreement did not take effect. The company knew that all had not signed, but chose to go on as if all had done so. It has therefore waived the objection. Besides it was a condition inserted in the agreement, not for the benefit- of the corporation, but only for that of the creditors, that those who signed the agreement need not be held unless all signed it. It had no reference to any interest of the corporation in the matter, and the failure to procure the names of all has caused no injury to the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">5. Again it is said, that it is inequitable that the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray should be paid, while the direct debts of the corporation can not be paid in full. But how is it any more inequitable to require payment from the corporation for property bought of Fales &amp; Gray, than for property bought of any body else. .Had the same precise property been bought on credit of a stranger, no one would regard it as inequitable that his claim should stand on an equality with any other claim presented against the corporation. It is a perfect debt, and therefore as good as any other debt, which can be no more than perfect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-7\">Ellsworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asd\">It appears from the record, that Thomas J. Fales and John S. Gray were copartners under the name of Fales &amp; Gray, in September, 1854, in the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>manufacturing railroad cars. The value of their estate, real, and personal, was, as then estimated, $5440,000, and their indebtedness was $5205,000. Being somewhat embarrassed, in order to obtain relief, on the 5th day of September, they agreed with their creditors, (with exception of a few,) to form a joint stock company,'under the statute law of the state, with a capital of $5200,000. They w.ere at once to convey all their property above mentioned to this joint stock company, $5200,000 of it to be considered as the capital, and the surplus to be held by them, the better to enable them to pay the debts of the firm of Fales &amp; Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The corporation was formed, and being organized took a conveyance from Fales &amp;\u2018Gray of said property to the estimated value of $5440,000. They took the name of !\u00a3 The Grove Car Works,\u201d and passed a resolution to appropriate the avails and earnings of the business to the payment of the said debts of Fales &amp; Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">After carrying on the business a few months, the corporation failed, and on the 5th day of March, 1855, assigned its property under the statute for the benefit of creditors, and Mr. Waterman was appointed trustee by the court of probate, The appellees and others presented their claims to the commissioners for allowance. Bo far as they consisted of the old debts of Fales &amp; Gray, (and this was one of them,) the trustee claimed that they should not be allowed by the commissioners, for the reason that the new corporation could not and in fact did not assume them ; and upon this appeal from the allowance of these claims by the commissioners, the chief question is, whether the corporation had the power to do this, and in fact did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">We think there is no question but that the corporation assumed the debt now in question, and the other existing debts of Fales &amp; Gray, so far as the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray signed and became parties to the instrument of the 5th of September. The entire arrangement proceeds upon this idea, as its very basis and motive. These creditors were to renounce their claims against Fales &amp; Gray, so far as the property of Fales &amp; Gray was concerned, and allow it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>pass into the hands of the corporation, in order to enable the corporation to carry on its business and pay the old and any new creditors as agreed. They likewise as a part of the arrangement executed their notes to the corporation, still more to aid it in the execution of the trust. And more than this, such assumption of the debts of Fales &amp; Gray is expressly stated in the instrument as the condition of its receiving and enjoying the property. After this, it would be strange indeed if the corporation could retain the property and repudiate the conditions upon which it was received. So too, the corporation, by its express vote, passed in all good faith, undertook to apply the earnings and avails towards this class of debts. On the whole, we do not entertain any. doubt but that the Grove Car Works assumed the debt in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">But it is said that the corporation was not authorized to assume the debts of Fales &amp; Gray. If by this is meant that the corporation had no power to purchase the stock, tools, &amp;e., of Fales &amp; Gray, and contract to pay for them by assuming debts, provided it was done <em>bona fid\u00e9, </em>so as to continue the same business under the new organization, we must say the appellant is mistaken. It could purchase this property as well as any other property without injuring the creditors of the company. The property necessary for carrying on the business must be had from somebody, and why may it not be purchased of Fales &amp; Gray, especially with the consent of their creditors. But if it is meant that this transaction is not consistent with the certificate lodged by the joint stock corporation with the clerk of the town of Hartford, that the corporation started with a capital of $200,000 free of charge, and that <em>bona fide </em>creditors of the Grove Car Works, who, relying on the certificate as true, gave credit to the corporation, may complain that they were deceived and are in danger of being injured, we are not prepared to say that there may not be force in the objection; but then-this is no reason why the commissioners should not allow this claim, for at all events, if our first position is correct, the debt is a good one against the corporation, and the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>priority among creditors must be raised, if any where, in the court of probate, when the order for distribution of the effects shall be obtained. The unpaid debts of Fales &amp; Gray amount to $99,000, and the unpaid debts contracted by the Grove Car Works are $18,000. How these debts are to stand in relation to the property to be divided, we shall not undertake to say, for no such decision is called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The statute of frauds has been urged as an objection to the assumption of the debts of Fales &amp; Gray by the Grove Car Works. There is no such assumption proved by writing it is said.. Our answer is, 1st. There is a good one in law, against the corporation, created by its receiving and retaining the property of Fales &amp; Gray, which it received and retains upon the terms and conditions expressed in the instrument upon which their title to it depends; 2d. The corporation, by a vote in writing, assumed to pay these debts; and 8d. The corporation assumed the debts upon a new and original consideration. It received property, as then valued, to the amount of $440,000, and in consideration thereof promised to pay these debts. 1 Smith. Lead. Cases, 329, 33J. Besides, a special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, is one which is made to the person to whom another is answerable, and not to the debtor himself, as this court held in <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Hum</em>phrey, 22 Conn., 317. See also <em>Hilton </em>v. Dinsmore, 21 Maine, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We attach no importance to the circumstance that the instrument of the 5th of September contains a provision that it shall not take effect until signed by all the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray whose claims exceed $200. The appellees and most of the creditors signed the instrument, and thereupon the property of Fales &amp; Gray was granted and delivered to the corporation, who accepted it and have made use of it in their business as they saw fit. The corporation can not now object because some others of the creditors of Fales &amp; Gray did not sign the instrument. This is no injury to them. The corporation should not have taken the property and gone on under the new arrangement, if it intended to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that this condition of the instrument should be complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We advise judgment for the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Judgment for the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
