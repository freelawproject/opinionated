FERC, </em>645 F.2d 360 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1142, 102 S.Ct. 1000, 71 L.Ed.2d 293 (1982) (hereinafter referred to as <em>\u201cPennzoil </em>\u201d). The central issues in this appeal focus on whether the Commission\u2019s decision, which sustained third-party protests to certain producer-sellers\u2019 contractual authorization to collect the stripper well price established under section 108 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3318, properly applies this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennzoil, </em>and whether it is supported by substantial evidence. Finding that the Commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>fundamentally misconstrued this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court grants the petitions for review. The agency orders are vacated and the proceedings remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">As explained in great detail in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 365-71, the adoption of the Natural Gas Policy Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3432 (\u201cNGPA\u201d), on November 9, 1978, substantially modified the structure of federal natural gas regulation then existing pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717-717w (\u201cNGA\u201d). Prior to the NGPA, the Commission prescribed just and reasonable rates through Commission rate proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The NGPA, in contrast, provided for congressionally set rates promulgated by statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Under the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court required that any rate increase filed under section 4 or 5 of the Natural Gas Act must be authorized by the contract between the producer-seller and the pipeline-purchaser. Contractual authority is also a prerequisite to collection of rates established in the NGPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Over the years, producer-sellers and pipeline-purchasers relied on various indefinite price escalator clauses in their contracts, generically termed area rate clauses,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to authorize increases to new rates as such rates were set by the Commission. This Court discussed the historical foundations of area rate clause use in detail in <em>Pennzoil, </em>and this Court need not repeat that discussion here. It is sufficient to note that when the Commission abandoned area-based rates and adopted nationwide rates of general applicability, the Commission permitted producers and interstate pipelines to rely on area rate clauses to escalate the contract price to the national ceiling rates.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-15\">After enactment of the NGPA, the question arose whether area rate clauses also authorized escalation of rates to those set in the NGPA. The <em>Pennzoil </em>case reviewed the Commission\u2019s Order 23 series which addressed that issue. In Order 23, the Commission concluded that neither the language of the NGPA nor Commission regulations precluded authorization of NGPA rates through area rate clauses. Nevertheless, the Commission also concluded that it could not dispositively construe all such area rate clauses. Rather, the Commission concluded that it would ascertain and give effect to the contracting parties\u2019 intent and that it would not object generally to the parties\u2019 reliance on area rate clauses as authority to collect NGPA prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-16\">Order 23-B established procedures which allowed interstate pipelines and certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>third-party protestors to protest producers\u2019 assertion of contractual authority to collect the higher NGPA rates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of particular importance to this proceeding, Order 23-B and the Order on Rehearing of Order 23-B, adopted a bifurcated procedure for third-party protests. If the contracting parties submit that it was their mutual intent to authorize the NGPA rates, then the Chief ALJ summarily dismisses the third-party protest unless (1) the contractual language is inconsistent with the parties\u2019 mutual interpretation, or (2) the protestor submits other specific evidence that explains or modifies the text of the contract. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 370. If either of these two requirements is met, an evidentiary hearing before another AU is scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">As summarized in <em>Pennzoil, </em>this procedure creates a rebuttable presumption (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Order 23 presumption\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-6\">In other words, the protestor has the burden of coming forward with substantial evidence of the lack of contractual authority to overcome the presumption that the contracting parties\u2019 assertion regarding their intent is accurate and not unreasonable. If the protestor meets the burden of production, the contracting parties bear the burden of persuasion at the hearing to show by a preponderance of the evidence that contractual authority exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">In <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court essentially affirmed the Order 23 procedures. Nevertheless, this Court held that the <em>Erie </em>doctrine<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> required the Commission to apply state law principles of contract construction rather than general principles of contract construction developed by the Commission. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 383-84. The instant case involves petitions for review of a case specific application of these third-party protest procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">B. <em>The Present Controversy</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgX\">On August 27, 1979,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> United Gas Pipe Line Company (\u201cUnited\u201d) filed an eviden-tiary submission pursuant to 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.94(j) which covered 365 natural gas producers and approximately 775 contracts. In this submission, United represented that the contracting parties mutually intended to authorize all NGPA rates through the use of area rate clauses. Third-party protests were filed by the Commission Staff and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">The Chief AU summarily dismissed the majority of the protests on the basis of the Order 23 presumption which attached to the contracting parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Chief AU found that the third-party protestors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>presented extrinsic evidence challenging the parties\u2019 contractual authorization to collect the NGPA rate for stripper well gas.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Chief AU based this ruling on an April 23, 1979, letter from United to its producers stating that United\u2019s contracts did not require United to pay stripper well rates because the rate of production from a well had never been a criterion for determining rates.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> United, however, retracted the April 23, 1979, letter in August 1979, four months after it was issued.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Chief AU, therefore, ordered an evidentia-ry hearing to decide the factual question whether the parties intended area rate clauses to authorize collection of stripper well gas prices. The case was assigned to another AU (hereinafter \u201cthe presiding AU\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The presiding AU considered the live testimony, deposition testimony, and the documentary evidence presented before issuing an opinion in which the presiding AU adopted the suggestion of Commission Staff that this proceeding involved eight types of area rate clauses. The presiding AU then construed these eight types of area rate clauses by taking into account both the language of the clauses<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the extrinsic evidence presented at the hearing. The presiding AU held that clauses types I and IV did not authorize stripper well gas rates. The presiding AU, however, further held that the remaining types of clauses (Types II, III, V, VI, VII and VIII) authorized collection of stripper well rates and accordingly dismissed the third-party protests as to those types of clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">In Opinion 181, the Commission reversed the presiding AU\u2019s decision as to types II, III, V, VI, and VII, holding that the producers failed, on burden of proof grounds, to demonstrate by a preponderance of the extrinsic evidence that they intended to authorize collection of stripper well gas rates. In Opinion 181-A, the Commission denied rehearing of Opinion 181, reiterating that the producers had failed to meet their procedural burden. Moreover, the Commission held that its approach did not diverge from this Court\u2019s order in <em>Pennzoil </em>to apply state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">The producers now seek review of Opinion 181 and Opinion 181-A in this Court. This Court finds merit to several of the producers\u2019 arguments. For the following reasons, the petitions for review are granted, the orders vacated and the proceedings remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AN0\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARS\">In their petitions for review, the producers argue that the Commission erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>applied the Order 23 presumption as a matter of law. Moreover, producers assert that the Commission failed to give adequate weight to the AU\u2019s factual determinations. It has long been settled law that this Court reviews the factual determinations of the Commission under the substantial evidence test.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, the Commission\u2019s assertion that this case is governed by the clearly erroneous standard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">The parties, however, dispute the amount of deference the Commission owes the AU\u2019s factual determinations. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the substantial evidence standard \u201cis not modified in any way when the Board and its [AU] disagree.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 496, 71 S.Ct. 456, 469, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). <em>See NLRB v. Lancer Corp., </em>759 F.2d 458, 461 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>Dunning v. NASA, </em>718 F.2d 1170, 1174 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Saavedra v. Donovan, </em>700 F.2d 496, 498 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 892, 104 S.Ct. 236, 78 L.Ed.2d 227 (1983). Thus, the Commission may properly resolve an issue on grounds which differ from those upon which the AU relied. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(b). <em>See Lancer Corp., </em>759 F.2d at 461; <em>Mattes v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 1125, 1129 (7th Cir.1983); <em>NLRB v. Seafarers International Union, </em>496 F.2d 1363, 1364 (5th Cir.1974). Likewise, the Commission is not strictly bound by the credibility determinations of the AU. <em>Mattes, </em>721 F.2d at 1129; <em>Kirkland v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>706 F.2d 99, 104 (2d Cir.1983); <em>NLRB v. Bogart Sportswear Manufacturing Co., </em>485 F.2d 1203, 1210 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight,\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp., </em>340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464, including determinations by the AU which differ from the agency\u2019s decision. 340 U.S. at 493; 71 S.Ct. at 467. <em>See Lancer Corp., </em>759 F.2d at 451; <em>Kirkland, </em>706 F.2d at 104; <em>Saavedra, </em>700 F.2d at 498. Consequently, \u201cwhen the ultimate determination of motive or purpose hinges entirely upon the degree of credibility to be accorded the testimony of interested witnesses, \u2018the credibility findings of the [AU] are entitled to special weight and are not to be easily ignored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. NLRB, </em>462 F.2d 8, 12 (5th Cir.1972) (quoting <em>Russell-Newman Manufacturing Co. v. NLRB, </em>407 F.2d 247, 249 (5th Cir.1969)). <em>See Kirkland, </em>706 F.2d at 103-04; <em>Saave-dra, </em>700 F.2d at 498. Therefore, when the Commission has rejected the credibility determinations of the AU, the Court subjects the record to particular scrutiny. <em>See Kirkland, </em>706 F.2d at 104; <em>Bogart Sportswear, </em>485 F.2d at 1210; <em>Ward, </em>462 F.2d at 12 &amp; n.5. Review is heightened not because the standard differs but because evidence supporting a conclusion is likely to be less substantial when the AU\u2019s conclusion differs from that of the agency. <em>Universal Camera Corp., </em>340 U.S. at 496-97, 71 S.Ct. at 469; <em>Ward, </em>462 F.2d at 12 &amp; n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">Unlike factual findings, questions of law are freely reviewable by the courts, and courts are under no obligation to defer to the agency\u2019s legal conclusions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>608 F.2d 213, 218 (5th Cir.1979). \u201cThis is particularly true when the decision of the agency is based on an interpretation of a judicial decision that in turn construes the Constitution or a statute.\u201d <em>Charter Limousine, Inc. v. Dade County Board of Commissioners, </em>678 F.2d 586, 588 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">In their petitions for review, the producers assert that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>failed to give adequate weight to the language of the contracts and the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent. Moreover, the producers argue that the Commission gave undue weight to the April letter submitted by protestors to rebut the Order 23 presumption. This Court agrees that the Commission so erred. The Commission\u2019s error stems from a misapprehension concerning the nature and effect of the presumption created which led the Commission to erroneously decide this case on procedural grounds. For similar reasons, the Commission erroneously refused to interpret the contracts at issue in these proceedings. These are errors of law and freely reviewable. Furthermore, the Commission erroneously refused to give proper weight to the credibility determinations of the presiding AU which leads this Court to question whether the Commission\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. For these reasons, as more fully articulated below, the decision of the Commission is vacated and the proceedings remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">B. <em>The Order 23 Presumption</em></p>\n<p id=\"Atkk\">In <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s use of a rebuttable presumption in favor of the contracting parties\u2019 mutual interpretation \u201cas a matter of contract law,\u201d 645 F.2d at 392, noting that \u201c[r]ebuttable presumptions serve as burden-shifting devices____\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court characterized the presumption as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqU\">The presumption in favor of [the contracting parties\u2019 mutual] interpretation is the same as that which arises from a prima facie case: it imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with substantial evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift the burden of persuasion. Therefore, protestors need not prove the lack of contractual authority, but only produce some evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amj\"><em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Evid. 301).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">Contrary to the Commission\u2019s present approach, this Court clearly adopted a \u201cbursting bubble\u201d theory of presumptions when it affirmed the Order 23 presumption. Under the Thayer<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or \u201cbursting bubble\u201d theory of presumptions, the <em>only </em>effect of a presumption is to shift the burden of producing evidence with regard to the presumed fact.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If the party against whom the presumption operates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>produces evidence challenging the presumed fact, the presumption simply disappears from the case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In the instant proceedings, once the third-party protestors met their burden of production, the presumption completely disappeared leaving the factual issue of intent to be resolved at the hearing before the presiding AU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">The Commission committed three fundamental errors in its application of the presumption. First, the Commission failed to give <em>any </em>further evidentiary weight to the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent. Second, the Commission gave undue weight to the rebuttal evidence, here the letter of April 23, 1979. Finally, the Commission failed to give evidentiary weight to the language of the contracts and in so doing erroneously refused to construe the contracts involved in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">1. <em>The Parties\u2019 Assertion of Mutual Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">First, the Commission erroneously refused to give any evidentiary weight to the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent beyond the initial proceeding before the Chief AU. The Commission stated numerous times in both Opinion 181 and Opinion 181-A that the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent (the base fact) had been <em>negated </em>by the April 23, 1979, letter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As a matter of law, this misstates the effect of rebuttal evidence on the presumption and the evidence supporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-10\">The base fact (here the assertion of mutual intent) which establishes the presumed fact (here contractual authorization) simply is not negated by the rebuttal evidence. It does not follow that the evidentiary basis underlying the presumption is negated merely because the third-party protestors submitted evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption. Granted, the presumption is dispelled, but the underlying evidence remains in the case. A fact finder could still credit the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent, which is probative of contractual authorization independent of the Order 23 presumption, over the third-party protestors\u2019 evidence because the protestors\u2019 evidence is simply evidence from which a reasonable person could, but is not required to, infer that contractual authority does not exist. See <em>infra </em>p. 1138 &amp; note 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">As stated by one leading scholar, \u201cpresumptions are frequently created in instances in which the basic facts raise a natural inference of the presumed fact.\u201d This natural inference may be sufficient to create a fact question, \u201cdespite the existence of contrary evidence and despite the resultant destruction of the presumption, ... not because of the presumption, but because of the natural inference flowing from the plaintiff\u2019s showing.....\u201d <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra </em>note 23, \u00a7 345(A), at 821.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>2. <em>The Effect of the Rebuttal Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAYz\">Second, as a corollary to the first error, the Commission thereafter gave undue weight to the April 23, 1979, letter for at least two reasons. As previously noted, and discussed in more detail <em>infra, </em>the April letter did not negate the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent. Rather, it constituted some evidence of lack of contractual authority. In addition, the letter was not necessarily credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">The third-party protestors\u2019 burden of production has been phrased a number of ways. In Order 23-B, the Commission stated that a third party must show in its protest \u201cevidence sufficient to show lack of contractual authorization....\u201d Order No. 23-B, 44 Fed.Reg. 38,834, 38,836 (1979). On rehearing of Order 23-B, the Commission further clarified the third-party protestors\u2019 showing: \u201cThat showing must involve more than a \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence; it must be such that a reasonable [person] could infer that contractual authority does not exist.\u201d Order on Rehearing of Order No. 23-B, 44 Fed.Reg. 48,174, 48,175 (1979). It is this formulation that this Court affirmed in <em>Pennzoil. </em>645 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">In Order 77, however, the Commission rearticulated the third-party protestors\u2019 burden in such a manner as to necessarily place undue weight on the evidence presented by the protestors if the protestors successfully obtained a further hearing before a presiding AU. The Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-8\">[T]he commission will find contractual authorization to collect NGPA rates unless the express terms of the contract exclude rates promulgated by statute <em>or the protest ... contains reliable and probative extrinsic evidence which, if true, would specifically contradict the mutual interpretation of the parties and be dispositive of the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">Opinion No. 77 at 61,400 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). From this reformulation, the Commission concluded in the present proceeding that the protestors\u2019 evidence must negate the contracting parties\u2019 mutual assertion of intent before a hearing will be held. Opinion 181-A at 61,371.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">This Court notes at the outset that there is a marked difference between \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 392, from which a \u201creasonable [person] could infer that contractual authority does not exist,\u201d 44 Fed.Reg. at 48,175, and \u201creliable and probative extrinsic evidence which, if true, would specifically contradict [or negate] the mutual interpretation of the parties and be dispositive of the case.\u201d Opinion No. 77 at 61,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-13\">Under the Thayer or \u201cbursting bubble\u201d theory of presumptions, the presumption is dispelled upon the \u201cintroduction of evidence which would support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact....\u201d 10 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra </em>note 24, \u00a7 301.04[2] at III \u2014 19 (citing Thayer, <em>A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, </em>at 352 (1898)). Professor Morgan, in contrast, adopted the position that a \u201c \u2018presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Morgan, <em>Instructing the Jury Upon Presumptions and Burden of Proof, </em>47 Harv.L.Rev. 59 (1933)). The Commission\u2019s rearticulation of the Order 23 presumption more closely follows Morgan\u2019s theory, a theory rejected by this Court in <em>Pennzoil </em>and by Congress in its adoption of Federal Rule of Evidence 301. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number><em>See supra </em>note 24, at 1137.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Clearly, the April 1979 letter did not <em>negate </em>the parties\u2019 mutual assertion of intent as a matter of law. At most, it was evidence sufficient to support a finding of the lack of the presumed fact of contractual authority; it did not compel such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Additionally, the producers challenged the credibility of the April 1979 letter. For example, the producers demonstrated that United retracted the April letter in August. Moreover, testimony indicated that the April letter represented a shift in United's previous policy and even may have been a breach of United\u2019s negotiator\u2019s promises to specific producers. On the other hand, significant evidence tended to establish that United wrote the August letter to maintain a working relationship with United\u2019s producers and because United had obtained certain producer consessions regarding production related costs. Thus, a trier of fact faced substantial evidence in support of either interpretation of the April letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-11\">The Commission, however, failed to address the factual inquiry directly. Rather, the Commission decided this case on procedural grounds, holding that producers failed to -meet their burden of proof. <em>See </em>Opinion No. 181 at 61,220, 61,221; Opinion No. 181-A at 61,368, 61,370.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The AU, in contrast, answered the factual inquiry. As to at least one type of area rate clause [Type II Clauses], the AU specifically held that the April 1979 letter did not constitute reliable and probative evidence which contradicted the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Commission, however, gave the letter undue weight simply by holding that it was credible and accurate without adequate reference to the AU\u2019s credibility determination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This Court does not hold that the Commission must accept the AU\u2019s credibility determination on remand. Nevertheless, it constitutes part of the record which the Commission cannot ignore. See <em>supra </em>at p. 1135.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>3. <em>Language and Construction of the Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Third, the Commission erroneously refused to consider the language of the contracts as evidence of intent and further erred by then refusing to construe the contracts. The starting point for determining the effect of an area rate clause must be the language of the contract. The Court must consider the language of the contract, its purposes and its commercial context in order to resolve the ultimate question of contractual authorization. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 388 (citing <em>Superior Oil Co. v. Western Slope Gas Co., </em>604 F.2d 1281, 1288-89 (10th Cir.1979); <em>Chase Manhattan Bank v. First Marion Bank, </em>437 F.2d 1040, 1046 (5th Cir.1971); U.C.C. \u00a7 1-205, Official Comment 1, \u00a7 2-202 <em>&amp; </em>Official Comments 1 &amp; 2). The extrinsic evidence does not stand alone. Rather, it \u201cis relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible....\u201d <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">In the present proceedings, the Commission reversed the AU in part because the AU construed the language of the contracts. Opinion No. 181 at 61,219. In Opinion 181-A, the Commission restated its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-7\">[In Opinion 181] [t]he Commission did not hold that the contract language could not be considered as an evidentiary tool. The Commission did not hold, however, that ... because the contract language was ambiguous that it must be explained or clarified through extrinsic evidence. The contract language itself cannot be dispositive in such a situation. Thus, the Commission reversed the judge on his approach that an independent construction of the contract language was dispos-itive. The Commission did not hold that the contract language could not or should not be considered. The contract language here, however, is ambiguous and therefore must be clarified by extrinsic evidence in order to be useful in resolving this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">27 F.E.R.C. at 61,369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-11\">Read together, and as a whole, Opinions 181 and 181-A clearly require the contracting parties to establish intent <em>solely </em>by extrinsic evidence. Such a proposition flies in the face of well established contract law. Although the Commission concedes in Opinion 181-A that there is evidentiary value in the language of the agreements, the Commission\u2019s disposition of the proceeding belies that statement. The Commission\u2019s opinions fail to note the language of the contracts, which contain no limiting language, or make any attempt to construe the language in light of the extrinsic evidence. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">In fact, the Commission clearly stated that interpretation of the contracts is not the purpose of a third-party protest. In third-party protests, \u201c[t]he Commission will not construe the contract language itself to determine intent if the contract parties cannot prove their mutual intent.\u201d Opinion No. 181-A at 61,371. The Commission\u2019s position rests on two interrelated grounds. First, the Commission adopted this position because the parties made a mutual representation as to intent which was \u201cnegated by reliable and probative extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, unlike two-party protest cases in which the central issue is whether the contract authorizes NGPA rates, the central issue in a third-party protest is whether the contracting parties have proved their mutual intent, an eviden-tiary issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-13\">As noted, this Court strongly disagrees that the evidence produced by the protestors in the initial hearing before the Chief AU <em>negated </em>the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent. At most, it constituted <em>some evidence </em>that the parties in fact did not intend to authorize collection of stripper well rates. Moreover, this Court also disagrees with the Commission\u2019s basic premise that the differences between third-party protests and two-party protests<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> somehow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>relieve the Commission of its obligation to actually construe the contracts at issue in a third-party protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">As understood by this Court, and clearly indicated in <em>Pennzoil, </em>the central purpose of the hearing before the presiding AU is to determine the factual question of intent. Intent, however, is relevant only as it relates to the proper interpretation of the contracts. Once the presumption disappears, the Commission is obligated to construe the contracts to determine whether they authorize NGPA rates or not, taking into account the language of the contracts and <em>all </em>the extrinsic evidence of intent presented, including the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">As stated by this court in a somewhat different context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-7\">In interpreting an ambiguous contract, a court does not simply determine the parties\u2019 intent; it makes a legal conclusion about the meaning of the contract based on evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. The words of the contract establish a universe of reasonable interpretations; evidence of the parties\u2019 intent guides the [court] in choosing among these possible interpretations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\"><em>Carpenters Amended and Restated Health Benefit Fund v. Holleman Construction Co., </em>751 F.2d 763, 767 n.7 (5th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">In large measure, this ultimate resolution involves a fact question<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that turns on credibility determinations. The Commission must make those difficult credibility determinations and answer the factual inquiry as did the AU in this case. It is simply unacceptable for the Commission to avoid the determination by stating that the producers procedurally failed to adduce sufficient evidence to sustain their burden of proof. As a matter of law, the amount of evidence presented by the producers, <em>if believed, </em>amply demonstrated contractual authorization under the contracts. In sum, <em>Pennzoil </em>requires the Commission to resolve the factual dispute by utilizing the AU\u2019s approach, or a similar approach, which construes the language of the contracts in light of the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-12\">C. <em>Application of State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-13\">The second major inquiry in the instant case is whether the Commission properly applied state law to the contract interpretation issues presented to it in this protest proceedings. The producers assert that three aspects of the Commission\u2019s decision are contrary to relevant state law principles of contract construction. First, the producers assert that the Commission failed to properly consider evidence of a course of performance between United and its producers. Second, the producers assert that the Commission failed to find, and then apply, evidence of a usage of trade. Third, the producers contend that the August 1979 retraction letter constituted a modification of their contracts. In addition, several producers, in separate briefs to this Court, assert that the Commission failed to individually address their conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>tions that a course of performance or dealing existed between United and them, even if it did not exist between United and all producers, and that the specific actions of United in relation to their companies constituted an amendment to their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">In <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court held that \u201cspecific determinations of contractual authority in the protest procedures must take account of and follow any differences with general contract law that the appropriate state contract law may have.\u201d <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 383-84 (footnote omitted); <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). This Court held that \u201cthe appropriate contract law to apply is the law that would govern the parties\u2019 dealings were there no regulation at all of the contract\u2019s subject matter.\u201d 645 F.2d at 387 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Nevertheless, this Court noted that the Commission need not undertake an extensive choice of law analysis in each case because \u201cit is reasonable to put the burden on the parties- to inform FERC if the state law that should apply is any different from the general principles that FERC utilizes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1210-6\">Since the Uniform Commercial Code applies to natural gas sales as the sale of goods, U.C.C. \u00a7 2-107(1), and all states except Louisiana have adopted the UCC, variations between state law and general principles are likely to be few. When such differences appear, however, FERC must follow the state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1210-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-13\">Although this Court indicated that the Commission could assume that a specific state\u2019s contract law was the same as general contract principles, this Court further made clear that those general principles included the UCC. This Court did not hold that the Commission was entitled to disregard the UCC and the general principles therein and to substitute its own version of \u201cgeneral contract law\u201d for the principles enunciated in the UCC. In light of this, this Court turns to the three central concerns expressed by the producers.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-14\">1. <em>Course of Performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-15\">U.C.C. \u00a7 2-208(1) defines course of performance.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> At issue here are two questions of interpretation of the UCC: (1) whether course of performance includes performance prior to the advent of NGPA stripper well gas rates, and (2) whether it includes the period of time from April 1979 to August 1979 when the parties disagreed over whether the contracts authorized collection of stripper well gas rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-16\">The Commission asserts that there could be no course of performance relevant to stripper well rates prior to the NGPA because volumetrically based rates were not used previously. Thus, the Commission asserts that the only relevant course of performance runs from April 1979, when United stated that stripper well rates were not authorized, until the hearing.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>to the Commission, becah\u2019se United reversed its position during that time period, course of performance evidence was inconclusive and entitled to little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">The producers assert, however, that they presented evidence tending to show that United consistently paid higher rates pursuant to area rates clauses even when those rates were based on previously unused methods of calculation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Producers argue that this evidence demonstrates a course of performance in which United paid the highest rate allowed by law regardless of the criteria used to calculate those rates. Consequently, producers argue, such course of performance evidence is entitled to significant weight on the issue whether these contracts also authorized collection of stripper well rates. In addition, the producers assert that the Commission erred in considering the time period from April to August 1979 because the producers did not acquiesce in United\u2019s policy not to pay stripper well rates and, pursuant to the UCC, a course of performance can only be established by evidence that both parties accepted the performance or acquiesced in it without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">First, the Commission\u2019s view of the relevant time period is too narrow. Clearly, whether United paid higher rates based on new pricing criteria over a long time span is relevant to the question whether present contracts authorize collection of a higher rate based on yet another new criterion \u2014 the volume of production. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d 389 n. 59. Such course of performance, however, is not conclusive, and the fact that United initially did not agree to pay stripper well rates is certainly relevant as well. <em>See Paragon Resources, Inc. v. National Fuel Gas Distribution Corp., </em>695 F.2d 991, 996 (5th Cir.1983) (evidence of subjective intent properly considered when contract language ambiguous). Thus we agree with the Commission that it would be improper to disregard United\u2019s position from April to August 1979. That evidence is not, however, entitled to the same weight as course of performance evidence because the producers did not acquiesce in that policy.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Consequently, to the extent the Commission failed to follow the definition of course of performance, as that concept is applied under relevant state law and the UCC generally, the Commission erred. Of course, course of performance evidence is merely one type of evidence which the parties may present to prove their intent, and it is entitled only to that weight to which the fact finder determines it is entitled in light of all other evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">2. <em>Usage of Trade</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-12\">The Commission held that the producers presented no evidence of usage of trade. Opinion No. 181 at 61,221; Opinion No. 181-A at 61,372. Plainly, this is incorrect. Nevertheless, the Commission did not err in holding that the producers had not established, as a matter of fact, a usage of trade upon which they could rely. U.C.C. \u00a7 1-205(2) defines usage of trade as \u201cany practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Usage of trade is a question of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-13\">The Commission held that no evidence of usage of trade had been presented based on the AU\u2019s finding in that respect regarding one type of contract analyzed. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>though evidence was presented which might tend to show a usage of trade, the Commission's determination that one was not demonstrated as a matter of fact is supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s conclusion is consistent with previous decisions by it on the identical point.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">3. <em>Amendment of the Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alx\">The producers assert that under state law, particularly the UCC, a contract can be modified by the mutual agreement of the parties. Further, the producers argue that the August retraction letter constituted such an agreement. The Commission, however, asserts that there was no contract amendment because the August letter did not constitute a formal offer and there was also no formal acceptance, citing <em>Schwartz v. NMS Industries, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 925, 928-29 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1054, 96 S.Ct. 785, 46 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976). Further, the Commission asserts that the parties\u2019 course of conduct requires amendments to be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">U.C.C. \u00a7 2-204(1) provides that \u201c[a] contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 2-209(1) provides that a contract modification needs no consideration to be binding. Finally, U.C.C. \u00a7 2-208(3) provides that course of performance shall be relevant to show a modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">In <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court noted that the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct might modify the original terms of a contract. <em>Pennzoil, </em>645 F.2d at 393 n. 69. <em>See Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. FERC, </em>587 F.2d 671, 676 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative v. FPC, </em>515 F.2d 998, 1009 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 2229, 48 L.Ed.2d 832 (1976). Moreover, such a modification can occur if the buyer unconditionally pays the higher price requested by the seller, such as stripper well rates in the instant case. <em>Pennzoil </em>645 F.2d at 393 n. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">Thus, if United began to pay stripper well rates after the August retraction letter and continued to do so, such conduct would most likely constitute an amendment or modification to a contract that otherwise would not permit recovery of those higher rates. Moreover, the retraction letter alone under some states\u2019 law might constitute a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-11\">This Court, however, declines to address whether such a modification occurred in the context of the individual contracts at issue here for a number of reasons. First, it is unclear whether statutes of frauds in the various states require a writing evidencing the modification and whether the August 1979 letter would meet the requirement.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Moreover, United\u2019s course of conduct with individual producers may vary and the Commission is better suited on remand to address those differences. We note, however, that the UCC requires no \u201cformal\u201d offer and acceptance for a contract modification to be effective as between the parties. <em>Schwartz </em>is not to the contrary. <em>See supra </em>note 42 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>4. <em>Individual Arguments of the Producers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Several producers submitted individual briefs to this Court detailing evidence of a course of performance or course of dealing between United and that specific producer on which that producer is entitled to rely in attempting to establish its claim that its contract authorizes collection of stripper well rates. In addition, individual producers assert that certain actions by United amounted to a modification of their contract with United. The Commission has inadequately addressed these individual contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">In <em>Pennzoil, </em>this Court stated that \u201c[ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent is a matter of case-by-case adjudication not susceptible to considerations of uniformity such as exist in a rulemaking proceeding.\u201d 645 F.2d at 386. Moreover, \u201cidentical language in different contracts could be interpreted to have different meanings\u201d depending on the circumstances of its execution. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case the producers\u2019 individual contentions have not been adequately addressed. On remand, the Commission must consider and determine the individual contentions of the producers which were timely raised before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">The Commission misconstrued the presumption affirmed by this Court in the <em>Pennzoil </em>decision. Rather than adopting a \u201cbursting bubble\u201d theory of presumptions, the Commission viewed the rebuttal of the Order 23 presumption as completely negating the parties\u2019 assertion of mutual intent. This led the Commission to place undue weight on the protestors\u2019 rebuttal evidence and no weight on the parties\u2019 mutual interpretation. Finally, the Commission refused to consider the language of the contracts as evidence of intent and erroneously refused to construe the contracts, resting its decision instead on procedural grounds. In contrast, this Court\u2019s <em>Pennzoil </em>decision clearly requires the Commission to decide the factual question of intent so that the Commission may then determine whether the contract authorize collection of NGPA rates, the ultimate purpose of the hearing. These errors of law require that this Court remand these proceedings for reconsideration.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">Finally, this Court reiterates that the Commission is bound to apply state law principles of contract construction to its interpretation of these contracts. This applies particularly to course of performance evidence, usage of trade evidence, and evidence of contract modifications. Furthermore, as noted in <em>Pennzoil, </em>individual producers are entitled to have their particular arguments addressed on an individual basis by the Commission and in accordance with the applicable state\u2019s contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">The petitions for review are granted.

U.C.C. \u00a7 2-209(3) requires that the parties comply with the statute of frauds provision, U.C.C. \u00a7 2-201, if the contract as modified falls within its provisions. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-201 requires a writing evidencing an agreement for a sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more. Thus, it appears that a writing is required. However, the issue presented is whether the August 1979 letter, alone or in combination with the existing written contract, meets that requirement under each applicable state\u2019s law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">. This Court notes that the ALJ\u2019s approach to this mammoth proceeding was eminently reasonable and practical and that it might serve as a model on remand. Furthermore, we reiterate that the Commission failed to give the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations the weight to which they were entitled under established precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
