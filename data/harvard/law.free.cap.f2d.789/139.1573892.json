Sweet, J.) in <em>Independent Union of Flight Attendants v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>85 Civ. 7702, 620 F.Supp. 447 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (\u201cOp.\u201d) that holds that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a \u201cminor\u201d dispute involving the suspension of one Star Hesse, a flight attendant and union representative, in response to her allegedly having made false statements to the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) while reporting alleged violations by Pan American World Airways, Inc. (\u201cPan Am\u201d) of its collective bargaining agreement. We affirm that holding but express no view as to other parts of the district court\u2019s opinion and judgment, which appellant has not raised, granting in part and denying in part the Independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Union of Flight Attendants\u2019 (IUFA\u2019s) motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">IUFA is the certified representative of Pan Am flight attendants under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>which governs labor relations in the air transport industry, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 181-88. IUFA and Pan Am renewed and revised their collective bargaining agreement in March, 1985. An ongoing dispute subsequently arose involving the right of flight attendants to \u201cwalk off\u201d duty when certain delays or diversions caused their projected or elapsed on-duty time to exceed the attendants\u2019 duty day hour limitations. The company circulated a July 3 memorandum stating that the \u201cwalk off\u201d provision applies only when attendants report for duty, not when delays occur during duty already in progress. On August 1, attendants aboard Flight 55 from London to Chicago threatened to walk off duty when a flight delay in Detroit would require them to work longer than their alleged fifteen-hour duty day limit under the agreement. The FAA does not regulate the number of hours that attendants may work.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">During the dispute, Hesse was working in the IUFA office in New York. She received a telephone call from an attendant on Flight 55 regarding the dispute. She called the FAA in Washington, but received only a taped message. She then called the FAA New York district office, reported the dispute and requested an immediate on-site inspection. The New York office referred her to the Ypsilanti office, the closest to Detroit; she passed this information to the Flight 55 crew in Detroit. The attendants ultimately decided to honor their \u201cwork now, grieve later\u201d policy, and worked a total of approximately nineteen hours. The following day, Pan Am directed Hesse to report to the company regarding her complaint to the FAA. On September 3, Pan Am issued a letter suspending Hesse for thirty days for \u201cmaking false or misleading statements ... about the Company\u201d and for acting to \u201cadversely affect[ ] the Company\u2019s services and/or reputation,\u201d all in connection with the Flight 55 affair. IUFA claims that Pan Am thus violated section 152 (third and fourth) of the Railway Labor Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">The Railway Labor Act, as amended, establishes different administrative dispute resolution mechanisms for \u201cmajor disputes,\u201d which include attempts to change \u201crates of pay, rules, or working conditions not adjusted by the parties in conference,\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 155 (first) (a); \u201cminor disputes,\u201d which involve grievances over the \u201cmeaning or proper application of a particular provision\u201d in an existing collective bargaining agreement, <em>see Elgin, J. &amp; E.R. Co. v. Burley, </em>325 U.S. 711, 723 &amp; n. 16, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 1290 &amp; n. 16, 89 L.Ed. 1886 (1945) (citing legislative history); 45 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u00a7 153, and \u201crepresentation disputes,\u201d which involve controversies over the designation of union representatives, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (ninth). <em>See also Air Line Pilots Association International v. Texas International Airlines, Inc., </em>656 F.2d 16, 20 n. 6 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">While \u201cmajor disputes\u201d involve the formation of collective bargaining agreements or modifications thereof, \u201cminor disputes\u201d involve the application or interpretation of existing rights. <em>See Air Cargo Inc. v. Local Union 851, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>733 F.2d 241, 245 (2d Cir.1984). The labor-management adjustment boards, created pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184, have exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cminor disputes,\u201d which include disciplinary disputes even if involving employee discharge. <em>Andrews v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>406 U.S. 320, 322, 92 S.Ct. 1562, 1564, 32 L.Ed.2d 95 (1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The adjustment boards <em>a fortiori </em>would seem to have exclusive jurisdiction where, as here, the underlying dispute involves merely a disciplinary suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Running through Congress\u2019 exacting allocation of administrative jurisdiction is a \u201cthread\u201d of judicial intervention in cases in which, \u201c \u2018but for the general jurisdiction of the federal courts there would be no remedy to enforce the statutory commands which Congress had written into the Railway Labor Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Air Line Pilots, </em>656 F.2d at 21 (quoting <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union v. National Mediation Board, </em>320 U.S. 297, 300, 64 S.Ct. 95, 97, 88 L.Ed. 61 (1943)). Where, as here, a post-certification dispute develops concerning existing rights, that dispute would appear to arise under section 153. In such a case, the statutorily-created adjustment board procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>might nonetheless be considered ineffective, and federal judicial intervention thus warranted, only where it is clear that the employer\u2019s conduct has \u201cbeen motivated by anti-union animus or ... an attempt to interfere with its employees\u2019 choice of their collective bargaining representative,\u201d <em>Tello v. Soo Line </em>R.R., 772 F.2d 458, 462 (8th Cir.1985), or constitutes \u201cdiscrimination or coercion\u201d against that representative, <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Pan American World Airways, </em>607 F.Supp. 609, 614 n. 5 (E.D.N.Y.1985) or involves \u201cacts of intimidation [which] cannot be remedied by administrative means,\u201d <em>Local Union 808 v. P &amp; W Railroad Co., </em>576 F.Supp. 693, 703 (D.Conn.1983). In all of the above eases, federal court intervention was found unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">IUFA contends that judicial intervention in this post-certification dispute is warranted because, in its view, the suspension of Hesse was motivated by an alleged objective on Pan Am\u2019s part to destroy the effectiveness of IUFA\u2019s representation. IUFA relies principally on <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., </em>305 F.2d 605 (5th Cir.1962). In so relying, IUFA reads <em>Georgia </em>too broadly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, management did not contradict the union\u2019s allegation upon motion to dismiss that the employer had an overall scheme to destroy the effectiveness of the union representative. In contrast, the present action has progressed beyond the motion to dismiss stage. IUFA thus may not rely on bare allegations of anti-union animus, <em>see International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Northwest Airlines, </em>673 F.2d 700, 712 (3d Cir.1982), which in any event Pan Am contests. IUFA has not demonstrated that, having reviewed the evidence regarding Pan Am\u2019s alleged objectives,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court erred in finding that IUFA \u201cfailed to prove that this suspension was a predetermined effort to \u2018frustrate and undermine the effectiveness of such bargaining agent by securing his discharge for unfounded, false, or baseless charges.' \u201d Op. at 143 (quoting <em>Georgia, </em>305 F.2d at 608).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">IUFA failed to sustain its burden of proof as movant on this critical allegation. Its argument rests principally on the Flight 55 incident and the testimony of Brian Mor-eau, an IUFA officer, that Pan Am supervisors had warned him that \u201c[i]f I deal with the FAA as a union representative ... they would take appropriate action.\u201d The Flight 55 incident constitutes precisely that kind of \u201cminor\u201d dispute over existing rights that Congress intended to be adjudicated before an adjustment board. As to the Moreau testimony, we cannot say that the district court erred in apparently holding such testimony, viewed in light of the Flight 55 incident and the subsequent suspension of Star Hesse, insufficient to establish the requisite anti-union scheme. Further, there is no evidence that Pan Am has precluded Star Hesse or any other flight attendant from challenging any disciplinary action through the adjustment board procedure. Under these circumstances, we will not hold clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s findings as to Pan Am\u2019s motive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Cf. McCann v. Coughlin, </em>698 F.2d 112, 124 (2d Cir.1983) (noting \u201cparticular reluctance\u201d to overturn district court findings as to motive or intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that the disciplining of Star Hesse arose from the same administratively cognizable contractual dispute as the disciplining or discharging of flight attendants who, in instances separate from the Flight <em>55 </em>incident, abandoned duty on the basis of the union\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cduty day\u201d and \u201cwalk off\u201d provisions. Indeed, in <em>Independent Union of Flight Attendants and Star Hesse v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>84 Civ. 6485 slip op. at 9-10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 1985) <em>(\u201cStar Hesse\u201d), </em>the court dismissed a complaint alleging that Pan Am had retaliated against Hesse for exercising her statutory right to organize and communicate with fellow members. IUFA seeks to distinguish the <em>Star Hesse </em>action principally on the ground that there, Hesse had a personal stake in the underlying dispute, involving employee pension benefits, whereas here, Hesse\u2019s conduct in contacting the FAA reflected solely her role as a union representative. But Hesse has a personal and a representational stake in duty day limitations just as she has in pension benefits. Nor does the fact of Hesse\u2019s having reported to the FAA Pan Am\u2019s alleged violation of its collective bargaining agreement during the Flight 55 incident render the resultant labor dispute justiciable in federal court. <em>See Pavolini v. Bard-Air Corp., </em>645 F.2d 144, 148 (2d Cir.1981) (employee\u2019s reporting alleged violations to FAA in interest of public and employee safety not cognizable in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Since we cannot say that the district court erred in finding that IUFA failed to demonstrate that Pan Am\u2019s conduct reflected the requisite improper objective, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute involving the suspension of Star Hesse.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. Railway Labor Act Section 2 (third), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (third), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Designation of representatives.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">Representatives for the purposes of this Chapter shall be designated by the respective parties without interference, influence, or coercion by either party over the designation of representatives by the other; and neither party shall in any way interfere with, influence, or coerce the other in its choice of representatives.

Railway Labor Act Section 204, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\n<em>System, Group, or Regional Boards of Adjustment</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers by air growing out of grievances, or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, including cases pending and unadjusted on April 10, 1936 before the National Labor Relations Board, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to an appropriate adjustment board, as hereinafter provided, with a full statement of the facts and supporting data bearing upon the disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">It shall be the duty of every carrier and of its employees, acting through their representatives, selected in accordance with the provisions of sections 181 to 188 of this title, to establish a board of adjustment of jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may be lawfully exercised by system, group, or regional boards of adjustment, under the authority of section 153 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">We reject IUFA\u2019s effort to avoid Railway Labor Act statutory and case law by urging that its rights be construed with reference to the broader judicially cognizable rights created by the Labor Management Relations Act. First, such construction contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s express admonition regarding construction of the Railway Labor Act. <em>See Chicago &amp; N. W.R. Co. v. United Transportation Union, </em>402 U.S. 570, 579 n. 11, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 1736 n. 11, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971). Second, the general restriction of the scope of the Railway Labor Act to organizing and representational rights, as opposed to the broader \u201cconcerted activity\u201d rights under the Wagner Act, is clearly supported by the legislative history. <em>See, e.g., An Act to Amend the Railway Labor Act to Cover Every Common Carrier by Air Engaged in Interstate or Foreign Commerce: Hearings on S. 2496 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, </em>74th Cong., 1st Sess. 25 (1935). Finally, contrary to IUFA\u2019s contention, section 7 of the Wagner Act did not \"originate! ] in\u201d but rather was drafted and proposed to the Senate prior to the enactment of section 152 of the Railway Labor Act. <em>See An Act to Amend the Railway Labor Act: Hearings on S. 3266 before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, </em>H. Rept. No. 1944 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1934), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History of the Railway Labor Act 918, 929 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-5\">. We are particularly reluctant to extend the rationale of <em>Georgia </em>where, as here, there is not a clear showing of an overall employer objective of undermining union representation. First, even the Fifth Circuit, which decided <em>Georgia, </em>has recognized the importance of reading that decision narrowly so as not to infringe upon Congress\u2019 conferral of jurisdiction on the adjustment boards. <em>See Georgia, </em>305 F.2d at 608-09; <em>see also International Ass'n of Machinists v. Eastern Airlines, </em>320 F.2d 451 (5th Cir.1963). Second, <em>Georgia </em>preceded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Andrews, </em>which, as noted, has unequivocally construed the Railway Labor Act as conferring <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over \"minor\u201d disputes in the adjustment boards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">. This cause came on to be heard on appeal from a judgment of the district court granting in part and denying in part IUFA\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction enjoining certain incentive and disciplinary practices of Pan Am that serve as the predicate for the issue on appeal herein. Since both parties have consented to treating this appeal from a motion for preliminary injunction as a consolidated appeal from preliminary <em>and </em>permanent relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), we assume that for purposes of this appeal, IUFA rests on the evidence of Pan Am\u2019s alleged anti-union animus as presented to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
