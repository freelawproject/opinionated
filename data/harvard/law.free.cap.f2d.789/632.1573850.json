In <em>United States of America ex rel. Shako-pee Mdewakanton Sioux Community v. Little Six Enterprises, </em>No. 85-5279, Little Six Enterprises (LSE) appeals from a district court order granting summary judgment voiding LSE\u2019s management agreements. In <em>Little Six Enterprises v. Hodel, </em>No. 85-5280, LSE appeals from a district court order granting summary judgment dismissing its challenge to the Interior Department\u2019s disproval of a management agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b711-21\">On April 10,1982, the Shakopee Mdewak-anton Sioux Community (Community), a federally-recognized Indian tribe, signed a management agreement allowing defendant New England Entertainment Company (New England) to develop and run a bingo operation on tribal lands. At the time they entered into this agreement, the federal government\u2019s position was that this type of agreement did not require approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The term of the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>was to be fifteen years, and New England was to receive forty-five percent of the net operating profits after the retirement of the debt incurred in constructing and developing the facilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement also provided that if the Community elected to establish any other bingo activities on its property, New England would have the right to compel the Community to enter into a new management agreement with the same terms. In 1982, New England assigned its interest in the agreement to New England/Pan American Entertainment Company (Pan American), which in turn assigned its interests to LSE. On July 8, 1983, LSE executed a new bingo hall management agreement with the Community, with terms essentially identical to the original agreement. On October 9, 1984, LSE and the Community entered into a separate management agreement for a new bingo lounge to be operated out of the Community Cultural Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">On February 8, 1985, subsequent to a change in the Community\u2019s leadership, the Community filed a complaint in district court against LSE<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81, seeking damages, an accounting, and declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to have the management agreements held null and void. LSE filed a counterclaim seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 25, 1985, following a decision by John W. Fritz, Deputy Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, disapproving the management agreements, LSE instituted a separate action against Fritz and Donald P. Hodel, Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior, seeking judicial review of the administrative decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government filed a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tion for judgment on the pleadings, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">On July 17, 1985, the district court heard the section 81 and administrative matters in conjunction, issuing a Memorandum Opinion and Order and a Judgment on August 9, 1985, 616 F.Supp. 1200.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In regard to the section 81 action, it granted the Community\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, declaring the management agreements null and void. It denied LSE\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment and sanctions and for a stay pending the final disposition of the appeal from the administrative decision. In regard to the administrative appeal, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied LSE\u2019s motions for preliminary injunctive relief and summary judgment. LSE appeals from the district court\u2019s orders in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">In <em>United States of America ex rel. Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community v. Little Six Enterprises, </em>the section 81 action, and in <em>Little Six Enterprises v. Hodel, </em>the administrative action, LSE invokes the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 1292.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although none of the parties argue this Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction, we must consider the issue on our own motion where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>question exists. <em>See Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 740, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1204, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976); <em>Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Michigan Railway Co. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379, 382, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Section 1291 confers jurisdiction on the Courts of Appeals over \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d \u201cA \u2018final decision\u2019 generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). The district court\u2019s order in the section 81 action granting the Community\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and declaring the management agreements void did not resolve the Community\u2019s claims for damages, an accounting, and injunctive relief. It also failed to resolve LSE\u2019s counterclaims. Additionally, the district court did not \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Accordingly, in the section 81 matter, LSE is appealing from an interlocutory order, and this Court has no jurisdiction pursuant to section 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Although this Court has jurisdiction over certain interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, this section does not apply in the section 81 appeal. In their supplemental letter briefs, the Community and LSE argue that this Court should take jurisdiction pursuant to section 1292(a)(1), which confers jurisdiction over interlocutory orders \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.\u201d As the Community admits, however, the district court\u2019s order technically did not grant an injunction, but merely declared the management agreements to be null and void. LSE points out that the Community\u2019s motion for summary judgment requested a permanent injunction pursuant to section 81. The district court, however, stopped short of granting the full relief requested. Additionally, the district court\u2019s order indicated that its intent was only to declare the agreements void. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion and Order at 3, 42. Because this Court has no jurisdiction over the section 81 action under either section 1291 or section 1292, we must dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Although there was a final decision in the administrative appeal action, the appeal must be dismissed as premature. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the administrative appeal action based on its finding in the section 81 action that the agreements were null and void. Logically, therefore, the question whether the management agreements fall under section 81 must be fully decided before the question whether the government properly reviewed and disapproved the agreements pursuant to that section can be considered. Since the section 81 action has not yet been fully decided, we must dismiss this appeal as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Accordingly, the appeal from the district court\u2019s order in the section 81 action is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and the appeal from the district court\u2019s order in the administrative appeal action is dismissed as premature. These dismissals are without prejudice. If subsequent appeals are taken on these matters, they shall be submitted to this panel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\">. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">No agreement shall be made by any person with any tribe of Indians, or individual Indians not citizens of the United States, for the payment or delivery of any money or other thing of value, in present or in prospective, or for the granting or procuring any privilege to him, or any other person in consideration of services for said Indians relative to their lands, or to any claims growing out of, or in reference to, annuities, installments, or other moneys, claims, demands, or thing, under laws or treaties with the United States, or official acts of any officers thereof, or in any way connected with or due from the United States, unless such contract or agreement be executed and approved as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-23\">First.
