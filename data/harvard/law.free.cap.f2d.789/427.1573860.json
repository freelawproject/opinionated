Fink and Karla S. Fink (\u201ctaxpayers\u201d) appeal from a decision of the United States Tax Court determining deficiencies in taxpayers\u2019 federal income taxes for 1976 and 1977. The taxpayers claimed that their non-pro rata surrender of stock to the issuing corporation entitled them to an ordinary loss under section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165. The Tax Court held that a non-pro rata surrender of shares to the issuing corporation to improve its financial position is not an event that permits the recognition of loss and constitutes, instead, a contribution to the corporation\u2019s capital. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Taxpayers were the principal stockholders of Travco Corporation. Throughout the 1970\u2019s, the largest part of Travco\u2019s business involved the manufacture and sale of motor homes, recreational vehicles, and their component parts. The energy crisis of 1973 and 1974 caused a decline in the market for motor homes and recreational vehicles, resulting in a decline in earnings and a weakening of Travco\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">At the time of the energy crisis and following, Travco enjoyed a line of credit with Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit of $3,000,000 to $3,400,000. Because of Travco\u2019s weakened financial condition, Manufacturers National became concerned about Travco\u2019s ability to repay its borrowings. During 1976 Manufacturers National put pressure for repayment upon Travco. Travco\u2019s attempts to obtain new capital were unsuccessful, and late in 1976 Travco entered into negotiations with a new lender, City National Bank of Detroit. As a condition of extending credit, City National required Travco to obtain $900,000 of new capital, $700,000 of equity and $200,000 of subordinated debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On December 22, 1976, Mr. Fink surrendered to Travco 116,146 shares of Travco\u2019s common stock having a total basis of $197,-781.64. Mrs. Fink surrendered to Travco 80,000 shares of Travco common stock having a total basis of $191,257.61. No other shareholders surrendered any shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The purpose of the stock surrender was to improve Travco\u2019s financial position, to preserve its business, and to increase the attractiveness of the corporation to outside investors. The number of shares surrendered to the corporation was calculated to reduce the number of outstanding shares below 1.4 million and thus allow a new investor to acquire control of Travco by investing $700,000 in new $1.00 par value preferred stock convertible into 1.4 million shares of TraVco common.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Prior to offering the new preferred stock to Travco\u2019s shareholders, Travco\u2019s directors passed a resolution authorizing the issuance of preferred stock to Mr. Fink, Mrs. Fink and Elise Fink (Mr. Fink\u2019s mother), if the other shareholders declined the offer. On February 25, 1977, after being unable to sell the stock to other persons, Travco sold $700,000 of its convertible preferred stock to Mr. and Mrs. Peter R. Fink and Elise M. Fink, and $200,000 of subordinated indebtedness to the same stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On their 1976 joint return, taxpayers claimed an ordinary loss of $197,781.64, representing the basis of the 116,146 shares of Travco stock surrendered by Mr. Fink. On their 1977 joint return, taxpayers claimed as a miscellaneous deduction an ordinary loss of $191,257.61, representing the basis of the 80,000 shares of Travco stock that Mrs. Fink surrendered to the corporation. The Commissioner disallowed the claimed deductions, and the Tax Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">In the Tax Court, the taxpayers relied on a long line of cases, culminating in <em>Smith v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 622 (1976), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Schleppy v. Commissioner, </em>601 F.2d 196 (5th Cir.1979), holding that a shareholder\u2019s non-pro rata surrender of stock to the issuing corporation results in an immediate ordinary loss. Following the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reversal of <em>Smith </em>in <em>Schlep-py, </em>the Tax Court, in <em>Frantz v. Commissioner, </em>83 T.C. 162 (1984), <em>affd, </em>784 F.2d 119 (2d Cir.1986), overruled its prior line of cases and held that a non-pro rata stock surrender should be treated as a non-deductible contribution to capital. In the instant case, the Tax Court held in favor of the Commissioner on the basis of <em>Frantz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">In <em>Frantz, </em>the taxpayer owned 65% of the common stock and 13% of the preferred stock of Andree Biallot, Ltd. (\u201cABL\u201d). In an effort to attract outside investors, the taxpayer contributed to the corporation his ABL preferred stock and his notes and accounts receivable representing debts owed him by ABL. This transfer was made without a proportionate surrender by other stockholders. Taxpayer claimed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ordinary loss deduction in the amount of the basis in the stock. The Commissioner disallowed the loss, and the Tax Court affirmed. <em>Frantz </em>held that a non-pro rata surrender of shares to the issuing corporation to improve its financial position should be characterized as a contribution to capital resulting in the basis of the surrendered shares being added to the basis of the shares retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In <em>Frantz </em>the Tax Court determined the crucial question to be \u201cwhether the surrender constitutes a loss \u2018incurred in any transaction entered into for profit\u2019 within the meaning of section 165(c)(2).\u201d 83 T.C. at 179. The Tax Court recognized that resolution of this issue required it to decide which of two competing views of stock ownership was applicable to this situation. Under the <em>\u201cfragmented view\u201d </em>of stock ownership each share of stock is considered a separate investment. A shareholder who surrenders shares to the issuing corporation is considered to have finally disposed of the particular shares surrendered. The surrender of the shares closes the transaction, and the shareholder is entitled to an immediate ordinary loss. <em>See Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 180. Under the <em>\u201cunitary view\u201d </em>of stock ownership the \u201cstockholder\u2019s entire investment is viewed as a single indivisible property unit.\u201d <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 188 (Parker, J., dissenting). The surrendering shareholder is recognized as having surrendered stock for the benefit of stock retained. The transaction remains open, and the surrendering shareholder must add the basis of the surrendered shares to the basis of the stock retained. <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Frantz </em>adopted the <em>\u201cunitary view\u201d </em>of stock ownership and concluded that the stock surrender did not constitute a loss event under section 165(c)(2) because there was no \u201cclosed transaction.\u201d According to <em>Frantz, </em>a non-pro rata stock surrender constitutes an open, non-taxable transaction in the nature of a capital contribution. Thus, whether the taxpayer suffered a recognizable loss could not be determined until there was a disposition of the retained shares. The Tax Court stated its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">This conclusion ... necessarily follows from a recognition of the purpose of the transfer, that is to bolster the financial position of [the issuing corporation] and, hence, to protect and make more valuable petitioner\u2019s retained shares, and a consequent inability to fit the transaction within the statutory language authorizing a deduction for \u201closses incurred in any transaction entered into for profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abr\">83 T.C. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Relying on <em>Schleppy, </em>the Second Circuit affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Frantz. Frantz v. Commissioner, </em>784 F.2d 119 (2d Cir.1986). The court upheld treatment of the taxpayer\u2019s non-pro rata surrender as a non-deductible capital expenditure \u201c[b]ecause the overall change in the taxpayer\u2019s interest in [the corporation] was miniscule compared with the taxpayer\u2019s retained interest in the company.\u201d <em>Frantz, </em>at 125. The court, however, cautioned that its holding \u201cshould not be construed as governing surrenders by a stockholder of more substantial equity interests that could truly be viewed as resulting in an immediate loss.\u201d <em>Frantz, </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Prior to <em>Frantz, </em>the Tax Court consistently held that non-pro rata stock surrenders gave rise to an immediate ordinary loss. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 622, 650 (1976); <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Schleppy v. Commissioner, </em>601 F.2d 196 (5th Cir.1979); <em>J.K. Downer v. Commissioner, </em>48 T.C. 86, 91 (1967); <em>Estate of Foster v. Commissioner, </em>9 T.C. 930, 934 (1947); <em>Miller v. Commissioner, </em>45 B.T.A. 292, 299 (1941). In <em>Foster </em>the Tax Court stated the general rule that \u201cwhen a stockholder surrenders part of his stock to improve the financial condition of the corporation he sustains a deductible loss, measured by the basis of the stock surrendered, less the resulting improvement in the value of the stock retained.\u201d 9 T.C. at 934. In <em>Downer </em>the Tax Court held that a taxpayer\u2019s transfer of a portion of his stock to an employee of the corporation for the purpose of inducing the employee to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>services to the corporation resulted in an immediate deductible loss. 48 T.C. at 91. The decisions in <em>Downer </em>and <em>Foster </em>were premised on the <em>\u201cfragmented view\u201d </em>of stock ownership and both decisions explicitly refused to characterize the transfers as contributions to capital. <em>Downer, </em>48 T.C. at 91; <em>Foster, </em>9 T.C. at 934. In <em>Smith </em>the Tax Court reaffirmed its holdings in <em>Foster </em>and <em>Downer. </em>The Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">It is well established that where a stockholder of a corporation surrenders some of his stock holdings to such corporation without consideration and such transfer results in a change of his proportionate ownership interest in that corporation, the stockholder is not treated as having made a contribution to capital but realizes any loss occasioned upon the surrender of such shares.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">66 T.C. at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In overruling its prior cases, the Tax Court relied on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Schleppy v. Commissioner, </em>601 F.2d 196 (5th Cir.1979), <em>rev\u2019g Smith v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 622 (1976), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Tilford v. Commissioner, </em>705 F.2d 828 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 485, 78 L.Ed.2d 681 (1983). In <em>Tilford </em>the shareholder of a corporation transferred stock to employees for the purpose of inducing them to accept or continue employment. The Commissioner disallowed the claimed capital loss deductions and treated the transfers as capital contributions under Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d). Section 83(h) of the Code provides that in the event of a transfer of property which is subject to section 83, \u201cthere shall be allowed as a deduction under section 162, to the person for whom were performed the services in connection with which such property was transferred____\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">If a shareholder of a corporation transfers property to an employee ... in consideration of services performed for the corporation, the transaction shall be considered to be a contribution of such property to the capital of such corporation by the shareholder, and immediately thereafter a transfer of such property by the corporation to the employee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Unlike the instant case, the sole issue in <em>Tilford </em>was the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of section 83(h) as set forth in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d). Resolution of the issue hinged upon language found in the report of the Senate Finance Committee on the Tax Reform Act of 1960:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">In general, where a parent company\u2019s or a shareholder's stock is used to compensate employees under a restricted stock plan, the transfer of stock by the parent company or the shareholder is to be treated as a capital contribution to the company which is to be entitled to a deduction in accordance with the restricted property rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The Tax Court concluded that section 83(h) was an income provision and that it did not address itself to the tax consequences to a stockholder who provides shares used in a restricted stock plan. Therefore, the Tax Court found Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d) outside the intended scope of the legislation. We, however, reversed the Tax Court and found Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d) consistent with the stated legislative purpose of section 83(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">In <em>Schleppy, </em>the Fifth Circuit reversed the Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith </em>and held that the non-pro rata surrender of stock to improve the financial condition of the corporation did not result in an immediate ordinary loss to the taxpayers. The court concluded that the basis of the taxpayers in the shares surrendered should be added to their basis in their remaining shares. 601 F.2d at 199. <em>Schleppy </em>found that there was no loss \u201c \u2018incurred in any transaction entered into for profit\u2019 \u201d recognizable under section 165(c)(2). 601 F.2d at 199. <em>Schleppy </em>observed that \u201cvoluntary payments by a stockholder to his corporation in order to bolster its financial position cannot be claimed as a loss.\u201d 601 F.2d at 197. The court then wrote that it perceived no distinction between a shareholder paying cash to the corporation and a shareholder surrendering part of his shares to bolster the financial health of the corporation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The court in <em>Schleppy </em>criticized the Tax Court\u2019s reliance on the decisions in <em>Foster </em>and <em>Downer. Schleppy </em>interpreted <em>Foster </em>as holding that a shareholder\u2019s non-pro rata surrender of shares to the issuing corporation requires the basis of the surrendered shares to be added to the basis of the stock retained. 601 F.2d at 198. <em>Schleppy </em>distinguished <em>Downer </em>as involving a stock transfer to a third party and as requiring recognition of a loss where the surrender results in a significant reduction in the shareholder\u2019s percentage of ownership in the corporation. <em>Id. </em>The shareholder\u2019s ownership in <em>Downer </em>decreased from 66.67 percent of the shares to just over 50 percent, whereas in <em>Smith </em>the shareholder\u2019s ownership decreased from 70.12 percent to 68.57 percent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In further support of its adoption of the <em>\u201cunitary view, \u2019\u2019Frantz </em>suggested that the transaction entered into for profit began when the shares were surrendered. The Tax Court asserted that the profit sought was the increase in the value of the taxpayer\u2019s remaining stock investment. 83 T.C. at 181. Because it could not be determined whether the stock surrender would decrease or increase the value of the overall investment until the retained shares were disposed of, <em>Frantz </em>concluded that the transaction was not closed and that the taxpayer had realized no loss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\"><em>Frantz </em>also noted that its prior position would encourage \u201cconversion of eventual capital losses into immediate ordinary losses.\u201d Section 165(g) provides that a security which becomes worthless during the taxable year will be treated as a loss from the \u201csale or exchange\u201d on the last day of the taxable year. <em>Frantz </em>reasoned that a shareholder in a corporation on the verge of failure could avoid the section 165(g) limitations by surrendering the stock before it became valueless. 83 T.C. at 182. The Tax Court concluded that if its prior position were permitted to stand, the result would be \u201cthe practical equivalent of a judicial repeal of section 165(g).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The Tax Court\u2019s \u201copen transaction analysis\u201d in <em>Frantz </em>is analytically sound only if we adopt a <em>\u201cunitary view\u201d </em>of stock ownership. 83 T.C. at 188 (Parker, <em>J., </em>dissenting). However, this court, like the Tax Court, has previously adhered to the <em>\u201cfragmented view\u201d </em>of stock ownership in determining the basis of stock sold or exchanged. <em>See Curtis v. United States, </em>336 F.2d 714 (6th Cir.1964); <em>Leake v. Commissioner, </em>140 F.2d 451 (6th Cir.1944), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 U.S. 722, 65 S.Ct. 54, 89 L.Ed. 580 (1944). In <em>Leake </em>this court stated: \u201cFairness to both the taxpayer and the Government requires the allocation of cost on a share basis, and the cost deducted from each share as sold for the purpose of determining gain or loss.\u201d <em>Leake, </em>140 F.2d at 453. Moreover, the tax law generally reflects a \u201cfractional, divisible view of property, seeking to allocate basis and recognize gain or loss immediately when a larger part of the property is disposed of.\u201d <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 189 (Parker, J., dissenting). <em>See also </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.61-6(a) (1960); <em>Byram v. Commissioner, </em>555 F.2d 1234, 1235 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Fasken v. Commissioner, </em>71 T.C. 650, 655-57 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">We do not believe that the facts of the instant case present sufficient justification for abandoning the <em>\u201cfragmented view\u201d </em>of stock ownership, a principle firmly rooted in the tax law and in this court\u2019s decisions. Each share of stock represents a permanent proprietary ownership or equity interest in the corporation. B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, <em>Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders, </em>\u00b6 14.31 (4th ed. 1979). The holder is entitled to a variety of rights, such as the right to receive dividends, the right to share in corporate assets on dissolution, and the right to vote on corporate matters. <em>Id. </em>With a non-pro rata surrender of stock, these rights are relinquished, and the shareholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest is reduced. <em>Downer, </em>48 T.C. at 91; <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 189 (Parker, J., dissenting). Consequently, the surrendering shareholder suffers an immediate loss. The shareholder will enjoy a smaller share of any future increase in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>corporate value. Moreover, any future income the shares would have earned through dividends or on liquidation is lost. The shareholder has incurred an economic loss that will not be fully accounted for by the increased basis of the retained stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Under the <em>\u201cunitary view,\u201d </em>a non-pro rata surrender can only result in an ascertainable gain or loss when the stockholder has disposed of his remaining shares. Under this analysis, a shareholder who disposes of his shares at a gain, to enhance the value of his remaining stock investment, must postpone his recognition of that gain by reducing his basis in the remaining shares. He cannot have a cognizable gain because his disposition does not result in a \u201cclosed transaction.\u201d In light of the potential for abuse, it is doubtful that Congress would be willing to indefinitely delay recognition of gain on such a transfer. <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 188. (Parker, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The Second Circuit in <em>Frantz </em>and the Fifth Circuit in <em>Schleppy </em>adopted the \u201cunitary view\u201d of stock ownership because the shareholders incurred only a minimal reduction in their percentage of ownership as a result of the surrender. The courts speculated that the shareholders\u2019 net equity positions would not be substantially reduced after taking into account the increased value of the retained shares. <em>Frantz, </em>at 124; <em>Schleppy, </em>601 F.2d at 198. However, both courts indicated their willingness to allow an immediate ordinary loss where the surrender results in an impact of some undefined magnitude on the shareholders\u2019 interest in the corporation. <em>Frantz, </em>at 125; <em>Schleppy, </em>601 F.2d at 198. This reasoning addresses the size of the loss, not the question of recognition, and implicitly recognizes that the value of the surrendered shares may not be fully absorbed by the retained shares. Moreover, this approach fosters uncertainty and will produce \u201cmuch future litigation over the magnitude of impact of particular surrenders of stock.\u201d <em>Frantz, </em>at 127 (Winter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Adoption of the <em>\u201cunitary view\u201d </em>is not supported by the suggestion by the Tax Court in <em>Frantz </em>and by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Schleppy </em>that the transaction entered into for profit began when the shares were surrendered, not when the shares were originally purchased. This reasoning ignores the well-settled principle that the profit, objective for purposes of section 165(c)(2) is determined when the property is acquired. <em>See </em>B. Bittker, <em>Federal Taxation of Income, Estates and Gifts, </em>\u00b6 25.3 (1981). Judge Parker, dissenting in <em>Frantz, </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">Generally, the requisite profit objective for dealings in property is established (or not established) when the property is acquired. [citation omitted] The discussion of the taxpayer\u2019s reasons for surrendering the stock \u2014 enhancing the value of the corporation and hence the value of his remaining shares \u2014 is to negate the Government\u2019s argument that the surrender was a gift, [citation omitted] Once the taxpayer has disproved [the Commissioner\u2019s] claim that the stock surrender was for personal ... reasons, the profit objective of his initial stock acquisition characterizes its disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">83 T.C. at 190. If the courts in <em>Schleppy </em>and in <em>Frantz </em>had followed the well-established <em>\u201cfragmented view, </em>\u201d the transactions would have been closed at the time of the surrender and would have fit squarely within section 165(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">While we share in the Tax Court\u2019s concern for the prevention of sham transactions, we do not believe that our continued adherence to the <em>\u201cfragmented view\u201d </em>will effectively nullify section 165(g). As Judge Parker noted, the judiciary has developed numerous tests for tax evasion that can be applied to a stock surrender. <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 192. The traditional tax common- law doctrines, such as substance over form, sham transaction, step transaction and the business purpose rule, are sufficient to prevent any abuses that arise. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove the \u201cbona fides\u201d of the stock surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Neither the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Schleppy </em>nor this court\u2019s decision in <em>Til-ford </em>requires abandonment of the <em>\u201cfrag-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>merited, view\u201d </em>of stock ownership. With respect to <em>Schleppy, </em>it is our view that <em>Foster </em>cannot be relied on for the proposition that a stock surrender requires the basis of the retained stock to be increased by the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the surrendered shares. In <em>Frantz </em>the majority and the dissent rejected <em>Schleppy\u2019s </em>interpretation of the decision in <em>Foster. </em>83 T.C. at 176 n. 11, 190. We, like the Tax Court, read <em>Foster </em>as holding that the taxpayer was allowed an immediate loss measured by the basis of the stock surrendered less any resulting increase in the value of the stock retained. 9 T.C. at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Furthermore, we do not believe that <em>Downer </em>can be distinguished as involving a transfer to third parties rather than a surrender to the corporation. In our view, the fundamental issue in both the third-party transfer cases and in the direct surrender cases is whether either .type of transfer constitutes a closed transaction that results in a recognizable loss. The difference between a transfer for consideration and a direct surrender is relevant only for purposes of characterizing the resulting gain or loss. <em>Frantz, </em>83 T.C. at 191 (Parker, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Nor do we believe that the situation where a shareholder surrenders shares is indistinguishable from the circumstance where a shareholder gives cash or property to the corporation. When cash or property is given to the corporation, the corporation\u2019s capital is increased by the value of the property contributed. A true capital contribution represents an additional price paid for the stock. <em>See </em>B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, <em>Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders, </em>113.14 (4th ed. 1979). The taxpayer\u2019s proportionate interest in the corporation remains unchanged and \u201cthe contribution will be reflected in an increased basis for his stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A non-pro rata stock surrender does not, however, represent an additional price paid for the stock. When a shareholder makes a non-pro rata surrender, corporate capital is not increased but the shareholder\u2019s proportionate percentage of ownership is reduced. <em>Smith, </em>66 T.C. at 647; <em>Downer, </em>48 T.C. at 91. As Judge Parker observed, we cannot disregard \u201cthe fact that a cash contribution does not change the shareholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest in corporation vis-a-vis the other shareholders whereas the non-pro rata surrender of shares does.\u201d 83 T.C. at 191 (Parker, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Our decision in <em>Tilford </em>is only applicable to section 83 transfers of property in connection with the performance of services. By enacting section 83, Congress altered the result reached in <em>Downer. </em>The legislative history of section 83 makes it clear that Congress intended to treat the transfer of stock by a shareholder to a corporate employee as a contribution of capital. Congress has not, however, altered the result reached in <em>Foster. </em>Congress is presumed to be aware of settled judicial construction and thus adopts that construction unless it affirmatively acts to change it. <em>See, e.g., Florida National Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>699 F.2d 1082, 1087 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1007, 104 S.Ct. 524, 78 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). We therefore conclude that Congress intended the shareholder who engages in a non-pro rata stock surrender to have the benefit of an immediate loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">For the reasons stated, we REVERSE the decision of the Tax Court and REMAND for a determination of whether the surrender of the stock by the taxpayers resulted in an increase in the value of their remaining shares. Barring such a finding, taxpayers are entitled to an ordinary loss deduction for the full amount of their basis in the surrendered shares.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-11\">JOINER, Senior District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, for I would affirm the decision of the Tax Court. The opinions of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Schleppy v. Commissioner, </em>601 F.2d 196 (5th Cir.1979), of the Second Circuit in <em>Frantz v. Commissioner, </em>784 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>119 (2d Cir.1986), and of this court in <em>Tilford v. Commissioner, 705 </em>F.2d 828 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 485, 78 L.Ed.2d 681 (1983), support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As indicated by the majority, <em>Schleppy </em>characterized two majority shareholders\u2019 non-pro rata surrender of slightly less than two percent of their stock to the issuing corporation as a non-deductible contribution to capital, rather than a deductible loss. The taxpayers\u2019 basis in the surrendered shares was therefore added to their basis in the remaining shares. 601 F.2d at 199. The court noted that a voluntary payment of cash to the corporation to bolster its financial position is considered a contribution to capital. The court found it \u201cdifficult to perceive why any distinction should arise if, instead of paying cash to the corporation, the shareholder surrenders part of his shares to bolster the corporation\u2019s financial health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. The Fifth Circuit then held that, in any event, the taxpayers had not demonstrated that they had suffered a genuine loss because of the surrender. The court observed that the taxpayers retained over 68% of the outstanding shares, thereby retaining corporate control while surrendering only a very small part of their holdings to improve the corporation\u2019s financial position. <em>Id. </em>at 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In its recent opinion in the <em>Frantz </em>case, the Second Circuit held that the taxpayer\u2019s non-pro rata stock surrender to a closely-held corporation, made to enhance the value of the taxpayer\u2019s continuing investment by improving the company\u2019s financial condition, was a contribution to capital rather than an ordinary loss. The taxpayer had surrendered his nonvoting preferred stock, but retained control of the corporation by continuing to hold 65% of the voting common stock. In deciding that the taxpayer had made a capital contribution, the Second Circuit emphasized that the stock surrender had not substantially reduced the taxpayer\u2019s net equity in the corporation. \u201cBecause the overall change in the taxpayer\u2019s interest in ABL was miniscule compared with the taxpayer\u2019s retained interest in the company, no justification exists for treating the change in value as a capital loss, much less as an ordinary one.\u201d At 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">As in the <em>Schleppy </em>and <em>Frantz </em>cases, the taxpayers here reduced their corporate ownership only slightly, in this case from 72% to 68%, and maintained their corporate control. Because the taxpayers\u2019 stock surrender left them in substantially the same position that they previously held, they have not suffered any sort of meaningful loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In <em>Tilford, </em>this court held that a taxpayer who sold stock at a loss to corporation employees to induce them to accept or continue employment made a capital contribution to the corporation, rather than suffered a deductible loss. <em>Tilford </em>found that Congress, by enacting Internal Revenue Code section 83, indicated that it viewed the transaction in two parts: the taxpayer\u2019s contribution of capital to the corporation, and the corporation\u2019s subsequent transfer of the stock as compensation to the employees. The majority distinguishes <em>Tilford </em>from the present case, stating that it merely affirms the validity of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(d) as an interpretation of section 83. While <em>Tilford </em>relies on these provisions in reaching its conclusion, the opinion suggests that its holding should be accorded a broader meaning. It states that the reasoning of the <em>Schleppy </em>opinion \u201cfurther explicate^]\u201d its conclusion. 705 F.2d at 831. <em>Tilford </em>also finds its result consistent with early Supreme Court tax cases holding that a shareholder cannot deduct payments made for the benefit of his corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 830 (citing <em>Deputy v. Du Pont, </em>308 U.S. 488, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940) and <em>Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, </em>319 U.S. 590, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 87 L.Ed. 1607 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Til-ford </em>from the present case presents a further difficulty. The majority\u2019s approach accords different tax treatment to a shareholder\u2019s transfer of stock to a third party for the benefit of the corporation, and a shareholder\u2019s direct surrender of stock to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the corporation for the same purpose. It makes little theoretical sense to distinguish between these two transactions. In both cases, the shareholder parts with stock to protect or enhance the value of his remaining investment. Both transactions are best viewed as a contribution to capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The majority relies heavily on its perceived need to apply the \u201cfragmented view\u201d of stock ownership to the present case. It views each share of stock as a separate investment. The majority holds that the taxpayers are entitled to recognize immediate gains or losses when surrendering shares to the issuing corporation, as the taxpayers have finally disposed of the particular shares surrendered. Whatever validity the \u201cfragmented view\u201d may have outside of the present context, it should not be applied here. Each share cannot validly be regarded as a separate investment that is separately terminated, when the taxpayers\u2019 sole motivation in disposing of certain shares is to benefit the other shares they hold. The taxpayers surrendered their shares only because their action affected the value of other shares, making a continuing investment in the corporation feasible. Viewing the surrender of each share as the termination of an individual investment ignores the very reason for the surrender itself. Particularly in cases such as this, where the diminution in the shareholder\u2019s corporate control and equity interest is so minute as to be illusory, the stock surrender should be regarded as a contribution to capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
