Rowland maintains that the filing of such a bond does not constitute the making of \u201cfalse, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations\u201d or the making or using of \u201cany false writing or document\u201d in the course of \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\u201d He contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>plicable because a bankruptcy proceeding is a private civil action and the false document was filed in a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d Concluding and holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 applies to Rowland\u2019s conduct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Rowland and three of his \u201ccompanies\u201d were debtors in four petitions pending before the bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Mississippi. The four proceedings were consolidated under the administration of a trustee who sought court authority for the public sale of certain assets of the debtors. Based on an agreement between the trustee and debtors, the bankruptcy court authorized the trustee to lease to the debtors for a fixed period of time, various assets of the debtors\u2019 estates for a per diem rental of $250. The court\u2019s order was conditioned on the debtors\u2019 posting of a performance bond guaranteeing the payment of the daily rental. Rowland timely filed a fraudulent bond, the subject of the instant indictment. The bond was signed by Rowland, individually and as representative of the two debtor corporations and the debtor partnership, as principals. The bond was purportedly executed by Travelers Indemnity Company as surety, but the signature of Travelers\u2019 attorney-in-fact was a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Rowland secured possession of the assets, subsequently dissipated to the detriment of the creditors, but defaulted in rental payments. When the trustee called upon the surety for performance, the falsity of the bond was disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Rowland was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by filing the false performance bond. He unsuccessfully sought dismissal of the indictment and then entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to a written plea bargain agreement. He was sentenced to prison for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">Although we address a question of first impression in this circuit, we find ample statutory and jurisprudential guidance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We begin with the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-11\">Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">The clauses which require discussion are: \u201cmatter within the jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cdepartment or agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">Sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>501 F.2d 943, 946 (5th Cir.1974), we rejected \u201ca narrowing construction of the \u00a7 1001 phrase \u2018matter within the jurisdiction\u2019 of a federal agency.\u201d Instead we concluded: \u201cWe are bound, however, to give that language a broad, nontechnical meaning. <em>See Bryson v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 64, 70, 90 S.Ct. 355, 359, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969) [declaring that \u201cthe term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 should not be given a narrow or technical meaning for purposes of \u00a7 1001\u201d]; <em>United States v. Bramblett, </em>348 U.S. 503, 75 S.Ct. 504, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955).\u201d Citing <em>Bryson </em>and <em>Bramblett, </em>the Eleventh Circuit observed in <em>United States v. Fern, </em>696 F.2d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 1983): \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 1001 is clearly to protect the Government from fraud and deceit. The reach of the statute covers all materially false statements ... made to any branch of the Government. ... Moreover, the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 should not be given a narrow or technical meaning for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 1001.\u201d We hold that the instant filing of a false bond comes within the reach of the \u201cmatter within the jurisdiction\u201d clause of \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Is the bankruptcy court to be considered a department or agency of the United States? In <em>Bramblett </em>a former member of Congress was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 with making false statements to the Disbursing Office of the House of Representatives. The defendant argued that the Disbursing Office was not a department or agency within the meaning of the statute, which he maintained applied only to the executive branch. After a detailed discussion of the history of \u00a7 1001 and its predecessor-statutes, the Supreme Court observed: \u201cThe context in which this language is used calls for an unrestricted interpretation____ \u2018[department,\u2019 as used in this context, was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government.\u201d 348 U.S. at 509, 75 S.Ct. at 508. The judicial branch, which includes the bankruptcy courts, is a department of the United States within the in-tendment of \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">As the cases involving false statements made to the judicial department occurred, refinements and exceptions were articulated by the courts of appeals. For our purposes today, the next significant development after <em>Bramblett </em>was the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Morgan v. United States, </em>309 F.2d 234 (D.C. Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U.S. 917, 83 S.Ct. 1306, 10 L.Ed.2d 416 (1963), involving a defendant who falsely held himself out as an attorney and practiced before the courts in the District of Columbia. In holding \u00a7 1001 applicable to the defendant\u2019s \u201cconcealing his name, identity, and non-admission to the bar,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 235, the D.C. Circuit opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-9\">We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms \u201cconceals or covers up.\u201d We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201chousekeeping\u201d functions, not the \u201cjudicial\u201d machinery of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbcA\"><em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">We first considered the application of \u00a7 1001 to the making of false statements in a judicial proceeding in <em>United States v. Abrahams, </em>604 F.2d 386 (5th Cir.1979). Abrahams had been convicted of violating \u00a7 1001 by falsely advising a federal magistrate, during a Fed.R.Crim.P. 40(b) removal proceeding and bail hearing, that he had never used any other name and had no prior convictions. Both statements proved false. We held that removal proceedings and bail hearings were judicial proceedings. Then, adopting the <em>Morgan </em>exception, followed in <em>United States v. Erhardt, </em>381 F.2d 173 (6th Cir.1967), we held \u201cthat 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is not a proper basis for charging a defendant with making a false statement in a judicial proceeding.\u201d 604 F.2d at 393. We further reflected on our earlier adoption of the so-called \u201cexculpatory no\u201d exception to the applicability of \u00a7 1001. Quoting <em>Paternostro v. United States, </em>311 F.2d 298, 309 (5th Cir.1962), we noted that mere negative responses, \u201cthe \u2018exculpatory no\u2019 answer without any affirmative, aggressive or overt misstatement on the part of the defendant does not come within the scope of ... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\u201d 604 F.2d at 394. We concluded that the \u201cexculpatory no\u201d exception rendered \u00a7 1001 inapplicable to Abrahams\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\"><em>Abrahams </em>is of precedential value in our present quest because of its general endorsement of the <em>Morgan </em>holding. In addition to our circuit and the Sixth Circuit, <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>distinction between the adjudicative and administrative functions has been cited with approval by the Ninth Circuit, <em>United States v. Mayer, </em>775 F.2d 1387 (9th Cir.1985), and the Second Circuit, <em>United States v. D\u2019Amato, </em>507 F.2d 26 (2d Cir. 1974). In reviewing developments since <em>Bramblett, </em>the <em>Mayer </em>court pointedly noted that the Supreme Court in <em>Bramblett </em>\u201cdid not suggest that any exception existed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>for a false statement or document offered in the course of a judicial proceeding and did not suggest any rationale for setting the boundaries of such an exception.\u201d 775 F.2d at 1389. Nonetheless, the first appearance of the \u201cadjudicative function\u201d exception soon followed <em>Bramblett, </em>and because in the intervening two decades plus \u201cthere ha[d] been no response on the part of Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it,\u201d it would appear \u201ctoo late in the day to hold that no exception exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1390. While agreeing with that observation, we are cognizant that the Supreme Court has signaled what might be taken as a caution to the <em>Morgan </em>-initiated thrust, stating, after noting the cases: \u201cWe express no opinion on the validity of this line of cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. 475, 483 n. 4, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 1948 n. 4, 80 L.Ed.2d 492, 500 n. 4 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">The <em>Morgan </em>court found a \u00a7 1001 violation by the defendant who misrepresented that he was an attorney as a prelude to practicing before the court. In <em>Erhardt </em>the statute was found inapplicable to the filing in evidence of a false document. <em>D\u2019Amato </em>found \u00a7 1001 inapplicable to a false statement made in a private civil action. <em>Abrahams </em>ruled out \u201cexculpatory no\u201d responses given to a magistrate in a judicial proceeding. In <em>United States v. Plascencia-Orozco, </em>768 F.2d 1074 (9th Cir. 1985), the court upheld a \u00a7 1001 conviction based on the giving of a false name to a magistrate at an arraignment which was considered a part of the magistrate\u2019s administrative duties. The <em>Mayer </em>court found false statements given at a sentencing hearing outside the reach of \u00a7 1001, viewing sentencing as adjudicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Rowland maintains that \u00a7 1001 is not applicable to his conduct because it falls within the parameters of the private civil exception first considered in <em>D Amato </em>as recently endorsed by the Eleventh Circuit in <em>United States v. London, </em>714 F.2d 1558 (11th Cir.1983). The <em>D'Amato </em>court reasoned that \u00a7 1001 does not apply to false statements made in civil actions in federal court where the United States is not a party. <em>London </em>relied on <em>D'Amato </em>in rejecting the use of \u00a7 1001 against an attorney who used a fake federal court order in an attempt to mislead his client concerning the court\u2019s decision. We do not here consider the private civil exception, for the rationale of our <em>Abrahams </em>decision, within the context of the foregoing jurisprudential evolution, fuels our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Was Rowland\u2019s submission of a false and fraudulent bond within the adjudicative or administrative function of the bankruptcy court? We are persuaded that it came within the latter category. The bankruptcy court authorized the lease to the debtors of certain assets, provided a performance bond was filed. Rowland had the option of filing or not filing the bond if he wished to take advantage of the lease benefits. We perceive his actions involving the filing of the bond as coming within the court\u2019s administrative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">In genre, Rowland\u2019s act of presenting himself to the clerk of the bankruptcy court and filing a known, invalid performance bond, is not unlike the conduct of the defendant in a recent case, <em>United States v. McCallum, </em>788 F.2d 1042 (5th Cir.1985). We upheld McCallum\u2019s \u00a7 1001 conviction for filing revoked powers-of-attomey, attached to criminal appearance bonds, with the clerk of court. By his actions, McCal-lum falsely represented that he had authority from the insurer to use the powers-of-attorney and, implicitly, that the bonds signed pursuant to those powers were valid. Although we did not specifically address the issue presented in the case at bar, the <em>McCallum </em>court had no difficulty finding that the filing of the fraudulent appearance bonds was violative of \u00a7 1001. Were we now to categorize such filings, we would place that activity within the realm of the administrative function of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Rowland\u2019s conduct violated the strictures of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001; his conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-28\">. Rowland entered a conditional guilty plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to appeal the rejection of his motion to dismiss the indictment in which he urged the grounds advanced in this appeal,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">. We find only one reported case in which \u00a7 1001 was used in a bankruptcy setting. In <em>Lyons v. United States, </em>325 F.2d 370 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 969, 84 S.Ct. 1650, 12 L.Ed.2d 738 (1964), the defendant was charged with causing another to make a false statement in a bankruptcy petition. The conviction was affirmed without discussion of the issues which we consider today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
