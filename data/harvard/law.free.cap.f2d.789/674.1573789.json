Sanson Investment Company (Sanson). Sanson retained a security interest in the property evidenced by a note secured by a first deed of trust. The deed of trust provided that in the event of default and sale of the property by the trustee, five percent of the balance remaining due at the time of default would be paid to Sanson as attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">After the filing of an involuntary petition under Chapter 11 against 268 Limited, default on the secured obligation, and sale of the real property securing the debt, Sanson applied to the bankruptcy court for $197,-500 in attorney\u2019s fees provided in the deed of trust. The court awarded $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">The property sold for about $1,000,000 in excess of the outstanding principal. Funds were thus available to pay the contractually set fee. The bankruptcy court, relying upon 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 506(b) (West Supp. 1986),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> limited the fees to the amount it deemed reasonable under the circumstances. The district court affirmed the award. We must therefore decide whether the bankruptcy court was correct in making its own reasonableness assessment, or whether it should have enforced the contractual fee provision if it was valid under the governing state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">We hold that \u00a7 506(b) preempts the state law governing the availability of attorney\u2019s fees as part of a secured claim, and that the bankruptcy court correctly engaged in an independent reasonableness inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">\n<em>The Law Governing Reasonableness under Section 506(b).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-20\">Sanson argues that it is entitled to the agreed fee if that fee would be allowed under the state law governing the contract. 268 Limited argues that the bankruptcy court must assess the reasonableness of the claim without regard to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">Both the language and the structure of \u00a7 506(b) require rejection of San-son\u2019s argument. Sanson\u2019s theory is linguistically untenable because it implicitly equates reasonableness with enforceability. It argues that if the contractual fee provision would be enforceable under Nevada law, then the amount provided is reasonable per se under \u00a7 506(b). Reasonableness and enforceability are not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>coterminous. A concededly unreasonable fee provision might be enforceable under state law, whereas a reasonable one might be unenforceable for reasons unrelated to the size of the fee. Thus, we cannot agree that by requiring that contractual fee agreements be reasonable Congress meant only that they must be enforceable under the law governing the enforcement of the contract. To give \u00a7 506(b)\u2019s limitation meaning, we must read it to provide for an <em>ex post </em>reasonableness determination by the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Sanson\u2019s argument also ignores the structure of \u00a7 506(b). The statute treats interest and \u201cfees, costs or charges\u201d claimed under \u00a7 506(b) differently. The interest provision is not subject to the reasonableness limitation. When an oversecured creditor seeks interest on his or her claim, the bankruptcy courts apply the security agreement\u2019s interest rate. <em>See, e.g., In re Rutherford, </em>28 B.R. 899, 902 (Bankr. N.D.Ill.1983); <em>In re Elmwood Farm, Inc., </em>19 B.R. 338, 341 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1982); <em>see also </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy K 506.05, at 506-42 (15th ed. 1985). Sanson reads the fee provision as the interest provision is read, thus ignoring the express reasonableness limitation imposed on fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Section 506(b)\u2019s legislative history also favors reading the statute as preempting the state law governing the reasonableness of fee provisions. The statute was enacted as part of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. References to it in the Act\u2019s legislative history are brief. Both the Senate and the House Reports state only that the provision \u201ccodifies current law\u201d by entitling an oversecured creditor to fees. S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 68, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5854; H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 356-57, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 6312. The enforceability of attorney\u2019s fees agreements between oversecured creditors and debtors was governed by state law prior to the enactment of \u00a7 506(b). <em>Unsecured Creditor\u2019s Committee v. Walter E. Heller &amp; Co. Southeast, Inc., </em>768 F.2d 580, 582 (4th Cir.1985). The reports thus support Sanson\u2019s view that state law governs reasonableness under \u00a7 506(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">However, a comparison of the various predecessor bills with \u00a7 506(b) as enacted suggests that Congress ultimately rejected the reference to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The first House predecessor bill did favor the application of state law. H.R. 6, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), introduced in January 1977, contained no reasonableness limitation at all. It afforded secured status to an oversecured creditor\u2019s interest on his claim, and \u201cany fees, costs, or charges provided under the agreement under which such claim arose.\u201d A subsequent bill, H.R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), as amended by the Committee on the Judiciary, read \u201c[tjhere shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, to the extent collectible under applicable law interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided under the agreement under which the claim arose.\u201d The reasonableness provision suggests a move away from a state law standard. The \u201cto the extent collectible under applicable law\u201d language supports Sanson\u2019s argument, but may modify only the interest clause that immediately proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The Senate bill contained the reasonableness limitation, but omitted the \u201cto the extent collectible under applicable law\u201d language. S. 2266, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Congress enacted the Senate version of the bill. Although the differences were worked out without formal conference, Senator De Concini and Representative Edwards, the floor managers of the Act, made identical statements on the floors of their respective Houses regarding \u00a7 506(b). They stated that the House version had been rejected in favor of the Senate version, and that fee agreements would be enforceable \u201cnotwithstanding contrary law.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 32,398, 33,997 (1978). Thus, despite the language of the House and Senate Reports, Congress declined to require that the bankruptcy courts consult the governing state law to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>reasonableness of fees claimed under \u00a7 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Section 506(b)\u2019s legislative history is silent as to why Congress ultimately chose to displace pre-bankruptcy contractual arrangements. The legislative history of the Code\u2019s provisions imposing reasonableness limitations on other pre-bankruptcy obligations suggests, however, that they were intended to prevent overreaching or the collusive use of fee arrangements. In 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329 (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984), Congress limited the fees available to attorneys for work performed \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy during the year before the filing of the petition to those deemed reasonable. The reports discussing \u00a7 329 state that \u201c[p]ayments to a debtor\u2019s attorney provide serious potential for evasion of creditor protection provisions of the bankruptcy laws, and serious potential for overreaching by the debtor\u2019s attorney, and should be subject to careful scrutiny.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, <em>supra, </em>at 39, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5825; H.R.Rep. 95-595, <em>supra, </em>at 329, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6285. Similarly, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502(b)(4) (West Supp.1986) disallows claims by \u201can insider or attorney of the debtor\u201d to the extent that the claim exceeds the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the services rendered. This provision, enacted as \u00a7 502(b)(5) and renumbered without alteration by the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, was designed to \u201cprevent[] overreaching by the debtor\u2019s attorneys and [the] concealing of assets by debtors.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, <em>supra, </em>at 63, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5849; H.R.Rep. 95-595, <em>supra, </em>at 353, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6309.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We note that when Congress intended state law standards to apply in bankruptcy it did so explicitly. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(1) (Supp. II 1984) disallows claims against the estate that are \u201cunenforceable against the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.\u201d Thus the validity of claims against the estate, with a few statutory exceptions, is determined by state law and private agreement. Congress\u2019 explicit reference to state law when it intended such law to apply cuts against Sanson\u2019s argument that the term \u201creasonable\u201d in \u00a7 506(b) requires only state law enforceability of the deed of trust\u2019s fee provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Sanson argues that <em>Butner v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 48, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979), supports the application of a state law reasonableness standard. <em>Butner </em>stands for the proposition that in the absence of a federal interest requiring the displacement of state law property rights, those rights are not abrogated by the institution of federal bankruptcy proceedings. State law thus functions as a default rule for the determination of property interests in a bankruptcy proceeding. <em>Butner </em>does not, however, require that we read \u00a7 506(b) to enforce contractual fee arrangements simply because the state law governing the contract would do so. Congress has chosen to treat contractual fees as part of the secured claim only to the extent that they are \u201creasonable.\u201d This express displacement of any contrary pre-bankruptcy state law entitlement of the overseeured creditor takes this case outside of Butner\u2019s default provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\n<em>The Reasonableness of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s $20,000 Fee Award.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">We review bankruptcy court factual determinations under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Global Western Development Corp. v. Northern Orange County Credit Service, Inc. (In re Global Western Development Corp.), </em>759 F.2d 724, 726 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In setting the $20,000 fee award, the bankruptcy court relied upon an affidavit by Sanson\u2019s counsel stating that his firm had billed Sanson $13,732.60 for services related to 268 Limited. Although the bankruptcy court\u2019s award is generous, particularly in light of the quality of the legal work performed both in the bankruptcy proceedings and before this court, its find- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>. ing was not an abuse of discretion. In re Nucorp. Energy, Inc., 764 F.2d 655, 657 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\n<em>The Availability of Attorney\u2019s Fees Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Our rejection of Sanson\u2019s construction of \u00a7 506(b) does not preclude it from seeking the contractual fees in excess of $20,000 as an unsecured claim. Section 506 establishes the requirements for a secured claim. Subsection (a) defines such claims. Subsection (b) states that under some circumstances \u201cthere shall be allowed to the holder of such claim\u201d interest, fees, costs or charges. When read literally, subsection (b) arguably limits the fees available to the oversecured creditor. When read in conjunction with \u00a7 506(a), however, it may be understood to define the portion of the fees which shall be afforded secured status. We adopt the latter reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Because other creditors may claim such expenses under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(1) (Supp. II 1984), to bar Sanson from seeking the balance of its fees as an unsecured claim would make it worse off in bankruptcy than it would have been if its claim were unsecured. Further, our reading of \u00a7 506(b) is consistent with the legislative history of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984), which sets forth the means by which unsecured claims may be presented to the bankruptcy court. Both the Senate and the House Reports discussing \u00a7 501 state that \u201ca proof of claim will be a prerequisite to allowance for unsecured claims, including priority claims and the unsecured portion of a claim asserted by the holder of a lien.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, <em>supra, </em>at 61, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5847; H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, <em>supra, </em>at 351, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6307. Because \u00a7 501 contemplates that undersecured creditors may pursue the unsecured portion of their claims as unsecured creditors, we find that oversecured creditors with valid contractual fee claims may do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\n<em>The Failure of the Deed of Trust\u2019s Trustee to Sell the Property.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We reject 268 Limited\u2019s argument that the deed of trust\u2019s fee provision does not apply because the property was never sold pursuant to the terms of the deed of trust. The deed\u2019s covenant containing the fee provision states the priority of the claims payable in the event of a trustee\u2019s sale. It provides for the payment of the five percent attorney\u2019s fee out of the proceeds of the sale. Liability for the fee is not, however, contingent upon the trustee\u2019s sale of the property. The deed of trust provides that the fees became due upon default by 268 Limited. Therefore, the default itself and not the anticipated trustee\u2019s sale triggered 268 Limited\u2019s liability for Sanson\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">We affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s fee award under \u00a7 506(b). We nonetheless remand to allow Sanson to seek the balance of its $197,500 claim under \u00a7 502. We express no opinion on the enforceability under the governing state law of the deed of trust\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-14\">. Section 506(b) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured hy property the value of which, after any recovery allowed under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
