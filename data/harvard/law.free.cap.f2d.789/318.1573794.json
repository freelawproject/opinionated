After an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate recommended dismissal of Cay\u2019s complaint based on a determination of the credibility of the witnesses. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and Cay now appeals. Although we hold that a district court may make limited credibility assessments to decide whether a suit is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1982), we reverse because the assessments in this case fell outside the scope of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">On October 7, 1982, Cay was granted leave to file a complaint <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). The complaint alleged that on August 3, 1982, when Cay asked to be relieved from work duties because of a back injury, he was beaten severely and placed in solitary confinement. The complaint named as defendants W.J. Estelle, Director of TDC; T.D. Durbin, a TDC Warden; J.T. Gremen, an assistant warden; W.B. Hagan, a correctional officer at TDC; and L.P. Allen, also a correctional officer at TDC. Also named as defendants were two TDC inmates: a Mr. Matthews and a Mr. Williams. The defendants denied the allegations, demanded a jury trial and raised the defense that Cay had failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>An evidentiary hearing was held on September 28, 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony diverged significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">a. <em>Testimony for Plaintiff </em>Cay testified that his work squad was assigned to work in the fields on the morning of August 3, 1982. As the squad was preparing to load into the transportation trailer, Cay stopped to remind Warden Gremen, who was standing nearby, of a conversation the two had had the day before. In this conversation, Cay had informed the Warden that he, Cay, had a long-standing back injury, and the Warden had agreed to investigate Cay\u2019s records and reassign him to lighter work if necessary. While Cay was addressing the Warden, another inmate, James Smith, objected to riding on the trailer and jumped from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Warden ordered Captain Hagan, who was standing nearby, to take Cay and Smith and lock them up. As they were proceeding to a back gate, Hagan began using abusive language. When Cay responded, somewhat in kind, Hagan struck him. A moment later, Hagan was joined by Lieutenant Allen and two inmates. The four beat Cay unconscious with blackjacks (used by the guards) and lead pipes (used by the inmates), inflicting him with various injuries including a black eye, bruises, a busted nose, and a busted mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Afterwards, Cay was taken to the infirmary where he was treated with iodine and bandaids by an inmate. (The medical report stated that Cay was treated for cuts and scratches.) Cay was then placed in a solitary confinement cell along with several other inmates, without clothes, a mattress, blankets or sheets. Three days later, he was charged with refusing to work, striking an officer, using vulgar language and other charges. After a disciplinary hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was given fifteen days in solitary provided that he would forget about the incident. Cay then spent only seven days in solitary.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Two witnesses testified on behalf of Cay. The first, inmate James Morse, testified that he observed Captain Hagan, Lieutenant Allen and two inmates beat Cay. He also testified, however, that he only saw one of the inmates use a weapon (a blackjack) and that he did not see Cay unconscious. A second inmate, Horace Dewberry, confirmed Cay\u2019s testimony that he and the other inmates in solitary had no clothes, mattresses or blankets. According to Dewberry, he could see into the cell once a day when he was taken to the showers. A third inmate was supposed to present testimony as to Cay\u2019s physical impairment from the beating, but, through an apparent mixup, the wrong inmate was brought to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">b. <em>Testimony for Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Warden Durbin testified briefly as to the procedures used during hearings before the prison\u2019s Disciplinary Committee. He stated that he did not know Cay and that he had never had a reason to harm Cay or to do anything to cause him harm. Durbin also testified that he was not present during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Captain Hagan\u2019s testimony, after his memory was refreshed by a disciplinary report written after the incident, differed in almost every respect from Cay\u2019s testimony. Hagan testified that Cay was on the trailer when he jumped off and announced to Hagan (not the Warden) that he (Cay) was not going to work. Cay refused two orders to return to the building and began to yell and curse. After refusing to obey a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>third order, Cay began hitting Hagan in the chest. Hagan and Allen, who was standing nearby, subdued Cay by themselves, without the use of weapons, then took him to the infirmary for treatment of minor scratches and bruises. Hagan also testified that, although he did not personally observe Cay while he was in solitary, prisoners were normally issued clothes, mattresses and blankets while so confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">c. <em>The Magistrate\u2019s Recommendation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Following the hearing, the magistrate filed a Memorandum and Recommendation. He stated that the hearing was held pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) to determine whether Cay had \u201cestablish[ed] that his claims have sufficient prima facie merit to justify the expense of litigation.\u201d He explicitly acknowledged that the Memorandum\u2019s findings of fact where \u201cbased in part on conflicting testimony, ... and that [he] ... assessed the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses and the inherent probabilities of inconsistencies in the testimony received.\u201d The magistrate concluded that the \u201c[p]laintiff cannot present evidence that he was subjected to physical brutality and since he received treatment for his injury, there was no \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 ... to his medical need.\u201d He therefore recommended dismissal of Cay\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The magistrate\u2019s Memorandum and Recommendation was sent to the parties. It notified both parties that a failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in the report within ten days would bar them from attacking the factual findings on appeal. Cay received the report on December 24, 1983. On December 28, 1983, inmate John Pussey mailed a motion for extension of time to file objections on Cay\u2019s behalf to the district court and the Attorney General\u2019s office. (Pussey claimed to be providing Cay with \u201clegal assistance.\u201d) The motion was returned because it had not been signed by Cay. On December 30, 1983, Cay mailed a Motion for Amended and/or Additional Findings of Fact. Because of insufficient postage, the district court did not receive the motion until February 10, 1984. The motion was, however, received by the Attorney General\u2019s office on January 3, 1984. The district court subsequently dismissed the action. Cay now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Cay contends primarily that it is improper to dismiss a civil rights action before trial when material, conflicting testimony is presented at an evidentiary hearing, requiring the magistrate to make an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. If the dismissal was made under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or 56, as Cay assumes, he would prevail by showing that the evidence at the hearing raised a material fact issue. But, as we discuss below, the dismissal in this case may be properly characterized as a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d), which allows dismissal of an IFP proceeding if the district court determines that the action is frivolous or malicious. Determinations under \u00a7 1915(d) are fundamentally different from pretrial dismissals under the Federal Rules. Some assessment of credibility is within the broad discretion provided district courts under \u00a7 1915(d). In this case, however, we conclude that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">We must first consider the defendants\u2019 argument that Cay\u2019s appeal is foreclosed by <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc). In <em>Nettles, </em>this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">the failure of a party to file written objections to proposed findings and recommendations in a magistrate\u2019s report [within ten days] ... shall bar the party from attacking on appeal factual findings accepted or adopted by the district court except upon grounds of plain error or manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 410. <em>See also Thomas v. Am, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). The defendants argue that the motion for extension of time submitted by inmate John Pussey on behalf of Cay, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>on December 30, 1983, and the motion for amended and/or additional findings of facts, filed on February 10, 1984, were insufficient both as to time of filing and specificity to secure compliance with <em>Nettles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Ordinarily, we would agree with the defendants. Cay is challenging the factual findings of the magistrate, not his legal conclusions, <em>cf. Nash v. Black, </em>781 F.2d 665, 667 (8th Cir.1986) (whether a complaint is legally frivolous is question of law, not fact), and <em>Nettles </em>made it clear that the ten-day rule would apply to pro se parties as well as parties represented by attorneys. <em>Nettles, </em>677 F.2d at 410. A district court, however, has the discretionary authority to allow a party to file objections after the ten-day period. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b). Since there is nothing in the record to the contrary, we assume that the district court exercised its discretion and allowed the filing of the February 10, 1984 motion. While defendants argue that Cay\u2019s objection fails to meet the <em>Nettles </em>requirement that the findings objected to be specifically identified, 677 F.2d at 410 n. 8, we do not consider the objections contained in the February 10 motion to be so general as to preclude review of the magistrate\u2019s report. Cay\u2019s appeal is therefore not foreclosed by <em>Nettles v. Wainwright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In his brief, Cay asserts that his original complaint alleged that the defendants deprived him of his constitutional rights by beating him, failing to provide him with adequate medical care both immediately after the beating and later while he was in solitary confinement, placing him in solitary under inhumane conditions and denying him access to mail. On appeal, the defendants argue that the claims regarding solitary confinement and access to mail were never properly raised in the complaint because they were not specific enough and because they were made against unnamed \u201cTDC officials\u201d and \u201cthe officers that work in solitary.\u201d (The evidentiary hearing also failed to identify the appropriate defendants.) We agree. While pro se complaints must be construed liberally, and the complainant given the opportunity to add specifics, allegations of misconduct must at least name a defendant or so specify the official\u2019s position that his identification is easily ascertainable. Thus, the only claims properly before the district court were those relating to the alleged beating and the alleged denial of medical care immediately following the beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Turning to the merits of Cay\u2019s appeal, we must determine initially whether the dismissal of his action was made under \u00a7 1915(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or Fed.R. Civ.P. 56. This determination has important consequences, as the standards governing dismissal in each instance are not necessarily the same. Following the lead of <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), we conclude that an IFP proceeding can be dismissed as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d) at whatever point it becomes clear that merit is lacking. We also conclude under <em>Spears </em>that the district court referred this case to the magistrate for disposition generally, including use of \u00a7 1915(d) to recommend that Cay\u2019s pauper status be revoked if the magistrate determined that the suit was frivolous. As part of our discussion, we think review of the \u00a7 1915 process is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">A grant of leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is made by considering only a petitioner\u2019s economic status. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a); <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 891 (5th Cir.1976). To ensure that the privilege of proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>is not abused, Congress authorized dismissal of an IFP proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) if it is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d The point at which dismissal is appropriate under \u00a7 1915(d) has been a source of confusion. <em>See, e.g., Wartman v. Branch 7, Civil Division, County Court, Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, </em>510 F.2d 130 (7th Cir.1975). <em>See generally </em>Federal Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>cial Center, <em>Recommended Procedures for Handling Prisoner Civil Rights Cases in the Federal Courts </em>54, 57-58 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In the Fifth Circuit a district court may dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>an IFP proceeding as frivolous after filing but before service based on an examination of the complaint. While pro se pleadings must be construed liberally, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), close scrutiny of the complaint may be properly made at this stage to determine whether any defendants and claims should be dismissed as frivolous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Green v. McKas-kle, </em>788 F.2d 1116 (5th Cir.1986). It is not always easy, however, to determine whether a claim is frivolous simply by examining the complaint: prisoner complaints are notoriously difficult to decipher. If the frivolousness of a complaint is not facially apparent, it is \u201cincumbent upon the court to develop the case and to sift the claims and known facts thoroughly until completely satisfied either of its merit or lack of same.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>58 F.R.D. 453, 464 (N.D.Ga.1972), <em>affd on basis of the district court\u2019s reasoning, </em>480 F.2d 805 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">To aid its development of the factual basis of a complaint, a district court may send a questionnaire to a prisoner before service requiring him to specify in greater detail the nature of his claims. <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 893 (5th Cir.1976). The questionnaire is then made a part of the pleadings. Use of these questionnaires is standard practice in this circuit, and, even though pro se pleadings must be liberally construed, a significant number of complaints are usually dismissed before service upon examination of the complaint and the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">As this court made clear in <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority to dismiss under \u00a7 1915(d) does not end with service. <em>See also Brown v. Schneckloth, </em>421 F.2d 1402, 1403 (9th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 847, 91 S.Ct. 95, 27 L.Ed.2d 85 (1970). Because a \u201cmagistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations [may] prove of greater aid than a prisoner\u2019s written answers on a questionnaire,\u201d 766 F.2d at 182, <em>Spears </em>authorized magistrates to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if a suit is frivolous under \u00a7 1915(d) or fails to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). If the magistrate determines that the claim is frivolous, he may recommend to the district court that the prisoner\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>status be revoked. <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 180 n. 1. Although a <em>Spears </em>hearing should not be necessary in all, or even most, cases, consideration under \u00a7 1915(d) after service of process and expansion of the. record may be preferable in some instances. <em>See Anderson v. Coughlin, </em>700 F.2d 37, 41 (2nd Cir. 1983) (\u201cexpansion of the record protects the unskilled litigant and enables the court to make an informed decision regarding the merits of an action by reference to the reality of the situation rather than by speculating as to the nature of the claim\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Regardless of the means used to develop the factual basis<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of a claim, dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d) is appropriate whenever it becomes clear that an IFP complaint is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">While a district court may dismiss an IFP proceeding whenever it determines that the complaint is frivolous, before or after service, Cay argues that the dismissal in this case was made not under \u00a7 1915(d) but instead under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 or Fed.R. Civ.P. 56. We do not agree. First, while neither the district court nor the magistrate denominated Cay\u2019s suit as frivolous, <em>Spears </em>stated clearly that \u201ca district court need not specifically term a prisoner\u2019s suit \u2018frivolous\u2019 to merit dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d).\u201d <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 181. <em>See also Irving v. Thigpen, </em>732 F.2d 1215, 1216 n. 2 (5th Cir.1984). Second, as in <em>Spears, </em>the magistrate in this case sought to determine whether the pro se plaintiff could \u201cestablish that his claims have sufficient prima facie merit to justify the expense of litigation.\u201d <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 181 n. 3. This invites a consideration and ruling under \u00a7 1915(d). <em>Id. </em>Thus, as in <em>Spears, </em>\u201c[stripping this record to legal essentials, we perceive that the district court referred this case to the magistrate for disposition, including, upon the development of [Cay\u2019s] claim, use of the authority vested by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) to recommend that [Cay] be denied pauper status if his suit be found frivolous.\u201d <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 181. <em>See also Brown, </em>421 F.2d at 1403 (dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d) is \u201cpreferable procedure\u201d as opposed to use of summary judgment procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The magistrate explicitly acknowledged that there was conflicting testimony presented at the hearing and that he made his findings of fact regarding the beating after determining the credibility of the witnesses. Cay argues that this action changed the hearing into a trial on the merits and that he had not agreed to trial before a magistrate. He also argues that making determinations of credibility at this stage are inappropriate to resolve conflicts in oral testimony. Although we have determined that the dismissal in this case was made under \u00a7 1915(d) rather than the Federal Rules, Cay\u2019s arguments are still relevant to \u00a7 1915(d) dismissals. Thus, we must determine whether credibility assessments are appropriate in the context of \u00a7 1915(d). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that while a district court may consider credibility to a limited extent in making a \u00a7 1915(d) determination, it was error to have done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">In <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1120 (5th Cir.1986), we emphasized \u201cthe uniqueness of a \u00a7 1915 determination.\u201d Such a determination is of a \u201cfundamentally different nature\u201d than proceedings under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 1120 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Coughlin, </em>700 F.2d 37, 43 (2nd Cir.1982)). The system of notice pleading embodied in the Federal Rules rests on the idea that one may sue now and discover later what his claim is. Section 1915(a), on the other hand, because it provides a special benefit \u2014 free access to the courts \u2014 requires that due consideration be given to the conservation of scarce judicial resources. <em>See id. </em>Although Congress justifiably enacted \u00a7 1915 to allow indigent persons access to the courts so that their rights may be vindicated, \u201cthere is no constitutional right to the expenditure of public funds and the valuable time of federal courts to prosecute an action which is totally without merit.\u201d <em>Collins v. Cundy, </em>603 F.2d 825, 828 (10th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">The court\u2019s explanation in <em>Jones v. Bales </em>of the special considerations involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>making determinations of frivolousness under \u00a7 1915(d) bears repeating here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">There are compelling reasons for allowing courts broader dismissal powers in forma pauperis suits \u2014 especially damage suits brought by convicted prisoners \u2014 than in other cases. Persons proceeding in forma pauperis are immune from imposition of costs if they are unsuccessful; and because of their poverty, they are practically immune from later tort actions for \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d or abuse of process. Thus indigents, unlike other litigants, approach the courts in a context where they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. The temptation to file complaints that contain facts which cannot be proved is obviously stronger in such a situation. For convicted prisoners with much idle time and free paper, ink, law books, and mailing privileges the temptation is especially strong. As Justice Rehnquist has noted, \u201cThough [an inmate] may be denied legal relief, he will nonetheless have obtained a short sabbatical in the nearest federal courthouse.\u201d <em>Cruz v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 327, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1084, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972) (dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are inadequate to protect the courts and defendants \u2014 who it should be remembered pay for their defense \u2014 from frivolous litigation from indigent prisoners. The Rules are liberal; they are designed so that most cases will actually go to trial if the parties so desire. Under current standards, Rule 12 motions to dismiss are rarely properly granted. The liberal approach of the Rules is probably desirable, but the rules contemplate litigants who are limited by the realities of time and expense. They also contemplate litigants with a basic respect for accuracy. As Judge Duniway has written, \u201c[w]e know from sad experience with habeas corpus and 2255 cases that imprisoned felons ... do not hesitate to allege whatever they think is required in order to get themselves even the temporary relief of a proceeding in court.\u201d <em>Weller v. Dickson, </em>314 F.2d 598, 602 (9th Cir.1963) (concurring opinion). A reasonably intelligent prisoner with a willingness to misrepresent facts can often avoid both 12b dismissal and summary judgment, although he actually has no chance of eventual success in his suit. Even if summary judgment can be won by a defendant, much expense may already have been suffered by him in retaining counsel to conduct the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyOd\"><em>Jones, </em>58 F.R.D. at 463-64 (citations, footnotes omitted). v</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Due to such considerations, this circuit has vested district courts with especially broad discretion in making the determination of whether an IFP proceeding is frivolous. <em>See, e.g., Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Watson V. Ault, </em>525 F.2d at 891-92; <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>58 F.R.D. at 464. Most other circuits have done likewise. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Coughlin, </em>700 F.2d 37 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Collins v. Cundy, </em>603 F.2d 825 (10th Cir.1979); <em>Milton v. Nelson, </em>527 F.2d 1158 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Daye v. Bounds, </em>509 F.2d 66 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1002, 95 S.Ct. 2404, 44 L.Ed.2d 671 (1975); <em>Hendricks v. Havener, </em>587 F.2d 21 (8th Cir.1978); <em>cf. Boyce v. Alizaduh, </em>595 F.2d 948, 951 (4th Cir.1979) (\u201chowever broad the discretion may be, it may not be exercised arbitrarily and is limited in a <em>pro se </em>case ... by the rule in <em>Haines v. Kemer ... </em>and in every case by the language of [\u00a7 1915(d)] itself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Courts have had difficulty in defining frivolous as it is used in \u00a7 1915(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>circuit uses three standards in making \u00a7 1915(d) determinations. An IFP proceeding may be dismissed if (1) the claim\u2019s realistic chance of ultimate success is slight; (2) the claim has no arguable basis in law and fact; or (3) it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim. <em>See Green, </em>788 F.2d at 1120 (citations omitted). While we doubt the appropriateness of the third standard, which equates frivolousness with the standard for dismissal under 12(b)(6), <em>see Anderson, </em>700 F.2d at 43, a \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal is appropriate under any of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We have addressed the appropriateness of credibility findings under the above standards in two previous cases. In <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>58 F.R.D. 453, we approved action by a district court dismissing an IFP proceeding because the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s allegations simply strain credulity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. The district court, relying entirely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint concluded that it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the plaintiff to prove facts necessary to establish his claim. <em>Id. </em>The court considered as relevant to its credibility assessment the plaintiff\u2019s lack of success in substantiating previous claims. In <em>Taylor v. Gibson, </em>529 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1976), we considered a magistrate\u2019s report which recommended dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint because the allegations were \u201ccompletely beyond belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716. Unlike <em>Jones, </em>the <em>Taylor </em>court had before it supporting affidavits from all parties which substantially conflicted. We reversed the dismissal because the prisoner \u201cwas deprived of a hearing at which to present evidence in support of his allegations\u201d and because \u201c[t]he lower court made credibility choices without hearing witnesses testify, without observing their demeanor or hearing their testimony subjected to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">While <em>Jones </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>read superficially, appear to reach conflicting results, close analysis reveals that they are in fact consistent. In <em>Jones, </em>the court considered the inherent improbability of the general facts alleged by the prisoner, together with his lack of previous success in substantiating other claims, to determine that his allegations were not credible. Other courts have allowed an assessment of the credibility of a prisoner\u2019s allegations in similar circumstances. <em>See Taylor, </em>529 F.2d at 717 (complaint which misstates facts that a district court may judicially notice may be dismissed); <em>Crisafi v. Holland, </em>655 F.2d 1305, 1307-08 (D.C.Cir.1981) (complaint which postulates facts of a \u201cwholly fanciful kind\u201d may be dismissed). Determining that it would be almost impossible for a plaintiff to prove certain facts requires a different kind of credibility assessment than the assessments made in <em>Taylor. </em>In <em>Taylor, </em>the prisoner had presented a plausible story. The magistrate, with only affidavits before him, chose to believe the prison officials over the prisoner, apparently on the basis of the prisoner\u2019s prior criminal record. As the <em>Taylor </em>court stated, \u201c[fjactual disputes are not so resolved under our system of jurisprudence,\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>529 F.2d at 716. Clearly, <em>Taylor </em>does not disallow credibility findings; rather, <em>Taylor </em>simply requires that a hearing be held before a court can make credibility determinations involving more than the inherent plausibility of a prisoner\u2019s allegations. <em>Spears, </em>of course, provides for such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">We conclude from the preceding discussion that credibility assessments are within the sound discretion of a district court making a determination of frivolousness. That discretion is limited, however, by the purpose of a \u00a7 1915(d) determination. District courts must remember that they are only determining whether a suit is frivolous, not deciding the case on the merits. Thus, the most important consideration in a \u00a7 1915(d) credibility assessment is the inherent plausibility of a prisoner\u2019s allegations based on objective factors, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>than the demeanor of witnesses or a witness\u2019s prior criminal record. A district court, faced with only the pleadings, and perhaps supporting affidavits, may consider credibility as a factor in determining frivolousness only to the extent that it believes a prisoner\u2019s allegations are almost impossible to prove, conflict with facts which may be judicially noticed, or postulate facts of a wholly fanciful kind. In addition, where witnesses can be observed and their testimony on direct and cross-examination compared, such as in a <em>Spears </em>hearing, credibility may be a factor only to the extent that a district court considers a complainant\u2019s change of position when exposed to interrogation or conflicting evidence, major internal inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s testimony, or substantial conflicts between the testimony of supporting witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In reviewing a magistrate\u2019s full credibility assessments, the district judge must consider the verbatim record of the evidentiary hearing. <em>Hernandez v. Estelle, </em>711 F.2d 619 (5th Cir.1983). This \u201cfresh consideration\u201d of the magistrate\u2019s findings may be undertaken by listening to a tape recording or reading a transcript of the hearing. <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404, 409 n. 5 (5th Cir.1982). When the magistrate recommends that claims or cases be dismissed as frivolous after conducting an evidentiary hearing, however, he may be able to dispense with the necessity of the verbatim review by the district judge if the pertinent evidence is summarized and the conflicts and inconsistencies that demonstrate fabrication and lack of merit are set forth in the magistrate\u2019s report. It would be preferable in that case for the district court to state the reasons for the \u00a7 1915(d) dismissal. Cf<em>. Jones v. Morris, 777 </em>F.2d 1277, 1281 (7th Cir.1985) (practice of supplying statement of reasons \u201cought to be the norm in all section 1915(d) cases where the basis for dismissal is not evident on the face of the complaint\u201d); <em>Crisafi v. Holland, </em>655 F.2d 1305, 1310 (D.C.Cir.1981) (same); <em>but see Collins v. Cundy, </em>603 F.2d 825, 828 (10th Cir.1979) (requiring statement of reasons in every \u00a7 1915 dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Applying these rules, we find that the district court abused its discretion in this case. The magistrate stated that he \u201cassessed the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses and the inherent probabilities of inconsistencies in the testimony received.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report apparently without a transcript or tape recording of the hearing before him, and the magistrate did not summarize any conflicts or inconsistencies that might demonstrate fabrication. The transcript reveals, however, that Cay\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged beating was consistent with the facts alleged in his complaint. It was substantially corroborated by a fellow prisoner. The testimony of both prisoners was inherently consistent, and, while their testimony differed with regard to details, such as the use of weapons and the extent of Cay\u2019s injuries, they agreed on the essentials \u2014 that Cay was severely beaten by two prison guards and two inmates. Cay\u2019s version of the entire incident was not implausible in any way. Any assessment of credibility based on factors other than these, such as demeanor, was inappropriate at this stage of the litigation. The parties clearly differed in their versions of the facts, and it was only for the ultimate trier of fact to determine who was more believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that Cay\u2019s claim that he was denied adequate medical treatment immediately after the beating be dismissed. Cay does not contest the dismissal of this claim, and we affirm. Prison officials are liable under the Eighth Amendment for failure to provide medical treatment only when they are deliberately indifferent to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251, 261 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(1976). Cay\u2019s complaint alleged that Captain Hagan intentionally denied him medical attention after the beating. At the hearing, however, Cay admitted that he' was taken to the prison infirmary immediately following the altercation and treated for minor injuries. Medical records confirmed his testimony. The magistrate concluded therefore that Cay \u201creceived medical care and received it promptly.\u201d We agree. Dismissal of this claim was proper under any standard, be it \u00a7 1915(d), Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Since we affirm the dismissal of Cay\u2019s claim of inadequate medical treatment, we remand only for a determination of the merits of his claim of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. Prior to the hearing, Cay filed a first amended complaint in which additional constitutional deprivations were alleged. No action was taken on his request to amend. The parties assumed . at the evidentiary hearing that these additional claims were being treated as a separate action. We assume likewise. Cay also filed a motion seeking to subpoena various witnesses to testify at the evidentiary hearing. The magistrate limited Cay to three witnesses at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-15\">. Cay complained at the hearing that Captain Hagan, who brought the disciplinary charge, sat on the Disciplinary Committee. This fact was disputed. Apparently, it was not disputed that Lieutenant Allen, who was also involved in the beating, did sit on the committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. It is important at this stage that the district courts review each of a prisoner\u2019s allegations to determine whether they adequately state a claim against each defendant. Prisoner complaints often make allegations against numerous defendants which should not survive scrutiny under recent Supreme Court decisions, which require a prisoner making allegations under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to allege facts sufficient to establish that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his rights. <em>See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (Fourteenth Amendment); <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) (same); <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986) (Eighth amendment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">. Also useful in this regard is a procedure developed by the Tenth Circuit. In <em>Martinez v. Aaron, </em>570 F.2d 317 (10th Cir.1978), the court approved a district court\u2019s order that prison officials investigate the facts surrounding a civil rights suit by inmates to construct \"an administrative record ... to enable the trial court to ... make a determination [of frivolity] under section 1915(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. The trial court had required the defendants to attach all relevant reports to their answers. <em>See also Hardwick v. Ault, </em>517 F.2d 295, 298 (5th Cir.1975) (alluding to use of a \"special report\u201d filed by prison officials in response to prisoner\u2019s claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. With a judicial officer and witnesses on hand, the parties could, of course, agree to proceed to trial on the merits. The magistrate or judge could then choose to withhold a final \u00a7 1915(d) ruling pending more familiarity with the complainant's case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. <em>See Jones v.
