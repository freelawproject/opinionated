We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits, modify the attorneys\u2019 fee award, and award attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-21\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-22\">Arizona participates in a Title XX federal grant program that provides federal reimbursement for 90% of the expenditures Arizona makes for certain family planning services. Arizona allocates 10% matching funds to pay for these services. <em>See Planned Parenthood v. Arizona, </em>718 F.2d 938, 941 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(Planned Parenthood I). </em>This controversy has its origins in a restriction on use of the state funds for abortion-related activities. The restriction was contained in a two-paragraph footnote to the Arizona bill appropriating the state\u2019s ten percent matching funds. It consists of two paragraphs and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-23\">No state money may be spent by the department of economic security by contract, grant or otherwise, on abortions, abortion procedures, counseling for abortion procedures or abortion referrals. These restrictions are not applicable when it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-24\">No state money, other than money for comprehensive medical and dental care and the developmentally disabled, may be given by the department of economic security by contract, grant or otherwise to agencies or entities which offer abortions, abortion procedures, counseling for abortion procedures or abortion refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>rals. Governmental agencies or entities are exempt from restrictions in this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">1980 Ariz. Sess. Laws 842, 860 n *.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona and Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona (collectively referred to as Planned Parenthood) brought suit to enjoin enforcement of this footnote. They argued that the footnote is an unconstitutional restriction on their freedom of speech and is void for vagueness. In 1982, the district court held that the footnote is unconstitutional on both first amendment grounds and vagueness grounds. In 1983, this circuit held that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. <em>Planned Parenthood I, </em>718 F.2d at 949. Its resolution of the first amendment issue was more complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">The first paragraph of the Arizona statute prohibits the use of state funds for abortion-related services. Relying on <em>Maher v. Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d (1977), <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>upheld this portion of the statute. <em>See </em>718 F.2d at 942-44. The second paragraph of the statute prohibits use of state funds by organizations that offer abortion-related services, even if the state funds themselves are not used for abortion-related services. Planned Parenthood in our first encounter characterized this portion of the statute as a penalty designed to chill the exercise of the constitutional right to provide abortions. The State argued to the <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>panel that this second paragraph of the statute was constitutional because, since it was impossible for the state to monitor use of the funds to prevent their use for abortion-related services, it was a measure necessary to the enforcement of the constitutionally proper first paragraph. The <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>panel remanded \u201cto give the State the opportunity to prove that withdrawing all state funds from Planned Parenthood was the only way to ensure that Planned Parenthood would not use state funds to support its abortion-related activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"aks-dedup-0\">On remand, the district court received depositions on this issue and granted summary judgment for Planned Parenthood. The State appeals. It argues, first, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Planned Parenthood, second, that the district court included improper costs in the fee award; and, third, that the district court erred in awarding Planned Parenthood an upward adjustment of the attorneys\u2019 fee award above the \u201clodestar\u201d amount. Planned Parenthood also seeks attorneys\u2019 fees for the cost of defending against the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-11\">The State in its first argument appears to frame a strange and simplistic proposition. It proceeds as follows. Planned Parenthood of Northern and Central Arizona spent funds on \u201ccounseling for abortion procedures or abortion referrals\u201d that had their source, in part, in State funds. This expenditure demonstrates that \u201cwithdrawing all state funds from Planned Parenthood ... [is] the only way to ensure that Planned Parenthood would not use state funds to support its abortion-related activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946. This, in turn, removed any cloud of possible unconstitutionality from paragraph two of the Arizona footnote and rendered any dispute on this issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-12\">The flaw in the argument is that Planned Parenthood\u2019s expenditure by no means demonstrates that withdrawal of funds is necessary to prevent violation of the footnote\u2019s first paragraph. The argument of the State renders this court\u2019s remand in <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>an exercise in futility. Had we assumed, as the State does in its argument, that <em>any </em>expenditure on abortion-related activities necessarily is derived from state funds at least to the extent of ten cents on the dollar, the remand would have been pointless. The constitutionality of the second paragraph on the basis of this assumption should have been confronted in <em>Planned Parenthood I. </em>Not having done so, we obviously rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>State\u2019s assumption. We proceeded on the basis that it was the burden of the State to show that ear-marking of state funds for non-abortion-related activities and a system of tracing reasonably susceptible to auditing by state officials was not possible to create.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Thus, the question before us is whether the State has made such a showing. It is not moot. <em>See </em>13A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3533, at 212 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See, e.g., Lojek v. Thomas, </em>716 F.2d 675, 677 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-9\">Turning to the merits, we note that neither of the parties have attempted to persuade us to reconsider the <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>decision. Moreover, it is clear that on remand the showing made by the State does not establish the impossibility of monitoring funds. Affidavits by State officials charged with distributing the funds, which are not controverted, established that monitoring was feasible. <em>See </em>Excerpt of Record (E.R.) at 40-41 (deposition of Guy Mikkelsen); <em>id. </em>at 43 (deposition of Betty DeGraw).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">Planned Parenthood also produced substantial evidence before the district court on the issue of feasibility of monitoring. Finally, in its brief to this court, the State has conceded that the spending practices of the Southern Arizona branch of Planned Parenthood adequately segregate state funds from abortion-related services. Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 9 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">The State contends that the spending practices of Planned Parenthood of Northern and Central Arizona demonstrate the impossibility of monitoring. This is simply not so. The State to monitor effectively need not be present at every client and patient interview. The fact is that the State has not attempted to monitor expenditures by Planned Parenthood. The most that can be said is that misuse of funds is possible so long as the State fails to monitor spending. This is a far cry from evidence that monitoring is not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">In short, Planned Parenthood has submitted convincing evidence on the feasibility of monitoring the funds. The State has not controverted that evidence and even admits that Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona has successfully segregated state funds from its abortion-related expenditures. We hold, after a <em>de novo </em>review, that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the constitutionality of paragraph two of the Arizona footnote as applied against Planned Parenthood and its patients was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-15\">ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES IN THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">Because Planned Parenthood prevailed in the litigation, the district court awarded it attorneys\u2019 fees under the Civil Rights Attorney Fee Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. It calculated the award in two steps. First, it multiplied the number of hours Planned Parenthood attorneys spent on the case by the customary hourly rates of those attorneys. This produced the \u201clodestar amount.\u201d Second, it increased that award by a multiplier of ten percent. The State objects to this award on two fronts. First, it argues that the award included \u201cexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary\u201d costs. Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 12-13. Second, it challenges the application of the multiplier in light of <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-17\">At the outset we note that determination of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cis within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Rutherford v. Pitchess, </em>713 F.2d 1416, 1420 (9th Cir.1983); <em>see Hensley v. Ecker-hart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (emphasizing \u201cthe district court\u2019s superior understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters\u201d). We also acknowledge that looking over the shoulders of attorneys to examine their charges is not a task welcomed by judges. Fee shifting makes our scrutiny necessary, however. Even though our competence to undertake this scrutiny is limited at best, we must assume the burden because at present no other bearer is available. Somebody must decide what fees should appropriately be shifted to the loser. No doubt our \u201cincompetence\u201d in this area is no greater than it is in many others in which we are compelled to render decisions; and it is, I suspect, our limited ability to avoid deci-sionmaking, in comparison to that enjoyed by the other two great branches of government, that induces many litigants to crowd our portals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">So, in full awareness of our limitations, we address the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">A. <em>The \u201cExcessive\" Costs Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">The State relies on <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>for its argument that the district court\u2019s award forces the State to reimburse Planned Parenthood for improper expenses. <em>Hensley </em>discussed the adjustments district courts should make in section 1988 awards when plaintiffs have been only partially successful. In the course of that discussion, the Court explicated its views on calculation of the lodestar amount. The Court\u2019s ideas regarding excess cost are both reasonable and not unusual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-7\">Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. \u201cIn the private sector, \u2018billing judgment\u2019 is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>client </em>also are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>adversary </em>pursuant to statutory authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 (quoting <em>Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 891 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc)) (emphasis by <em>Copeland </em>court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">Hours expended in pursuit of unsuccessful claims in civil rights cases were treated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-10\">Many civil rights cases will present only a single claim. In other cases the plaintiff\u2019s claims for relief will involve a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories. Much of counsel\u2019s time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims. Instead the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-11\">Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee. Normally this will encompass all hours reasonably expended on the litigation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\"><em>Id. </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">Neither hours not properly billed to one\u2019s client nor hours expended on discrete and unsuccessful claims exist in this case. The State lists four categories of attorney effort to which it objects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av6\">time spent for the unsuccessful attempt to name the State of Arizona as a defendant; their attempt at garnishment to collect the previously awarded attorneys\u2019 fees judgment; the time spent on whether the preliminary injunction appeal was moot pursuant to this Court\u2019s request; and the time spent on the void-for-vagueness issue which this Court has decided in the defendant\u2019s favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-14\">Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 12. We think that a reasonable client who had received the results obtained in this litigation would not cavil at being billed for these ancillary efforts. We also think that it is improper in this case to categorize any of these efforts as discrete claims. The thrust of this lawsuit was Planned Parenthood's ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>fort to continue receiving state funds. All of these activities are aimed at that result. We hold that all of the challenged activities are properly compensable by an attorneys\u2019 fee award under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\">B. <em>Use of a Multiplier Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">We approach the use of a multiplier somewhat differently, however. In <em>Planned Parenthood I, </em>the panel concluded that \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that the court abused its discretion in any way in determining the appropriate \u2018multiplier\u2019 or adjustment factor.\u201d 718 F.2d at 951. First, because the panel vacated the fee award when it remanded the case for further factfinding on the first amendment claim, we are not bound by the <em>Planned Parenthood I </em>panel\u2019s consideration of the attorneys\u2019 fee issue. It is clear that the court\u2019s evaluation of the use of the multiplier was dicta. <em>See </em>718 F.2d at 951.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, because the Supreme Court has recently decided a case on this question, <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), we are less inclined than we might ordinarily be to adopt the conclusions of the prior panel without independent consideration. <em>See Kimball v. Callahan, </em>590 F.2d 768, 771-75 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 826, 100 S.Ct. 49, 62 L.Ed.2d 33 (1979); <em>White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d 428, 431-32 (5th Cir. 1967); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4478, at 790-91 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Planned Parenthood suggests two justifications for imposition of a multiplier in this case: the plaintiff\u2019s success in the lawsuit and the contingency of recovery. Our examination of <em>Blum v. Stenson </em>convinces us that neither of these factors justifies the use of a multiplier in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">In <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>the Court discussed the manner in which a plaintiff could justify a section 1988 fee award in excess of the lodestar amount. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he burden of proving that such an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee is on the fee applicant.\u201d 465 U.S. at 898, 104 S.Ct. at 1548. The Court went on to reverse the district court\u2019s imposition of a multiplier because the plaintiff \u201cintroduced no evidence that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901, 104 S.Ct. at 1550.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-15\">Planned Parenthood attempts to justify use of the multiplier by pointing to the success of their efforts. This is inadequate justification. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Blum v. Stenson, see id. </em>at 900, 104 S.Ct. at 1549, adequate compensation for the success of a civil rights plaintiff will normally be secured by an award based on the number of hours billed and the billing rate of the attorneys. Many clients with reasonable bargaining power would insist upon paying no more. We do not think the State of Arizona should be required to shoulder a greater burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-16\">The Supreme Court also addressed the factors of risk and contingency of recovery as bases for upward fee adjustments. The Court seemed to approve an adjustment based on \u201crisks associated with the litigation or claim that the risk of nonpayment required an upward adjustment to provide a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901, 104 S.Ct. at 1550; <em>accord LaDuke v. Nelson, </em>762 F.2d 1318, 1332-33 (9th Cir.1985) (EAJA case); <em>Hall v. Borough of Roselle, </em>747 F.2d 838, 843 (3d Cir.1984) (section 1988 case). The Court\u2019s language apparently refers to the contingent fee arrangement common to many areas of the law. At oral argument, however, counsel for Planned Parenthood conceded that the fee arrangement in this case was not contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-17\">Planned Parenthood\u2019s argument is slightly different. It argues that the controversial nature of the abortion issue makes \u201crisky\u201d the representation of clients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>like Planned Parenthood. It argues that controversial representation may have an adverse effect on the law firm\u2019s other business by soiling its reputation. We recognize that the \u201cundesirable\u201d nature of a case is an appropriate factor in determining attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See, e.g., Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, </em>526 F.2d 67, 69-70 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976); <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 719 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cited with approval in </em>S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (legislative history of \u00a7 1988), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 5908, 5913.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">Nevertheless, we reject this contention as a justification for the imposition of a multiplier in this case. Controversial representation is just as likely to bolster the reputation of a law firm as it is to harm it. Planned Parenthood may have its enemies; but it also has many friends. It is hardly a pariah. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the representation actually posed a substantial risk to the law firm\u2019s business or that any risk presented was not adequately taken into consideration in setting the hourly rate. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Blum </em>predisposes us against the use of a multiplier unless the successful plaintiff has demonstrated that a lodestar amount does not represent a fully compensatory fee. The plaintiffs in this case have made no such showing, but rely instead on abstract arguments in their brief. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it applied a multiplier in calculating the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">Planned Parenthood seeks attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal under section 1988. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201ca prevailing [civil rights] plaintiff \u2018 \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (quoting S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (quoting <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968)), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5908, 5912). Planned Parenthood clearly has prevailed on the merits of this appeal. There are no circumstances making such an award unjust. We hold, therefore, that Planned Parenthood is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees for the reasonable expenses of this appeal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">.
