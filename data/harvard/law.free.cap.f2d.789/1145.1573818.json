Our review of such actions by the district court is limited, and we have stated that its order must be sustained \u201cif it is supported by the proceedings\u201d in that court. <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>780 F.2d 1185, 1189 (1986), <em>citing </em>and <em>quoting </em>from <em>United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243, 250 (5th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge concluded that Cantu presented a substantial risk of flight and that no set of conditions would reasonably assure his appearance at trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-17\">Cantu, a resident alien, is a Mexican citizen who visits Mexico several times a year and has a sister residing there. He is divorced, unemployed, and owns no property in this country. The charges against Cantu \u2014 charges which the government has produced credible evidence upholding \u2014 are serious ones indeed, exposing him upon conviction to maximum punishments of forty years in prison and a half-million dollar fine. In such circumstances we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying Cantu bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-15\">. As an appellate court, we possess no greater competence to review factual findings from this cold record than from one assembled at a trial on the merits. That being the case, the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard seems a proper gauge of record support for such findings. See e.g. United States v. Kreczmer, 636 F.2d 108, 110 (5th Cir. 1981)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
