Shapley and National Communications Systems, Inc. appeal the District Court\u2019s order dismissing their civil rights action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In March 1975, plaintiff Shapley formed plaintiff National Communications Systems, Inc. as a Michigan corporation. Shapley entered into an agreement with the owner of Mesick and Northern Telephone companies, two small telephone companies operating in Michigan, under which National acquired as a holding company all the stock of the two telephone companies. The telephone companies needed a substantial financial investment in their facilities, so National undertook certain capital improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">On September 30, 1976, Northern Telephone Company filed a request for the Michigan Public Service Commission\u2019s approval of the borrowing of funds to finance the improvements. On February 2, 1977, Northern Telephone Company filed a second petition with the Michigan Public Service Commission, this time seeking approval of a $47,000 annual rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Plaintiffs allege that thereafter, Northern Telephone Company and Shapley were subjected to maliciously motivated abuse of the regulatory process by defendants-ap-pellees, members of the Michigan Public Service Commission and the commission itself, with the intended result of destroying plaintiffs\u2019 property and business. According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, defendants intentionally delayed action on plaintiffs\u2019 petitions for unreasonable lengths of time without regulatory justification. Additionally, defendants allegedly asked the commission\u2019s auditor to falsify his calculations in order to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 request for a rate increase. When the auditor refused, defendants fired him. Defendants then appointed an independent appraiser to determine the value of plaintiff\u2019s property and facilities, a value used as a factor in the rate setting process. Defendants allegedly harassed the appraiser and constrained him to substantially understate the value. Moreover, plaintiffs allege, defendants intentionally caused the disruption of telephone service to plaintiffs\u2019 customers by physically destroying plaintiffs\u2019 lines and other equipment and then aggressively solicited public criticism and complaints from plaintiffs\u2019 customers about plaintiffs\u2019 telephone service. Finally, plaintiffs allege that defendants intentionally caused plaintiffs\u2019 costs and expenses incurred in the regulatory proceeding to be unjustifiably increased to more than $200,000 for the purpose of destroying plaintiffs\u2019 ability to provide telephone service to their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">On May 4, 1984, plaintiffs filed this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that defendants had, under color of state law, deprived plaintiffs of their property without due process of law, and under section 1985(3), alleging that defendants had conspired to deprive plaintiffs of equal protection and due process. The named defendants in the suit are the Michigan Public Service Commission and four present and past members of the commission. By this suit, plaintiffs sought $5,000,000 in damages. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. After a hearing on the motion, the District Court granted the motion in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The District Court ruled that the eleventh amendment barred the plaintiffs\u2019 action against the Michigan Public Service Commission and against the commissioners in their official capacities. The District Court judge further ruled that if plaintiffs\u2019 action against the commissioners attempted to reach them in their individual capacities, the due process claim should be dismissed as required by <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527,101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Lastly, the judge determined, <em>sua sponte, </em>that he should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this action and dismissed any remaining claims under <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co., </em>319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943), and <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Association v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 102 S.Ct. 177, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At oral argument plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admitted that the District Court properly dismissed the claims against the Michigan Public Service Commission and any claims against the commissioners in their official capacity. Plaintiffs do not appeal the District Court\u2019s order in this respect, and we therefore state no opinion on the eleventh amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal centers mainly around the District Court\u2019s dismissal of their individual-capacity \u00a7 1983 claim against the commissioners alleging the deprivation of a property interest without procedural due process. Plaintiffs do not allege a taking under the fifth amendment, a seizure of property under the fourth amendment, or any other claim incorporated by the fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process clause. This then is simply a \u00a7 1983 damage suit for deprivation of property without procedural due process. In <em>Vicory v. Walton, </em>721 F.2d 1062 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 125, 83 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), this Court dealt with another such suit and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">in section 1983 damage suits for deprivation of property without procedural due process the plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving the inadequacy of state processes, including state damage remedies to redress the claimed wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVz\">721 F.2d at 1063. This requirement was imposed under the authority of <em>Parratt v. Taylor, supra, </em>and the Supreme Court applied a similar requirement a year after <em>Vicory </em>in <em>Hudson v. Palmer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Plaintiffs failed to plead the inadequacy of state processes. On appeal they advance two arguments relevant to this point. First, plaintiffs argue that the requirement of showing the inadequacy of state remedies, which grew out of <em>Parratt, </em>applies only to deprivations caused by random and unauthorized acts of misconduct, as opposed to the alleged conspiratorial acts involved in the case at bar where the alleged conspirators are the public officials whose duty it was to see that plaintiffs were not denied due process. Plaintiffs advance no authority for this contention. In <em>Vicory </em>the Court rebuffed a similar attempt to distinguish <em>Parratt.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-15\">As we read <em>Parratt, </em>the principle being applied does not turn on the question of whether the claimed constitutional tort affecting property is caused by intentional conduct or negligent conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or is based on strict liability. Nor does it matter whether the writ at common law would be in detinue (action for wrongful detention of a chattel by a bailor), trespass <em>de bonis asportatis </em>(action for carrying away plaintiff\u2019s chattels), trespass on the case (roughly speaking, an action for negligence) or a motion in a criminal case for return of property held as evidence. The reasoning of <em>Parratt </em>appears to extend at least to all section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1983 cases claiming a procedural due process injury to a property interest____<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">721 F.2d at 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Plaintiffs next argue that any existing state law remedies are per se inadequate because state law clothes the commissioners in absolute immunity from liability in a suit for damages based on the commissioners\u2019 official conduct. In <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>the Supreme Court dealt with a similar contention. The Court examined state law on the immunity question and determined that the defendant would not be entitled to sovereign immunity. 104 S.Ct. at 3205. The Supreme Court of Michigan recently addressed the sovereign immunity issue in some detail. <em>Ross v. Consumers Power Co., </em>420 Mich. 567, 363 N.W.2d 641 (1984). In regard to the question of immunity of government officials, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">We therefore hold that judges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government are absolutely immune from all tort liability whenever they are acting within their judicial, legislative, or executive authority. Lower level officials, employees, and agents are immune from tort liability only when they are</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">1) acting during the course of their employment and acting, or reasonably believe they are acting, within the scope of their authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">2) acting in good faith; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">3) performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">Under this test, no individual immunity exists for <em>ultra vires </em>activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">420 Mich. at 633-34, 363 N.W.2d at 667-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">The defendant commissioners are not \u201chighest executive officials\u201d entitled to absolute immunity against claims such as the ones here for malicious destruction of property. Therefore, as is the case with other lower level state officials, the commissioners are immune from tort liability under state law only if, among other things, the commissioners\u2019 acts giving rise to potential liability were committed in good faith. Plaintiffs allege that defendants acted with malice and an intent to ruin plaintiffs\u2019 business and to deprive them of property. If plaintiffs were to prove their allegations in state court, the requirement of good faith action would defeat the defendant commissioners\u2019 claim to individual immunity. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the individual defendants would not enjoy sovereign immunity if plaintiffs pursued the remedies afforded by state procedures. It may be that plaintiffs would not be entitled, under state law, to the same relief potentially available in an action brought under Civil Rights Act. Nevertheless, it has long been recognized that the fact that state procedures would not afford relief identical to that sought in the civil rights action does not make those procedures constitutionally inadequate. <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. at 544, 101 S.Ct. at 1917; <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3204.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">In short, Michigan law presents a variety of procedures to redress the wrongs that plaintiffs assert. Not only could plaintiffs have taken an appeal from the regulatory proceedings before the Public Service Commission, but they could have brought a state law action in tort or restitution, not to mention seeking one of the different extraordinary writs available to force the commissioners to cease intentionally acting outside their authority. Plaintiffs failed to show that these available procedures did not afford the process that is due under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">The District Court did not deal specifically with plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim brought under \u00a7 1985(3). Nevertheless, it appears clearly from the record that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>claim will not lie, and we affirm the dismissal of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants denied them equal protection by classifying all telephone companies operating in Michigan according to size and then intentionally discriminating against the small telephone companies. In <em>Browder v. Tipton, </em>630 F.2d 1149 (6th Cir.1980), this Court held that the \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d language of \u00a7 1985(3) protected only the \u201cso-called \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 minorities that receive special protection under the Equal Protection Clause because of inherently personal characteristics.\u201d 630 F.2d at 1150. Additionally, \u201c[s]ection 1985(3) clearly does not reach all torts or equal protection violations measured by the rationality test.\u201d 630 F.2d at 1159. Small telephone companies are not members of a discrete and insular minority of the sort that has traditionally received special protection under the suspect classification analysis of the fourteenth amendment. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1985(3) claims do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of all claims involved in this action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">. The Supreme Court recently closed the possibility of a \u00a7 1983 procedural due process case based on negligent conduct. <em>Daniels v. Wil-Hams, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-13\">. This requirement has also been extended to \u00a7 1983 procedural due process cases involving liberty interests. <em>Wilson v. Beebe, </em>770 F.2d 578 (6th Cir.1985) (en banc); cases cited <em>supra </em>note 1 (apparently extending this requirement <em>sub </em>silentio).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel maintained that the equal protection claim was brought under \u00a7 1985(3) only. We therefore need not consider whether the above holding would also apply to an equal protection claim asserted under \u00a7 1983. Likewise, we state no opinion on the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claims on alternative grounds of abstention and comity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
