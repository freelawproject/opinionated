(\u201cSOCOL\u201d), a limited partnership, and other plaintiffs filed suit in district court alleging that defendants violated federal securities laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1964 (1982), as well as state law. The suit arose out of the promotion and sale by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>defendants of certain interests in oil and gas development programs through a complicated series of financial transactions. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the federal claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, without leave to amend, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. The district court also dismissed the pendent state claims. This court heard arguments on the case but vacated the submission, pending the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). That case having been decided, we now consider SOCOL\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">I. RICO Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The district court dismissed the RICO claim because the claim did not allege that plaintiffs \u201cwere injured by a racketeering type injury\u201d or that defendants inflicted \u201cany additional or different injury from that allegedly sustained by the underlying acts.\u201d <em>Sedima, </em>however, has clearly rejected the requirements of a \u201cracketeering\u201d injury and an injury distinct from that caused by the predicate acts themselves. The Supreme Court stated: \u201cThere is no room in the statutory language for an additional, amorphous \u2018racketeering injury\u2019 requirement.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3285. Further, a RICO claim \u201cis not deficient for failure to allege ... an injury separate from the financial loss stemming from the alleged [predicate] acts____\u201d Id. at 3287. Plaintiffs need only allege injuries caused by (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. Id. at 3285; <em>Miller v. Glen &amp; Helen Aircraft, Inc., </em>777 F.2d 496, 498 (9th Cir.1985). Plaintiffs have alleged these elements and thus the dismissal of the RICO claim is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">II. Securities Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">The district court dismissed the securities claims because it found that the transactions did not constitute \u201csecurities\u201d and thus could not state a cause of action under federal securities law, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 771, 78j(b) (1982). We review de novo this dismissal and the determination whether these transactions constituted \u201csecurities.\u201d <em>Preferred Communications, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>754 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 380, 88 L.Ed.2d 333 (1985); <em>SEC v. Goldfield Deep Mines Co. of Nevada, </em>758 F.2d 459, 463 (9th Cir.1985). The Supreme Court has instructed that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102-03, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). The complaint must be liberally construed in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, and generally we take as true all facts as alleged. <em>Rosen v. Walters, </em>719 F.2d 1422, 1424 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Under these guidelines, we find that a triable issue of fact remains as to whether the transactions did constitute \u201csecurities.\u201d One transaction involved the \u201cMinoco Agreements,\u201d a series of economic arrangements under which defendants conveyed fractional interests in oil and gas rights to plaintiffs in return for cash and letters of credit. The parties also executed a \u201cManagement Agreement,\u201d which provided that defendants and affiliated companies would manage the oil and gas operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">\u201c[Fractional undivided interest[s] in oil, gas, or other mineral rights\u201d are specifically included in the definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d found in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(1). The Supreme Court has recently held that a transaction involving \u201cstock,\u201d which is also included within the statutory definition, automatically constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d see <em>Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2297, 2303, 85 L.Ed.2d 692 (1985); <em>Gould v. Ruefenacht, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2308, 2310, 85 L.Ed.2d 4607 (1985), and the Third Circuit in a well-reasoned opinion has extended this reasoning to encompass undivided interests in mineral rights, <em>Penturelli v. Spector, Cohen, Gadon &amp; Rosen, P.C., </em>779 F.2d 160, 164-67 (3d Cir.1985). We are not attempting to resolve at this time, however, whether all transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>that fit within the statutory definition automatically constitute \u201csecurities.\u201d The Supreme Court left this issue open, stating: \u201cWe here expressly leave until another day the question whether \u2018notes\u2019 or \u2018bonds\u2019 or some other category of instrument listed in the definition might be shown \u2018by proving [only] the document itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Landreth, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2306 (quoting <em>SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., </em>320 U.S. 344, 355, 64 S.Ct. 120, 125, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943)) (brackets supplied by Court). Instead, using this Circuit\u2019s \u201crisk capital\u201d test, see <em>Underhill v. Royal, </em>769 F.2d 1426, 1431 (9th Cir.1985), we conclude that there is a factual question whether plaintiffs contributed risk capital subject to the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. See <em>United California Bank v. THC Financial Corp., </em>557 F.2d 1351, 1356-57 (9th Cir.1977). Reading the complaint liberally, as we must under a 12(b)(6) motion, SOCOL has alleged facts which, if proved, entitle it to relief under the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that defendants exercised a major degree of control over the drilling operations. Any control plaintiffs had was illusory due to their lack of experience in the drilling business and the financing package by which defendant Craigmuir obtained an assignment of SOCOL\u2019s assets in the program. Cf. <em>Parvin v. Davis Oil Co., </em>524 F.2d 112, 114-16 (9th Cir.1975) (even though plaintiff had \u201csubstantial experience\u201d in oil and gas investment and had control over some drilling decisions, transaction met risk capital test because \u201cmajor decisions which would effect success or failure were made by the [defendants]\u201d); <em>Johnsen v. Rogers, </em>551 F.Supp. 281, 288 (C.D.Cal.1982) (finding risk capital test met even though plaintiff had option to manage oil and gas lease itself or to contract with someone else).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Because we find that the allegations concerning the Minoco Agreements are sufficient to defeat a motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim, we do not need to consider extensively the second transaction alleged to be a security. The district court concluded that that transaction, the sale of limited partnership interests in SOCOL, did not constitute a security because any practices forbidden by the securities laws did not occur in connection with the sale of the partnership interests. The fact finder must look at \u201cthe economic realities underlying a transaction,\u201d <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 849, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2059, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975), and the economic realities alleged in the complaint are that the formation of the limited partnership was tied with the agreements to convey interests in oil and gas rights and to finance the program. These acts can be read to have occurred \u201cin the offer or sale of,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), and \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), the fractional interest in the oil and gas leasehold. Under the broad construction to be given remedial legislation such as the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, see <em>SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 476, 480 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 821, 94 S.Ct. 117, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973), such allegations are sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">III. Pendent State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">SOCOL asserted claims for fraud, specific performance, and state securities law violations. The district court dismissed these state law claims when it dismissed the federal claims. The \u201cdetermination of whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent state claims is within the discretion of the district court, and the district court is not required to exercise such jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Vigman, </em>764 F.2d 1309, 1318 (9th Cir.1985); see also <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Thus we remand for the district court to consider whether the state law claims should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">For the reasons set forth, we reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint. The district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing the RICO claim cannot stand in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Sedima. </em>Reading the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>liberally, we reverse the dismissal of the securities claims because a triable issue of fact remains as to whether the transactions meet the risk capital test for finding a \u201csecurity.\u201d Because the district court dismissed the pendent state law counts based on its dismissal of the federal counts, those claims are remanded to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
