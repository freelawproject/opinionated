Appellant argues that in authorizing these awards of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the district court abused its discretion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the award of costs against appellant, but reverse both awards of attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for further proceedings the award of fees against appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">Plaintiff-appellant Gwendolyn E. Jones (Jones) brought this action against defendant-appellee The Continental Insurance Company (employer) alleging employment discrimination under Title VII and \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a bench tidal on the merits, the district court entered judgment for the employer on all claims in the complaint. <em>Jones v. Continental Corporation, </em>No. 82-3572, slip op. (M.D.Tenn. June 29, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-19\">The evidence showed that Ms. Jones, a black woman, had been employed from May, 1977 to August, 1983 at the employer\u2019s Nashville office. She had been steadily promoted from her starting position as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>rate and code clerk, to senior rate and code clerk (Aug. 14, 1978), to underwriter trainee (Aug. 13, 1979), to associate underwriter (Nov. 3, 1980), and to underwriter (May 4, 1981). There is no dispute that the plaintiffs employment was terminated in August of 1983, following receipt of a letter written by her to the employer\u2019s largest local client, an insurance agency, accusing employees of the latter of \u201chate and prejudices\u201d to Ms. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Ms. Jones sought to prove that, in several actions taken towards her during the period of her employment, her employer was motivated by racial (and secondarily by sexual) prejudice. She claimed to have been repeatedly denied promotions, and to have been denied promotional opportunities \u2014 to attend professional workshops and to socialize with clients \u2014 that routinely were enjoyed by similarly-situated white employees. She claimed to have been singled-out for showing Amway products on work time, when white employees were permitted to sell goods. She claimed that she was deliberately placed at an inadequately-lighted desk, with her back to all white employees, and that her employer was unresponsive to her requests for better lighting or a new desk location. She claimed to have been the object of racially-motivated profanity by white employees and clients, about which her employer allegedly did nothing. She claimed to have been passed over for promotion to supervising underwriter in favor of a less-qualified white employee (Carol Brown) who transferred from the San Francisco office. While these claims were pending, Jones was discharged, ostensibly for writing an insulting letter to a major client. She then amended her complaint to add the final claim that her termination was racially-motivated, and that the proffered excuse was mere pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">The district court found that Jones\u2019s proof was so insubstantial that she had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of illegal discrimination only as to the Carol Brown transfer. The court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqiJ\">against the plaintiff because of her lack of credibility. The plaintiff assumed her knowledge of her work place was omniscient. Many of her complaints were never communicated to her superiors. Many that were, were picayune. In short, the plaintiff could be a quite petty person who assumed that anything that did not suit her was a product of racial prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\"><em>Jones v. Continental Corporation, </em>No. 82-3572, slip op. at 4 (M.D.Tenn. June 29, 1984). Jones appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal on the merits in a companion case, alleging that the court\u2019s failure to find disparate treatment was clear error. We have previously affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits. <em>Jones v. Continental Corporation, </em>785 F.2d 308, (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Following his judgment in favor of the employer, the district judge assessed some attorney\u2019s fees against Jones, as a losing party, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; and some against her counsel, for unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the litigation, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, and under the court\u2019s inherent powers to punish those who litigate in bad faith, <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980). The court also taxed costs against the plaintiff. While the court did not hold a hearing prior to these decisions awarding fees and costs, it did receive briefs from both parties, and filed a memorandum. Subsequently, the court by additional memorandum denied motions to alter or amend judgment. Ms. Jones and her counsel appeal the orders assessing fees and costs, and denying their motions to alter or amend judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">Although the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d has been and remains that parties to litigation must bear their own attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>federal courts recognize several exceptions to this general rule. <em>See generally Tarter v. Raybuck, </em>742 F.2d 977, 984-86 (6th Cir. 1984). An award of attorney\u2019s fees, whether granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, or under the court\u2019s \u201cinherent powers,\u201d rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Bowers v. Kraft Foods Corp., </em>606 F.2d 816, 818 (8th Cir.1979) (\u00a7 1988); <em>United States v. Blod-gett, </em>709 F.2d 608, 610 (9th Cir.1983) (\u00a7 1927); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752,100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (court\u2019s inherent powers). Similarly, while an award of costs against a losing party is \u201ca normal incident of defeat,\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 352, 101 S.Ct. 1146, 1150, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981) , a court may, of course, in its discretion, choose not to tax costs. Accordingly, our only inquiry as to each aspect of the instant appeal is whether the awards represent an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Tarter v. Raybuck, </em>742 F.2d 977, 986 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">There is no doubt that a federal district court, in the sound exercise of its discretion, may assess attorney\u2019s fees against losing <em>counsel, </em>as well as against a losing party. In <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980), the Supreme Court, while finding no statutory authority for such an award, determined that it could be upheld under the court\u2019s \u201cinherent powers,\u201d upon a finding that an attorney \u201cwillfully abuse[d] judicial processes\u201d by conduct \u201ctantamount to bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2463-64. Congress subsequently amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 to grant statutory authority for an award of \u201cthe excess costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred\u201d due to conduct by an attorney that \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (1982) (as amended by Pub.L. 96-349, \u00a7 3, 94 Stat. 1156 (Sept. 12, 1980)). The effect of the amendment was to nullify that part of <em>Roadway Express </em>which held that former \u00a7 1927 permitted assessment against losing attorneys only of \u201ccosts,\u201d not of attorney\u2019s fees, thus adding a statutory power to the \u201cinherent power\u201d recognized in <em>Roadway Express. </em>447 U.S. at 757-64, 100 S.Ct. at 2459-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">In the instant case, the district judge based his conclusion that Ms. Jones\u2019s attorneys had unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the litigation on two aspects of the attorneys\u2019 conduct. First, the court noted that Jones\u2019s counsel had failed to respond timely to the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss, which was twice renewed in the course of the proceedings. Appendix 97-98. The original motion was accompanied by a brief, noting <em>inter alia </em>that Jones\u2019s complaint failed to specify under which statute (Title VII or \u00a7 1981) the individual defendants were being sued, under which statute the sex (as opposed to race) discrimination claims were being brought, and under which statute damages were being requested. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The motion to dismiss was accompanied by a letter indicating a willingness to withdraw the motion if Jones would amend her pleadings to eliminate certain defendants, and would \u201comit the claims discussed in our brief which are not subject to litigation here.\u201d Appendix 42. Jones never amended her complaint (except to add parties and claims), and in her eventual response to the motion to dismiss, did not address the motion\u2019s request for more specific pleadings. Appendix 284. This last omission took on importance, in the eyes of the court, when Jones\u2019s counsel refused to sign a pretrial order that would have simplified the issues for trial. Appendix 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">In awarding attorney\u2019s fees, the district court concluded that counsel\u2019s original \u201csloppy\u201d pleading, together with their failure to cure it by amendment, was a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>for an award of fees under \u00a7 1927. The court also found that the reason Ms. Jones\u2019s counsel had refused to sign the pretrial order \u2014 purportedly the product of an all-day negotiating session between both sides \u2014 was unrelated to the substance of the proposed order, but rather was an attempt to pressure the employer\u2019s counsel into waiving rights to certain attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded, based on this second finding, that the refusal to execute the pretrial order was an additional basis for an assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against Jones\u2019s counsel under \u00a7 1927. Jones\u2019s counsel do not argue that the pretrial order would not have reduced the number or complexity of issues to be tried; rather, counsel contend only that there is no evidence that they refused to approve the order with the improper motive found by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">\n<em>\u201cUnreasonable and Vexatious Multiplication\u201d of Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">This circuit has yet to construe the meaning of the \u201cunreasonable and vexatious multiplication\u201d standard of \u00a7 1927, or of the \u201cbad faith\u201d standard of <em>Roadway Express. Cf. Shimman v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 18, </em>744 F.2d 1226, 1228-34 (6th Cir.1984) (en banc). Some courts have concluded that an assessment under \u00a7 1927, like one under <em>Roadway Express\u2019s </em>\u201cinherent powers\u201d standard, requires a finding that the attorney acted either with recklessness or in bad faith. <em>Suslick v. Rothschild Securities Corp., </em>741 F.2d 1000, 1006 (7th Cir.1984) (bad faith); <em>United States v. Blodgett. </em>709 F.2d 608, 610 (9th Cir.1983) (recklessness or bad faith). However, some opinions have used language indicating that the \u201cbad faith\u201d requirement is limited to the court\u2019s inherent powers, and that the \u201cunreasonable and vexatious multiplication\u201d requirement of the amended statute is a different and lower standard. <em>Lewis v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1287, 1292 (5th Cir. 1983), <em>aff'd in part on reconsideration, </em>722 F.2d 209 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1231, 104 S.Ct. 2690, 81 L.Ed.2d 884 (1984). This standard has been found to be met when an attorney, though not guilty of conscious impropriety, \u201cintentionally ... [pursues] a claim that lacks plausible legal or factual basis.\u201d <em>Knorr Brake Corp. v. Harbil, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 223, 226-27 (7th Cir. 1984). Our court\u2019s most recent opinion appears to endorse \u00e1 distinction between the two powers of the court, with the bad faith standard applying to the court\u2019s inherent powers, and the lower \u201cunreasonable and vexatious multiplication\u201d standard applying to assessments under \u00a7 1927. <em>Reynolds v. Humko Products, </em>756 F.2d 469, 473 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">We are persuaded that the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>KnorrBrake, </em>have accurately discerned the meaning of \u00a7 1927. To hold that subjective \u201cbad faith\u201d remains as necessary under amended \u00a7 1927 as under <em>Roadway Express </em>would be to assume that the amendment added nothing to the \u201cinherent powers\u201d recognized in that case. Since we must assume that Congress intended the post <em>-Roadway Express </em>change in \u00a7 1927 to have effect, we hold that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 authorizes a court to assess fees against an attorney for \u201cunreasonable and vexatious\u201d multiplication of litigation despite the absence of any conscious impropriety. An attorney\u2019s ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on behalf of his or her client does not amount to <em>carte blanche </em>to burden the federal courts by pursuing claims that are frivolous on the merits, or by pursuing nonfrivolous claims through the use of multiplicative litigation tactics that are harassing, dilatory, or otherwise \u201cunreasonable and vexatious.\u201d Accordingly, at least when an attorney knows or reasonably should know that a claim pursued is frivolous, or that his or her litigation tactics will needlessly obstruct the litigation of nonfrivolous claims, a trial court does not err by assessing fees attributable to such actions against the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">Applying this standard to the case before us, we are unable to perceive anything in the record that would support a conclusion that Jones\u2019s counsel knew or should have known that failure to amend their plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>ings would retain frivolous claims in the litigation, or needlessly obstruct the litigation of nonfrivolous claims. Likewise, we can find no basis in the record for the district court\u2019s determination that the reason for failing to approve the pretrial order was to pressure the employer\u2019s counsel into waiving certain attorney\u2019s fees. We treat these two bases for the district court\u2019s award in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">a. <em>failure to amend </em>complaint\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The employer\u2019s counsel argues, and the district court seems to have concluded, that Jones\u2019s pleadings contained \u201cglaring legal deficiencies,\u201d and that the failure to correct those deficiencies by amendment was \u201cunreasonable and vexatious.\u201d Appendix 97-98. Specifically, the district court relied on three deficiencies in the complaint: failure to specify under which statute the sex (as opposed to race) discrimination claims were brought; failure to specify under which statute the individual defendants (as opposed to the employer) were being sued; and failure to specify under which statute damages of $1,000,-000.00 were sought. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">Jones\u2019s complaint begins by identifying the foundations for the lawsuit as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 2000e, and the thirteenth amendment. Appendix 111. The complaint then alleges facts and concludes with several requests for relief. <em>Id. </em>117-18. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the failure to clarify the \u201cdeficiencies\u201d noted above constituted \u201cunreasonable and vexatious multiplication\u201d of the litigation must rest on the extent to which the employer\u2019s counsel was burdened with unnecessary research or preparation as a result of the supposed lack of specificity occasioned by the complaint\u2019s format. We cannot agree that these so-called deficiencies were so substantial, confusing or otherwise burdensome that failure to amend them met the \u201cunreasonable and vexatious\u201d standard we have described.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">To begin with, federal law is quite clear that \u00a7 1981 prohibits only race discrimination, not sex discrimination. <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976). The most cursory research thus would have revealed that the sex discrimination claims were properly brought only under Title VII. In light of the clarity of the law on this point, the only tenable reading of Jones\u2019s complaint is that sex discrimination claims were brought only under Title VII; no significant attorney time could possibly have been spent preparing a defense to any hypothetical \u00a7 1981 sex discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">Similarly, the law is clear that individuals may be held liable for violations of \u00a7 1981, <em>e.g., Taylor v. Jones, </em>653 F.2d 1193, 1200 (8th Cir.1981) (\u201cSection 1981 applies to all types of racial discrimination, public or private\u201d); <em>Faraca v. Clements, </em>506 F.2d 956, 957 (5th Cir.1975) (individual director held liable while corporation exonerated); <em>Vietnamese Fishermen\u2019s Association v. Knights of Ku Klux Klan, </em>518 F.Supp. 993, 1008 (S.D.Texas 1981) (\u201cprivate citizens are proper defendants\u201d in suits under \u00a7 1981), and as \u201cagents\u201d of an employer under Title VII, <em>e.g. Owens v. Rush, </em>636 F.2d 283 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Robson v. Eva\u2019s Super Market, Inc., </em>538 F.Supp. 857, 862-63 (N.D.Ohio 1982); <em>Munford v. James T. Barnes &amp; Co., </em>441 F.Supp. 459, 466 (E.D. Mich.1977); <em>Compston v. Borden, Inc., </em>424 F.Supp. 157, 158 (S.D.Ohio 1976). Since the individual employees sued were at least arguably \u201cagents\u201d of the employer, we think it obvious that Jones\u2019s counsel were intentionally and properly seeking recovery against the individuals under both statutes. Thus, we are at a loss to understand how failure to amend to \u201cclarify\u201d this point could have \u201cmultiplied\u201d this aspect of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Finally, this circuit has long held that Title VII does not authorize general compensatory damages; it authorizes only back pay and other equitable relief, making clear that the request for \u201cdamages\u201d of $1,000,000.00 applied only to the \u00a7 1981 claim. <em>E.g. Harrington v. Vandalia-Butler Board of Education, </em>585 F.2d 192 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 932, 99 S.Ct. 2053, 60 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 48 A.L.R.Fed. 330 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">In short, while the amended complaint certainly is a boilerplate effort, and certainly could have been more artfully drawn, its meaning is sufficiently clear as written. The ambiguities argued by employer\u2019s counsel are so easily resolved that failure to amend cannot be characterized as unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of the litigation. We therefore hold that any award of attorney\u2019s fees based solely on failure to amend the complaint as requested was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">b. <em>failure to sign pretrial </em>order\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">It does not follow, however, that counsel\u2019s failure to sign the pretrial order limiting the issues to be tried could not have amounted to a violation of \u00a7 1927. Even a well-pleaded complaint may contain issues or claims that need not be tried, and should be resolved by stipulation of opposing counsel prior to trial. When counsel reach agreement on such a narrowing of issues, they reduce the amount of litigation remaining. If, after agreeing to such a narrowing of issues, one attorney then refuses to sign the pretrial order unless his or her adversary waives a wholly separate claim or right, that refusal necessarily multiplies the issues that must be tried. The refusal to approve such an agreed-upon order amounts to bad faith, and thus would justify an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the court\u2019s inherent powers or under \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">The record in the instant case provides no support for the conclusion that counsel\u2019s refusal to sign the pretrial order was motivated by a bad faith desire to pressure the employer into waiver of rights to attorney\u2019s fees. The employer cites the transcript of a hearing held on December 14, 1982 in support of the district court\u2019s finding; yet at no point in the transcript of that hearing was Jones\u2019s counsel questioned about this issue. <em>See </em>Appendix 155-67. Indeed, in his decision to proceed without a pretrial order, the district judge primarily criticized counsel\u2019s failure to comply with discovery. <em>Id. </em>This incomplete record thus will not support an inference that refusal to sign the pretrial order was undertaken in bad faith. We therefore agree with Jones\u2019s counsel that a hearing to resolve this factual issue must precede any award of attorney\u2019s fees for failure to sign the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees against a losing plaintiff in a civil rights action is an extreme sanction, and must be limited to truly egregious cases of misconduct. The Supreme Court has indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-11\">a plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable or groundless ... [a]nd, needless to say, if a plaintiff is found to have brought or continued such a claim in <em>bad faith, </em>there will be an even stronger basis for charging him with attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av8-dedup-0\"><em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) <em>(Christiansburg </em>test applies to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988); <em>Tarter v. Raybuck, </em>742 F.2d 977, 984-88 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">In the instant case, the district court concluded that Jones\u2019s claim for wrongful termination was obviously frivolous from the first. Jones unquestionably was terminated almost immediately after accusing an employee of her employer\u2019s largest local client of \u201chate and prejudices\u201d in a letter. Reasoning that after such a letter, \u201cthe defendants would have been completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>justified in firing the plaintiff,\u201d Appendix 99, the district court assessed against Jones fees incurred in defending that claim only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">These remarks fall short of a finding that Jones\u2019s termination claim was frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, and indeed, the existing record is inadequate to support such a finding. In a disparate treatment case, the question before the court is not whether the employer <em>would have been </em>justified in firing the plaintiff for her conduct; the question is whether <em>in fact </em>the plaintiff\u2019s firing was racially-motivated. The district court found that it was not, and this finding is not clearly erroneous. But we think it undeniable that Ms. Jones presented a tenable claim. She was fired during the period when her trial was in recess. Thus, her employer was fully aware that she was suing it for a variety of alleged discriminations. It certainly is plausible that in that situation, the employer might have been looking for any pretextual excuse to terminate Jones\u2019s employment. In fact, Jones attempted to prove such pretext, by introducing evidence that other white employees had also made errors costing the company money, but had not been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Here, the record contains nothing to indicate that Ms. Jones was completely unjustified in believing her discharge \u2014 in the middle of protracted litigation against her employer \u2014 to be the result of racial or retaliatory motives. That the district court found Jones\u2019s contention to be erroneous as a factual matter, and concluded that there was no pretext in her firing, does not render her claim frivolous, unreasonable or groundless. We therefore reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees against Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d), the trial court, in the sound exercise of its discretion, may tax the costs of litigation against a losing party. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that the rule, which provides that costs <em>\u201cshall </em>be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs,\u201d signals the general proposition that \u201cliability for costs is a normal incident of defeat.\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 352, 101 S.Ct. 1146, 1150, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">In the present case, Jones\u2019s argument against being required to pay costs is twofold. First, she argues that taxing costs against a losing civil rights plaintiff would conflict with the remedial purposes of Title VII. Second, she argues that in any event, she should be excused from paying costs due to her indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">The first argument is meritless, especially in a case of so little substance. Jones has cited no authority to support this argument, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">Jones\u2019s second argument also lacks authority. While the Seventh Circuit has recognized that refusal to tax costs against an indigent plaintiff is a permissible exercise of discretion by the district court, <em>Badillo v. Central Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>717 F.2d 1160, 1165 (7th Cir.1983), Jones has cited no case reversing an assessment of costs on the basis of indigency. Here, the district judge, after a review of Jones\u2019s affidavit, concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff has sufficient assets to take out a loan to pay the judgment without being rendered destitute.\u201d Appendix 108. While perhaps the district court might have considered the question of indigency more fully for the record, we are unable to characterize this part of his decision as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">For the reasons stated in our opinion, we REVERSE the judgment assessing attorney\u2019s fees against Jones\u2019s counsel, and REMAND this claim for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">We further REVERSE the judgment assessing attorney\u2019s fees against Jones herself, and REMAND this claim for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">Finally, we AFFIRM the judgment taxing costs against Jones.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">. Plaintiff actually added her employer, The Continental Insurance Company, to an earlier version of the complaint against its parent corporation, The Continental Corporation (Continental), and two individual supervisory employees. We have previously affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the only defendant with potential liability was the employer insurance company, and that court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against the other named defendants. <em>See Jones v. Continental Corp., </em>785 F.2d 308 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">. Jones\u2019s counsel have not argued that the number of hours claimed or rates charged by the employer's counsel were unreasonable or excessive if the work for which fees were requested is found to have been justified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">. We note that the employer moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), rather than, as would have been proper, for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). The subsequent course of the litigation indicates that the district court treated the motion as brought under Rule 12(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">.

Appendix 42. But the district court specifically held that such was not a basis for awarding fees against counsel. Appendix 97. Moreover, the district court never ordered Jones to amend her complaint, or otherwise ruled on the motion to dismiss prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
