We find that the district court, 616 F.Supp. 742, properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s claims, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In the fall of 1983, the Mississippi Board of Bar Admissions (the Board) denied appellant Arlene Nordgren\u2019s bar exam application because she had graduated from a non-ABA accredited law school located in California. Nordgren reapplied to the Board for admission to the February 1984 bar exam on the ground that she satisfied what she alleged to be Mississippi\u2019s alternative admissions requirement, which involves an integrated, six-year course of legal study. The Board again denied Nord-gren\u2019s application on February 27, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Subsequently, Nordgren brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <em>pro se </em>action challenging the constitutionality of that portion of the related Mississippi bar admission rules which exempts from the ABA accreditation and written exam requirements graduates from non-ABA accredited Mississippi law schools but <em>not </em>graduates from non-ABA accredited out-of-state law schools. In addition to her constitutional claims for which she sought declaratory and injunctive relief plus compensatory and punitive damages, appellant sought recovery under antitrust and state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Following the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the appellees, Nord-gren timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">A. Because federal trial courts and Courts of Appeal possess no power to sit in review of state court decisions, the district court in this case properly examined its subject matter jurisdiction under <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Finding that the Board was an arm of the Mississippi Supreme Court and that its actions were judicial in nature, the district court concluded that no jurisdictional foundation supported appellant's claims arising from the Board\u2019s denial of her application. Nordgren challenges this holding on the ground that the Board\u2019s action was not a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d. She raises related arguments, but they involve meritless contentions concerning Article III power, abstention, diversity, pendent and \u201c1983\u201d jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">In determining that the bar proceeding in this case was of a judicial nature, the district court, under the holding in <em>Feldman, </em>was not required to find evidence of the formal trappings normally associated with judicial proceedings. Rather, the district court properly examined whether Nordgren asserted a claim of right and whether the admissions board exercised court-delegated, judicial power by applying Mississippi admissions rules as to her individually. This Court found such a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d analogue in <em>Thomas v. Radish, </em>748 F.2d 276 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3531, 87 L.Ed.2d 655 (1985), where the Texas bar admissions board applied its admissions criteria in denying Thomas admission on mental fitness grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">In this case the Board applied its bar admissions criteria when it denied Nord-gren\u2019s application on educational \u201cfitness\u201d grounds. Like the Texas Board in <em>Thomas, </em>the Mississippi Board exercised admissions power on behalf of the state supreme court, and it did so under rules which were subject to that court\u2019s approval. Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 73-3-2(1) &amp; (3). Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the Mississippi Board\u2019s fitness determinations are subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Like the waiver proceedings in <em>Feldman, </em>the Board\u2019s actions here may not have been cast in the common mold of judicial proceedings, but they were sufficient for the district court to conclude correctly that the Board acted in a judicial capacity within the meaning of <em>Feldman (see Thomas, </em>748 F.2d at 281 &amp; n. 8) when it denied Nord-gren\u2019s application. Nordgren\u2019s quest for review of the specific action as to her own application, therefore, was beyond the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Otherwise we would be undertaking to review a state judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">B. The district court next went on to reach Nordgren\u2019s general constitutional challenges to the Mississippi Bar rules and statutes. Although, as mentioned above, federal courts do \u201cnot have jurisdiction ... over challenges to state-court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional\u201d, <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486, 103 S.Ct. at 1317, they do \u201chave subject-matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules, promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings, which do not require review of a final state-court judgment in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Appellees agree that the district court properly recognized jurisdiction over Nordgren\u2019s \u201cgeneral constitutional challenges\u201d. But even a general attack upon the bar admission rules can implicate subject matter jurisdiction. It, therefore, requires this Court\u2019s examination to see if appellant is making such a general attack. <em>See, e.g., Giannakos v. M/V BRAVO TRADER, </em>762 F.2d 1295, 1297 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Our jurisdictional scrutiny on this issue must be conducted by examining if Nord-gren presented to the district court a general constitutional challenge to the bar admission rules which was not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the Board\u2019s denial of her own application. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 483 n. 16, 486-487, 103 S.Ct. at 1316 n. 16, 1316-1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The distinction \u201cbetween general challenges to state bar rules as promulgated and challenges to [what amounts to] state court decisions in particular cases ... is often difficult to draw.\u201d <em>Razatos v. Colorado Supreme Court, </em>746 F.2d 1429, 1433 (10th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2019, 85 L.Ed.2d 301 (1985); <em>Rogers v. Supreme Court of Virginia, </em>590 F.Supp. 102, 104-108 (E.D.Va.1984). This Court recently applied the distinction in <em>Thomas, </em>where the plaintiff mounted no general attack upon the constitutionality of any rule of the Texas bar admission procedures, 748 F.2d at 277 n. 1, but did allege that his constitutional rights were deprived when the Texas Board, in applying state bar rules, denied his bar application on mental incompetency grounds. Citing <em>Feldman, </em>we held that since Thomas could have sought review of his constitutional claims in the Texas courts, no federal subject matter jurisdiction supported them. 748 F.2d at 281-282. <em>Compare Howell v. State Bar of Texas, </em>710 F.2d 1075, 1077 (5th Cir.1983) <em>(Feldman </em>did not preclude general constitutional challenges to a state\u2019s disciplinary scheme applicable to attorneys), cer<em>t. denied, </em>466 U.S. 950, 104 S.Ct. 2152, 80 L.Ed.2d 538 (1984), <em>cited in Hefner v. Alexander, </em>779 F.2d 277, 282 (5 Cir.1985); <em>Rogers, </em>590 F.Supp. at 106 (no subject matter jurisdiction where plaintiff complains only that her particular constitutional rights were violated by state supreme court).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The record reveals that appellant mounts several \u201cgeneral constitutional challenges\u201d which support subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of <em>Feldman. </em>Feldman, for example, contended that a District of Columbia bar rule was unconstitutional because, <em>inter alia, </em>it created an irrebutable presumption that only accredited law school graduates are fit to practice law. It was held that the district court had jurisdiction to hear this claim because it did not require review of the judicial decision of the District of Columbia as it related specifically to Feldman\u2019s sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tion; it only had to review the rule as promulgated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In the case before us, the appellees do not urge that Nordgren should have appealed the Board\u2019s action through the Mississippi courts, raising her general constitutional challenges there. This affirmative defense was available to appellees but was not asserted by them. It was, therefore, waived. <em>Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exchange of Houston, </em>628 F.2d 500, 507 n. 10 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also, Carbonnell v. Louisiana Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>772 F.2d 185 (5th Cir.1985). Furthermore, this waiver does not implicate our subject matter jurisdiction since a general constitutional attack is within our jurisdiction. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486, 103 S.Ct. at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A. Appellant\u2019s constitutional argument is largely focused on an equal protection of the laws claim grounded upon the fact that the Mississippi bar admits for examination the graduates of certain unaccredited Mississippi law schools but does not admit the graduates of unaccredited <em>out-of-state </em>law schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Nordgren\u2019s constitutional claim leads us to a review of Mississippi bar admission statutes and rules. The bar admission statutory scheme, made effective in 1979, and amended in 1983 to remove residency requirements, requires that bar applicants must be graduates of an ABA-approved law school. Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 73-3-2(2)(a) (1985 supp.). One of the exceptions, however, makes eligible for bar admission those who were enrolled in a law school in Mississippi, whether or not ABA accredited, on November 1,1981, who also graduated before November 1984. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Nordgren has stated a colorable equal protection claim, <em>see Pappanastos v. Board of Trustees, Etc., </em>615 F.2d 219 (5th Cir.1980); <em>compare Attwell v. Nichols, </em>608 F.2d 228, 231 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 955, 100 S.Ct. 2924, 64 L.Ed.2d 813 (1980). But she is a white Jewish female who challenges a classification which is not based upon racial, religious, gender, or other suspect classifications or fundamental rights. <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U.S. 483, 488, 75 S.Ct. 461, 464, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955); <em>Pappanastos, </em>615 F.2d at 221; <em>Moore v. Supreme Court of South Carolina, </em>447 F.Supp. 527, 528 (D.S.C.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>577 F.2d 735 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 984, 99 S.Ct. 574, 58 L.Ed.2d 655 (1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also correctly concluded that appellant cannot successfully assert standing on behalf of aggrieved black applicants to the Mississippi bar. She is not their representative. <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 482, 102 S.Ct. 752, 764, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); <em>see also Town of Ball v. Rapides Parish Police Jury, </em>746 F.2d 1049, 1051 n. 1 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">Because there was nothing suspect about the class appellant undertook to represent, the district court needed to discern only a rational basis in the legislative classification<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> challenged here, <em>Cline v. Supreme </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Court of Georgia, </em>781 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir., 1986). The presumption is in favor of constitutionality. <em>Town of Ball, </em>746 F.2d at 1058. In general the Supreme Court has exhibited extreme deference to legislative classifications in actions challenging regulation of licensed professions. <em>Lupert, </em>761 F.2d at 1328 (and cases cited). This Court need only inquire whether any state of facts reasonably may justify the distinctions embodied in Mississippi\u2019s admissions criteria. <em>Pappanastos, </em>615 F.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The \u201cgrandfather clauses\u201d are distinctions which serve a legitimate state interest. Indeed, it has been held that where a state upgrades professional license requirements, due process may <em>require </em>a \u201cgrandfather provision\u201d. <em>Berger v. Board of Psychologist Examiners, </em>521 F.2d 1056, 1063 (D.C.Cir.1975). In upgrading the bar admission requirements in issue, the Mississippi legislature simply sought to avoid unduly prejudicing those applicants who relied on the pre-1979 statutory avenues for bar admission. Mississippi follows a common pattern in making such provision. <em>See Louis v. Supreme Court of Nevada, </em>490 F.Supp. 1174, 1184 (D.Nev.1980). Sections 73-3-2(2)(a), (b), and (4) represent a transitional stage for bar admissions within the state, and these exceptions all \u201cexpired\u201d in November 1984. Further, since the 1983 amendment deleting the residency requirement, these exceptions have been open to persons from <em>any state, </em>although it is true that the Mississippi law school exception limited non-residential protection only to those who attended the local unaccredited school.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Nordgren\u2019s basic argument is that since her California law school program was the equivalent of the statute's Mississippi law school exception, her right to equal protection under the laws was violated. The district court concluded that the \u201clegislature could reasonably have relied on its own knowledge, combined with that of the Board ... and the [state] Supreme Court, in determining ... the quality of the legal education offered by the Mississippi College School of Law, formerly known as Jackson School of Law.\u201d <em>See also Shenfield v. Prather, </em>387 F.Supp. 676, 686 (N.D. Miss.1974) (three-judge court) (legislature had a reasonable basis for exempting University of Mississippi law graduates from bar exam requirement); <em>Huffman v. Montana Supreme Court, </em>372 F.Supp. 1175 (D.Mont.1974) (Montana law exempting only state law school graduates from taking the bar exam is reasonable and therefore constitutional), <em>aff'd, mem., </em>419 U.S. 955, 95 S.Ct. 216, 42 L.Ed.2d 172 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Were this Court to accept Nordgren\u2019s argument, the Mississippi legislature would be compelled to study and \u201cprovisionally accredit\u201d every non-Mississippi, non-ABA accredited law school which spawns a Mississippi-bound graduate. The Constitution does not demand this much, especially where the challenged provision was of limited duration. <em>Goldsmith v. Pringle, </em>399 F.Supp. 620, 625 (D.Colo.1975) (three-judge court); <em>cf., Sestric v. Clark, </em>765 F.2d 655, 664 (7th Cir.1985) (\u201c[t]he less serious a discrimination is, the less ought to be required to justify it.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 862, 88 L.Ed.2d 901 (1986). The state is only required to abstain from arbitrarily or irrationally waiving its admission requirements. <em>Zeigler v. Jackson, </em>638 F.2d 776, 779 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Louis, </em>490 F.Supp. at 1182. There is here no arbitrary or irrational exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In support of Mississippi\u2019s rational and proper concern is the fact that the state of California, where Nordgren graduated, \u201creminds\u201d students of unaccredited law school stature. <em>See Lupert, </em>761 F.2d at 1328 (9th Cir.1985), holding that no equal protection violation was established because California requires that first-year students of unaccredited law schools pass an examination before receiving credit for further study. No such requirement is made as to students of accredited law schools. Nord-gren does not claim that she relied on Mississippi\u2019s exception clauses when she attended her law school. She concedes that her Mississippi bar application coincided with her husband\u2019s military transfer to that state in 1983 from California. She, therefore, hardly presents a compelling case against a rule which excludes <em>all </em>unaccredited law school graduates except a limited \u201creliance\u201d class, which itself is an exemption that otherwise imposes no residence requirement. <em>See also Louis, supra, </em>490 F.Supp. at 1184 (\u201cone who attends an unaccredited law school knowing it may preclude her admission to practice in the state of her choice cannot complain when she is excluded from practice for that reason.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">B. Nordgren also challenges the bar admission statute\u2019s \u201claw clerkship\u201d exception to the ABA accreditation and bar exam requirement. This exception extends to those who, before July 1, 1979, began a general course of study of law under the supervision of a Mississippi attorney and who completed, by November 1, 1984, the course of study required by other statutory-provisions. \u00a7 73-3-2(2)(b). This claim is controlled by the analysis set out above. It is also well known that several states maintain bar eligibility achieved by office law study which takes place within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The remainder of appellant's equal protection claims are attenuated and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Nordgren asserts a due process claim based upon her interpretation of \u00a7 73-3-2(2)(c) as it exists in the form of Mississippi Supreme Court Rule V as compared to its provisions in its pre-1983 versions. This statutory subsection requires that both ABA-accredited school applicants and alternative, \u201creliance-class\u201d applicants are required to satisfy certain undergraduate educational requirements. They must show that they have received: (1) \u201ca bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited college or university\u201d; or (2) \u201ccredit for the first three years of college work from a college or university offering an integrated six-year prelaw and law course, and ha[ve] completed [their] law course at a college or university offering such an integrated six-year course.\u201d \u00a7 73 \u2014 3\u20142(2)(c). This undergraduate education provision itself contained an exception for \u201capplicants who have already begun the general course of study of law as of November 1, 1979, either in a law school or under the supervision of a Mississippi lawyer----\u201d \u00a7 73-3-2(2)(c). These applicants needed only submit proof of two years of college study. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Nordgren argues that <em>after </em>her first bar application but <em>before </em>the Board denied it, the statute and the rule based upon it were amended to make clear that the change instituted more stringent undergraduate educational requirements for bar admission. Then she asserts that prior to this clarifying amendment in 1983, this provision should have been read to act as no more than an alternative, all-encompassing, \u201creliance-class\u201d prerequisite, so that mere fulfillment of these requirements alone would gain ones eligibility for admission to the bar regardless of the fact that a law school was out of state and unaccredited. Thus, she claims that the later statutory amendment, which made it clear that this was only an additional undergraduate edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>cational requirement, violated her right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We find that the district court correctly concluded that Nordgren\u2019s factual assertion is wrong. Subsection (c), since <em>1979, </em>had contained the words stating that the undergraduate requirements were \u201cin addition to\u201d the ABA-accreditation or alternative law requirements. The 1983 amendment only deleted the residency requirement. The court also properly found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">As to the state supreme court\u2019s Rule V on bar admission, the district court properly concluded that notwithstanding the fact that it lacked the words \u201cin addition to\u201d, the rule in substance repeated \u00a7 73-3-2(2)(c). The rule was clear enough to inform a reasonable person that at the very least this provision could not authorize an alternative bar admission. As the court noted, Nordgren\u2019s construction of the rule\u2019s requirements is illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We do not enumerate other contentions of appellant which we have considered and found unpersuasive. We find that there exists \u201c \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact and [appellees are] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Fontenot, </em>780 F.2d at 1194. We find no error in the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\">. The Supreme Court did note, however, that even a general constitutional challenge to a statute or rule might be barred by res judicata-col-lateral estoppel principles, since it may be found that an aggrieved bar applicant reasonably could have raised such claim before the state tribunals. 460 U.S. at 487-489, 103 S.Ct. at 1318; <em>see also, Korup v. Flaherty, </em>524 F.Supp. 1160, 1163-1166 (E.D.Pa.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">.
