Brimmer, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b909-17\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R. App.P. 34(a); 10th Cir.R. 10(e). The appeal is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">In this diversity action, Wayne Anderson, <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendants. Mr. Anderson contends that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether certain allegedly defamatory statements in a \u201cletter to the editor\u201d published in the <em>Arvada Sentinel </em>were substantially true.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">Mr. Anderson and his wife, Willow Cram-let, separated without going through legal proceedings and agreed informally that Ms. Cramlet would take care of their son, Eland, but that Mr. Anderson could take him for occasional overnight visitations. During one such visitation, Mr. Anderson took his son to Texas without Ms. Cram-let\u2019s consent. For six weeks, Ms. Cramlet tried to locate Mr. Anderson and Eland. When she finally located Eland in Texas, she obtained from the state district court for Jefferson County, Colorado, an order directing that Eland be returned to her in Colorado. On the basis of that order, she obtained a writ of habeas corpus from the state district court for Harris County, Texas, compelling Mr. Anderson to return Eland to her. After Mr. Anderson returned Eland, the Colorado state court ordered him not to contact Ms. Cramlet or Eland without the court\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">Thereafter, as part of divorce proceedings involving Mr. Anderson and his wife, the Colorado state court awarded Ms. Cramlet custody of Eland, and granted Mr. Anderson limited visitation privileges. Mr. Anderson again took Eland, this time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>violation of the custody order, and kept him hidden from and out of touch with Ms. Cramlet for more than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Shortly after taking Eland, Mr. Anderson wrote a letter to television talk show host Phil Donahue asking to be a guest on Mr. Donahue\u2019s nationally televised program. Mr. Anderson wrote, in pertinent part, \u201cI am a fugitive father \u2014 I kidnapped (terminology not my own) my son____ I would hope you would be willing to present the other side of child snatching: the side that never gets defended.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 26. A few months later, Mr. Anderson, wearing a disguise, appeared on the Donahue show. During the show, Mr. Donahue asked Mr. Anderson, \u201cYou actually kidnapped your own child?\u201d Mr. Anderson replied, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Ms. Cramlet, who happened to be watching the show, immediately recognized her former husband. She sued Mr. Donahue, the company that produced the show, and others in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. A lengthy jury trial ended with a hung jury. The case was later retried, and the second jury returned a verdict for Ms. Cramlet. Both trials attracted national television, radio, and newspaper coverage, which widely publicized Mr. Anderson\u2019s identity and his efforts to obtain custody of his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">While Eland was still with his father, the <em>Arvada Sentinel </em>published a \u201cletter to the editor\u201d written by Ms. Cramlet. The letter criticized the state trial judge who had presided over the Anderson/Gramlet divorce proceedings for his handling of two cases. Without referring to Mr. Anderson or the Anderson/Cramlet divorce proceedings, the letter stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">In one instance a 3-year-old boy was ordered to be sent on unsupervised visits with his father even though the child had already been kidnapped once before, the father had no place of residence \u2014 stating that he was living here and there in motel rooms. The father had no employment, and the father admitted in court that he had stated that he would kidnap the child again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-11\">The father has also been described by a psychiatrist as having an extreme personality disorder bordering on being a psychopath. Within two months of the last court hearing, the child was kidnapped and has still not been found. The child has been gone nearly three years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"add-dedup-0\">Record, vol. 1, at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Eventually, Eland was discovered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his father. Mr. Anderson was charged with \u201cViolation of Custody,\u201d a felony under Colorado state law. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-304 (1973). He pleaded guilty and was placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Thereafter, Mr. Anderson brought this action against Ms. Cramlet and the <em>Arvada Sentinel, </em>alleging that Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter defamed him. He sought $1.4 million in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that the allegedly defamatory statements in Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter were substantially true. The district court did not reach the question whether Mr. Anderson is a \u201cpublic figure\u201d with respect to the child custody dispute or whether defendants acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Summary judgment is appropriate only where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>Daitom, Inc. v. Pennwalt Corp., </em>741 F.2d 1569, 1574 (10th Cir.1984). In determining whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>a genuine issue of material fact, we must apply the substantive law of Colorado. <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Ando v. Great Western Sugar Co., </em>475 F.2d 531, 534 (10th Cir.1973). \u201cSubstantial truth\u201d is an affirmative defense to a defamation action under Colorado state law. <em>See Colorado Jury Instructions 2d, Civil, </em>22:14. In <em>Gomba v. McLaughlin, </em>180 Colo. 232, 504 P.2d 337, 338-39 (1972) (en banc), the Supreme Court of Colorado explained the defense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-4\">A defendant asserting truth as a defense in a libel action is not required to justify every word of the alleged defamatory matter; it is sufficient if the substance, the gist, the sting, of the matter is true. <em>Heuer v. Kee, </em>15 Cal.App.2d 710, 59 P.2d 1063 (1936); Prosser, Law of Torts, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">The question, a factual one, is whether there is a substantial difference between the allegedly libelous statement and the truth; or stated differently whether the statement produces a different effect upon the reader than that which would be produced by the literal truth of the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Mr. Anderson specifically alleges that four statements in Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter to the <em>Arvada Sentinel </em>are defamatory. The first statement is: \u201c[T]he child had already been kidnapped once before____\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 25. Mr. Anderson admits that the first time he took Eland, he did so without Ms. Cramlet\u2019s consent. He contends, however, that this act did not constitute \u201ckidnapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The district court concluded that Mr. Anderson violated Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-304 (1973) when he took Eland the first time and that the description of this act as \u201ckidnapping\u201d was therefore substantially true. Colo.ReviStat. \u00a7 18-3-304 (1973), entitled \u201cViolation of Custody,\u201d is found in the Colorado Criminal Code under the section entitled \u201cKidnapping.\u201d Subsection (2) of that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-14\">Any parent or other person who violates an order of any district or juvenile court of this state, granting the custody of a child under the age of eighteen years to any person, agency, or institution, with the intent to deprive the lawful custodian of the custody of a child under the age of eighteen years, commits a class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Initially, we note that the district court apparently erred in determining that Mr. Anderson violated Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>304 (1973) when he took Eland the first time. In <em>People v. Armendariz, </em>684 P.2d 252, 257-58 (Colo.App.1983), Judge Tursi stated in his dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">The General Assembly has addressed the problem created by a parent violating a lawful custodial order. Section 18-3-304(2), C.R.S. 1973 (1978 repl. vol. 8) makes the violation of an order granting custody a class 5 felony, [footnote omitted]. However, to date, the General Assembly has not chosen to criminalize the act of one parent taking a child from the physical custody of another parent, absent a court order granting custody to the other parent____ Defendant correctly contends that absent a court order terminating or modifying his co-equal right to custody, there was no lawful prohibition against his exercise of custody over his son. <em>See </em>Annot., 77 A.L.R. 317. I know of no contrary authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avc\">Since it is undisputed that no custody order had been entered the first time Mr. Anderson took Eland, it appears he did not violate Colorado\u2019s \u201cViolation of Custody\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Nonetheless, we believe that, in the popular sense of the word, Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter truthfully and accurately described Mr. Anderson\u2019s conduct as \u201ckidnapping.\u201d Other courts have held that \u201ctechnical errors in legal terminology and reports of matters involving violation of the law are of no legal consequence.\u201d <em>Hovey v. Iowa State Daily Publication Board, Inc., </em>372 N.W.2d 253, 255 (Iowa 1985). <em>See Simonson v. United Press International, Inc., </em>654 F.2d 478, 481-82 (7th Cir.1981) (\u201crape\u201d used to describe sexual assault); <em>Brueggemeyer v. Associated Press, </em>609 F.2d 825, 826 (5th Cir.1980) (exaggerated reports of amounts of court-ordered restitution); <em>Orr v. Argus-Press Co., </em>586 F.2d 1108, 1112 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 960, 99 S.Ct. 1502, 59 L.Ed.2d 773 (1979) (\u201cswindle\u201d substituted for \u201cdefraud\u201d). As the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 581A comment f (1977) explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">[M]any charges are made in terms that are accepted by their recipients in a popular rather than a technical sense. Thus a charge of theft may be reasonably interpreted as charging any form of criminally punishable misappropriation, and its truth may be established by proving the commission of any act of larceny or embezzlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">It is not necessary to establish the literal truth of the precise statement made. Slight inaccuracies of expression are immaterial provided that the defamatory charge is true in substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of Colorado\u2019s \u201cViolation of Custody\u201d statute demonstrates that even respected jurists could differ on the question whether Mr. Anderson\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ckidnapping\u201d under Colorado state law. However, the meaning of an allegedly defamatory statement is not determined by legal research, but \"by the plain and ordinary meaning of the word.\u201d <em>Simonson v. United Press International, Inc., </em>654 F.2d 478, 482 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">We note that the word \u201ckidnapping,\u201d according to common usage, would encompass Mr. Anderson\u2019s taking of Eland without the knowledge or consent of his mother. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(P.B. Gove, ed. 1976) defines \u201ckidnapping\u201d as the \u201cseizpng] and carry-png] or takpng] away often wrongly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>provides an illustration of an appropriate use of the word in context: <em>\u201ckidnapped </em>the children for the afternoon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Moreover, in the area of child custody, the word \u201ckidnap\u201d appears to have assumed a non-legal connotation. Indeed, one federal appellate judge has used the word \u201ckidnap\u201d to describe the situation where one parent takes or conceals the child from the other parent, while acknowledging in a footnote that such conduct is not technically \u201ckidnapping\u201d under state law. In <em>Flood v. Braaten, </em>727 F.2d 303, 304 n. 1 (3rd Cir.1984), the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APD\">Strictly speaking, a parent who seizes his or her child in violation of a custody decree is not guilty of \u201ckidnapping\u201d as defined by the criminal law in most states. Nevertheless, the literature on parental abduction frequently refers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>this conduct as \u201ckidnapping\u201d or \u201cabduction.\u201d Where these terms appear in this opinion, they are used only in the nontechnical sense that they have acquired in the area of child custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Defendants are not required to show that the allegedly defamatory statement is technically accurate, only that the \u201cgist\u201d or \u201csting\u201d of the statement is true. In light of the non-technical meaning that the word \u201ckidnap\u201d has acquired in the child custody context, the description of Mr. Anderson\u2019s conduct in March 1978 as \u201ckidnapping\u201d was substantially true as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The second statement Mr. Anderson alleges is defamatory is: \u201c[T]he father has also been described by a psychiatrist as having an extreme personality disorder bordering on being a psychopath.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 25. Dr. John Glismann, a psychiatrist, testified during Ms. Cramlet\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Donahue. In the case before us, the district court properly took judicial notice of this testimony in considering the motion for summary judgment. <em>See St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, </em>605 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir.1979). During Dr. Glismann\u2019s testimony, he stated that Mr. Anderson \u201crepresented a severe personality disorder____ His lack of empathy bordered on psychopathy.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 89. Mr. Anderson does not contest the accuracy of the transcript of Dr. Glismann\u2019s testimony. He argues instead that Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter mischaracterizes Dr. Glismann\u2019s diagnosis. When the statement in the letter is compared with Dr. Glismann\u2019s testimony, it is apparent that they are substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The third allegedly defamatory statement in Ms. Cramlet\u2019s letter is: \u201cWithin two months of the last court hearing, the child was kidnapped and has still not been found.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 25. Mr. Anderson does not dispute that, when he took Eland the second time, he did so in violation of a custody order entered by the Colorado state court. Nor does he dispute that he entered a plea of guilty to \u201cViolation of Custody,\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-304 (1973), in connection with this act. He argues, however, that his guilty plea would not be admissible in this case because he has appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court could properly take judicial notice of Mr. Anderson\u2019s guilty plea. <em>St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, </em>605 F.2d at 1172. Mr. Anderson\u2019s guilty plea had not been withdrawn at the time summary judgment was granted and was therefore admissible. Other evidence in the record also establishes the truth of this statement. For instance, Mr. Anderson admitted on national television that he had kidnapped his son:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">Phil Donahue: You actually kidnapped</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-12\">your own child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-13\">Mr. Anderson: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Record, vol. 1, at 29. Mr. Anderson also stated in his letter to Phil Donahue: \u201cI kidnapped (terminology not my own) my son.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 26. Mr. Anderson argues that his letter to Phil Donahue and the transcript of the Phil Donahue Show were not properly supported by sworn affidavits as required by Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants obtained Mr. Anderson\u2019s letter to Phil Donahue in a request for production of documents. It is therefore admissible under Rule 56(c). A complete transcript of the Phil Donahue Show was admitted in evidence during the trial of Ms. Cramlet\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Donahue. A video tape of that show was played during the trial, introduced as an exhibit, and made a part of the record. Thus, the district court could take judicial notice of its contents. \u201cJudicial notice is particularly applicable to the court\u2019s own records of prior litigation closely related to the case before it.\u201d <em>St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, </em>605 F.2d at 1172. The second kidnapping is well established by these items of evidence. Thus, the third statement complained of is substantially true as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">Finally, Mr. Anderson alleges that the following statement is defamatory: \u201c[T]he father admitted in court that he had stated that he would kidnap the child again.\u201d Record, vol. 1, at 25. This state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ment is based on Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony during the 1979 divorce proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aaz-dedup-0\">QUESTION: Mr. Anderson, have you ever threatened to steal your child away from the mother and conceal him so that the mother would not be able to see the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-4\">ANSWER: I would not consider it a threat. I said that is a logical alternative if my son can\u2019t be taken care of within the system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">QUESTION: Are you planning to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">ANSWER: No, not as long as the system takes care of my son, so that his needs are taken care, I don\u2019t intend to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">QUESTION: So, you would state under oath at this time that that is not what you are going to do, is take Eland and hide him so the mother would have any contact with the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">ANSWER: My feeling is that my son needs both parents, and I would like to be able to see my son have both parents: but, I don\u2019t think one or the other should be forced not to be able to see the child. But, I will have to make that decision eventually. I would like to hope that things will be worked out so that won\u2019t be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Record, vol. 1, at 20. Mr. Anderson contends that the above-quoted testimony did not constitute a threat to kidnap his son. He argues that, in context, the testimony merely demonstrates his hope that \u201cthe child could maintain significant contact with both parents.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14. Although Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony does show that he hoped the court would award joint custody to both parents, it also demonstrates his clear intention to have custody of his son regardless of the trial court\u2019s decision. No reasonable jury could interpret Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony as anything but a thinly veiled threat to kidnap his son if the court did not award him custody. Ms. Cramlet\u2019s characterization of this testimony is therefore substantially true as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Because we agree with the district court that the statements contained in Ms. Cram-let\u2019s letter to the <em>Arvada Sentinel </em>are substantially true, we do not decide whether Mr. Anderson is a \u201cpublic figure\u201d with respect to the child custody dispute or whether defendants acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The Supreme Court has recognized that the expense involved in defending meritless defamation suits may have a chilling effect on First Amendment rights. <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 389, 87 S.Ct. 534, 542, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967). Some lower courts have suggested that, because of this potential chilling effect, summary judgment is especially appropriate in defamation cases. <em>See Southard </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>588 F.2d 140, 146 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Schuster </em>v. <em>U.S. News and World Report, Inc., </em>602 F.2d 850, 855 (8th Cir.1979); <em>Anderson v. Stanco Sports Library, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 638, 641 (4th Cir.1976); <em>Treutler v. Meredith Corp., </em>455 F.2d 255, 257 n. 1 (8th Cir.1972); <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 858, 864-65 (5th Cir.1970); <em>Washington Post Co. v. Keogh, </em>365 F.2d 965, 968 (D.C.Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 1011, 87 S.Ct. 708, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>17 L.Ed.2d 548 (1967). More recently, other courts have rejected this notion, treating defamation actions, for procedural purposes, no differently than other cases. <em>See Lavin v. New York News, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 1416, 1419 (3rd Cir. 1985); <em>Schultz v. Newsweek, Inc., </em>668 F.2d 911, 917 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 1208, 1212 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Yiamouyiannis v. Consumers Union of United States, </em>619 F.2d 932, 939-40 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 839, 101 S.Ct. 117, 66 L.Ed.2d 46 (1980). The neutral approach taken by these courts finds some support in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hutchinson v. Proxmire, </em>443 U.S. 111, 99 S.Ct. 2675, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979). In footnote 9 of <em>Hutchinson, </em>the Court commented on the district court\u2019s statement that summary judgment might be the rule rather than the exception in determining whether an adequate showing of \"actual malice\" has been made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">Considering the nuances of the issues raised here, we are constrained to express some doubt about the so-called \"rule.\u201d The proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d calls a defendant's state of mind into question, <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254 [84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686] (1964), and does not readily lend itself to summary disposition. See 10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2730, pp. 590-592 (1973). <em>Cf. Herbert v. Lando, </em>441 U.S. 153 [99 S.Ct. 1635, 60 L.Ed.2d 115] (1979). In the present posture of the case, however, the propriety of dealing with such complex issues by summary judgment is not before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Although footnote 9 in <em>Hutchinson </em>states some \u201cdoubt\u201d about the supposed \"rule\u201d favoring summary judgment on the issue of \"actual malice,\u201d it does not address the question whether summary judgment is favored in defamation cases where \u201cactual malice\u201d is not involved. Until the Supreme Court provides more explicit guidance on this issue, we will continue to apply Rule 56 as it is written, without preference for either granting or denying summary judgment in defamation cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
