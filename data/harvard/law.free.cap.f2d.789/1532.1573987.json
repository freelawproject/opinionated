Car-man alleged that the trustees were not required to transfer the funds to the IRS, that the trustees violated Carman\u2019s rights under ERISA, and that the trustees deprived him of property by paying the funds to the IRS. The district court granted the trustees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under either 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 or under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132 (the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) (ERISA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 provides \u201ca remedy for deprivation of rights under col- or of state law and does not apply when the defendants are acting under color of federal law.\u201d <em>Mack v. Alexander, </em>575 F.2d 488, 489 (5th Cir.1978). The trustees here were complying with federal law in honoring the tax liens. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6332(d) exempts any \u201cperson\u201d in possession of property of a taxpayer subject to a tax levy from liability to that person for surrendering or paying the property to the IRS. The vacation fund trust and its trustees plainly are \u201cpersons\u201d subject to the payment requirements and protection of section 6332. The definitions section of the Internal Revenue Code includes \u201can individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation\u201d within the definition of person unless \u201cotherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent\u201d of the applicable provision. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7701(a)(1). The fact that section 6332(e) defines the word \u201cperson\u201d to \u201cinclude\u201d an officer or employee of a corporation or partnership does not limit the meaning of person, but merely makes clear that those people are subject to the levying requirements of section 6332(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-4\">A number of courts specifically have found that the trustees of a vacation trust are \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of section 6332(d). <em>See United States v. Dreier, </em>307 F.Supp. 810, 812 (S.D.N.Y.1969); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>566 F.Supp. 1012, 1014 (M.D.Fla.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-5\">We hold that as a matter of law the trustees are immune from liability under ERISA by virtue of the protection of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6332(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
