Weigel, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1401-16\">WEIGEL, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1401-17\">Jerry W. Davis appeals a district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights action for lack of prosecution. He also appeals the denial of his motion for relief from an earlier judgment dismissing defendants Gary Sussman and the Portland Police Bureau, his motion for assistance of counsel, and his motion to compel discovery. We affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-18\">The district court correctly determined that Davis\u2019s action was barred by a two-year statute of limitations. The district court relied upon this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kosikowski v. Bourne, </em>659 F.2d 105,108 (9th Cir.1981) that the two-year limitation of the Oregon Tort Claims Act, Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 30.275, applies to \u00a7 1983 actions brought in the district of Oregon. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), Section 1983 claims are to be characterized as personal injury actions for statute of limitations purposes. Although under <em>Wilson v. Garcia </em>the district court should have applied Oregon\u2019s general tort statute, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12.110(1), rather than the Oregon Tort Claims Act, both statutes provide for a two-year limitations period. Therefore, the district court properly found that a two-year statute of limitations barred petitioner\u2019s action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Davis\u2019 motions and denying him relief from the judgment entered against him. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in dismissing his action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>all remaining defendants for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1401-14\">. Appellant also contends that his cause of action accrued on June 29, 1983, when the Oregon Supreme Court reversed his conviction, rather than at the time of his wrongful arrest on March 16, 1981. He claims that because he filed his complaint January 16, 1984, less than two years after the reversal of the charges against him, his action is not barred. These claims lack merit. <em>See Venegas v. Wagner, </em>704 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1983) (\u2018\u2018[W]here false arrest or illegal search and seizure is alleged, the conduct and asserted injury are discrete and complete upon occurrence, and the cause of action can reasonably be deemed to have accrued when the wrongful act occurs\u201d); <em>Gowin v. Altmiller, </em>663 F.2d 820, 822 (9th Cir.1981) (rejecting appellants\u2019 argument that their civil rights claims did not arise until appellant\u2019s conviction was reversed because they could not have discovered the violation until then.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
