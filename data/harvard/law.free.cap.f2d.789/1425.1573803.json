PERTINENT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-29\">On February 25, 1979, an intruder attacked Josephine Hoapili in her apartment. After sexually assaulting her, the attacker shot Hoapili three times in the back of her head with a .22 caliber pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-30\">The State of Hawaii charged Reiger with rape, attempted murder, and first degree burglary. The State\u2019s case against Reiger rested on Hoapili\u2019s identification of Reiger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>as her assailant and on circumstantial evidence linking Reiger to Hoapili\u2019s apartment. In particular, Reiger\u2019s estranged girlfriend, Shannon Scott, testified that she had previously lived in Hoapili\u2019s apartment and that Reiger still had a pass key. Reiger was convicted as charged after a jury trial in Hawaii state court. The Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed. <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii 510, 644 P.2d 959 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">On August 4, 1982, Reiger filed a habeas corpus petition. The district court denied his petition on the merits without holding an evidentiary hearing. Reiger seeks reversal on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-6\">One. The district court erred in denying Reiger\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-7\">Two. The district court erred in finding that the state trial court\u2019s admission of a photo array from which the victim had identified Reiger did not deprive Reiger of his due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-8\">Three. The district court erred in finding that the state trial court\u2019s admission of a prosecution witness\u2019s statement that Reiger had a \u201clong police record\u201d did not violate Reiger\u2019s due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-9\">Four. The district court erred in holding that the state trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial based on the State\u2019s delay in disclosing negative fingerprint test results did not deprive Reiger of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-10\">Five. The district court erred in ruling that the state trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of a prosecution witness\u2019s prior shoplifting conviction for impeachment purposes did not violate Reiger\u2019s due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-11\">Six. The district court erred in finding that the state trial court\u2019s refusal to segregate the jurors for questioning regarding their exposure to potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity did not violate Reiger\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1495-12\">We discuss the facts pertinent to each claim under separate headings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Weygandt v. Ducharme, </em>774 F.2d 1491, 1492 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Chatman v. Marquez, </em>754 F.2d 1531, 1533-34 (9th Cir.1985). This court also reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>Weygandt v. Ducharme, </em>774 F.2d at 1492-93; <em>Butcher v. Marquez, </em>758 F.2d 373, 376 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-16\">III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-17\">Reiger claims that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by his state trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance. He contends that his trial counsel erred by (1) failing to introduce evidence that a murder with a similar modus operandi had been committed in Hoapili\u2019s apartment building one year prior to the attack on Hoapili, (2) failing to object to questioning concerning Reiger\u2019s connection with local organized crime figures, and (3) eliciting damaging testimony from two prosecution witnesses on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-18\">Reiger\u2019s failure to raise these claims before the Hawaii Supreme Court precludes him from raising them in federal court. A habeas petitioner must exhaust state remedies unless he shows an absence of available state corrective process or circumstances rendering such process ineffective. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); <em>see Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 515, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982); <em>Lindquist v. Gardner, </em>770 F.2d 876, 877 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Gutierrez v. Griggs, </em>695 F.2d 1195, 1197 (9th Cir.1983). If the habeas petitioner\u2019s claim was not presented to the state court on direct appeal, state collateral remedies must be exhausted. <em>Sweet v. Cupp, </em>640 F.2d 233, 235 (9th Cir.1981). Although Reiger\u2019s failure to raise these issues on direct appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court bars state collateral relief, <em>see </em>Hawaii R.Penal P. 40(a)(3);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Matias v. Oshiro, </em>683 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>F.2d 318, 320-21 (9th Cir.1982), a failure to comply with state procedural rules does not exempt a habeas petitioner from the exhaustion requirement unless he demonstrates cause and prejudice for his failure to exhaust state collateral remedies. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506-08, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977); <em>Matias, </em>683 F.2d at 321. Because Reiger has made no showing of cause for his failure to comply with Hawaii procedural rules, federal relief is not available to him. <em>See id. </em>Reiger was represented by different counsel on his appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court (they also represented him on his petition to the district court); he does not indicate dissatisfaction with their performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-4\">Reiger also argues that his trial counsel erred by (1) failing to introduce at trial, test results that indicated that Reiger\u2019s fingerprints were not found in Hoapili\u2019s apartment; (2) failing to <em>voir dire </em>jurors who had been exposed to potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity concerning the case; (3) failing to object during the opening and closing arguments to prosecutorial comment that the crimes were committed in the manner of a \u201cgangland execution\u201d; and (4) failing to object to prosecution witness Shannon Scott\u2019s testimony that Reiger had \u201ca long police record.\u201d Reiger asserts that the district court should have held an evi-dentiary hearing to resolve these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-5\">We may not affirm a district court\u2019s summary denial of a writ of habeas corpus unless the record on appeal indicates that the district court independently reviewed all relevant portions of the state court record. <em>Richmond v. Ricketts, </em>774 F.2d 957, 961 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Johnson v. Lumpkin, </em>769 F.2d 630, 636 (9th Cir.1985). The district court did not review the transcript of the trial in this matter. Because resolution of Reiger\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance is dependent upon a review of the trial transcript, we remand for such independent consideration those of Reiger\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims that were raised before the Hawaii Supreme Court. <em>See Richmond, </em>774 F.2d at 961; <em>Johnson, </em>769 F.2d at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-8\">Our decision in <em>Austad v. Risley, </em>761 F.2d 1348 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 163, 88 L.Ed.2d 135 (1985) is not to the contrary. In <em>Austad </em>we held that a habeas petitioner who alleges that the jury\u2019s exposure to prejudicial pretrial publicity prevented him from receiving a fair trial has the burden to produce pertinent portions of the state court record. <em>Id. </em>at 1353. We opined that the district court has no duty <em>sua sponte </em>to obtain and examine the state court exhibits unless the petitioner is unable to produce the record. <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that the determination of a juror\u2019s partiality or bias is a factual determination to which 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s presumption of correctness applies, <em>id. </em>at 1350, and concluded that it is petitioner\u2019s duty under section 2254(d) to establish by convincing evidence that the challenged factual determinations of the state court were erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-11\">In contrast, Reiger\u2019s habeas corpus petition, like that in <em>Johnson, </em>alleges an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a mixed question of fact and law. <em>See Butcher v. Marquez, </em>758 F.2d at 376. We have held that the section 2254(d) presumption of correctness applies only to issues of fact as found by the state courts, and does not apply to federal court review of state court decisions regarding mixed questions of law and fact. <em>See Fendler v. Goldsmith, </em>728 F.2d 1181, 1190-91 n. 21 (9th Cir.1983). We give deference to the state court\u2019s findings of the underlying facts, but reserve the right to give different legal weight to such facts. <em>Butcher v. Marquez, </em>758 F.2d at 376. Our holding in <em>Austad, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>premised as it was upon a petitioner\u2019s duty to produce evidence in support of a challenge to a state court\u2019s factual findings, has no application to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">In <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the Supreme Court set out six separate circumstances in which a federal court reviewing factual issues previously decided by state courts must grant an evidentiary hearing to a habeas applicant. <em>See id. </em>at 313, 83 S.Ct. at 757. In the instant case, the district court\u2019s failure to review the relevant portions of the state court record prevented it from ascertaining whether an evidentiary hearing was appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 319, 83 S.Ct. at 760; <em>Richmond v. Rickets, </em>774 F.2d at 961-62. Where, as here, the state court opinion contained no specific factual findings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there may be a heightened need for an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Townsend, </em>372 U.S. at 320, 83 S.Ct. at 760 (evidentiary hearing required where state trial judge \u201crendered neither an opinion, conclusions of law, nor findings of fact.\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse and remand Reiger\u2019s ineffective assistance counsel claims to the district court with instructions to review the relevant portions of the state court record and to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">IV. ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC ARRAY</p>\n<p id=\"a3a-dedup-0\">Reiger next contends that the introduction into evidence of the photographic array, from which Hoapili identified him, violated his due process rights. On at least two occasions, the police showed Hoapili an array of photographs which included Reiger\u2019s picture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each time, Hoapili selected Reiger\u2019s picture, along with a few other pictures, as resembling her assailant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hoapili made a third positive identification at a live lineup conducted at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-13\">The prosecution sought to bolster Hoapi-li\u2019s in-court identification of Reiger as her attacker by introducing into evidence the photographic array shown to Hoapili in the hospital immediately after the attack. The pictures were introduced through the testimony of the investigating police officer, Detective Benson. Reiger argues that the introduction of the photographs, which presented front and profile images typical of police \u201cmugshots,\u201d prejudiced him by suggesting prior contact with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-14\">The Hawaii Supreme Court rejected Reiger\u2019s argument, reasoning that Reiger\u2019s alibi defense rendered the question of identification crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case and holding that introduction of the photographs was relevant and necessary to the State\u2019s case. <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 512, 644 P.2d at 962. The court applied the three-part test for the admissibility of such evidence established in <em>State v. Kutzen, </em>1 Hawaii App. 406, 620 P.2d 258 (1980), and concluded that (1) the government demonstrated a need to introduce the photographs, (2) the photographs themselves gave no indication that Reiger had a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>criminal record, and (3) the manner of their introduction at trial did not draw particular attention to the source or implications of the photographs. <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 512-13, 644 P.2d at 962. The district court reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-4\">The dispositive issue is not whether introduction of the photographs violated state law evidentiary principles, but whether the trial court committed an error which rendered the trial \u201cso \u2018arbitrary and fundamentally unfair\u2019 that it violated federal due process.\u201d <em>Pennywell v. Rushen, </em>705 F.2d 355, 357 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(quoting Powell v. Spalding, </em>679 F.2d 163, 166 (9th Cir.1982)). We are not persuaded that the trial court committed such an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">The Eighth Circuit considered a similar situation in <em>Futrell v. Wyrick, </em>716 F.2d 1207 (8th Cir.1983). There, an unsuccessful habeas petitioner claimed that the introduction of police mugshots at his trial violated his due process rights. The court of appeals disagreed. \u201cThe manner in which the photographs were introduced,\u201d the court found, \u201cwas unexceptionable. The photographs were never referred to as \u2018mugshots\u2019 and all police data was removed from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208. Thus, their introduction did not violate notions of fundamental fairness. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Terry, </em>760 F.2d 939, 944 (9th Cir.1985) (holding that introduction of mugshots containing no incriminating police data was not an abuse of the district court judge\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-6\">The photographs in Reiger\u2019s case did not betray any link with the police or suggest that Reiger had a past criminal record. <em>See State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 512, 644 P.2d at 962. Reiger does not allege that the pictures bore any markings identifying their source as the police department files or that the prosecution\u2019s efforts to disguise any identifying numbers or lettering drew attention to the pictures\u2019 prejudicial significance. Instead, he asserts only that the juxtaposition of front and profile images gave rise to an inference of a prior criminal record. <em>See Barnes v. United States, </em>365 F.2d 509, 510-11 (D.C.Cir.1966) (finding that the double shot picture leads to an automatic response that the person photographed has a criminal record).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While it may have been preferable to separate the images, the mere failure to do so does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Futrell, </em>716 F.2d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-10\">The fact that the prosecution chose to introduce the photographic array through the testimony of a police officer rather than through the testimony of Hoapili herself does not alter our conclusion. In <em>United States ex rel. Bleimehl v. Cannon, </em>525 F.2d 414 (7th Cir.1975), another case in which the identity of the assailant was the central issue, the court sustained against a habeas challenge the introduction of an entire book of mugshots, including a photograph of the defendant taken some years earlier. Because the witnesses\u2019 ability to identify the assailant was central to the case, the court found that the probative value of allowing the jury to examine the mugshots was critical, while any prejudice that resulted was merely secondary to the manner in which the testimony established the defendant\u2019s identity as the culprit. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22. And in <em>United States ex rel. Johnson v. Hatrack, </em>417 F.Supp. 316 (D.N.J.1976), <em>affd </em>564 F.2d 90 (3d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 906, 98 S.Ct. 1454, 55 L.Ed.2d 497 (1978), a police officer, while describing a photographic array to the jury, inadvertently revealed that the photographs were mugshots taken from police files. The court concluded that the inference of the defendant\u2019s prior criminality raised by the officer\u2019s remarks was \u201ctoo slender a reed upon which to predicate a claim that the trial was fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-11\">Similarly, the manner in which the state introduced the photographic array in Reiger\u2019s case did not amount to fundamental unfairness. As in <em>Bleimehl, </em>the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>ability to identify her assailant was a central issue. . And as in <em>Hatrack, </em>any prejudice resulting from the manner of introduction did not outweigh the probative value of introducing the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">We need not address Reiger\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in his brief on appeal to this court, that the manner in which the police presented the photographs to Hoapili was impermissibly suggestive. Reiger failed to present this contention to the state courts. He thus forfeited his right to collateral relief in federal court. As discussed above, Reiger\u2019s failure to give the Hawaii Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on the issue and his inability to establish cause or prejudice for his failure preclude consideration of his claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">The district court properly dismissed Reiger\u2019s claim that the admission of the photographic array from which Hoapili first identified him violated Reiger\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">V. ADMISSION OF SCOTT\u2019S TESTIMONY THAT REIGER HAD A \u201cLONG POLICE RECORD\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">Reiger next argues that the prosecution injected his criminal past into the trial in a different way, this time through the testimony of one of the prosecution witnesses. The offending statement came up while Reiger\u2019s estranged girlfriend, Shannon Scott, was on the witness stand. Scott apparently testified that she had adopted the name \u201cScott\u201d at the time she and Reiger lived together, a time when Reiger also used the name Scott. When asked why she adopted the name, Scott replied, \u201cMr. Reiger told me that was his good name. Reiger was a name that he had a lot of, a long police record with.\u201d <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 513, 644 P.2d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-9\">Reiger failed to object to this statement at trial. He did raise the issue in a motion for a mistrial, however, which the trial court denied. <em>Id. </em>He did not move to strike the evidence or request a cautionary instruction. <em>Id. </em>The Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed, restricting its inquiry to eviden-tiary principles and finding that \u201cin the circumstances of this case\u201d the answer\u2019s probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. <em>Id.; </em>644 P.2d at 963. The court also noted that Reiger\u2019s attack was upon the admission of the evidence rather than upon denial of the motion for mistrial, and that no objection was made to the admission of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The district court agreed without further analysis. We construe Reiger\u2019s argument concerning the admission of Scott\u2019s testimony as a contention that the denial of his motion for a mistrial deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-11\">Reiger\u2019s failure to assert a contemporaneous objection to the admission of Scott\u2019s testimony does not preclude collateral review. The purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule was substantially served by Reiger\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 448-49, 85 S.Ct. 564, 567-68, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965) (purpose of state contemporaneous objection rule was substantially served by petitioner\u2019s motion for directed verdict based upon erroneous admission of certain testimony; at that point trial court could have stricken the tainted testimony, given a cautionary instruction, or taken other appropriate action). Thus, to the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court rested its ruling upon Reiger\u2019s failure to object to admission of Scott\u2019s testimony, we disagree with its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-12\">We cannot determine without reference to the state court trial transcript whether the admission of Scott\u2019s statement transgresses the due process \u201cboundary beyond which state [evidentiary] rules cannot stray....\u201d <em>Perry v. Rushen, </em>713 F.2d 1447, 1453 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 137, 83 L.Ed.2d 77 (1984). The district court\u2019s failure to conduct an independent review of the transcript prevented it from ascertaining whether the trial court performed the requisite balancing test and weighed the prejudicial effect of Scott\u2019s testimony against its probative value. We decline to speculate as to the grounds upon which the trial court denied the motion for mistrial. Because we must remand this case for other reasons (discussed <em>supra, </em>Section III and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number><em>infra, </em>Section VIII), the district court will have ample opportunity to review the transcript. Therefore, we remand to the district court the question whether Scott\u2019s testimony violated Reiger\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">VI. STATE\u2019S DELAY IN DISCLOSING NEGATIVE FINGERPRINT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-5\">Reiger argues that the state\u2019s delay in disclosing fingerprint test results violated his right to disclosure of exculpatory materials secured by <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The results revealed that Reiger\u2019s fingerprints were not found in Hoapili\u2019s apartment. The Hawaii Supreme Court rejected Reiger\u2019s argument. It found that the state had in fact disclosed the existence of negative test results at a pretrial conference. <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 515, 644 P.2d at 963.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also found that Reiger\u2019s attorney failed to request discovery of the report under Hawaii Rules or to pursue the matter at all after the conference. 64 Hawaii at 515, 644 P.2d 963-64. The district court adopted the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning and further found that the test results were not \u201cmaterial\u201d as required by <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-6\"><em>Brady </em>proscribes prosecutorial suppression of exculpatory evidence that is \u201cmaterial\u201d either to guilt or punishment. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196. \u201c(Ejvidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3384, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). In the instant case, Reiger does not allege complete nondisclosure by the prosecution, but merely <em>untimely </em>disclosure. <em>Brady </em>\u201cinvolves the discovery, <em>after trial, </em>of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-13\">We have found no <em>Brady </em>violation stemming from the government\u2019s delay in disclosure in situations where defense counsel was made aware of the exculpatory evidence well before trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Multi-Management, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 1359, 1363 (9th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>742 F.2d 509, 510-11 (9th Cir.1984). The prosecution\u2019s failure in Reiger\u2019s case to disclose the fingerprint tests until the pretrial conference does not dictate a different result. <em>See United States v. Kubiak, </em>704 F.2d 1545, 1549-51 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 852, 104 S.Ct. 163, 78 L.Ed.2d 149 (1983); <em>cf. Hilliard v. Spalding, </em>719 F.2d 1443, 1447 (9th Cir.1983) (where exculpatory evidence of sperm sample taken from rape victim in rape case was <em>never </em>furnished to defense, defendant was deprived of due process rights). As the Hawaii Supreme Court found, state law provided Reiger\u2019s counsel with a variety of avenues to pursue discovery of the fingerprint report. In particular, counsel could have asked the trial court for a continuance for the purpose of obtaining and analyzing the test results. <em>See State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 515, 644 P.2d at 964; <em>see also Bell, </em>742 F.2d at 511. Even after finding out about the tests, however, Reiger\u2019s attorney failed to seek a continuance or to make any effort to pursue the test further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-14\">The district court correctly dismissed Reiger\u2019s claim that the prosecution\u2019s delay in disclosing to the defense negative fingerprint results violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-15\">VII. ADMISSIBILITY OF SCOTT\u2019S PRIOR SHOPLIFTING CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-16\">At trial, Reiger sought to impeach Shannon Scott by proof of a prior shoplifting conviction. The trial court sustained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s objection and rejected Reiger\u2019s offer of proof. The Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the theft was not a felony or a misdemeanor involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d within the meaning of applicable state evidentiary rules. 64 Hawaii at 515, 644 P.2d at 964. The district court adopted the state supreme court\u2019s reasoning. Reiger apparently claims a denial of the right to confront adverse witnesses secured by the sixth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">The sixth amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses to uncover possible bias and to expose the witness\u2019s motivation in testifying. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1109-10, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>United States v. McClintock, </em>748 F.2d 1278, 1289 (9th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 75, 88 L.Ed.2d 61 (1985); <em>Chipman v. Mercer, </em>628 F.2d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1980). This right, however, is not absolute. The matters that the defendant intends to pursue on cross-examination must be at least relevant: \u201c[S]ome topics may be of such minimal relevance that the trial court would be justified either in totally prohibiting cross-examination about them or in allowing only limited questioning.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Cardwell, </em>564 F.2d 1381, 1389 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1009, 98 S.Ct. 1883, 56 L.Ed.2d 392 (1978). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s right to attack the witness\u2019s general credibility enjoys less protection than his right to develop the witness\u2019s bias. <em>Hughes v. Raines, </em>641 F.2d 790, 793 (9th Cir.1981); <em>see Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 321, 94 S.Ct. at 1112 (Stewart, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he Court neither holds nor suggests that the Constitution confers a right in every case to impeach the general credibility of a witness through cross-examination about his past delinquency adjudications or criminal convictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-8\">Scott\u2019s prior conviction for shoplifting does not suggest any bias against Reiger. Its introduction would not prove that she bore any personal ill will against him, <em>see, e.g., Chipman, </em>628 F.2d at 532, or that she had any special reason to cooperate with the government, <em>see, e.g, Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 317-18, 94 S.Ct. at 1110-11. Moreover, the conviction was only marginally relevant to Scott\u2019s overall credibility. <em>See United States v. Ortega, </em>561 F.2d 803, 806 (9th Cir.1977) (shoplifting does not involve \u201cdishonesty or false statement\u201d within the meaning of Rule 609(a)). The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow its introduction did not violate Reiger\u2019s confrontation rights. <em>See Hughes, </em>641 F.2d at 792-93 (trial court\u2019s ruling precluding a rape defendant from questioning the victim about an attempted rape accusation she had made previously against another person did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-10\">The district court properly dismissed Reiger\u2019s claim that his sixth amendment confrontation rights were infringed by the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit Scott\u2019s prior shoplifting conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-11\">VIII. FAILURE TO SEGREGATE JURORS FOR QUESTIONING REGARDING EFFECT OF PRETRIAL PUBLICITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-12\">After the jury had been impaneled, the trial court was informed that the jury had been exposed to adverse pretrial publicity regarding Reiger. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court examined each juror individually in open court in the presence of the other jurors. <em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 513, 644 P.2d at 963. The trial court\u2019s questioning of the first juror, Mrs. Kamodo, elicited from her the following summary of what she had heard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-13\">The first part was about James Benton\u2019s bail and then Mr. Reiger\u2019s bail and the amount and the discrepancy and it was the name and also Mr. Reiger\u2019s possible connection with the underworld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-14\"><em>Id. </em>The court excused Mrs. Kamodo after determining that she could not function as a fair juror. <em>Id. </em>Of the remaining jurors, only two responded that they had inadvertently read such an article in the newspaper; both, however, stated that they could give Reiger a fair trial. 64 Hawaii at 514, 644 P.2d at 963. Reiger\u2019s counsel was given the opportunity to ask additional questions of these jurors but did not do so. <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>Hawaii Supreme Court found that \u201c[although it would have been better practice to have examined the individual jurors ... out of the presence of the other jurors,\u201d Reiger was not prejudiced by the procedure employed. <em>Id. </em>The district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">Reiger argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to segregate the affected jurors for questioning necessarily deprived him of his right to a fair and impartial trial. We disagree. When prejudicial matter is brought to the jury\u2019s attention during the course of a trial, the court should \u201c[make] a careful, individual examination of each of the jurors involved, out of the presence of the remaining jurors, as to the possible effect of the articles.\u201d <em>Silverthome v. United States, </em>400 F.2d 627, 639 (9th Cir. 1968) <em>(quoting Coppedge v. United States, </em>272 F.2d 504, 508 (D.C.Cir.1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 855, 82 S.Ct. 92, 7 L.Ed.2d 52 (1961)); <em>accord, United States v. Giese, </em>597 F.2d 1170, 1183 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 979, 100 S.Ct. 480, 62 L.Ed.2d 405 (1979). The question in the instant case, however, is whether individual voir dire outside the presence of the other jurors is <em>constitutionally </em>required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">The Constitution does not require an individual voir dire of all jurors exposed to potentially prejudicial publicity. <em>See Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 594, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 1020, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976) (\u201cThe Constitution does not always entitle a defendant to have questions posed during voir dire specifically directed to matters that conceivably might prejudice veniremen against him.\u201d). Our direction to trial courts that jurors who have been exposed to potentially prejudicial publicity during the course of trial should be subjected to a careful, individual examination out of the presence of the remaining jurors, <em>see Silverthorne, </em>400 F.2d at 639, is necessarily based upon our supervisory power to \u201c\u2018formulate and apply proper standards for the enforcement of the criminal law in the federal courts,\u2019 and [was not] a matter of constitutional compulsion.\u201d <em>See Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 797, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2034, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975) <em>(quoting Marshall v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 310, 313, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959)); <em>Jackson v. Amaral, </em>729 F.2d 41, 45 (1st Cir.1984). We may reverse Reiger\u2019s conviction only if there is reason to believe that the procedure employed by the trial court involves \u201csuch a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process.\u201d <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 542-43, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 1632-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-7\">We are unable to ascertain from the record before us whether the trial court\u2019s failure to segregate the jurors for questioning violated Reiger\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. Individual voir dire is not constitutionally required in cases involving unsupported general allegations of prejudicial pretrial publicity or in cases where the publicity does not create a significant potential of prejudice. <em>United States v. Colacurcio, </em>659 F.2d 684, 689 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1002, 102 S.Ct. 1635, 71 L.Ed.2d 869 (1982). Mrs. Kamodo\u2019s comments clearly transcend unsupported general allegations of prejudicial pretrial publicity, <em>see id., </em>and the fact that her observations were elicited in open court may have created a significant potential for prejudice. <em>Compare Jackson v. Amaral, </em>729 F.2d at 45 (fact that judge\u2019s nonsegregated voir dire led one juror to publicly question her impartiality \u201cindicates that the voir dire was not wholly ineffective and suggests that any other juror who doubted his or her ability to render an impartial verdict would have felt comfortable in stepping forward\u201d); <em>and Colacurcio, </em>659 F.2d at 689 (district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to conduct individual segregated voir dire of jurors who had been exposed to newspaper articles suggesting that defendant possessed strong underworld connections and was able to post bail in less than one-half hour) <em>with Coppedge v. United States, </em>272 F.2d at 508 (jurors\u2019 exposure to adverse pretrial publicity deprived defendant of right to fair trial where jurors were questioned about such exposure in open court; had one juror described the contents of the publicity and stated that he would be influenced in his verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>damage to defendant would have been spread to listening jurors).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">Given Mrs. Kamodo\u2019s responses to the court\u2019s voir dire, the district court had the duty to make an independent examination of the state court transcripts to determine whether the jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality were adequate to insure Reiger a fair trial. <em>See Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1031-34, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2888-90, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984); <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S.Ct. 1639,1642, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961); <em>Bashor v. Risley, </em>730 F.2d 1228, 1234 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 137, 83 L.Ed.2d 77 (1984). Because the district court did not obtain the state court transcripts, it was unable to perform such an independent evaluation. Therefore, we remand to the district court for consideration of Reiger\u2019s claim that his right to a fair trial was violated by the district court\u2019s failure to conduct an individual voir dire of each juror out of the presence of the others.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1503-8\">IX. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-9\">Because resolution of Reiger\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is dependent upon a review of the state court trial transcript and it is apparent from the record that the district court did not review the transcript, we remand for independent consideration those claims of ineffective assistance which Reiger raised before the Hawaii Supreme Court. The district court is also instructed to consider whether an evidentiary hearing on Reiger\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is required under <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed. 770 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-14\">Additionally, on remand the district court should review the state court trial transcript and make an independent determination whether (1) admission of Shannon Scott\u2019s testimony regarding Reiger\u2019s use of the name Scott violated Reiger\u2019s due process rights, and (2) the voir dire procedure employed by the trial court impaired Reiger\u2019s right to a fair trial. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Reiger\u2019s petition on the remaining due process grounds is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-15\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1495-13\">. Hawaii Rule of Penal Procedure 40(a)(3) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-19\">(3) Inapplicability. Said [post-conviction] proceedings shall not be available and relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived. An issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually initiated under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1497-7\">. The state court\u2019s opinion contains only the following conclusory paragraph addressing Reiger\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-8\">Lastly, appellant argues that he was deprived of the right to effective assistance of counsel at the trial below. Upon a reading of the record, we find no basis for this contention. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s conduct was \u2018within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1497-9\"><em>State v. Reiger, </em>64 Hawaii at 515-16, 644 P.2d at 964 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1497-10\">. Both parties agree that there were at least two photographic arrays. Reiger, however, maintains that Hoapili viewed police photographs on a third occasion, at which time Hoapili did not select his picture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1497-15\">. The parties\u2019 accounts of the photographic sessions differ sharply. The state asserts that at the first session, which took place shortly after the attack while Hoapili was recovering in the hospital, Hoapili selected Reiger\u2019s picture and no other. Although the state concedes that Hoa-pili selected a second photograph at the second session, it maintains that she did so only after choosing Reiger\u2019s photograph and only to underscore her belief that her attacker was stockier than Reiger. Reiger, by contrast, asserts that Hoapili selected several photos at the first session, and that she selected Reiger\u2019s photograph at the second session after choosing the stockier assailant and after being asked why she failed to choose Reiger\u2019s photograph instantly. We need not concern ourselves with this discrepancy because it is immaterial to our resolution of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1498-7\">. Despite its strong criticism of the introduction of the \"doubleshot images,\u201d the <em>Barnes </em>case ultimately turned on the prosecution\u2019s flimsy efforts to hide the pictures\u2019 identifying markings by placing adhesive tape over the prison numbers, an effort which emphasized rather than disguised the prejudicial impact of introducing the photographs. <em>See </em>365 F.2d at 511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1500-9\">. Reiger nonetheless contends that the disclosure did not occur until \"midtrial.\u201d Because he has produced no evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded to state court factual determinations under section 2254(d), we accept the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s finding that disclosure occurred at the pretrial conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1503-10\">. Our resolution of the instant case is consistent with our en banc decision in <em>Austad v. Risley. </em>Although in cases involving factual determinations such as juror impartiality, <em>Austad </em>places a burden on the habeas petitioner to produce the pertinent parts of the record, that \"burden of producing the record does not lie heavily upon petitioner\u2019s shoulders.\u201d <em>Austad, </em>761 F.2d at 1354 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-11\">Under the Rules applicable to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the state is obligated to respond to the allegations of the petition. Rule 5 requires the state to indicate what transcripts are available, when they can be furnished, and also what proceedings have been recorded but not transcribed. \"There shall be attached to the answer such portions of the transcripts as the answering party deems relevant.\u201d Rule 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-12\">Thus, normally, the parties will have identified and made available the relevant portions of the record for review by the federal trial judge. If the parties fail to do so,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4R\">the trial judge has ample discretion to require, once informed, that a sufficient portion of the record be produced so that the court can make an intelligent decision ... There is no reason to assume that in reviewing the record trial judges will not have the competence to know or the will to act if the petition or the circumstances show that a part of the record which is missing is obviously needed to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1503-18\"><em>Austad, </em>761 F.2d at 1355 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-19\">Here, there can be no dispute that the voir dire transcripts are crucial to Reiger\u2019s claim. Although the parties did not provide those transcripts for review, it is clear that the trial judge should have known that he could not evaluate the alleged constitutional violation without them. By contrast, the trial judge in <em>Austad </em>had voir dire transcripts available that allowed him to make an \u201cintelligent decision,\u201d based on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
