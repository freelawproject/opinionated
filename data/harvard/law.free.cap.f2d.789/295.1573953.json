The ground for the challenge is that the exemption violated the establishment clause of the first amendment and also denied the plaintiffs the equal protection of law. The defendant in the action is the Director of the State Department of Welfare and Institutions. Both parties in the proceeding filed motions for summary judgment, the defendant urging that the exemption was valid as \u201ca permissible effort by the state to comply with its constitutional obligation to avoid infringement of the sectarian sponsor\u2019s rights under the religious clauses.\u201d The district judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant, sustaining his claim that the exemption represented a permissible effort on the part of the State to avoid an unconstitutional infringement of the non-sectarian operators\u2019 rights under the religious clauses of the amendment. 540 F.Supp. 1046 (S.D.Va.1982). On appeal, that decision was reversed and the cause was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. 728 F.2d 230 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">In our opinion reversing the district court, we found that certain of the exempted activities of the sectarian child centers were not entitled to free exercise protection under the religious clauses of the amendment, and we identified generally some we so found. We accordingly concluded that the statutory exemption was overbroad and could be declared unconstitutional on that ground. We recognized, however, that there might be parts of the centers\u2019 activities which could validly qualify for free exercise protection as granted them under the challenged exemption. We concluded that under those circumstances, the prudent course for us to pursue was to remand the cause to the district court in order to permit the development of a record which would enable the court to \u201csquar[e] ... [the] statute with [the] Constitution by excising only the unconstitutional portions of legislation not wholly unconstitutional\u201d and salvaging those portions of the statute that might be constitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">We were persuaded to this resolution by three factors. First was our concern that, in litigating the constitutional issue herein, the \u201cpersons whose free exercise rights are centrally in issue are not parties to the litigation\u201d and are having their rights \u201cindirectly asserted in this litigation by the state, which more commonly in free exercise litigation finds itself on the other side, defending or seeking to enforce legislation challenged by such persons as violative of free exercise rights.\u201d Secondly, the entire issue of the constitutionality of the exemption had been presented to the court on a \u201cdisturbingly meager record upon which to apply free exercise doctrine as shaped by authoritative Supreme Court interpretations (or \u2018non-interpretation\u2019) of the [reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>gious] clause.\u201d Lastly, a \u201cdeclaration of unconstitutionality for overbreadth\u201d in this action on its meager record with its limited representation would \u201clikely ... be inconclusive of the underlying rights in issue, including those of the prevailing plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We accordingly concluded that, on remand, the sectarian operators \u201cwho claim entitlement to free exercise protection should be parties to the action\u201d and that they should be given \u201ca fair opportunity to intervene\u201d and, assuming qualification under Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., to qualify as a class. Upon intervention of the sectarian operators as a class,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">further evidentiary proceedings may be devoted to developing \u2014 under applicable substantive doctrine and appropriately allocated burdens of proof, <em>see </em>Part II, <em>supra </em>\u2014 the extent of any free exercise rights had by the sectarian institutions in the exempted activities, and the nature and extent of any compelling state interest in nevertheless regulating those activities. This will provide a basis \u2014 not now provided \u2014 for a properly informed \u201cvalue judgment\u201d by the court of the constitutionally permissible extent, under establishment clause constraints, of the accommodation to free exercise rights made in the challenged exemption. 728 F.2d at 246.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The cause was thus remanded to the district court for further action in accordance with the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On remand, the district court in essence held that, while the petitioning sectarian operators might be tentatively permitted to intervene as parties, that right was conditioned on their qualifying as class representatives under Rule 23. It held that the sectarian operators could not qualify under Rule 23, among other reasons, since, because of the differences in religious beliefs and doctrines among the churches, it is difficult to find a common nexus of law and fact sufficient to support class certification. After declaring that it found our decision on the merits \u201cwrong, profoundly wrong,\u201d it ruled broadly but incorrectly that in our decision, we had held that none of the activities of these centers were protected from state regulation under free religious rights. Specifically, it dismissed the suggestion made by us in our opinion that some of the activities of the sectarian child centers might qualify for free religion protection. It slated erroneously and hyper-bolically that our ruling had in effect held that \u201cthe establishment clause [had] devoured the free exercise clause \u201cand that, though the sectarian operators had cited \u201cseveral instances where regulation [under the Virginia statute] impinge[d] upon the church\u2019s free exercise of its religious beliefs\u201d our decision had \u201cdecided that, ... a failure to regulate [this free exercise of one\u2019s religious beliefs],\u201d would work a violation of the establishment clause of the Constitution. It accordingly revoked the intervention of the sectarian operators, denied them any right to class certification or an opportunity to conduct discovery, or to present evidence, and granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, as it said \u201cin accordance with and for the reasons set forth by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion\u201d in this case. In effect, the decision of the district court misapprehended the purport of our decision and nullified entirely the purposes of a remand herein. It is, therefore, necessary to return the cause to the district court for the purposes stated in our earlier opinion herein. In that connection, the parties on appeal have raised the point that <em>Wallace v. Jaffree, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985), decided since our decision, has to some extent affected the result we reached in our earlier opinion. Without deciding whether that decision made any change in the pertinent law involved in this proceeding, we direct the district court to give consideration to that decision in its findings and conclusions upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. The opinion emphasized in note 16, p. 245, that the court was not to be understood as expressing an \"opinion as to whether portions of the statutory exemption may be found constitutional upon more complete inquiry. We simply recognize[d] that as a possibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
