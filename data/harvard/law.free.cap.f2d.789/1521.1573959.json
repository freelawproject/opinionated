This is frivolous, since the prior conviction is an element of the offense charged and must be revealed to fairly inform the person charged of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-11\">For the same reasons, proof at trial of the prior offense does not constitute double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-12\">The argument that the indictment is unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous, or so vague and ambiguous that it requires a hearing to determine its content, is frivolous. The indictment tracks the statute and states date, time, place and participants involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-13\">Counsel was not ineffective in refusing to call a state sheriff and a notary public to testify that Dees had been issued gun license and a deputy sheriff\u2019s card and that he had worked undercover trying to make buys on guns that had been previously taken in a burglary. A convicted felon may lift his firearms disability if he receives a pardon expressly permitting him to possess a firearm, or gets the predicate conviction vacated before obtaining a weapon, or secures the consent of the secretary of the treasury. <em>Lewis v. U.S., </em>445 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980); <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 114 N. 10, 103 S.Ct. 986, 993 N. 10, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983). Dees does not suggest, and we do not find, any precedent to support the proposition that the issue of a $5.00 pistol license and a deputy sheriff's card, or participation in making buys of burglarized guns, is a defense to the charges made in this case. Counsel did not err in declining to call these witnesses for the purposes indicated. Further, with respect to the notary public, Dees contends that the notary\u2019s testimony would have disputed that of a government witness concerning \u201ccertain business transactions with the defendant.\u201d There was not a sufficient presentation of how the notary\u2019s testimony would have disputed the government witness\u2019s testimony or of what the business transactions were. The district court did not err in concluding that no prejudice was demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
