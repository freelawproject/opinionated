(CBT) and the Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Company IRA Collective Investment Fund and entering judgment in defendants\u2019 favor. Judge Ca-branes\u2019 decision is reported at 630 F.Supp. 593 (D.Conn.1986). Plaintiff in its complaint challenged the legality of an administrative ruling of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which declared that the Glass-Steagall Act does not prohibit, and that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 92a (1982) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 permit, CBT to create a mutual fund for Individual Retirement Accounts and to market and promote the fund\u2019s shares to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-19\">The key issue in this appeal is whether CBT\u2019s offering of shares of its IRA Collective Investment Fund constitutes the sale of securities, barred by the Glass-Steagall Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh), or a sale of fiduciary services permissible under the Act as construed by <em>Investment Company Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 638, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1102, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-20\">We believe that it is the latter and affirm the district court judgment for substantially the reasons contained in Judge Ca-branes' Ruling on Cross-Motions For Summary Judgment dated January 21,1986 and reported at 630 F.Supp. 593 (D.Conn.1986).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
