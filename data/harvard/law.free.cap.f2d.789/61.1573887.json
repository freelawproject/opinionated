Under that rate schedule, Tennessee made available interruptible transportation service to pipeline customers and local distribution companies. Tennessee undertook to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to provide this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">As an incentive for Tennessee\u2019s interrup-tible transportation service customers to estimate their service requirements accurately, Tennessee required shippers that utilized the service for more than sixty days to pay a minimum bill, even if their actual usage of the service would have warranted a smaller bill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">On December 28, 1981 FERC accepted the Rate Schedule IT tariff sheets for filing and allowed them to go into effect subject to refund. FERC consolidated the Rate Schedule IT matter with other pending rate matters involving Tennessee in an order issued January 25, 1982, and later added another Tennessee matter, a general rate increase, to the matters already consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">On November 29, 1983 Tennessee filed with FERC a Stipulation that settled or established procedures to resolve all the consolidated matters then pending. The Commission approved the Stipulation. FERC subsequently issued an order, and later a second clarifying order, interpreting the Stipulation to require Tennessee to refund minimum bill charges under Tennessee\u2019s Rate Schedule IT for the period February 1, 1983 to December 31, 1983. Tennessee petitioned this court to reverse and set aside the orders to the extent that they require IT minimum bill refunds. We now do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-19\">In <em>Kansas Cities v. FERC, </em>723 F.2d 82 (D.C. Cir.1983), we stated that FERC\u2019s interpretation of a contract is entitled to deference if \u201c \u2018amply supported both factually and legally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 (quoting <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div., </em>358 U.S. 103, 114, 79 S.Ct. 194, 200, 3 L.Ed.2d 153 (1958)). It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether <em>Kansas Cities, </em>a case involving interpretation of a contract between a utility and municipalities, governs a case in which FERC\u2019s staff is a party. We think it inappropriate to defer to FERC\u2019s interpretation in any event because the Commission has vacillated in articulating a rationale for its result. \u2022 FERC\u2019s first order relied on a concededly mistaken construction by the Commission of one of its own regulations; its clarifying order relied on Articles II and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>III \u201cread together\u201d; and on appeal, FERC\u2019s counsel relied on the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Article III.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This removes the usual presumption of deference that attends administrative decisions made in the exercise of the agency\u2019s delegated authority. FERC\u2019s handling of the case demonstrates tenacious dedication to a particular result \u2014 which the Commission later enshrined as policy when it determined in 1985 that the IT minimum bill was unjust and unreasonable, <em>see </em>Opinion No. 240, <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., </em>32 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,086 (1985), <em>aff'g in part Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., </em>25 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 63,052 (1983) \u2014 but does not constitute the kind of reasoned decision-making to which we will defer. <em>See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>570 F.2d 1021, 1025-26 (D.C. Cir.1978) (inconsistency in FERC\u2019s orders construing settlement agreement demonstrates irrationality). FERC may not, of course, directly or indirectly rely on Opinion No. 240 in interpreting the Stipulation to give the later enacted policy retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Turning to the merits of the interpretation issue, we note first that the Stipulation is somewhat ambiguous as to the issue before us. We conclude, however, that Tennessee\u2019s interpretation is decidedly the more reasonable. First, nowhere in the Stipulation is there stated a positive obligation to refund the minimum bill charges. This is in contrast with the explicit refund obligations enumerated in Article II, section 7, and Article III, section 3. Second, we find unpersuasive FERC\u2019s most prominent group of arguments, that various provisions of Articles II and III construed together mandate elimination of the minimum bill from the tariff for the entire docket period and therefore require a refund. We conclude that the controlling provisions are the more specific ones by which Tennessee is directed to eliminate the minimum bill (Art. Ill, \u00a7 2(i)) and to file, <em>after </em>the effective date of the Stipulation, revised tariff sheets reflecting that change. Art. II, \u00a7 5. The revised tariff sheets were expressly given prospective effect. Art. II, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We have reviewed all of the Commission\u2019s arguments in defense of its interpretation, but find them unconvincing. Therefore, we reverse the Commission\u2019s orders to the extent that they require Tennessee to refund minimum bill charges under its Rate Schedule IT.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-14\">. The minimum bill charges were computed according to a formula based on 66\u2154 percent of the maximum daily transportation quantity stated in the shippers\u2019 service agreements with Tennessee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>. </em>Counsel\u2019s \"plain meaning\u201d argument is related to but distinct from the Commission\u2019s \"read together\" rationale. Both rely on Article Il's definition of the docket period, and on Article III, section 2(i) which directs Tennessee to revise its IT Rate Schedule to eliminate the minimum bill. But the Commission relied on Article II, section 7 as authority for the refund requirement, whereas counsel argued that elimination of the minimum bill for the entire docket period meant that \u201cthere is no basis in the filed rate for those charges after [February 1, 1983] and refunds must be made.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 10. The Commission\u2019s action must stand, of course, on its own reasoning. Counsel\u2019s post hoc rationalizations cannot sustain it. <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b141-10\">MIKVA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZt\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Interpreting the Stipulation filed by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, the Commission ruled that it did not authorize collection of a minimum bill for the pipeline\u2019s interruptible-transport (IT) service from February 1 to December 31, 1983. The Commission therefore ordered petitioner to make refunds of minimum bill charges it had collected in connection with its IT service during that period. The majority decision reverses the Commission\u2019s order, stating that \u201cthe Commission has vacillated in articulating a rationale for its result.\u201d I find in the record, however, no such fatal wavering on the part of the Commission. In its clarifying order, the Commission simply corrected the grounds it had previously offered for its refund order. The Commission confessed that it had erred in determining that Article III, section 3 of the Stipulation imposed a general obligation upon Tennessee to make refunds to all categories of IT shippers. In defense of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>refund order, the Commission then articulated a reasonable reading of the Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Commission stated that Articles II and III of the Stipulation, read together, require Tennessee to delete the minimum bill provision from the IT rate schedule for the eleven-month docket period in 1983. The Commission reasoned that Article II, sections 2 and 3 require Tennessee, in calculating its settlement rates for this period, to reflect the Interim Methods set forth in Article III, section 2. One of these Interim Methods included Tennessee\u2019s commitment to revise its IT rate schedule in order to eliminate the minimum bill. Thus the Stipulation bound Tennessee to eliminate the minimum bill charge from its tariff for the entire docket period, and to refund amounts attributable to that minimum bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This interpretation is entitled to judicial deference; the Commission\u2019s adherence to the result it originally reached, which the majority tries to stigmatize as \u201ctenacious dedication to a particular result,\u201d provides no sound reason for suspending the deference due to an agency\u2019s determination within its expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In clarifying its order, the Commission admitted error and corrected itself. The Commission\u2019s amended rationale for its order is reasonable and should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
