The district court was instructed to rule on appellant\u2019s request that conditions be attached to any dismissal of this case without prejudice, and to set forth in writing the findings and conclusions on which the court relied in reaching its dera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>sion in that regard. We retained jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-4\">On remand, the district court imposed conditions on the dismissal of plaintiff-ap-pellee\u2019s suit that included limitations on discovery to be conducted by plaintiff-ap-pellee in the similar action appellee intends to file in Mississippi, limitations on the expert witnesses that appellant would be permitted to call in the action in Mississippi, and the requirement that appellee reimburse appellant $2,817.50 for the expenses appellant incurred in researching and pressing its statute of limitations defense in this action. The court\u2019s order was amply supported by necessary findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-5\">We invited the parties to submit supplemental memoranda if they wished to do so. Appellant indicated its satisfaction with the order of the district court, and appellee did not respond. We have carefully considered the opinion and order of the district court and such arguments as the parties have chosen to make. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
