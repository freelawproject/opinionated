Telesca, <em>Judge, </em>affirming without opinion a decision of Judge Edward D. Hayes of the bankruptcy court (reported at 46 B.R. 88 (1985)) in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of McFarlin\u2019s Inc. The decision held that \u201cwithdrawal liability\u201d incurred by McFarlin\u2019s under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act (MPPAA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381(a) <em>et seq., </em>must be asserted by the Fund as a general unsecured claim and hence is not entitled to priority as an expense of administering the estate under the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507, or under the MPPAA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">\u201cWithdrawal liability\u201d is a term used to describe an employer\u2019s obligation, upon his withdrawing from a multiemployer pension and employee benefit plan requiring him to make periodic payments toward employees' insurance and pensions, to make a lump sum payment of additional money to the fund. This payment is required to satisfy the employer\u2019s pro rata share of the vested but unfunded benefits to be paid to employees participating in the plan, including those employed by others. The obligation was created by Congress after it found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-23\">\u201c(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>creased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and \u201c(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in sub-paragraph (A) are exacerbated.\u201d MPPAA \u00a7 3(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001a(a)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Congress was concerned that, unless a withdrawing employer assumed such a liability, the remaining employer participants would be unable to shoulder the increased burden caused by the withdrawal, which might lead to a collapse of the entire multi-employer plan. <em>See infra </em>at 102-103. The withdrawal payment is not made by the withdrawing employer to his own employees but to the Fund in order to help defray the total unfunded vested liability of the pension plan to which he had been contributing.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Before filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 <em>et seq., </em>McFarlin\u2019s was in the business of altering and selling at retail men\u2019s and boys\u2019 clothing. The employees in its alteration department were represented by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO (\u201cUnion\u201d). Under its collective bargaining agreement with that union McFarlin\u2019s made weekly contributions amounting to 15% of the gross wages of those employees to the Fund, a multiemployer pension and benefit plan which provided retirement, life, accident and health insurance to the covered employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On March 16, 1982, McFarlin\u2019s filed its Chapter 11 petition and was authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession. Thereafter it maintained its alteration department for a time, employing persons covered by the collective bargaining agreement and making all required contributions to the Fund. On or about November 13,1982, however, McFarlin\u2019s closed its alteration department and, though it retained its sales staff, \u201ceffective that date [it] permanently ceased all operations employing employees covered by the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381(a) provides that if an employer withdraws from a multiem-ployer plan he is liable to the plan in the amount determined under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 to be his \u201cwithdrawal liability.\u201d The Trustees of the Fund, after determining that McFarlin\u2019s withdrawal liability was $57,-969.76, filed a claim for that amount in the Chapter 11 proceeding and asserted that the withdrawal liability was an expense of administration entitled to first priority under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(a)(1). In response, McFarlin\u2019s Creditor\u2019s Committee requested the bankruptcy court to reclassify the debt as a general unsecured claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">McFarlin\u2019s thereafter went out of business and the Creditor\u2019s Committee proposed a liquidation plan which was approved by the bankruptcy court on September 1, 1984. Under Article VI of that plan, McFarlin\u2019s rejected all executory contracts, including its collective bargaining agreement with the Union, which it had not confirmed while operating as debtor in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">On January 28, 1985, the bankruptcy court ruled that the McFarlin\u2019s withdrawal liability gave rise to a general unsecured claim, not an administrative expense meriting priority over McFarlin\u2019s other debts. The Western District of New York affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The central question is whether the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or the MPPAA mandate that McFarlin\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal liability\u201d be given first priority among McFarlin\u2019s debts. The Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507, defines those expenses and claims against a bankrupt estate that are entitled to priority in a bankruptcy proceeding. Because the presumption in bankruptcy cases is that the debt- or\u2019s limited resources will be equally distributed among his creditors, statutory priorities are narrowly construed. <em>Joint Industry Board v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 224, 228, 88 S.Ct. 1491, 1493, 20 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>546 (1968); <em>In re United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 348, 349 (2d Cir.1979); <em>In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., </em>536 F.2d 950, 953 (1st Cir.1976). \u201c[I]f one claimant is to be preferred over others, the purpose should be clear from the statute.\u201d <em>Nathanson v. N.L.R.B., </em>344 U.S. 25, 29, 73 S.Ct. 80, 83, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952). <em>See also Matter of Jartran, Inc., </em>732 F.2d 584, 586 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Section 507 gives first priority to \u201cadministrative expenses allowed under [11 U.S.C.] section 503(b).\u201d Section. 503(b)(1)(A) defines administrative expenses as including \u201cthe actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate, including wages, salaries or commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fund contends McFarlin\u2019s withdrawal liability satisfies that definition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Congress granted priority to administrative expenses in order to facilitate the efforts of the trustee or debtor in possession to rehabilitate the business for the benefit of all the estate\u2019s creditors. <em>Mammoth Mart, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 953. <em>See also Yorke v. N.L.R.B., </em>709 F.2d 1138, 1143 (7th Cir.1983) (administrative expenses arise from operating the estate \u201cin the overall interests of the creditors.\u201d). Congress reasoned that unless the debts incurred by the debtor in possession could be given priority over the debts which forced the estate into bankruptcy in the first place, persons would not do business with the debtor in possession, which would inhibit rehabilitation of the business and thus harm the creditors. <em>Mammoth Mart, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 953. <em>See also Jartran, supra, </em>732 F.2d at 586; <em>Matter of Fuzzy Thurston\u2019s Eau Claire Left Guard, </em>33 B.R. 579, 581 (Bankr., W.D.Wisc.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Accordingly, an expense is administrative only if it arises out of a transaction between the creditor and the bankrupt\u2019s trustee or debtor in possession, <em>Jartran, supra, </em>732 F.2d at 587; <em>Straus-Duparquet, Inc. v. Local U. No. 3 Int. Bro. of Elec. Wkrs., </em>386 F.2d 649, 651 (2d Cir.1967) and \u201conly to the extent that the consideration supporting the claimant\u2019s right to payment was both supplied to and beneficial to the debtor-in-possession in the operation of the business.\u201d <em>Mammoth Mart, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 954. <em>See also Jartran, supra, </em>732 F.2d at 587; <em>In re Freedomland, Inc., </em>480 F.2d 184, 189 (2d Cir.1973); <em>American A. &amp; B. Coal Corp. v. Leonardo Arrivabene, S.A., </em>280 F.2d 119, 124 (2d Cir.1960); <em>In re Baths International Inc., </em>31 B.R. 143, 145 (S.D.N.Y.1983). A debt is not entitled to priority simply because the right to payment arises after the debtor in possession has begun managing the estate. <em>Jartran, supra, </em>732 F.2d at 587; <em>Mammoth Mart, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Thus, whether the McFarlin\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal liability\u201d is an administrative expense depends upon the consideration supporting the Fund\u2019s right to receive it. The history of the MPPAA demonstrates that the employer\u2019s lump sum payment in satisfaction of his withdrawal liability is made to guarantee pension benefits already earned by those employees covered by the Plan. Were the employer not withdrawing from the plan, he would be obligated to continue making periodic contributions to the Fund after his withdrawal. The consideration supporting the withdrawal liability is, therefore, the same as that supporting the pensions themselves, the past labor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>employees covered by the Plan. See, e.g., House Report (Education and Labor Committee) No. 93-533, Oct. 2, 1973, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4639, 4640 (pension payments deferred compensation for labor).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The MPPAA was enacted as a result of experience following World War II, when steadily increasing numbers of employees successfully bargained with their employers for pension benefits. <em>Id. </em>4640-41. Most employers provided the benefits through private plans. <em>Id. </em>In 1974 Congress adopted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to protect employees with pension rights vested in such plans from the \u201cgreat personal tragedy\u201d of losing those rights when the plans terminated. <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 374, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1733, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980) (quoting statement of Senator Bentsen, 3 Leg. History of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4793 (Comm.Print 1976)). <em>See also Textile Workers Pension v. Standard Dye &amp; Finishing, </em>725 F.2d 843, 847 (2d Cir. 1984). ERISA regulated the funding, management, operation and benefit provisions of private pension plans and established a program to insure employee benefits in the event of plan termination. The insurance program was administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As originally structured ERISA allowed some employers to withdraw from pension plans without requiring them to pay for benefits promised to and earned by their employees. \u201cIf an employer wanted to withdraw [from a plan] it could do so without incurring liability, unless the plan terminated within five years of the employer\u2019s withdrawal without assets sufficient to provide employee benefits\u201d at the level guaranteed by the PBGC. <em>Textile Workers, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 848. The withdrawal of employers allowed them to leave plans without fully funding the benefits vested in, and therefore earned by, their employees up to the time of the withdrawal. Then, as now, employers contributed to multiemployer plans at rates specified in their collective bargaining agreements with their employees\u2019 unions. The contributions were based \u201con hours worked by employees, units of production ... or a percentage of compensation.\u201d House Report (Education and Labor Committee) No. 869, Apr. 3, 1980, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 2918, 2921. (H.R. No. 869). Plan trustees established plan benefit levels based on their projection of the plan\u2019s expected resources and the cost of benefits. \u201cThe resources of a plan available to pay those benefits consist of assets held by the plan. Future contributions expected by the plan and income expected to be earned on plan investments for the future.\u201d Joint Explanation of S.1076: Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, 126 Cong.Rec. S.20189, S.20191 (July 29, 1980) (Joint Explanation). Accordingly, the plan, and, indirectly, each participating employer promised to all participating employees (including those employed by others) benefits based on projections of future employer contributions. However, when an employer withdrew from the plan, the plan was \u201cunlikely to have the resources necessary to provide benefits promised to employees,\u201d <em>id., </em>unless a way was found to compensate the plan for the value of the future contributions it would lose because of his withdrawal. Moreover, the amount of the employers\u2019 contributions often did not, in fact, cover the present value of those benefits. \u201c[B]ecause benefit promises may be funded over many years after they are made, the withdrawing employer may not have made sufficient contributions to the plan to fund a fair share of the cost of those benefit promises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at S.20192.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Congress concluded that, if an employer were permitted to withdraw from a plan without paying his share of the funds needed to fully fund the vested benefits of the employees covered by the plan, other employers would be encouraged to desert plans. That, in turn, would endanger the plans themselves, placing a heavy burden on the PBGC and threatening those bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>fits which the PBGC did not insure. Absent a withdrawal liability, once an employer withdrew from a plan the contributions required of the remaining employers to fund the plan\u2019s vested benefits would increase. Congress concluded that \u201cthe rising costs ... [could] encourage \u2014 or force\u2014 further withdrawals, thereby increasing the inherited liabilities to be funded by an ever-decreasing contribution base. This vicious downward spiral ... [could] continue until it ... [was] no longer reasonable or possible for the pension plan to continue.\u201d <em>Textile Workers, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 848 (quoting Pension Plan Termination Insurance Issues: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Oversight of Committee on Ways &amp; Means, House of Representatives, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1978)). <em>See also </em>H.R. No. 869, <em>supra, </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Congress therefore in 1980 adopted the MPPAA. The Act mandates that if \u201can employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan in a complete or partial withdrawal,\u201d he incurs a \u201cwithdrawal liability\u201d to the plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381(a). This liability is designed to insure that before leaving a plan an employer would pay his \u201cproportionate\u201d share of the plan\u2019s liability for vested but unfunded benefits attributable to work already performed. H.R. 869, <em>supra, </em>at 67. <em>See also Textile Workers, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 849; Joint Explanation, <em>supra, </em>at S.20195. That liability usually accumulates over a period of years prior to the departure of the withdrawing employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The manner in which the MPPAA calculates withdrawal liability confirms that the liability represents an employer\u2019s accelerated contribution of funds needed to finance employees\u2019 pension rights which have vested at the time of withdrawal but which have not been fully funded at that date. Each of the MPPAA\u2019s four methods of establishing the amount of \u201cwithdrawal liability,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, accordingly extrapolate the employer\u2019s proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded, vested benefits from such factors as the employer\u2019s past contributions to the plan and the portion of the plan\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations attributable to the employer\u2019s employees. H.R. No. 869, <em>supra, </em>at 67, 71, 77-78, 82, House Report (Ways and Means Committee) No. 76-869(11), Apr. 23, 1980, 96th Cong.2d Sess., at 16. Under the \u201cpresumptive\u201d method, which the Fund applied .in the present case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">\u201ca plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits accumulated in the years ending before ... [September 25, 1980], are to be allocated to the employers who maintained the plan before that date and continued to maintain the plan after ... [Sept. 25, 1980]. The share of those unfunded vested benefits for which an employer is liable generally depends upon the employer\u2019s proportionate share of total contributions to the plan during the five plan years preceding ... [Sept. 25, 1980]. A change in unfunded vested benefits for a year ending after ... [Sept. 25, 1980] is generally to be allocated to withdrawing employers in proportion to their plan contributions for the five plan years preceding the year of withdrawal.\u201d Joint Explanation, <em>supra, </em>at S.20190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Since withdrawal liability is based on the withdrawing employer\u2019s contributions to the Plan prior to the year before the employer withdraws, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, McFarlin\u2019s withdrawal liability is related to the years 1975-81. The consideration supporting its withdrawal liability was, therefore, the work of employees in the alteration department during those earlier years. Since McFarlin\u2019s did not file for bankruptcy and become a debtor in possession until March 1982, this consideration was not furnished for the benefit of the debtor in possession or for the continuation of McFarlin\u2019s business after it went into bankruptcy. It is attributable to the period pre-dating the filing of the Chapter 11 petition. It cannot, therefore, qualify as an administrative expense within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 503(b)(1)(A)\" and 507 of the Bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>cy Code since it was not incurred for the benefit of the estate\u2019s creditors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The foregoing view finds support in decisions uniformly rejecting the argument that withdrawal liability is entitled to priority as an administrative expense incurred by the trustee in bankruptcy or debtor in possession in order to operate or preserve the business. <em>Trustees of Amal. Ins. Fund v. Kessler, </em>55 B.R. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); <em>In re United Department Stores, Inc., </em>49 B.R. 462, 12 Collier, Bankruptcy Cases 1424 (Bankr., S.D.N.Y.1985); <em>In re Cott Corp., </em>47 B.R. 487, Bankr.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 70,304 (Bankr., D.Conn.1984); <em>In re Pulaski Highway Exp., Inc., </em>41 B.R. 305, 310-11 (Bankr., N.D.Tenn.1984); <em>In re Concrete Pipe Machinery Co., </em>28 B.R. 837, 8 Collier, Bankruptcy Cases 294, 299 (Bankr., N.D.Iowa 1983); <em>In re Granada Wines, Inc., </em>26 B.R. 131, 134 (Bankr., D.Mass.1983); <em>In re Goldblatt Bros., Inc., </em>No. 81-B-7075 (Bankr., N.D.Ill. Nov. 12, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Our decision is not inconsistent with cases holding that a bankrupt\u2019s obligation to pay severance pay, which arises out of the termination of an employee during bankruptcy, is an administrative expense entitled to priority. <em>See, e.g., In re W.T. Grant Co., </em>620 F.2d 319, 320-21 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 983, 100 S.Ct. 2963, 64 L.Ed.2d 839 (1980); <em>Matter of Unishops, Inc., </em>553 F.2d 305, 308 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Straus-Duparquet, Inc. v. Local U. No. 3 Int. Bro. of Elec. Wkrs., </em>386 F.2d 649, 650-51 (2d Cir.1967). These decisions rest on the basis that severance pay is compensation for the hardship which all employees, regardless of their length of service, suffer when they are terminated and that it is therefore \u201cearned\u201d when the employees are dismissed. Accordingly it is granted a first priority as a cost of doing business during the bankruptcy proceeding. An employer\u2019s withdrawal liability payment, on the other hand, is the means by which the employer funds benefits that his employees have \u201cearned\u201d by their past service and that he would normally finance through continuing contributions to his employees\u2019 pension plan. Indeed, it appears to be the general rule that when severance pay, like vacation pay, represents compensation for the employee's past services it is not an administrative expense entitled to priority. <em>Matter of Pacific Far East Line, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 476, 478 (9th Cir.1983); <em>In re Health Maintenance Foundation, </em>680 F.2d 619, 621-22 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Mammoth Mart, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 955; <em>Alpert v. New York, New Haven and Hartford R.R. Co., </em>348 F.2d 304, 306 (2d Cir.1965); <em>In re Public Ledger, </em>161 F.2d 762, 769-71, 773 (3d Cir.1947). The \u201cseverance pay\u201d decisions, therefore, lend no support to the Fund\u2019s contention in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Fund next argues that, regardless of the foregoing, at least 50% of an insolvent employer\u2019s withdrawal liability is entitled to priority under \u00a7 4225(b) of the MPPAA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1405(b). We disagree. Section 1405(b) provides that in the case of withdrawal by an insolvent employer undergoing liquidation or dissolution the employer shall be liable in a sum not in excess of 50% of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to it and, for the second 50%, only to the extent that the value of the estate less the first 50% of withdrawal liability exceeds its liabilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Matter of Cott Corp., </em>26 B.R. 332, 335 (Bankr., D.Conn.1982); Soble, \u201cBankruptcy Claims of Multi-Employer Pension Plans,\u201d 33 <em>Labor Law Journal </em>57, 60 (1982); Perkins, \u201cPension Claims In Bankruptcy,\u201d 32 <em>Labor Law Journal </em>343, 343 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Neither the language nor the purpose of \u00a7 1405(b)(1) suggests that the first 50% of an employer\u2019s withdrawal liability is entitled to priority over other debts. It establishes only the extent or amount by which a fund claiming withdrawal liability against an insolvent employer will receive full creditor treatment. Congress simply recognized that in certain limited circumstances the interests of the withdrawing employer outweighed those of the employees whose benefits were at stake and of other employers in the Plan who would be required partially to fund the shortfall resulting from the withdrawal. In short, \u00a7 1405 amounts to a \u201cspecial relief rule,\u201d Joint Explanation, <em>supra </em>at S.20195, enacted to enable economically strapped employers to survive and designed to help pension funds by encouraging creditors to lend to such employers. As a further step toward assisting the funds in such circumstances, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(a), (b), requires the government to establish a program under which Multiemployer Pension and Employee Benefit Plans will be reimbursed for withdrawal liability payments that are uncollectible because the withdrawing employer has undergone Chapter 11 or similar proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">For the foregoing reasons the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">.

Title 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A), which defines administrative expense as including the actual necessary expenses of preserving the estate, is derived from \u00a7 64a(l), Senate Report (Judiciary Committee) No. 95-989, July 14, 1978, 66 <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5852; House Report (Judiciary Committee) No. 95-595, Sept. 8, 1977, 355 <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 6311.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Accordingly, judicial interpretations of the old 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1) are relevant to the interpretation of the new 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A). <em>See, e.g., Matter of Jartran, Inc., 732 </em>F.2d 584 (7th Cir.1984); <em>In re Baths International, Inc., </em>31 B.R. 143, 145 (Bankr., S.D.N.Y.1983). They will be relied on throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>. </em>Having concluded that under the terms of the MPPAA withdrawal liability is attributable to a period pre-dating the McFarlin\u2019s Chapter 11 proceeding and cannot therefore be treated as an administrative expense, we need not express any views regarding the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s rationale to the effect that the same result is dictated by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a). Under that provision the debtor-in-possession\u2019s rejection of an executory contract such as a collective bargaining agreement, <em>N.L.R.B. v. Bildisco and Bildisco, </em>465 U.S. 513, 104 S.Ct. 1188, 1194-95 &amp; n. 6, 79 L.Ed.2d 482 (1984), is backdated to the date immediately preceding the filing of the Chapter 11 proceeding, in this case to March 16, 1982. Moreover, McFarlin\u2019s compliance with the collective bargaining agreement during the period from March 16, 1982, to November 13, 1982, and later inaction until it was rejected in September 1984, did not constitute either an assumption or a rejection of the contract. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Whitcomb &amp; Keller Mortg. Co., Inc., </em>715 F.2d 375, 380 (7th Cir.1983); <em>In re Kelly Lyn Franchise Co., Inc., 26 </em>B.R. 441, 444-45 (Bankr., M.D.Tenn.1983); <em>In re Marple Publishing Co., Inc., </em>20 B.R. 933, 935 (Bankr., E.D. Pa. 1982); <em>In re Price Chopper Supermarkets, Inc., </em>19 B.R. 462, 467 (Bankr., S.D.Cal.1982); 2 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 365.03[1] at 365-26 (15th ed. 1984) (1985 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">However, we do note that withdrawal liability does not derive from the collective bargaining agreement but from the MPPAA and that reliance on \u00a7 365 of the Bankruptcy Code would appear to conflict with the MPPAA\u2019s provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a), (e), that withdrawal occurs when an employer <em>\u201cpermanently </em>ceases all covered operations under the plan\u201d (emphasis supplied). In this case that did not occur until November 13, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\">.
