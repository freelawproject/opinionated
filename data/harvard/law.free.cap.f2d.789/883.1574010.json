We find that sanctions are appropriate here. It was pointed out to King in the district court\u2019s order that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a) provides that no suit can be maintained for recovery of any tax or penalty until an administrative claim for refund has been filed. The statute is unambiguous and could not possibly have been mistaken. Moreover, the case law makes it clear that filing a claim for an administrative refund is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintenance of a refund suit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co., </em>283 U.S. 269, 273, 51 S.Ct. 376, 378, 75 L.Ed. 1025 (1931); <em>Rock Island, A. &amp; L.R. Co. v. United States, </em>254 U.S. 141, 142-43, 41 S.Ct. 55, 56, 65 L.Ed. 188 (1920); <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>332 F.2d 657, 659 (5th Cir.1964);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Zernial v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 431, 434 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Dixie Margarine Co. v. Shaefer, </em>139 F.2d 221, 223 (6th Cir.1943), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 U.S. 791, 64 S.Ct. 789, 88 L.Ed. 1081 (1944). In light of the district court order pointing out the law and the absolute clarity of the statute, it is obvious that King\u2019s appeal is frivolous. The arguments which King makes in order to skirt this issue have been asserted to this court numerous times and have been declared by this court to be frivolous. Therefore, sanctions pursuant to Rule 38 are entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">In lieu of remanding this case to the district court for an assessment of costs and attorney\u2019s fees, the government urges, in the interest of judicial economy, that this court enter an award of damages in a set amount. In this regard, the government has represented to the court that the average award ordered by courts in cases such as this during the relevant time period was $1,246. Although we would have preferred that the government establish its costs and attorney\u2019s fees by affidavit, since King has not disputed the government\u2019s representation of $1,246, we accept same. This procedure is also in King\u2019s interest since he would be liable for the additional costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees incurred during any proceedings on remand. Under these circumstances, we award the government damages of $1,246.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">AFFIRMED and SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-13\">.
