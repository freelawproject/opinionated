PECK, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1603-13\">Appellants, Certain British Underwriters at Lloyds of London (\u201cUnderwriters\u201d), brought this action for a declaratory judgment against their insured, Aero Service International, Inc. (\u201cAero Service\u201d) and Jet Charter Service, Inc. (\u201cJet Charter\u201d), owner of an aircraft damaged at Aero Service\u2019s repair facility. Underwriters sought a determination that an insurance policy subscribed to by Underwriters did not provide coverage for the damage to Jet Charter\u2019s aircraft while it was being repaired by Aero Service. Aero Service and Jet Charter counterclaimed for coverage under the insurance contract for the damage to Jet Charter\u2019s aircraft. The trial court granted Aero Service\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-14\">Aero Service is an aviation repair facility located at Miami International Airport. In August 1982, Jet Charter delivered a Boeing 707 aircraft to Aero Service for maintenance. The aircraft slipped off its jacks during a weight and balance check and sustained severe structural damage. At the time of this incident a policy entitled \u201cAirport Owners and Operators Liability Insurance\u201d issued by Underwriters to Aero Service was in effect. Aero Service filed a claim under this policy for the damage to Jet Charter\u2019s airplane. Underwriters rejected the claim on the basis that an airplane was not a \u201cvehicle\u201d such as would bring the aircraft within an exception to an exclusion from coverage. The instant action ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-17\">In order to determine whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the appellees, we must turn to the insurance contract. It is a well settled rule of Florida law that parol or extrinsic evidence may not be introduced for the purpose of construing written contract terms which are plain and unambiguous. <em>Garcia v. The Queen, Ltd., </em>487 F.2d 625, 630 (5th Cir.1973). The Schedule attached to the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-18\">The risk and sum insured hereunder Risk: Legal Liability arising out of the Assureds [sic] operation as FAA Aircraft Repair Station, Flight Crew Training School, Dispatch/Flight Following Center and Cargo Handling Agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-19\">Sum Insured: $5,000,000 Single Limit BI/PD any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1603-20\">The policy itself, a form contract supplied by Underwriters, is entitled \u201cAirport Owners and Operators Liability Insurance.\u201d The policy is composed of three sections, plus a list of exclusions, a definitions section, and a list of general conditions. On the policy issued to Aero Service, Sections 2 and 3 and the list of exclusions are stamped \u201cTHIS CLAUSE VOID.\u201d Thus, only Section 1, Definitions, and General Conditions are the operative portions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-21\">Section 1 provides coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-22\">Bodily injury or property damage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-23\">(a) in or about the premises specified in the Schedule, as a direct result of the services granted by the Assured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-24\">(b) elsewhere in the course of any work or of the performance of any duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>carried out by the Assured or his employees in connection with the business or operations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1604-4\">caused by the fault or negligence of the Assured or any of his employees engaged in the Assured\u2019s business or by any defect in the Assured\u2019s premises, ways, works, machinery or plant used in the Assured\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1604-5\">Section 1 includes the following exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1604-6\">1. Loss of or damage to property owned or occupied by or in the care, custody or control of the Assured or of any servant of the Assured, but this exclusion shall be deemed not to apply to vehicles that are not the property of the Assured whilst on the premises specified in the Schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1604-7\">2. Bodily injury or property damage caused by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1604-8\">(a) any mechanically propelled vehicle which the Assured may cause or permit any other person to use on the road in such a manner as to render them responsible for insurance under any domestic or international law appertaining to road traffic, or where no such law exists, whilst such vehicle is on any public highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1604-9\">(b) any Ships, Vessels, Craft or Aircraft owned, chartered, used or operated by or on account of the Assured, but this exclusion shall be deemed not to apply to aircraft owned by others which are on the ground and for which indemnity is otherwise granted under Section 2 of this Policy, whether such Section is insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1604-10\">Section 2 of the policy, which is stamped \u201cvoid\u201d and thus does not apply to Aero Service, provides for coverage of \u201cLoss of or damage to Aircraft or Aircraft equipment, not the property of the Assured, whilst on the ground in the care, custody or control of the Assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-11\">Nowhere in the policy is the word \u201cvehicle\u201d defined. It is the position of the appellees that the term \u201cvehicles\u201d as used in the exception to the first exclusion of \u00a7 1 applies to aircraft. Consequently, ap-pellees argue that the exclusion does not apply to aircraft not the property of Aero Services but on its premises and under its care, custody or control. Under appellees\u2019 interpretation, the damage to the ill-fated Boeing 707 would be covered by the contract. Underwriters, on the other hand, contends that the exclusion is applicable because the term \u201cvehicle,\u201d when read in the context of the entire policy, is not ambiguous and does not apply to aircraft. In the alternative, Underwriters maintains that if an ambiguity exists, it is latent and extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intent of the parties. <em>Landis v. Mears, </em>329 So.2d 323 (Fla.Dist.App.Ct.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-13\">In support of its contention that the term \u201cvehicles\u201d is not ambiguous, Underwriters points to the second exclusion of \u00a7 1. This exclusion specifically excludes from coverage \u201cbodily injury or property damage caused by any mechanically propelled vehicle which the insured may cause or permit any other person to use on the road____\u201d The second part of the exclusion applies to \u201cany Ships, Vessels, Craft or Aircraft owned, chartered, used or operated by or on account of the Assured____\u201d Underwriters submits that if \u201cvehicle\u201d includes aircraft, as the appellees maintain, then the second half of the exclusion specifically enumerating \u201cShips, Vessels, Craft or Aircraft\u201d would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-16\">As appellee Aero Service notes, when a policy provision is not defined, common everyday usage determines its meaning. <em>Security Insurance Company of Hartford v. Commercial Credit Equipment Corp., </em>399 So.2d 31 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1981). Accordingly, we address the question of whether the common, everyday meaning of \u201cvehicle\u201d includes aircraft within its scope. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cvehicle\u201d as [t]hat in or on which persons, goods, etc. may be carried from one place to another, especially along the ground.... Term refers to every device in, upon or by which a person or property is or may be transported upon a highway.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1393 (5th Ed.1979). Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cvehicle\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>\u201ca means of carrying or transporting something;\u201d examples of usage include \u201caerial vehicles such as airplanes\u201d and \u201cspace vehicle.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2538 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-4\">In <em>McBoyle v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931), Justice Holmes stated that \u201cin everyday speech \u2018vehicle\u2019 calls up a picture of a thing moving on land.\u201d In <em>McReynolds v. Municipal Court of City of Ottuma, </em>207 N.W.2d 792 (Iowa 1973), the Iowa Supreme Court found that the word \u201cvehicle\u201d has come to be applied to aircraft since the time of <em>McBoyle </em>in 1931. The court commented that frequent reference is commonly made in connection with space exploration to \u201cspace vehicles.\u201d We note that just as in the usage examples from Webster\u2019s Third quoted above, the court has included an adjective with \u201cvehicle\u201d when referring to aircraft, suggesting that \u201cvehicle\u201d standing alone is not sufficient to connote aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-5\">We find Justice Reynoldson\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>McReynolds </em>to be persuasive, and we therefore quote extensively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1605-6\">The difference between the etymological meaning and the man-on-the-street concept of \u201cvehicle\u201d has been recognized by almost all modern-day court decisions interpreting that word, (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1605-7\">The general holding is thus distilled in the annotation found at 165 A.L.R. 916:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aif-dedup-0\">\u201cAlthough the result is always contingent on the particular wording involved, it has been almost invariably held, in the construction of statutes and regulations, that airplanes are not within the terms \u2018vehicles,\u2019 \u2018motor vehicles,\u2019 etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1605-8\">Other supportive statements are found in the following authorities: 8 Am. Jur.2d, Aviation \u00a7 20, at p. 638 (\u201cAn Airplane is in a class by itself. It has usually been held, in the absence of any express provision on the subject calling for a different conclusion, not to be within the terms \u2018vehicle,\u2019 \u2018motor vehicle,\u2019 \u2018vessel,\u2019 or the like.\u201d); Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 1334 (3rd ed. 1969), (\u201cThe word [vehicle] is commonly understood as something which moves or runs on the land, not something that flies in the air, although etymologically the term might be considered as broad enough to cover a conveyance propelled in the air.\u201d); 91 C.J.S., Vehicle, at p. 806 (\u201c[I]n everyday speech \u2018vehicle\u2019 calls up the picture of a thing moving on land, and, accordingly, the term ordinarily is not applied to an aircraft * * *.\u201d); 2 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 2637 (1940) (\u201cvehicle * * *, That in or on which anything is or may be carried; especially, a contrivance with wheels or runners for carrying something * * *; specif., in law, any artificial contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on land.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1605-10\">The single supportive case relied on by the majority <em>(United States v. One Pitcairn Biplane, </em>11 F.Supp. 24 [W.D.N.Y. 1935]), from the lowest federal court, has been cited only three times in its 38-year existence. It was cited in a dictum in <em>South Mississippi Airways v. Chicago &amp; South. Airlines, </em>200 Miss. 329, 26 So.2d 455 (1946), which held the Mississippi statutes had not recognized air transportation as falling within the jurisdiction of the state\u2019s public service commission. It appears in <em>Grace v. MacArthur, </em>170 F.Supp. 442 (E.D.Ark.1959) on an entirely unrelated point. Finally, it was referred to in the annotation, 165 A.L.R. 916, 918, as \u201cApparently the only case in which an airplane was considered to be a \u2018vehicle\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1605-11\">207 N.W.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-12\">Based on the above analysis, we conclude that an aircraft is not a vehicle as the latter term is commonly and ordinarily used. Florida case law supports our conclusion. In <em>Gibbs v. Mayo, </em>81 So.2d 739 (Fla.1955) (en banc), the defendant had been charged with unlawfully breaking and entering a motor vehicle. The court, in determining the ordinary meaning of motor vehicle, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>A motor vehicle is such a vehicle which is self-propelled. Under this definition undoubtedly all automobiles or trucks are motor vehicles, but it is just as clear that all motor vehicles are not automobiles or trucks. For example, farm tractors, bulldozers, motorcycles, motor scooters, electric street cars, and road rollers are within the definition of a motor vehicle. In its broadest sense, an airplane, a self-propelled boat, and even an elevator may be a motor vehicle. But clearly none of these kinds of motor vehicles, in the common usage and ordinary meaning of the words, is a vehicle within the terms of those described in our statutes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1606-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-6\">Appellee Jet Charter cites Florida\u2019s Insurance Code, codified at Fla.Stat. \u00a7 624.-605, which defines \u201cvehicle insurance\u201d as \u201cinsurance against loss of or damage to any land vehicle or aircraft or any draft or riding animal____\u201d Thus, Jet Charter asserts, the Florida legislature intended \u201cvehicle\u201d in terms of insurance coverage to include aircraft. Other Florida statutes, however, support the position that an aircraft is not ordinarily encompassed within the meaning of \u201cvehicle.\u201d At Fla.Stat. \u00a7 806.01(3), \u201cstructure\u201d is defined as \u201cany building of any kind, any enclosed area with a roof over it, and any vehicle, vessel or aircraft.\u201d Florida Statute \u00a7 932.702(3) states that it is unlawful \u201c[t]o use any vessel, motor vehicle or aircraft to facilitate the transportation ... of any contraband article.\u201d <em>See also </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 943.-43(1); Fla.Stat. \u00a7 455.06(1). If an aircraft were considered to be included within the meaning of vehicle, the Florida legislature did not need to include \u201caircraft\u201d in any of the above statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-8\">In conclusion, we hold that the district court erred in finding that the insurance contract provided coverage for damages to the Jet Charter aircraft, because such aircraft was not a \u201cvehicle\u201d within the meaning of the exception to the exclusionary clause. This determination makes an examination of the remaining issues unnecessary, and the order of the district court is REVERSED and the cause is REMANDED with instructions to grant appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1606-10\">GODBOLD, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AH6\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-11\">This case should be sent back to the district court to be unraveled. Ultimately it may require certification to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-12\">Lloyds asserted estoppel as an affirmative defense to Jet Charter\u2019s counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage. In support thereof Lloyds sought to introduce, and the court excluded, the following evidence. In December 1981 a Boeing 707 in the hands of Aero Service for maintenance was damaged when an Aero Service employee drove a tractor into it. Aero Service notified the insurer of the damage, and it was investigated. On March 29, 1982 Lloyds\u2019 agent wrote Aero Service that coverage was denied because the policy provided airport premises liability coverage but excluded \u201closs of or damage to property in the care, custody or control of the assured.\u201d This would seem to be a commonsense result \u2014 that premises liability was not intended to cover damage to multimillion dollar aircraft in the care and control of the insured while being maintained by it \u2014 and the agent\u2019s letter to Aero Service denying liability explained this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-13\">The tendered evidence showed that Aero Service did not further assert that there was coverage but instead contacted the agent and requested a quotation for insurance that would provide coverage for aircraft in Aero Service\u2019s care, custody and control. The agent responded offering such coverage for a premium of $15,446, approximately five times that being paid under the existent policy ($3,095.15). Aero Service did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-14\">On May 24 the policy was renewed. One of the clauses stamped \u201cvoid\u201d in the policy describes the coverage that Aero Service was offered and did not buy: \u201cLoss of or damage to Aircraft or Aircraft equipment, not the property of the Assured, whilst on the ground in the care, custody or control of the Assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>Approximately three months thereafter the same Boeing 707, again in Aero Service\u2019s hands for maintenance, slipped off the jacks and was damaged. For this incident Aero Service claims the benefit of the precise coverage that it was told that it lacked and that it did not buy when offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-7\">The tendered evidence should have been received. Unless Aero Service can offer something else, Lloyds would be entitled to judgment on estoppel grounds. If other evidence refutes that tendered by Lloyds, and the case is not decided on estoppel grounds, the next threshold to traverse is determination of the type of coverage extended by the policy (without addressing the exclusions). This is not wholly free from doubt. The risk is defined as \u201cLegal Liability arising out of the Assureds operation as FAA Aircraft Repair Station (and other descriptive language not relevant).\u201d Arguably the risk of \u201coperation\u201d of a repair station is broader than premises liability. These are unanswered questions since this court\u2019s decision is based upon an exclusion from coverage (whatever the coverage may be). If the meaning of \u201cvehicle\u201d has to be reached, whether an airplane is a vehicle under Florida law for purposes of insurance law in general and this policy in particular is an issue that should be certified to the Supreme Court of Florida. Insurance law is a field in which the state has a particular interest, and it is entitled to define its own terms. I would not take bets on which way the Florida Supreme Court would go. It seems to me that the term \u201cvehicle\u201d in this policy is not so unambiguous that its meaning can be determined without extrinsic evidence. Whatever court decides the matter needs all the help it can get. The ambiguity is demonstrated by the opinion of this court, which finds a single and certain meaning by reference to, inter alia, a law dictionary that goes one way and a standard dictionary that goes the other, an opinion of the United States Supreme Court rendered in 1931 when airplanes had minor significance, a dissenting opinion from the Iowa Supreme Court, and Florida statutes that point both ways,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
