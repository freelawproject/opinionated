Rather, appellant questions the sufficiency and validity of medical reports negating permanent total \u201cimpairment\u201d for the reasons that such reports (1) did not describe what type of work appellant would be able to perform based on age, education and work experience; and (2) used the term \u201cimpairment\u201d and thus expressed no opinion concerning appellant\u2019s \u201cdisability.\u201d Such contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">Appellant relies on <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101, to support his claim that the failure of medical reports to recite consideration of nonfunctional factors invalidates such reports. Such reliance is misplaced. <em>Jennings </em>entailed a medical report repudiated by the medical examiner in a deposition. There was no such deposition and repudiation here. Moreover, the commission had before it at the August 1982 hearing appellant\u2019s affidavit which recited the factors of age, education and work experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>As to appellant\u2019s second contention, use of the term \u201cimpairment\u201d in the medical reports is in accordance with the definition set forth in the commission^ Medical Examination Manual, at pages 1 and 2, which describes \u201cimpairment\u201d as, \u201c* * * the amount of claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function * * \u201cDisability\u201d is defined as \u201c* * * the effect that the medical impairment has on the claimant\u2019s ability to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The manual then properly states that \u201c[disability is determined by the Industrial Commission and its hearing officers.\u201d The commission made such determination here based on substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">For reason of the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals, denying the writ, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
