The first issue raised is whether Commodity Credit Corporation, an unjoinable party in a state proceeding, is an indispensable party under Civ. R. 19(B). The second issue raised is whether the trial court\u2019s ruling in denying the appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss was a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 or Civ. R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The question as to whether Commodity Credit Corporation is an indispensable party pursuant to Civ. R. 19(B) was never raised at the appellate level. While this may have been appellants\u2019 intended assignment of error, the appellate proceedings did not reach that stage. In fact, none of the parties filed briefs presenting this issue as error. Instead, the court of appeals dismissed the appeal on plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a final appealable order. Therefore, the question of Commodity Credit Corporation\u2019s status was not before the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">This court cannot address a proposition which was not raised at the intermediate level. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wirick </em>(1910), 81 Ohio St. 343; <em>Bd. of Commrs. </em>v. <em>Deitsch </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 1. This court\u2019s traditional policy against issuing advisory opinions precludes us from considering the issue of Commodity Credit Corporation\u2019s status. Thus, we focus on the question of whether the trial court\u2019s ruling in denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss was a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Appellants argue that the trial court\u2019s order denying their motions to dismiss when Commodity Credit Corporation was no longer a party was a final appealable order. In pertinent part, R.C. 2505.02 defines \u201cfinal appealable order\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">\u201cAn order affecting a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding * *</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">Appellants also concede that the trial court\u2019s order was not one which in effect determined a claim in the action and prevented a judgment in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>favor. However, they do contend that the instant order affected a substantial right and was made in a \u201cspecial proceeding.\u201d This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><em>Amato </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 253 [21 O.O.3d 158], established a balancing test to determine whether a civil action is a special proceeding. The factors to be weighed are the \u201c \u2018prompt and orderly disposition of litigation\u2019 and the consequent waste of judicial resources, resulting from an allowance of an appeal, with the need for immediate review because appeal after final judgment is not practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Here, there is no need for immediate appellate review. The court\u2019s decision whether to join a party is equally reviewable now or after the case has been finally adjudicated. Appellants argue that they may be subject to double liability and double litigation arising from an action by the Commodity Credit Corporation in federal court; however, their liability under the provisions of R.C. 1309.01 <em>et seq. </em>is limited to divestiture of the Waddells\u2019 corn. See R.C. 1309.25, 1309.26, 1309.44 and 1309.46. Further, appropriate protective features in the trial court\u2019s order would effectively minimize such occurrences.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">An immediate review would also waste judicial resources and disrupt an orderly disposition of the case. BancOhio\u2019s complaint does not solely seek foreclosure of its security interest in the corn. It has also sued Rubicon Cadillac, Inc. as a maker of the note and Thomas A. Simons as guarantor of the note. Judgment could be rendered against those parties and BancOhio\u2019s claim satisfied by either without foreclosure of the security interest in the corn. If this were to occur, the probable result would be no additional litigation. An immediate appeal only serves to disrupt the orderly disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the overruling of a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party under Civ. R. 19(B) is not a final appealable order within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02 or Civ. R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., Hoffman, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b64-12\">Ford, J., of the Eleventh Appellate District, sitting for W.
