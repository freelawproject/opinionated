Kramer, </em>v. <em>Indus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Comm. (1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 39, 42 [13 O.O.3d 30]; <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Appellant argues that there was no evidence upon which the commission could base its decision for the reason that Dr. Hardie did not specifically adopt the findings of the examining physicians in his report as required by <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, 61 [11 O.O.3d 216]. Appellant is correct that Dr. Hardie\u2019s report is deficient in this regard; however, we find sufficient other evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Dr. Fallon concluded that appellant was \u201cunemployable\u201d as a result of illnesses associated with his diabetes and not his foot injury. Dr. Wehr concluded that as a result of his injury, appellant had a low impairment of fifteen percent. These opinions predate the allowance of the claim for aggravation of preexisting diabetes but were made giving consideration to the effect of appellant\u2019s diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It is essentially appellant\u2019s position that by reason of the allowance of the claim for aggravation of preexisting diabetes, he is entitled to have all aspects of his diabetic condition considered in determining whether he is permanently and totally disabled. This is incorrect. While it is unclear what the commission intended in granting this additional allowance, there is nothing in the record to suggest that it includes complications from appellant\u2019s diabetes such as vision impairment or atherosclerosis which might contribute to his alleged total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
