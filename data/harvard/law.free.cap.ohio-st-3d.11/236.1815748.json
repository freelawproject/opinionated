The only evidence directed to that issue were the reports of Dr. Kubiac dated October 1, 1980, and April 20, 1981. In the first report Dr. Kubiac tentatively found that appellant\u2019s disability would terminate on October 15, 1980. Subsequently, he modified his opinion and determined that appellant could be released for work on April 6, 1981. This opinion has not been retracted or modified by Dr. Kubiac and no contrary medical evidence as to the duration of appellant\u2019s temporary total disability was before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Where there is no evidence upon which the commission could base its decision, an abuse of discretion is shown and mandamus becomes appropriate. <em>State, ex rel. Hutton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 9, 13 [58 O.O.2d 66].</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>writ is allowed to compel the commission to extend appellant\u2019s temporary total disability award to April 6, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
