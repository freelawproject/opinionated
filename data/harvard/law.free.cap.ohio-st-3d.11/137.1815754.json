Gerspacher, </em>v. <em>Coffinberry </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 32 [47 O.O. 31], paragraph two of the syllabus. As long as there is some evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings and no abuse of discretion is shown, the commission\u2019s order will not be disturbed. <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278, 283 [71 O.O.2d 255].</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Relator contends that the medical reports of Drs. James and McCloud, having been submitted to the commission prior to relator\u2019s motion for permanent total disability, do not constitute evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that relator was not permanently and totally disabled. Relator contends the two medical reports are too remote in time to adequately evaluate the deterioration of his physical condition. Relator states the reports were especially significant since the commission\u2019s finding and order stated it was based \u201c* * * particularly on the medical reports of Drs. McCloud and James, * * * <em>))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">While the commission may consider the appropriateness and relevance of the time frame during which medical examinations are conducted, a time difference here of five to seven months between conflicting medical reports is insufficient to preclude the commission\u2019s consideration and reliance on the earlier reports without a demonstration that such time interval was crucial to the progress of relator\u2019s physical condition. The commission\u2019s finding and order further indicated that the commission relied upon \u201cthe evidence in the file and the evidence adduced at the hearing,\u201d in making its determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>here. Included in the file is an offer of employment to relator on May 5, 1982 from his employer. Relator did not accept the position which his employer referred to as \u201cService Manager\u201d and which would have required relator to answer the telephone, record mechanics\u2019 labor time, and write work orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The commission must make its conclusions from all the evidence before it. Questions of credibility and weight to be given the evidence are clearly within the commission\u2019s discretionary powers of fact-finding. There being valid evidence here to support the finding and order of the commission denying permanent total disability there was no abuse of discretion and such order will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Therefore, the writ prayed for is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
