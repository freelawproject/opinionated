Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 16 [58 O.O.2d 70]. Furthermore, \u201cwhere the record contains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual findings, these findings will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Humble, </em>v. <em>Mark Concepts, Inc. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 77 [14 O.O.3d 275]. Conversely, \u201c[w]here there is no evidence upon which the commission could have based its factual conclusion an abuse of discretion is present and mandamus becomes appropriate.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Kramer, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 39, 42 [13 O.O.3d 30].</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Relator argues that the commission abused its discretion when, based upon the facts of record, it found relator not to be permanently and totally disabled. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Respondents argue that the reports of Drs. Cooke and McCloud provide evidence in support of the commission\u2019s order and that the order should therefore not be disturbed. In <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101, 102, this court held that \u201cwhere a medical expert has, by deposition testimony, repudiated a conclusion previously made in a medical report, that report cannot constitute evidence to support the order of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Respondents contend that Dr. Cooke merely \u201cclarified\u201d his earlier opinion by distinguishing between the terms of \u201cimpairment\u201d and \u201cdisability.\u201d Further, respondents argue that Dr. Cooke is not competent to draw administrative conclusions such as how much disability results from a certain amount of physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Although the Medical Examination Manual issued by the commission on October 5, 1981 does distinguish between determinations of extent of \u201cimpairment,\u201d which are medical in nature, and determinations of extent of \u201cdisability,\u201d which are administrative in nature, it should be noted that in the instant case doctors\u2019 reports containing an opinion as to extent of relator\u2019s disability, <em>including </em>that submitted by Dr. McCloud in the instant case, have been referred to and relied upon. In addition, a review of the transcript of Dr. Cooke\u2019s deposition clearly bears out relator\u2019s contention that Dr. Cooke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>repudiated his earlier report. His report therefore cannot constitute evidence to support the order of the commission. <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra. </em>The application of the rule in <em>Jennings, </em>however, does not dispose of the instant case. In <em>Jennings, </em>\u201cthere was no evidence but the repudiated report * * * to support the order of the commission * * <em>Id. </em>at 103. In the instant case, the claimant\u2019s file also contained the report of Dr. McCloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Dr. McCloud, taking note of relator\u2019s lack of education and vocational training, estimated that she would have difficulty finding work other than that which she was doing prior to her injury, <em>i.e., </em>unskilled manual labor. He also reported that the loss of strength and range of motion would limit \u201cany activity wherein the hand is required to be positioned in front of oneself doing any activity.\u201d In spite of Dr. McCloud\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, these findings demonstrate that relator\u2019s disability has effectively prevented her from returning to her former position of employment. This court has consistently required that determinations of disability be based on a claimant\u2019s ability to return to the type of work for which he or she is qualified. See <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630 [23 O.O.3d 518].</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The respondents argue that Dr. Williams\u2019 report, inasmuch as it was effectively rejected in the commission\u2019s order denying relator\u2019s first motion, could not constitute evidence to support a second, identical motion. Dr. Williams\u2019 report, although somewhat remote in time, was relevant and admissible in that it tended to prove an element of an ultimate fact. See <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165, 168 [22 O.O.3d 400], citing <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 577 [55 O.O. 472].</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The facts of the case are clear. Relator\u2019s educational and vocational background limits her employment opportunities to those involving unskilled manual labor. Her injury effectively prevents her from performing those types of activities. There was no evidence upon which the commission could have determined otherwise. Accordingly, the writ prayed for is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, C. Brown and J. P.
