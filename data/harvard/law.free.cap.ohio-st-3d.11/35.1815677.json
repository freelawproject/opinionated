Critchfield, Critchfield, Critchfield &amp; Johnston </em>and <em>Mr. J. Douglas Drushal, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\"><em>Mr. John R. Quine, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-6\">Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">The sole issue before this court in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether appellant should have brought his appeal within thirty days or whether he should benefit from the ten-day \u201cgrace period\u201d permitted by App. R. 4(A). The rule holds in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u201cIf a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, <em>any other party </em>may file a notice of appeal within ten days of the date on which the first notice of appeal was filed * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The decision whether to invoke this language hinges on whether appellant was an \u201cother party\u201d in the instant case. We hold he was a subsidiary, or separate party in the litigation and his notice of appeal, filed some seven days after the buyers\u2019 notice of appeal, was within App. R. 4(A) and thus timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Although there were two judgment entries filed in the instant case, there was one lawsuit about one land contract. The judgment of the trial court against the appellant-broker was a derivative judgment emanating from the judgment against the buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Appellant\u2019s assignment contract with appellee contains provisions, specifically paragraphs six and seven, detailing the consequences of a possible default on the part of the buyers under the land contract. The August 9, 1983 journal entry of the court of appeals dismissing appellant\u2019s cause precludes him from enjoying his day in court and arguing the summary judgment entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Appellant\u2019s right to appeal the final order of the trial court should not be prejudiced because he did not join with the buyers in their appeal. Such a joinder is only discretionary under App. R. 3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-14\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b66-15\">W. Brown, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b66-16\">Hoffman, J., of the Fifth Appellate District, sitting for J. P.
