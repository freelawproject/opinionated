The waiver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>minimum school year requirements is governed by R.C. 3317.01(B) which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u201c* * * This requirement shall be waived by the superintendent of public instruction if it had been necessary for a school to be closed because of disease epidemic, hazardous weather conditions, damage to a school building, or other temporary circumstances due to utility failure rendering the school building unfit for school use, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that relator is entitled to the waiver of one day of instruction due to \u201cother temporary circumstances due to utility failure rendering the school building unfit for school use\u201d under R.C. 3317.01(B). We note first that no argument was made nor evidence presented to suggest that relator\u2019s superintendent acted imprudently in closing the schools. The utilities were inoperable, creating a genuine concern for the welfare of the students if classes were held. We sympathize with respondent\u2019s concern that too lenient enforcement of minimum school year requirements will erode the protections they afford to Ohio\u2019s public school students. However, the purpose of the minimum school year is to provide guidelines to insure that public schools offer quality education. We cannot conclude that one day of instruction will improve the quality of education offered in the Cleveland Public Schools this year, particularly when the one day will cost relator $750,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In so holding, we expressly reject relator\u2019s contention that the reason for the utility failure is irrelevant in determining whether a waiver is appropriate under R.C. 3317.01(B). We find simply that the reasons for the utility failure herein do not justify requiring relator to schedule a make-up day of instruction at a cost of $750,000. This expenditure can only adversely affect relator\u2019s students in the long run, with no practical benefit in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Accordingly, the writ is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
