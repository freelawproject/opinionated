Contract of sale\u2014construed. An instrument in writing recited a sale by the makers of fifty shares of the capital stock of a corporation, of $100 each, for the sum of $5000, the receipt whereof was acknowledged, upon the condition that if the vendee, at the expiration of three years, should elect to return said shares of stock, the vendors agreed to repay the vendee said sum of money, with interest, less any dividends he might have received on the stock, provided the vendee should notify the vendors of his intention to return such capital stock and claim repayment at least thirty days before the expiration of said term of three years: Held, that the instrument showed a present sale of shares of stock for $5000, upon the condition that the purchaser should notify the vendors of his intention to return the stock not less than thirty days before the expiration of three years.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-9\" pgmap=\"581\">2. Same\u2014terms of rescission\u2014must be complied, with. Where a purchaser of capital stock of a corporation has, by the contract of sale, the right, within a given time, to return the stock upon thirty days\u2019 notice before the expiration of such time, and receive back the purchase money, with interest, he may rescind within the time limited only by the doing of that which the condition provides shall be done by him.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-10\" pgmap=\"581\">3. In such case the purchaser, before he can rescind and recover back the purchase money, must give the requisite notice of his intention to rescind, and, within the time limited for that purpose, return or offer to return the shares of capital stock purchased by him. Failing in this, the sale becomes absolute, and the purchaser can not recover under the contract.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-11\" pgmap=\"581\">4.

It is-plainly a present sale of fifty shares of the capital stock of the Big Laramie Land, Cattle and Improvement Company, for the - snm of $5000, upon the condition that the purchaser shall not notify the seller of his intention to return the stock sold, and claim repayment of the money paid therefor, and interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum, less any dividends he may have received upon said stock, at least thirty days before the expiration o'f three years from the date of sale,, and return said stock to the seller at the expiration of three-years from the date of the sale; but if the purchaser shall give such notice, and so return the stock, then the seller shall repay him the $5000 paid for the stock, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum, less any dividends he may have received upon the stock. Stated shortly, the sale is absolute if not rescinded as provided by the condition. It may be rescinded, but only by the doing of that which the condition provides, and this is wholly to be done by the purchaser. Until he has thus rescinded the sale, it stands, and he has no right to the purchase money. It is not a case of mutual and concurrent covenants, as is Clark v. Weis, 87 Ill. 438, cited by counsel for appellant. There, the contract was. that the seller should convey and the purchaser should pay, each promise being the consideration of the other, on or before a day named. But here the purchaser does not undertake-that he will rescind the contract by returning the stock, but the undertaking is solely by the seller, that he will repay if the purchaser shall return, etc.,\u2014that is, of course, after he-shall return.</p> <p id=\"b585-5\" pgmap=\"585(97) 586(52)\">The rule is well settled that \u201cwhere an act is to be performed\" by the plaintiff before the accruing of the defendant\u2019s liability under his contract, the plaintiff must aver in his declaration, and prove, either his performance of such condition precedent, or an offer to perform it, which the defendant rejected; or he may aver his readiness to fulfill the condition until the defendant discharged him from so doing, or prevented the execution of the matter which was to be performed by him.\u201d\u201d Chitty on Contracts, (11th Am. ed.) p. 1083, and cases cited. in note.
