Blazo for certiorari, lodged in the county court, to correct alleged errors committed at a misdemeanor session of the Superior Court. A single justice of our court reserved and reported the matter to the full bench, the basic facts having been reduced by the parties to a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Blazo had been found guilty in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston of begetting and nonsupport (G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 11,15). He took his appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, for trial de nova by a jury of twelve at a misdemeanor session of the Superior Court, usually presided over by a judge of a District Court sitting by special assignment. Before trial, Blazo applied on the ground of his indigence to the assigned judge for an order providing for blood grouping tests under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12A, without cost to himself. The motion was granted. Blazo applied also (1) to have summonses served and other steps taken to secure the attendance at trial of persons alleged to be needed as witnesses on his behalf, and (2) to have a stenographer appointed to record the proceedings in the misdemeanor session, both to be without cost to him. The judge denied the two motions and declined to report the questions involved under the procedure of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A. Blazo has therefore proceeded on these points by petition for certiorari (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, prior to amendment by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 289, effective July 1,1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The second above entitled case raises only question (2), that of stenographic recording. Raphael Lopez, convicted in the Municipal Court of the Roxbury District of unlawful possession of heroin (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 34) and of a hypodermic needle and syringe (\u00a7\u00a7 27, 38), took his appeal to the misdemeanor session of the Superior Court for a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>de nova and as an indigent moved for a stenographer. The motion was denied by a District Court judge sitting by special assignment. Thereupon Lopez brought a petition in the county court under the \u201csuperintendency\u201d statute (G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3), and this matter also was reserved and reported by the single justice on a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Pertinent to both questions presented here, and discussed in the briefs, are the \u201cTranscript Cases\u201d commencing with <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12 (1956).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These have to do for the most part with the provision of free transcripts (or reasonable substitutes) to indigents appealing from criminal convictions. They are a working out of the general constitutional principle that \u201c[ijn criminal trials a State can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or color\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 17, plurality opinion of Black, J.), so that \u201cthe State must, as a matter of equal protection, provide indigent prisoners with the basic tools of an adequate defense or appeal, when those tools are available for a price to other prisoners.\u201d <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>404 U. S. 226,227 (1971). As more recently stated, while the Constitution does not require a State to equalize economic conditions, \u201c[i]t does require that the state appellate system be \u2018free of unreasoned distinctions,\u2019 <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>384 U. S. 305, 310 (1966), and that in digents have an adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly within the adversarial system.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffit, </em>417 U. S. 600, 612 (1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>1. <em>Attendance of witnesses. </em>To turn to the first issue, the expenses involved in securing the attendance of a witness on the part of a defendant in a criminal proceeding consist of the fees of the officer serving the process and fees to the witness for travel and attendance. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3; c. 262, \u00a7\u00a7 8 (B)(3), 29.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no statute relieving a defendant of these costs in case of his inability to pay them except G. L. c. 277, \u00a766, a statute of venerable origin<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stating that a prisoner indicted for a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for life shall on demand have process at the expense of the Commonwealth to summon witnesses necessary to his defence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This, indeed, is apparently without regard to proof of indigence.'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Despite the lack of statutory authority for casting the costs of necessary witnesses in the lesser prosecutions on the public when the defendants are without resources, the Commonwealth does not argue that that relief is unavailable when necessity and indigence are shown. Such a position would be hard to maintain because it has been settled since <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Possehl, </em>355 Mass. 575 (1969), which invoked the Transcript Cases, that an indigent defendant can secure blood grouping tests at public expense \u2014 the judge below recognized the proposition in granting Blazo\u2019s motion for that purpose \u2014 and it would hardly be possible to distinguish the demand for attend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>anee of witnesses from a demand for blood testing. General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 12A, states that in paternity matters the court on defendant\u2019s demand shall order blood grouping tests of the mother, child, and defendant. In the <em>Possehl </em>case we thought that, if this blanket command was not in itself to be read as requiring the public to defray these expenses where the defendant making the demand could not meet them, the Constitutions of the Commonwealth and the United States \u2014 the concepts of due process and equal protection underlying the Transcript Cases \u2014 would require that result. See 355 Mass, at 577. The present cases are not less compelling: while the right to blood testing was conferred by statute, it is the Sixth Amendment itself that in terms guarantees \u201ccompulsory process for obtaining witnesses in [the accused\u2019s] favor,\u201d and this is paralleled in substance by art. 12 of our Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">An affluent defendant prepared to pay the fees may summon witnesses nearly ad lib. There is no constitutional command that an indigent shall be provided with the same unbounded liberty. It is right that an indigent should have to establish need for his witnesses who are to be summoned at public cost; he may not demand excessive and therefore pointless expenditure. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dirring, </em>354 Mass. 523 <em>(1968); Draper w. Washington, </em>372 U. S. 487, 495-496 (1963). There should be no serious difficulty in the defendant\u2019s coming forward with his reasons justifying the particular summonses, or in the judge\u2019s reaching an objective decision on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Rules of Criminal Procedure that are now being formulated by an Advisory Committee may be expected to prescribe a procedure for impecunious defendants who seek process for needed witnesses. Pending adoption of an appropriate rule, a defendant believing himself entitled will apply to the competent judge \u2014 ex parte if the defendant should so desire<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 supporting his application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>by affidavit showing his inability to pay the fees involved, setting out the names and addresses (if known) of the persons to be summoned, and stating why their attendance is necessary to an adequate defence. The judge may require the submission of further data. Authority for payment by the county on the court\u2019s order appears from G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The outlined procedure is similar to Rule 17 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to which the Commonwealth has referred as a model.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judge below may have thought that the affidavit supporting Blazo\u2019s motion was not sufficiently informing \u2014 he sought the attendance of seven witnesses on the basis of brief averments \u2014 but Blazo did offer to supply further data if desired. In all events Blazo will be required to satisfy the procedure just described when the case is resumed in the misdemeanor session.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">2. <em>Stenographic recording. </em>Blazo and Lopez ask to have stenographic notes made of the proceedings in the misdemeanor session of the Superior Court. This claim looks ahead to the possibility that the defendants will be convicted on the trials de nova and will pursue review of the convictions upon exceptions under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 31, in which case they may require, and therefore make a claim for, free transcripts. Otherwise stated, the attendance of a stenographer is claimed in order to effectuate such rights as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the defendants may have to secure access to verbatim records under the Transcript Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The position in the Commonwealth is this. Under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33B, an official stenographer is routinely provided to record the Superior Court proceedings in prosecutions for felony and for any misdemeanor tried with a felony. Where review is by \u201cappeal\u201d (the method employed following trial for murder or manslaughter, and used if ordered by the court in the other cases mentioned) there is express provision under which in digents may obtain transcripts at county expense. \u00a7 33B.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For misdemeanors, not felony-connected, tried in the Superior Court, there is no provision for stenographic recording.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 91B, inserted by St. 1965, c. 585, a defendant having the wherewithal may provide at his own expense for attendance of a stenographer and later for a transcription. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>356 Mass. 358 \u2022(1969). Under the reasoning of the Transcript Cases, the defendants here are entitled to some comparable facilities at public expense so far as needed for adequate review of right of final judgments of conviction, and the fact that these are prosecutions for misdemeanors rather than of-fences of higher grade should not deprive them. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma City, </em>395 U. S. 458, 459 (1969) (\u201cviolation of a city ordinance, quasi criminal in nature and often referred to as a petty offense\u201d); <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>404 U. S. 189, 195-196 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As indicated in point 1 above, exact equivalence of opportunity for indigents is not necessarily commanded. This is again illustrated by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>362 Mass. 325 (1972). The case dealt with probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>hearings in a District Court in connection with felony charges. There was no statutory right to a stenographer or a transcript, but a solvent defendant could arrange for both under c. 221, \u00a7 91B. The indigent defendants demanded the same without cost, but a majority of the court held that they were not entitled. Among the factors relied on<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was the circumstance that a probable cause hearing, though its content might be significant, was still at a considerable remove from a trial at which guilt or innocence would be adjudicated with the usual finality, subject to review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In the present cases considerations of fair and comparable treatment are heightened because the defendants do confront a jury trial with just such finality, subject to review of right. But the Commonwealth urges that the defendants, in preparing exceptions, can have functionally sufficient substitutes for stenographer\u2019s transcripts through the use of electronic tape recorders available to the Boston Legal Assistance Project and the Massachusetts Defenders Committee, the organizations that have furnished counsel for the defendants. In Lopez\u2019s case the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>indicated that he would permit use of a tape recorder, and we suppose it would also have been permitted in Blazo\u2019s case. See Rule 47A of the Superior Court (1954), superseded by Rule 17, effective July 1,1974; cf. Rule 46 of the Rules of the District Courts (1965), as amended June 1, 1972. The defendants, however, do not agree that the machines are adequate for picking up enough of the testimony and colloquies to provide a basis for framing a cogent record (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>361 Mass. 431, 432-434 [1972]). They point to the mechanical infirmities of their recorder units (acquired at a price of around $50 each),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and to the marked inferiorities of this equipment when compared with the recording devices that have been considered suitable for official installation in our courts as a possible alternative to stenographic recording.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They note, since the question opened up is a general one, that there are indigent defendants who have no access even to a tape recorder. And they lay stress on the importance that this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>356 Mass. 358, 361 (1969), attached to counsel\u2019s recourse to a full transcript when he prepared for review \u2014 the case was one like the present where a defendant in the misdemeanor session of the Superior Court was looking ahead to review by exceptions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The truth of the matter is that the need for a record, or for a record of a given fidelity, varies from case to case. Misdemeanor prosecutions generally present simple issues. In some instances review in the event of conviction can be seen from the beginning to be a futility, and is not contemplated. In other instances tape recorders, or even hand-kept notes, may well suffice for any possible purposes of review. In still other situations a verbatim record can be essential for protection of the defendants\u2019 rights. The problem is that in particular cases it may be hard to tell in advance what the defendant coming to trial will need in the form of a record if the jury convict and review is called for. Unlike a showing that a particular witness is needed, a demonstration that a given method of preserving a record for eventual review will or will not be adequate, may be difficult, time consuming, and in the end unsatisfactory precisely because of the speculative factors involved.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The consequences of refusing a stenographer, however, could be serious if it turned out that the judge\u2019s guess was wrong and a verbatim record, full or partial, was later shown to be actually requisite. An attempt at pre-trial demonstration might prove not only difficult but embarrassing. It could put pressure on counsel to disclose more of what he proposed to do at trial than he would otherwise be bound (or at liberty) to reveal. So also it could be awkward to try to demonstrate to the judge slated to try a case that there was such potentiality that error would be committed that special precautions should be taken in recording the proceedings. Cf. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>372 U. S. 487, -498 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Practical considerations thus suggest that here the indigent should be placed roughly in the position of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>nonindigent, that is, it should be left to the indigent\u2019s counsel to decide, in the light of eventualities as he can best project them, whether less costly alternatives are infeasible and a stenographic record is required. To put the proposition more formally, we think a defendant in a misdemeanor session, on proof of his inability by reason of indigence to avail himself of c. 221, \u00a7 91B, should be\" entitled on request to have a stenographer record the proceedings.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As we shall point out below, the request will be understood to be a good-faith representation by counsel that in his considered judgment such a verbatim record is needed to insure protection of the defendant\u2019s rights. Counsel may be helped to a conscientious judgment by the fact that the nature of the case will often have become clear during the provisional trial in the District Court. A reasonable forbearance in requesting stenographers is essential pending a general solution of the problem of maintaining records at tolerable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">When the trial has taken place, and the defendant in fact applies for a free transcript of all or part of the record, a good basis will exist for deciding whether or to what extent he requires such assistance in order to exercise effectively his right to appellate review. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>356 Mass. 495 (1969). When an adequate record has been made that can be read out or played, it will often, though not always, be possible to prepare exceptions without making a typed transcript. If the Commonwealth objects to the particular request of the defendant on the ground that it imposes unnecessary expense or delay, an informal hearing should be held and the judge should pass on the matter. Whether the defendant is being extravagant in his request will turn in considerable degree on the number and nature of the points he intends to raise in the reviewing court. Under <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>404 U. S. at 195 (1971), the judge is advised to be careful not to limit access to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>transcript unduly by any hasty prejudgment of the merits of the defendant\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We are the more confident about the soundness of these procedures with respect to preserving a record and obtaining a transcript because they are consistent with those recently laid down by statute for defendants, found guilty in enumerated District Courts of offences within District Court jurisdiction, who appeal and claim a trial de nova by a jury of six in specified District Courts, instead of appealing and claiming a jury of twelve in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, inserted by St. 1972, c. 620, \u00a7 1, bringing together earlier particular enactments.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This statute provides that the judge presiding over trial by a jury of six shall on request of the defendant appoint a stenographer to record the testimony, the compensation and expenses of the stenographer being borne by the county. The statute says that a party requesting a full or partial transcript must pay the stenographer for it; but here the Transcript Cases come in to enable an indigent to claim any appropriate relief.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We add that there is ground for argument that a discrimination might be worked against indigents in jury-of-twelve appeals tried in the misdemeanor session of the Superior Court if their rights were held to be less than those of indigents in jury-of-six appeals in the District Courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In deciding whether to request that a stenographer attend and record the proceedings or to rely instead on a tape recorder or the like, and again in deciding whether to request full\" or partial transcripts or to depend on other means to prepare for review, counsel are expected to act responsibly and avoid making unnecessary or exorbitant demands on the time of stenographers and on public resources; they are to act as if they were representing nonindigent clients to whom the expenditures in question were matters of serious consequence. (The same applies to the summoning of witnesses discussed in point 1, and to demands for stenographers in jury-of-six trials.) Just this point about counsel\u2019s attitudes was made by Chief Justice Burger, concurring in <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>404 U. S. 189, 199 (1971). He spoke of \u201cthe duty of counsel as officers of the court to seek only what is needed,\u201d and he concluded that \u201c|w]hen excessive demands are made by an appellant in order to postpone the day when the appeal is finally determined, because, for example, he is at liberty pending appeal, a lawyer who cooperates is guilty of unprofessional conduct.\u201d id. at 199-200,201 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As to a more general solution for the future: The high desirability of having proceedings in criminal cases suitably preserved as a matter of routine is widely recognized. But competent stenographers are in short supply and their services are necessarily expensive. Accordingly, an alternative method of recording through officially approved, sophisticated electronic equipment has been carefully studied, and its introduction strongly recommended.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If such an official method should become available, it would profoundly affect a range of problems including the present. It would furnish a relatively inexpensive means of preserving testimony and could also greatly ease the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>problem of preparing a satisfactory record for purposes of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>In the light of this opinion, counsel will wish to reconsider what requests they are warranted in making to the judge below.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The orders of the assigned judges in the Superior Court denying applications are vacated and the petitioners, if upon consideration they are so advised, may reapply for relief in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> The Commonwealth has not objected to the use of certiorari or the \u201csuperintendency\u201d power in the special situations at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> Other cases in the series are: <em>Eskridge </em>v. <em>Washington State Bd. of Prison Terms and Paroles, </em>357 U.

See 1 Wright, Federal Practice andProcedure, \u00a7 272 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> In this particular context \u201cappeal\u201d connotes review on the basis of a verbatim record.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">With respect to the cases mentioned where the court may order \u201cappeal,\u201d but in fact declines to do so, and review is thus by exceptions, there is no express statutory provision for indigent defendants\u2019 obtaining transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> Stenographers are routinely provided by the county for civil cases tried in the Superior Court (although transcripts must be paid for by the parties), so it appears that the only class of cases m the Superior Court at which stenographers do not attend routinely is misdemeanors not connected with felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> The Supreme Court case nearest to our <em>Britt </em>case was <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>389 U. S. 40 (1967), which involved the record of a preliminary hearing, but there \u2014 unlike the situation in Massachusetts \u2014 the State had_ provided for recordation of the hearing by an official stenographer and the question was on the indigent\u2019s right to a free transcript of an existing stenographic record. Our court in the <em>Britt </em>case indicated, further, that a decision for the defendant, extended over seventy-two District Courts and the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, might put such a levy on stenographers as in practical effect to deny equal protection of the laws; the Legislature might indeed prefer an annulment of c. 221, \u00a7 91B. No question about the possible use of electronic recording in lieu of stenography was before the court. See 362 Mass, at 332 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">It is believed that the practical effect of the present qualified decision will be moderate because of the differences in numbers of cases affected, the experience in jury-of-six cases (see n. 22 below), and other factors. And see below the discussion of counsel\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> Somewhat analogous is <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffit, </em>417 U. S. 600 (1974), where the Supreme Court, answering a question left open in <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U. S. 353 (1963), held (six to three) that the State of North Carolina was not constitutionally required to provide counsel for an indigent to- conduct an application for discretionary review by a higher court after he had been provided (pursuant to the <em>Douglas </em>case) with counsel for a first appeal of right which proved unsuccessful. Substantial adequacy and comparability were shown by an analysis of the character and criteria of the discretionary review involved, taken together with the assistance provided by counsel at trial and in the briefing of the first appeal, by the opinion below, and by the availability of a transcript of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> The statements of agreed facts in the two cases describe the tape recorders and say as to past experience with them in the District Courts: \u201c|Tjhe overwhelming majority were defective to the extent that almost without exception, some portions of the matters recorded on those tapes were unintelligible. There was great discrepancy among the tapes in terms of the quality of the recordings. Most of the tapes contained the bulk of the information recorded; a substantial number were incomplete in that significant portions of the proceedings did not appear on the recording, and some of the tapes were of no value whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> Seen. 24 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> \u201cWithout a stenographic record, the prosecuting of an appeal in which questions of evidence, questions relating to the charge, and the propriety of rulings and instructions and the like are involved is hazardous. It opens the door to conflicting versions of what occurred at the trial, and the failure to settle these questions satisfactorily might often result in a miscarriage of justice. It is conceivable that the defendant in fact suffered no prejudice by the lack of a stenographic record, but as to that we can only speculate. Without such a record the showing of prejudice is rendered difficult. We prefer to resolve any doubts on this score in favor of the defendant. Accordingly, there must be a new trial.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Shea </em>case at 361. See <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 U. S. 277, 282, 288 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring); <em>Mayer v. Chicago, </em>404 U. S. 189, 195 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In the <em>Shea </em>case it was a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a stenographer under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 9IB, that was held to be the error requiring reversal of his conviction in the misdemeanor session.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\"> This problem of forecasting was not faced in the Transcript Cases which typically involved the question of the indigent\u2019s right to a transcript from an existing official stenographic record.

[ W] here the grounds of appeal, as in this case, make out a colorable need for a complete transcript, the burden is on the State to show that only a portion of the transcript or an \u2018alternative\u2019 will suffice for an effective appeal on those grounds.\u201d The <em>Mayer </em>case at 195.
