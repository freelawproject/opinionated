L. c. 272, \u00a7 35. He argues that the prohibition against committing an \u201cunnatural and lascivious act\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. He further asserts that \u00a7 35 is unconstitutional because it impermissibly attempts to apply to conduct of consenting adults in private. He argues that the judge should have instructed the jury that consent by the victim would bar a conviction under \u00a7 35. He also claims that, if \u00a7 35 is free from unconstitutional vagueness, the judge failed to give the jury an adequate description of what constitutes an unnatural and lascivious act. He finally argues that an improper remark in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury was not adequately cured by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The victim testified that she was standing on the sidewalk at Exeter Street in Boston one day in July, 1972, when a light blue car pulled up. Because she thought the car was that of a friend, she entered it. She testified that when she discovered that the driver was not her friend, she tried to leave the car, but the defendant pulled a knife and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d She testified that he then drove her to a secluded place south of Boston. He threatened her and ordered her to take off her blouse and pants. He then ordered her to commit an act of fellatio on him, threatening to kill her if she did not. She did as he ordered. He then ordered the victim \u201cto put. .. [her] tongue on his backside.\u201d She complied. The victim testified that the defendant drove her back to Boston and let her go. Subsequently he was apprehended at a time and place where the victim said she had agreed to meet him on the following Saturday. The defendant did not testify. There were no other witnesses to the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The jury found the defendant guilty of committing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>unnatural and lascivious act but found him not guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">1. The defendant first argues that \u00a7 35 is void on its face as a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>325 Mass. 519, 521 (1950). He asserts that the words \u201cunnatural and lascivious\u201d fail to state with sufficient particularity what conduct is made criminal. We agree that today these words, standing alone, present some question as to their meaning, even if they had a generally understood signification in 1887 when they were first expressed in the statute from which \u00a7 35 is derived. St. 1887, c. 436, \u00a7 1. In some other jurisdictions, statutes utilizing language of this general character have been struck down on due process grounds. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>1 Ohio App. 2d 425 (1965) (\u201cunnatural sex act\u201d); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>State, </em>457 P. 2d 638 (Alaska, 1969) (\u201ccrime against nature\u201d); <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 So. 2d 21 (Fla. 1971) (\u201cabominable and detestable crime against nature\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">However, judicial construction of an otherwise ambiguous statute may fulfil the constitutional requirement of specificity. <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 303-304 (1967). <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15 (1973). Furthermore, a sufficiently definite warning may be achieved by the common law meaning or statutory history of particular terms. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 553 (1971), and cases cited. Constitutional adequacy is thus attained when the language proscribing certain conduct is \u201cmeasured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497(1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In 1954, this court held that \u00a7 35 had sufficient clarity to be free from unconstitutional vagueness. <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 442 (1954). We said (at 442) that the words \u201can unnatural and lascivious act\u201d are \u201cwords of common usage and indicate with reasonable clarity the kind and character of conduct which the Legislature intended to prohibit and punish.\u201d We stated that \u201c[t]hese words have a well defined, well understood, and generally accepted meaning.\u201d We then defined these words as signifying \u201cirregular indulgence in sexual behavior, illicit sexual relations, and infamous conduct which is lustful, obscene, and in deviation of accepted customs and manners.\u201d We said (at 443) that \u201cthe common sense of the community, as well as the sense of decency, propriety, and morality which all respectable persons usually entertain, is sufficient to apply the statute to a situation and determine what particular kind of conduct offends.\u201d We concluded (at 443) that specification in the indictment beyond the language of the statute (see G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 45) \u201cwould be an offence against common decency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We thus have limited the scope of \u00a7 35 to sexual conduct which virtually all members of the community have regarded as offensive. This is, of course, a standard which may change with the passage of time. In the years since the <em>Jaquith </em>case, a new factor has appeared with the articulation of the constitutional right of an individual to be free from government regulation of certain sex-related activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First Amendment rights of free speech now permit even a patently offensive portrayal of sexual conduct in a work which has some \u201cserious literary, artistic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>political, or scientific value.\u201d See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In light of these changes and in light of our own awareness that community values on the subject of permissible sexual conduct no longer are as monolithic as the <em>Jaquith </em>case suggested they were in 1954, we conclude that \u00a7 35 must be construed to be inapplicable to private, consensual conduct of adults. We do so on the ground that the concept of general community disapproval of specific sexual conduct, which is inherent in \u00a7 35, requires such an interpretation. We do not decide whether a statute which explicitly prohibits specific sexual conduct, even if consensual and private, would be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As thus construed, \u00a7 35 clearly may apply to the noncon-sensual conduct in which the defendant forced the victim to engage. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deschamps, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4-5 (1972), the Appeals Court concluded that \u00a735 applied to a defendant who forced another to commit an act of fellatio and submit to an act of cunnilingus. Without undertaking to consider acts not involved in this case, we conclude that there is no unconstitutional vagueness in \u00a7 35 as applied to the defendant. The defendant may not properly rely on the possible unconstitutionality of \u00a7 35 as applied to others. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>364 Mass. 550,553-554(1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">2. We turn next to the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the consent of the victim. What we have said already indicates that consensual conduct in private between adults is not prohibited by \u00a7 35. Assuming that the acts here in question occurred in private and that the victim was an adult,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on request or objection the judge should have submitted the issue of consent to the jury. However, the defendant did not file such a request, nor did he take an exception (or even raise any objection) to the judge\u2019s charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>in this respect. Although the matter of the statute\u2019s \u201coverbreadth\u201d was raised in a motion to dismiss the indictment, the defendant did not press further the subject of consent, once the evidence was presented to the jury. The defendant may not object here for the first time to the absence of a charge on the subject of consent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>364 Mass. 550, 554 (1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">3. The defendant contends that, if \u00a7 35 is not impermis-sibly vague, the judge failed to give the jury any standards for determining whether the acts described by the complaining witness were \u201cunnatural and lascivious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The judge charged the jury that, if they believed the testimony of the victim, they would be warranted in finding that the defendant committed an unnatural and lascivious act upon her. The judge stated that he \u201cneed not go further in this particular case to define the nature of such acts.\u201d He added that \u201c[i]f you believe that those acts did occur, then you would be warranted in finding that such acts were unnatural and lascivious acts within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We believe that this charge was at least as favorable to the defendant as was necessary. By compelling the victim to put her mouth on his genitals and on his buttocks or anus, the defendant sought sexual gratification in a manner which deviated from accepted conduct in the community. These <em>nonconsensual </em>acts are by general agreement both unnatural and lascivious. Thus, if the jury found that these acts did occur under threats by the defendant, a finding of guilt was indicated, and there was no occasion for the jury to exercise independent judgment as to whether the acts were \u201cunnatural and lascivious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">4. The defendant asserts finally that the judge failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>cure prejudice arising from the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument to the jury that certain testimony of the victim had not been denied. The prosecutor\u2019s statement, which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> could be construed as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify and hence as a violation of rights protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights, and G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Third. The Commonwealth concedes that the challenged remarks <em>\u201cgo </em>beyond the purpose of a closing argument,\u201d but argues that any possible prejudice was obviated by the judge\u2019s instructions to thejury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defense counsel objected immediately to the inappropriate remark. The judge forthwith instructed the prosecutor to \u201cmove off that particular point\u201d and told the jury that it was \u201cnot up to the defendant to put on any evidence\u201d and that it was \u201ccompletely up to the Commonwealth to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d He repeated these points in his charge, alluding to what he had said previously. After the charge, defense counsel objected to the judge\u2019s failure to instruct specially as to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, claiming that the judge had failed to cure the prejudice. When the judge asked defense counsel to suggest \u201cin any form of words what more I can say to the jury,\u201d defense counsel was unable to offer any suggestion. The judge promptly and thoroughly protected the defendant\u2019s interests in this respect. There was no prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>251 Mass. 275, 281-282 (1925). <em>Commonwealth v. Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69 (1954).

The fact that the jury acquitted the defendant of assault with a deadly weapon does not require the conclusion that the victim consented to perform the acts in question.
