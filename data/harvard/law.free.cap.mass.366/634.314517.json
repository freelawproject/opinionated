SeeG. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>that the same time limitations apply to all applicants for abatement, we must then determine whether in the circumstances the application for abatement was filed seasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Facts found by the board, mostly on the basis of a stipulation by the parties, may be summarized briefly. In April, 1970, Shahmoon Industries, Incorporated (Shah-moon), sold various assets, including real estate in Everett (the premises), to the appellant Canron, Inc. (Canron). However, no deed conveying the premises was recorded until late in 1971. In June, 1971, Shahmoon advised the board of assessors of Everett (the assessors) by letter that the premises had been sold and enclosed a copy of an executed bill of sale to Canron. That bill of sale indicated that the principal office of Canron was 1121 Ville Marie Place, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and contained a written acceptance, purportedly executed on behalf of Canron. On October 8, 1971, the collector of taxes of Everett mailed Canron a notice of 1971 real estate taxes on the premises, which set forth the name and address of the owner as \u201cShahmoon Industries, Inc. c/o Canron Inc., 1121 Ville Marie Place, Montreal, Quebec, Canada 02149.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Although Canron did not have a \u201clegal\u201d office in Montreal, its parent company (Canron Ltd.) did. The tax notice was received by Canron at its offices in New Jersey. On November 5, 1971, without paying the real estate taxes in advance, Canron filed an application for an abatement of taxes on the premises, listing itself as the person assessed. The assessors returned the tax bills for payment and inquired whether deeds transferring the premises had been recorded. The deed was recorded subsequently on Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ber 31,1971. On February 11,1972, a demand for payment of 1971 real estate taxes on the premises was sent to \u201cShahmoon Industries, Inc. 19 Robin Street Everett, Mass. 02149 c/o Canron, Inc. 1121 Ville Marie Place Montreal, Quebec Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On March 2,1972, Canron paid the 1971 local real estate taxes assessed on the premises, and, on March 7,1972, filed with the assessors an application for abatement of those taxes. Subsequently Canron appealed to the board from the denial, by inaction, of the abatement application. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 64,65.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The board found that the assessors had made a good faith effort to cooperate with Shahmoon and Canron with respect to billing for 1971 real estate taxes on the premises, \u201ceven though the facts indicate that the procedures followed left much to be desired.\u201d The board further found that \u201c [a] ny mix-up\u201d with respect to the address to which the bill was sent did not prejudice Canron. The board ruled that under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, the November 5, 1971, abatement application was ineffective because Canron, as \u201ca person other than the person to whom a tax on real estate , is assessed,\u201d had not paid the tax.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board further ruled that the tax notice sent on October 8,1971, was sufficient to initiate the thirty-day period, set forth in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, during which an application for abatement must be filed (if the tax bill or notice is first sent after September first in any year) and that Canron was as much subject to the limitations of that thirty-day period as an assessed owner or other assessed person. The board allowed the assessors\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal to it for want of jurisdiction, and Canron appealed. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">1. The time period for filing an application for abatement, which clearly applies to \u201c[a] person upon whom a tax has been assessed,\u201d applies as well to other persons (such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Canron here) who may file applications for abatement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the effectiveness of St. 1933, c. 165, \u00a7 1, which added the third sentence of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, only a person to whom a local real estate tax had been assessed (and, in some circumstances, a tenant) could file an application for abatement of that tax. See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>311 Mass. 415, 416 (1942). That 1933 amendment to \u00a7 59 grants to a person other than the party assessed, if he has paid the tax, the right to \u201cprosecute in his own name any application, appeal or action provided by law for the abatement or recovery of such tax.\u201d That amendment says nothing about the procedures to be followed in pursuing this new right. However, because the amendment was added to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, and because the new right is to prosecute any application \u201cprovided by law,\u201d we regard the time limitations expressly applicable to an assessed party under the first sentence of \u00a7 59 as equally applicable to one who has a right to seek an abatement under the third sentence of \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">There is no strong reason to make a distinction between the two classes of potential applicants, and certainly there is no compelling reason why a person who is not the owner on the assessment date should have more time to seek administrative relief than the person assessed. There is, however, reason for the Legislature to have adopted a course which permits a municipality to know by a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>lar date the scope of its potential liability for claimed tax abatements. See <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>310 Mass. 300, 308 (1941). The construction urged by Canron opens the possibility of circumvention of the time limitations of \u00a7 59 by an assessed owner who has discovered that an application cannot be filed seasonably by him, but could be so filed by someone else with an \u201cinterest\u201d in the property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We see no merit in Canron\u2019s constitutional argument that it has been denied due process of law by the interpretation of \u00a7 59 which we have made. See Old <em>Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>309 Mass. 439, 445-446 (1941) (requirement of prepayment of the tax within a particular time period); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Marden &amp; Murphy, Inc. </em>321 Mass. 597, 599 (1947), cert. den. and app. dism. for want of substantial Federal question, 332 U. S. 850 (1948) (same); <em>Winona &amp; St. Peter Land Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>159 U. S. 526, 537 (1895) (an opportunity to be heard on the validity and amount of a property tax satisfies due process requirements); <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors for the Parish of Orleans, </em>221 U. S. 358, 360-361 (1911) (reasonable time limit to seek reduction in taxes). Canron acquired the premises in April, 1970. Certainly it had ample opportunity to preserve its rights to challenge local real estate taxes assessed as of January 1,1971, and billed in October, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">2. We turn next to Canron\u2019s argument that, if it is subject to the time restraints of \u00a7 59, the thirty-day period did not commence on October 8,1971, when the collector of taxes mailed a notice to Shahmoon, care of Canron in Montreal. Canron correctly points to G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 50, which directs the collector to \u201csend notice to each person assessed, resident or nonresident, of the amount of his tax; if mailed, it shall be postpaid and directed to the town where the assessed person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>resided on January first of the year in which the tax was assessed.\u201d Canron argues that the board was in error in ruling that the October 8, 1971, notice was effective to begin the running of the thirty-day period for applying for an abatement. The assessors argue, in response, that an irregularity does not invalidate a tax notice if the taxpayer\u2019s rights were not prejudiced by the irregularity. We have so held in other contexts involving tax statutes. See <em>Boston v. Boston Port Dev. Co. </em>308 Mass. 72, 74-75 (1941); <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>320 Mass. 585, 587 (1947); <em>Trustees of the Hawes Fund in Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>346 Mass. 26, 27-28 <em>(1963).Cf. Lowell v. Marden &amp; Murphy, Inc., supra, </em>at 599. The same principle of law is appropriately applicable to the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Although, in sending the tax notice as he did, the collector did not comply with the requirement of G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 3, we see no substantial prejudice to Canron from the mailing of the notice to Montreal. The Montreal address was one which Canron had acknowledged, at least indirectly, as its own on the bill of sale. In any event, we are not dealing here with a question of timeliness, because Canron did file an application for abatement within thirty days of October 8,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Canron\u2019s problem was its failure to realize that it was not the assessed owner of the premises (because no deed had been recorded prior to January 1, 1971). Canron seeks to place the responsibility for this failure on the improper addressing of the tax notice. The board found, however, that \u201c [a]ny mix-up\u201d regarding the address to which the bill was sent \u201cwas not the cause of any loss of rights of the appellant.\u201d The basic question before the board, of course, was whether the form of the notice reasonably contributed to Canron\u2019s mistaken belief that it was the assessed owner. We think the board was warranted in finding that it did not. The tax notice set forth \u201cShahmoon Industries, Inc.\u201d under the heading \u201cName and Address of Owner.\u201d It then set forth \u201cc/o Canron Inc.\u201d and the Montreal address. The board was not required to rule as matter of law that Canron\u2019s filing of an application for abatement listing itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>as the person assessed was attributable to the action of the assessors or the collector of taxes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">3. Because the collector\u2019s noncompliance with G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 3, did not substantially prejudice Canron, the board was correct in ruling that the thirty-day period to apply for an abatement commenced on October 8, 1971. And, because Canron as a person other than the assessed party was subject to that thirty-day limitation, the board was correct in dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-15\"> The relevant portions of G.
