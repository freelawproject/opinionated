L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, the plaintiffs seek to annul the decision of the defendant board of appeals of the town of Winchester (the board) granting the defendant First Carriage Hill Associates, Inc. (First Carriage), a comprehensive permit to construct 176 units of low and moderate income housing under the provisions of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, all inserted by St. 1969, c. 774, \u00a7 1. The plaintiffs own property in Winchester abutting the property for which this comprehensive permit was granted. They bring this suit as persons allegedly \u201caggrieved\u201d by its issuance, as provided inc. 40B, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The board originally granted a permit to First Carriage by a decision dated March 3,1972, in response to which the plaintiffs filed their original bill of complaint in the Superior Court. After several days of trial the judge remanded the case to the board in order that notice and an opportunity to be heard could be given to owners of neighboring property in addition to the abutters of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>property involved. The board gave such notice, held an additional hearing on First Carriage\u2019s application, and on December 29, 1972, affirmed its previous decision. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a supplemental bill of complaint. On March 26, 1973, First Carriage filed a \u201cMotion for Immediate Entry of Final Decree in Favor of the Respondents,\u201d alleging in substance that the plaintiffs\u2019 bill raised only an issue of law which had been resolved by this court in <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. in the Dept. of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 339 (1973), decided March 22, 1973. The motion was allowed and a final decree dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill was entered. The case is before us on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">1. We first dispose of First Carriage\u2019s claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this court was not filed within the twenty days permitted. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19. There is no merit in this argument. Although the judge allowed First Carriage\u2019s motion for immediate entry of final decree on April 17,1973, and a notation to that effect was written on the motion, the final decree was not entered until May 4. As a general rule, only the final decree itself is the subject of appeal. See <em>Fusaro </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>300 Mass. 229, 230-231 (1938). Although there are cases in which both parties have treated the judge\u2019s informal notation of his ruling or an order for a final decree as the final decree itself, see <em>Wallin </em>v. <em>Smolensky, </em>303 Mass. 39, 42 (1939); A. <em>J. Wolfe Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 361, 363 (1969), the parties did not do so in this case with respect to the judge\u2019s April 17 notation on the motion. First Carriage prepared and filed the final decree for entry, as it was required to do by Rule 82 of the Superior Court (1954), as amended, and it is therefore responsible for any delay between the allowance of its motion and entry of such decree. The statutory twenty-day appeal period ran from May 4, 1973, and not April 17. The plaintiffs filed their appeal seasonably on May 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">2. Although neither First Carriage nor the board filed a demurrer and both filed answers to the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, there appears to be no factual dispute between the parties. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>was no evidentiary hearing on the bill. Accordingly, the question before us is limited to whether the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient as matter of law for them to maintain their cause of action. We hold that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations may be summarized as follows. General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, constitutes an unlawful delegation of power and fails to set forth adequate standards to guide the board\u2019s action, in violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The board\u2019s action in granting the comprehensive permit to First Carriage denies the plaintiffs equal protection of the laws and due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. By granting First Carriage an \u201cimmunity\u201d from the requirements of the subdivision control law and the Winchester building bylaw, the board has deprived the plaintiffs of their rights, inherent in their ownership of adjacent property, to have these requirements uniformly enforced. General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, by giving only the applicant for a comprehensive permit the right of appeal to the Housing Appeals Committee in the Department of Community Affairs, denies the plaintiffs their right to equal access to the courts. The board failed to satisfy the criteria required by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, prior to granting a comprehensive permit. The board failed to give proper notice of the initial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The claim that G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of power and is unconstitutionally vague was given extensive treatment in <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. in the Dept. of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 339, 363-368 (1973), and was resolved against the position argued here by the plaintiffs. Nothing need be added to our discussion in that case. The same is true of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they have been denied equal access to the courts on the ground that they have no right of appeal to the Housing Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Committee. This is in essence an argument that the different method of review afforded an applicant for a permit from one aggrieved by its issuance constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws. In response to a contention,_ the reverse of what the plaintiffs raise here \u2014 that it was the applicant who was denied equal protection by virtue of being forced to appeal to the Housing Appeals Committee rather than seeking a de nova review in the Superior Court \u2014 we held in the <em>Hanover </em>case that \u201cthere are no substantial differences between the alternative methods of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371. And finally, to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 explicit allegation of a denial of equal protection constitutes a contention that G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, permits unconstitutional spot zoning, the <em>Hanover </em>case specifically considered and rejected the <em>claim.Id. </em>at 360-363.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention on appeal centers around their allegation concerning the subdivision control law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG. They argue first that G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, was not intended to permit a zoning board of appeals to override the requirements of the subdivision control law in granting a comprehensive permit. They then argue that in this case the board granted First Carriage an \u201cimmunity\u201d from these requirements and that by doing so the board denied the plaintiffs their right to equal protection of the laws. We do not agree, and we believe that, although these precise claims were not specifically considered in the <em>Hanover </em>case, our opinion there in effect disposes of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">By the provisions of c. 40B, \u00a7 21, the board has \u201cthe same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application.\u201d \u201cLocal Board\u201d as defined in \u00a7 20 explicitly includes the planning board and the board of subdivision control appeals, the two administrative bodies in charge of implementing the subdivision control law. In the <em>Hanover </em>case we held that the board\u2019s power under that part of \u00a7 21 quoted above includes the power to override \u201clocal \u2018requirements and regulations\u2019\u201d \u2014 in that case zoning by<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>laws \u2014 which are not \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d: \u201c[T]he statute\u2019s legislative history and avowed purpose to facilitate the construction of low and moderate income housing in areas which have exclusionary zoning practices compel our decision to construe the statute so that zoning ordinances or by-laws are treated like any other local requirements which hamper the construction of low and moderate income housing. All these local \u2018requirements and regulations\u2019 will be applicable if they are \u2018consistent with local needs\u2019; if they are not, they must be modified or ignored.\u201d 363 Mass, at 354 (1973). This analysis is equally applicable to the requirements of the subdivision control law.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The record does not indicate whether the board \u201cmodified or ignored\u201d the requirements of this law in granting First Carriage a comprehensive permit, but even if it did, such action would not deny the plaintiffs equal protection of the laws. Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 view of the requirements of the equal protection clause it is clear, as we emphasized in the <em>Hanover </em>case, that the Legislature\u2019s authority to regulate local zoning and related practices is very broad and that the court\u2019s role in reviewing its exercise, as provided in c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, \u201cis limited to the determination of whether the legislation adopts a reasonable means to serve a legitimate public purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. We concluded there that this legislation does so, and our conclusion is not changed by the fact that the plaintiffs in this case are individual property owners whose land abuts the parcel at issue and not, as in the <em>Hanover </em>case, public bodies responsible for enforcing the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The plaintiffs do not argue in their brief their allegation concerning improper notice and we treat the allegation as waived. See S.J.C. Rule 1:13, 351 Mass. 738 (1967); <em>Finance Comm. of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Falmouth Bd. of Pub. Welfare, </em>345 Mass. 579, 587 (1963). Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
