The plaintiff (Lumbermens) insured one of the vehicles under a standard motor vehicle liability insurance policy and paid its insured approximately $750 for damage sustained by the insured\u2019s vehicle in the accident. The other vehicle was a commercial vehicle owned by the defendant (Truck Lease), as to which a motor vehicle liability bond, rather than an insurance policy, was in effect: Truck Lease was the obligor on that bond; Seaboard Surety Co. was the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">In September, 1973, Lumbermens filed in the Superior Court a demand for arbitration of an asserted subrogation claim against Truck Lease pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 340, as amended through St. 1971, c. 1079, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. Truck Lease by answer denied any obligation to arbitrate. After a hearing, at which counsel agreed to all the relevant facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the judge denied Lumbermens\u2019 application for an order compelling arbitration on the ground that Truck Lease was \u201cnot an insurer within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, Sec. 340.\u201d The case is before us on Lumbermens\u2019 exception to that order. We ordered this case transferred from the Appeals Court for hearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Since January 1, 1972, every person having in force a motor vehicle liability policy or bond, as defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, has been obliged to maintain \u201ceither property protection insurance or a bond providing equivalent benefits.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 340, first paragraph. See St. 1971, c. 978, \u00a7 2, for the effective date. Every owner or operator of a vehicle covered by property protection insurance or by a property protection bond is exempt from all liability \u201cfor accidental loss of or damage to any vehicle to which ... [\u00a7 340] applies.\u201d \u00a7 340, fifth paragraph. However, \u00a7 340 provides for interinsurer subrogation, with any property damage loss ultimately placed among insurers pursuant to normal tort principles, without regard to the exemptions from tort liability which \u00a7 340 itself extends.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Truck Lease takes the position that it is not an insurer within the meaning of the word in \u00a7 340 and, therefore, Lumbermens may not turn to it for reimbursement under the interinsurer subrogation provisions of \u00a7 340. Truck Lease further contends that it may not be compelled, in any event, to arbitrate the dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Truck Lease is an insurer subject to the interinsurer subrogation provisions of \u00a7 340. Section 340 provides that a motor vehicle liability bond \u201cshall create the same rights, liabilities, waivers and exemptions as are provided with respect to property protection insurance coverage.\u201d This legislative purpose would be thwarted if Truck Lease were able to avoid liability to Lumbermens simply by purchasing a bond instead of an insurance policy. Because between Truck Lease and its surety the obligation to pay losses and to defend claims rests primarily on Truck Lease, we have no hesitation in concluding that Truck Lease is an insurer for the purposes of carrying out the subrogation provisions of \u00a7 340.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Truck Lease argues that it may not be forced to arbitrate Lumbermens\u2019 claim. It contends that it has not agreed in writing to arbitrate, that \u00a7 340 calls for arbitration \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the General Laws\u201d; and that the relevant arbitration provisions of the General Laws (G. L. c. 251) apply only where the claim for arbitration is based on a written agreement. Truck Lease further claims that compulsory, binding arbitration violates its right to trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">If an insurer could avoid any obligation to arbitrate claims under \u00a7 340 simply by not agreeing in writing to arbitrate, the purpose of \u00a7 340 to achieve prompt and economical interinsurer settlement of certain claims would be largely frustrated. We therefore read the reference in \u00a7 340 to \u201carbitration in accordance with the provisions of the General Laws\u201d as an incorporation of the procedures of our arbitration statute (G. L. c. 251) but not as a grant to an insurer of the option whether to participate fully in inter-insurer subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The Legislature did not violate Truck Lease\u2019s right to a jury trial when it established arbitration under G. L. c. 251 as the procedure by which interinsurer subrogation claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>would be handled. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 562, 569-570 (1941); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 571, 601-602 (1941). Truck Lease in effect elected to become a self-insurer when it decided to maintain a motor vehicle liability bond and must accept all the consequences of that election.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Truck Lease argues finally that there was no claim against it to which Lumbermens could be subrogated. It is true that the statute exempts owners and operators of motor vehicles from personal liability in these circumstances. However, the word \u201csubrogation\u201d is not used in \u00a7 340 in its traditional sense. In the context of the statute, the word \u201csubrogation\u201d obviously is used to describe the process of allocating losses among insurers, applying traditional tort concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">An order should be entered in the Superior Court directing arbitration of Lumbermens\u2019 claim against Truck Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> At the time of the accident which gave rise to this dispute, interinsurer subrogation was permitted under \u00a7 340 only where (as here) at least one of the vehicles was not a private passenger vehicle. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 340, sixth paragraph, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 978, \u00a7 1. For a change in that provision, making interinsurer subrogation available even where all the involved vehicles are in the private passenger classification, see St. 1973, c. 917, \u00a7 1, effective as to policies issued and causes of action arising on and after January 1, 1974 (c. 917, \u00a72). See also, however, St. 1973, c. 1069, \u00a71, giving the Commissioner of Insurance authority in certain circumstances to postpone until January 1, 1975, the effectiveness of St. 1973, c. 917.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\"> The sixth paragraph of \u00a7 340 provides that if the involved insurers cannot agree who is entitled to recover for any expense for which subrogation may be sought, the determination shall be made \u201cby arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the General Laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> We know the extent of the obligor\u2019s duties from oral argument, Truck Lease\u2019s brieband exhibits in a parallel case decided today <em>(Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem.
