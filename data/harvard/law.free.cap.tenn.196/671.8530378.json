The lots on both sides of Mrs. Grant\u2019s property and to the rear are zoned Residential \u201cC\u201d. Mrs. Grant and the City of Nashville have appealed from the decree of the Chancellor holding that this ordinance is unconstitutional in that it gives to Mrs. Grant privileges \u201cnot extended to others in the same neighborhood similarly situated, and that the action taken was not in furtherance of any general plan or scheme of zoning, and, therefore, constituted \u2018spot zoning.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Appellants\u2019 insistence is that this amendatory ordinance was enacted \u201cfor the general welfare of the people in Mrs. Grant\u2019s neighborhood\u201d; hence, is a valid enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Mrs. Grant\u2019s lot fronts 50 feet on the north side of Boscobel Street, .as do the other lots thereon. Prior to the enactment of this amendatory ordinance, all lots on the north side of Boscobel Street and those to the rear thereof were zoned Residential \u201cC\u201d, except that the lot on the corner of the intersection of Boscobel Street with South 10th Street is zoned Commercial \u201cA\u201d. This is in keeping with the fact that all lots in this neighborhood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>fronting on South 10th Street are zoned Commercial \u201cA\u201d. Lots No. 933 ,and 931 in this block to the west of Mrs. Grant\u2019s lot and lots No. 927, 925, 923 and 921 to the east of her lot are zoned Residential \u201c0\u201d. The amendatory ordinance leaves all these lots Residential \u201cC\u201d, changing* only to Commercial <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>Mrs. Grant\u2019s lot No. 929. Across from Mrs. Grant\u2019s lot on the south side of Boscobel Street four lots running east from South 10th Street are zoned Commercial \u201cA,\u201d. The others thereon are Residential \u201cC\u201d. They are not changed by this amendatory ordinance. So it is that no lot other than the one belonging to Mrs. Grant is affected by this ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">It is glaringly apparent from the physical situation detailed that the 'Chancellor had ho escape from the conclusion that the ordinance was not enacted in furtherance \u201cof any general plan or scheme of zoning\u201d. Those same facts force the conclusion that mercantile stores were already available to the neighborhood. Therefore, the change of this one parcel of land from residential to commercial cannot fairly be held to have been a change for the general welfare of the people in Mrs. Grant\u2019s neighborhood, as insisted in her behalf. The situation then poses the question as to why the city fathers enacted this unusual ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Mrs. Grant is a widow well up in years. She has the responsibility of supporting her invalid son who can help himself in this respect if there can be legally conducted on this lot No. 929 belonging to his mother, it being the place where they live, the commercial business of selling merchandise generally classed as varieties' and notions. With this in mind, Mrs. Grant appealed to the alderman representing her particular ward. The planning commission thereafter disapproved of the change on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that it was \u201cspot zoning\u201d. Nevertheless, the city fathers enacted the ordinance. No basis for this action can be conjured other than that it emanated from a strong desire to help this good lady.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Notwithstanding the laudable purpose which inspired the ordinance, the Chancellor was compelled, reluctantly, to find that it was an ordinance enacted only for the personal benefit of Mrs. Grant and her son. It was inconsistent with the general ordinance on the subject, and gave to Mrs. Grant a privilege withheld by the general law from others in a situation like unto that of Mrs. Grant. On principle, there is no escape from the conclusion that the ordinance contravened Article XI, See. 8 of the Tennessee Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We find no Tennessee decision on the exact point involved. However, the number of decisions which might be cited from other jurisdictions holding such an ordinance invalid are quite numerous. The Chancellor cites, and quotes from, a number of these. We borrow from that exceedingly well-considered opinion only two or three cases to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Village of Tarrytown, </em>302 N. Y. 115, 96 N. E. (2d) 731, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201c \u2018Spot zoning\u2019 is process of singling out small parcel of land for use classification totally different from that of surrounding area, for benefit of owner of such property and to detriment of other owners, and, as such, is very antithesis of planned zoning. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Rash, </em>314 Ky. 609, 236 S. W. (2d) 687, it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">\u201cAmendment to city zoning ordinance reclassifying lot so as to permit erection and construction thereon of modern well equipped doctors\u2019 office build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ing constituted \u2018spot zoning\u2019, since it simply selected one lot, owned by one person, and created for it a particular zoning classification different from that of surrounding property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In <em>Cassel </em>v. <em>Mayor </em>&amp; <em>City Council of Baltimore, </em>195 Md. 348, 73 A. (2d) 486, 489, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cIt is, therefore, universally field that a \u2018spot zoning\u2019 ordinance, which, singles out a parcel of land within the limits of a use district and marks it off into a separate district for the benefit of the owner, thereby permitting a use of that parcel inconsistent with the use permitted in the rest of the district, is invalid if it is not in accordance with the comprehensive zoning plan and is merely for private gain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABI\">The Chancellor\u2019s decree will be affirmed with costs adjudged against the City of Nashville and surety on its bond.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
