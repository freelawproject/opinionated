The accident happened on April 29, 1951, and he died the following February, 1952. It is conceded by the defendant that the accident arose out of and in the course of his employment. While at work at or near a printing-press he was \u201cseverely burned by an explosion of oil or gas in said press pit.\u201d The extent of his injuries is described by Dr. Kaufman as follows: ' \u2018 * most of his arms up to, well within say three inches of his shoulder, the entire front of his face, neck, ears, lips, forehead, nose, eyebrows, all that and part of his hair. And I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>forgotten but my record shows that both knees were burned too.\u201d Some \u201cwere third degree burns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The deceased was hospitalized and given the necessary treatment for his injuries. He entered the hospital on April 29, 1951, and was discharged on May 12, ,1951, and died as above stated in February, 1952. After leaving the hospital he was confined to his home being \u201cin bed part of the time and up part of the time\u201d and was under treatment of Dr. Kaufman, who was in the regular employ of the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier. For at least a month after leaving the hospital he was unable to feed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It appears that in September, 1951, he developed a swelling in his right foot and leg. Dr. Kaufman described it as \u201cterrific\u201d and later required an operation. There was more than one operation. When asked to state the cause of the leg condition he said it indicated \u201cthrombo phlebitis\u201d. In a letter to the Agent of the Insurance Company, supplementing his report of October 9, 1951, he stated the disability in the right leg began in August \u201cand became quite disabling for the first part of September.\u201d Continuing he states, \u201cFrom the history of the ease and physical findings the diagnosis of this is syphilitic osteitis. \u2019 \u2019 This leg condition developed approximately three months following the accident and while he was under treatment at his home. The letter contains the following significant and important statement: \u201cIt is my opinion that had Odie not been burned and suffered a considerable degree of shock, weakness and disability <em>clue to Ms extensive burns, tMs leg condition would never have shown up.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) But he added: \u201cThis is purely speculative and impossible to prove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The learned doctor expressed the opinion that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>primary cause of death was acute heart failure.\u201d We here quote the following relevant testimony of the doctor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cQ. You say his heart just stopped beating. Acute heart failure. A. Yes, it is more than that. I mean the heart was just, it had stood all it could stand. It couldn\u2019t stand any more. It had been beating against this big old leg trying to drive blood through that leg that couldn\u2019t get there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201c Q. Had the strain that been placed, the leg placed on his heart, do you think that that could have had something to, some causal connection. * <em>* </em>* A. It had half to do with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cQ. Half to do with it! A. Yes, sir. That leg, you see that put a tremendous load on a heart that is designed to pump blood through a diseased limb like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cQ. Well, now in other words, if it hadn\u2019t been for this diseased limb it is quite likely and most probable that the strain would not have been. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">A. He probably would be here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201c'Q. He probably be here today? A. Probably. I mean as far as we know from what we know about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Prom what you know about. A. Yes, sir.\u201d (Tr. pp. 54 and 55.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">We think it definitely appears that the deceased was never released to go to work after he was burned, as shown by the following questions to Dr. Kaufman and his answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-15\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Doctor, did Odie Eaybon, did you ever release him to go back to work any time after you treated him for his burns, first, treated him. * * * A,. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\"><em>* </em># # # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201c Q. You never released Mm to go back to work though did you? A. No, sir. I released Mm from compensation and be went to the hospital. \u201d (Tr. pp. 58 and 59.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The petitioner introduced Dr. Matt B. Murfree, who expressed the opinion in answer to a hypothetical question, that the severe burns were a disturbance of the normal blood supply and aggravated a condition of \u201cthrombo phlebitis\u201d. This statement seems to be corroborative of Dr. Kaufman\u2019s letter, and that if it had not been for excessive burns it would not have developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">It is reasonable to conclude that the death of Odie Raybon was indirectly, if not directly, caused by the severe burns, all of which have been more or less described in detail. The evidence when considered as a whole, both direct and circumstantial, fully sustains the judgment of the trial court. It thereupon results that the appellants\u2019 assignment of error, based upon the alleged insufficiency of the evidence, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">There is no merit in the assignment that, \u201cThe Court erred in refusing to permit counsel for petitioner to restate the hypothetical question propounded to Dr. Murfree.\u201d There is no showing that the question was not broad enough to cover all the relevant facts. The framing of the question was under the direction of the trial judge, and his final action was not subject to criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed, and the case is remanded for such further action as may be necessary for its enforcement and final disposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
