On appeal, the plaintiffs argue, in part, that the court improperly affirmed the board\u2019s decision because the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5.7 of the Branford zoning regulations was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Following oral argument in this court, this court, sua sponte, asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the following question: \u201cWhether the zoning board of appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff-appellants\u2019 appeal from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s issuance of the certificate of zoning compliance?\u201d We further requested that the parties comment on whether the thirty day period for appealing from a zoning enforcement officer\u2019s action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-7<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has an effect on the facts of this case. In their supplemental brief, the plaintiffs respond that the board did not lack jurisdiction to hear their appeal, notwithstanding that it was brought well beyond the thirty day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 8-7, because our \u201cSupreme Court has held that the only reasonable construction of statutory time limits to appeal is that the time period runs from the date of notice.\u201d The plaintiffs conclude that the board had jurisdiction to hear their appeal because they appealed within thirty days of receiving actual or constructive notice of the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The defendants respond that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear that portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal challenging the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s action because the plaintiffs did not file the appeal within the prescribed thirty day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 8-7. The defendants further argue that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ing officer\u2019s action because the board has no authority to hear such appeals under \u00a7 8-7 and because the appeal should have been filed with the building board of appeals pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-266.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we hold that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment of affirmance and remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. Sim-jian owns a parcel of real property on Etzel Road in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Branford on which there is a freestanding garage. Pursuant to the Branford zoning regulations, the garage is a nonconforming structure because its footprint does not conform with area setback regulations. On May 1,1997, Simjian applied separately for a certificate of zoning compliance and a building permit to build a second story addition to the garage. After altering the construction plan to conform to the structure\u2019s footprint, the Branford zoning enforcement officer issued the requested certificate on August 26,1997. On September 8, 1997, the town\u2019s building official also issued the requested building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On April 2, 1998, Simjian commenced demolition of the garage roof in preparation for construction of the second story addition. The plaintiffs, all of whom are abutting property owners, promptly lodged objections with the zoning enforcement officer and the building official. The zoning enforcement officer refused to revoke the certificate of zoning compliance as the plaintiffs requested. The building official did not rescind Simjian\u2019s building permit because it effectively had lapsed on March 8, 1998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The building official acted, however, on Simjian\u2019s application for a second building permit dated April 2, 1998, and, thereafter, issued a second building permit on April 7, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>On or about April 7, 1998, the plaintiffs appealed to the board from the issuance of the certificate and the building permits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal rested, in part, on the ground that the second story addition was a prohibited increase in a nonconformity under \u00a7 5.7. On May 19,1998, the board held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, at which the plaintiffs argued that \u201csince June, 1997, the zoning authorities for the town of Branford have interpreted the nonconformity section of the Bran-ford zoning regulations to require that an applicant obtain a variance (1) if a structure which is nonconforming as to setback is to be increased vertically within its existing footprint.\u201d They further argued that Simjian did not obtain the required variance, although the addition would increase the vertical height of the garage and, therefore, the certificate of zoning compliance and building permit were improperly granted. The plaintiffs requested that the board revoke the certificate and the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Following the hearing, the board voted to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The board concluded that the certificate of zoning compliance had been properly issued because the zoning enforcement officer had acted consistently with the law and rules as she knew them at the time. The board further ruled that the zoning compliance officer \u201cwas doing what has always been done when someone requests a building permit and a [certificate] of compliance is issued at the time. Once a certificate was issued it doesn\u2019t expire and generally the building permit is just renewed when requested. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued when the building is complete if it does not comply with the site plan.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The plaintiffs thereafter appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision. In their complaint, dated May 27,1998, the plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that the board had acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion \u201c[b]y failing to correctly interpret the zoning regulations applicable to the issues and applying them with reasonable discretion to the facts . . . .\u201d The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument and affirmed the board\u2019s decision. Before reaching the substantive issues on appeal, however, the court determined that the plaintiffs had filed a timely appeal with the board. Notwithstanding the defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiffs had appealed to the board well after the thirty day appeal period under \u00a7 8-7, the court found that the plaintiffs had timely appealed to the board from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision. Citing <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>241 Conn. 180, 695 A.2d 1040 (1997), the court reasoned that without actual or constructive notice of the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision, the prospective appellants\u2019 statutory right to appeal is meaningless. The court then concluded that because the plaintiffs did not receive actual or constructive notice of the issuance of the certificate until April, 1998, and the board treated the appeal as timely, the court also would treat the appeal to the board as timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The court further determined, inter alia, that the board had conducted a de novo hearing on whether the issuance of the certificate was contrary to the Branford zoning regulations, as the board interpreted them at the time the documents were issued. Implicit in the court\u2019s decision was the determination that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5.7 was reasonable. The court concluded that the board did not act illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of discretion when it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Section 8-7 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved . . . and shall be taken within such time as is prescribed by a rule adopted by said board, or, if no such rule is adopted by the board, within thirty days . . . .\u201d There is no indication in the record that the board has adopted a local rule and, therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 8-7, the plaintiffs were required to file their appeal within thirty days of the issuance of the certificate of zoning compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>Koepke v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 395, 398, 620 A.2d 811 (1993), rev\u2019d, 230 Conn. 452, 645 A.2d 983 (1994), we determined that an August 12, 1986 appeal to a board of appeals was untimely because the thirty day appeal period of \u00a7 8-7 began to run on July 11, 1986, the date on which the zoning enforcement officer issued the original zoning permit, and not on August 7, 1986, the date on which a superseding zoning permit was issued. We concluded that \u201cthe thirty day limit of \u00a7 8-7 is mandatory in nature and, thus, any appeal not taken within thirty days is invalid.\u201d Id.; <em>Pinchbeck </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>58 Conn. App. 74, 79, 751 A.2d 849 (2000); <em>Bosley </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>30 Conn. App. 797, 800, 622 A.2d 1020 (1993). In so deciding, we rejected the same reasoning the court gave in the present case, namely, that the thirty day period did not commence until the plaintiffs received actual or constructive notice of the issuance of the certificate. <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 400-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We noted in <em>Koepke </em>that the statutes specifically require local zoning authorities to provide notice under limited circumstances, including when a variance or special permit is granted or when a subdivision or resub-division is approved. Id., 401-402; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3c (b) (special permit or special exception) and 8-26 (approval of subdivision or resubdivision). \u201cWhile it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>is true that an aggrieved person has the right to take issue with the granting of a zoning permit, the legislature has not required that notice of the granting of a permit be given nor would it seem practical to give such notice for the literally thousands of such zoning and building permits that are issued on an almost daily basis across the state.\u201d <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 402. We further concluded that whether the appellant received actual or constructive notice is irrelevant because the time to appeal commences at the time of the issuance of the certificate of zoning compliance. Id., 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Our Supreme Court subsequently reversed our decision in <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>230 Conn. 452, 645 A.2d 983 (1994). The court concluded that the appeal to the board was timely filed because the thirty day period under \u00a7 8-7 began to run on August 7, 1986, the date of the issuance of the second zoning permit, and not, as we decided, on July 11, 1986, the date on which the original zoning permit was issued. Id., 456. Nevertheless, the court expressly declined to consider whether an appeal to a zoning board of appeals filed after the thirty day time limit prescribed by \u00a7 8-7 deprives the board of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Id., 455-56 &amp; 456 n.2. Thus, notwithstanding the subsequent reversal, our conclusion in <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 385, that an appeal of a zoning action must be taken within the thirty day period under \u00a7 8-7 is still valid law.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The plaintiffs argue, however, that in <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Par-rott, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 193, our Supreme Court explicitly \u201crejected the reasoning of Appellate Court cases holding that a failure of notice did not toll \u00a7 8-7\u2019s time limit to appeal.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Unlike the plaintiffs in the present case, who are appealing a decision of an administrative body, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>plaintiffs in <em>Loulis </em>were seeking injunctive relief outside of the administrative context. In <em>Loulis, </em>the plaintiffs sought an injunction barring the defendants from using a certain property as a package store in the town of Monroe. Id., 181. The plaintiffs argued that such use would violate the town\u2019s zoning regulations. Id. The plaintiffs\u2019 action was in response to the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance on May 4, 1994. <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>42 Conn. App. 272, 275, 679 A.2d 967 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 241 Conn. 180, 695 A.2d 1040 (1997). On that date, the planning administrator of the town of Monroe issued the certificate to the defendant Dean Parrott, the operator of a proposed liquor store on the property. Id., 274. The plaintiffs did not appeal from the issuance of the May, 1994 certificate to the zoning board of appeals, and instead commenced a declaratory judgment action. Id., 274-75. While the action was pending in the trial court, the town\u2019s zoning enforcement officer subsequently found that the proposed store complied with all zoning regulations and, on March 27, 1995, issued Parrott a permanent certificate of zoning compliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because they had failed to appeal from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s May, 1994 certificate decision to the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-6<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 8-7. <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 275. They subsequently filed a supplemental motion to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>appeal of the issuance of the March, 1995 certificate \u201cconstituted an adequate administrative remedy that deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the ground that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to the issuance of the March, 1995 certificate and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the action. Id., 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The plaintiffs appealed to this court from that decision, arguing that the trial court improperly found that they did not exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to the March, 1995 certificate. Id., 273. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court, but on a different ground. We held that \u201cthe action should have been dismissed on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to the May, 1994 certification.\u201d Id., 276-77. We reasoned that the plaintiffs could not maintain an action for equitable relief without first exhausting their administrative remedies. Id., 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The plaintiffs thereafter appealed to the Supreme Court from our decision, arguing that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable to an action for injunctive relief. <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 181-82. Our Supreme Court agreed and reversed our decision. The court reasoned that although \u201c[i]t is true that the legislature has not required notice to be given regarding an administrative action such as a zoning or building [permit,] [t]hat does not necessarily mean . . . that the legislature also intended to bar aggrieved persons from the courts based on their failure to exhaust an administrative remedy when they seek to challenge the issuance of a permit of which they had no notice.\u201d Id., 193-94. \u201cIndeed, it is only proper to allow such an aggrieved party to challenge the permit\u2019s validity in an appropriate judicial forum, given the lack of notice and consequent lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of meaningful opportunity to pursue an administrative appeal.\u201d Id., 194. Thus, although the failure to take an appeal from a zoning action within the thirty day period deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal, it does not deprive a party who has received no notice from seeking injunctive remedies. In short, <em>Loulis </em>is inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As discussed, the plaintiffs in the present case are appealing from a decision of an administrative body pursuant to \u00a7 8-7. Section 8-7 requires a person who is aggrieved by an action or decision of a local zoning enforcement officer to appeal from such action or decision to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals within thirty days of such action. Here, the zoning enforcement officer issued a certificate of zoning compliance to Simjian on August 26, 1997. The plaintiffs did not appeal from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision until April 7, 1998, well beyond the thirty day period for bringing such an appeal. We conclude, therefore, that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the certificate of zoning compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We further conclude that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal with respect to the building permits because the board lacks jurisdiction over the issuance of a building permit. The trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs cite no provision in the zoning regulations authorizing the [board] to reverse a decision by the Branford building official to renew a building permit. The [board] wisely confined itself to a review of the [zoning enforcement officer\u2019s] decision to issue a certificate of zoning compliance. Issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance is a prerequisite to the issuance of a building permit. Had the [board] reversed said decision by the [zoning enforcement officer], the plaintiffs would be free to pursue the implications of such decision on the building permit in another forum.\u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>towns have differing schemes of regulation. The zoning regulations of some towns specify a [board\u2019s] authority over a building official; in some towns, the functions of building inspector and zoning enforcement officer are vested in the same individual. Such was not the case in Branford at the time of the events giving rise to this appeal. The plaintiffs have failed to establish that the [board] had the authority to act on their appeal of the building official\u2019s decisions to grant or renew the said building permit.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">As the trial court properly recognized, the board\u2019s statutory authority is limited to zoning matters. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (a). Pursuant to \u00a7 29-266 (b), \u201c[w]hen a person other than such owner claims to be aggrieved by any decision of the building official, such person or his authorized agent may appeal, in writing, from the decision of the building official to the [building] board of appeals . . . .\u201d Rather than appealing from the building official\u2019s decision to the building board of appeals, the plaintiffs appealed to the board. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to link the building official\u2019s decision to issue or reissue the building permit to the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision to issue the certificate of zoning compliance, the record indicates that the building official issued such permits and not the zoning enforcement officer. Such actions by a town\u2019s building official shall be appealed to the town\u2019s building board of appeals in accordance with \u00a7 29-266. For those reasons, we conclude that the court properly determined that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Because the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the certificate of zoning compliance and also with respect to the reissuance of the building permit, the case should have been dismissed for such lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>The judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction of the zoning board of appeals for the town of Branford.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\"> Also named as defendants were Thomas Simjian, Branford town clerk Georgette A.
