He claims on appeal that the court improperly failed to find that his trial counsel was ineffective because (1) counsel made errors (a) in his cross-examination of a prosecution witness, (b) by failing to request a jury instruction and (c) by failing to take exception to two jury instructions, (2) counsel advised him to plead guilty to one of the charges against him and failed to object properly when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>evidence of the plea was introduced at trial, (3) counsel failed to raise the petitioner\u2019s drug dependency as a defense at trial and (4) a conflict of interest resulted from counsel\u2019s simultaneous representation of a code-fendant, which the trial court failed to inquire about. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The factual background of this case is set forth in <em>State v. Goodrum, </em>39 Conn. App. 526, 665 A.2d 159, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 929, 667 A.2d 554 (1995). Therein, on direct appeal, we upheld the petitioner\u2019s conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), possession of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (c) and five counts of violation of probation. Thereafter, the petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus. The court denied his petition in a memorandum of decision dated November 18, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In each of his claims before the court, the petitioner alleged that his trial counsel had, in some way, been ineffective. Our standard of review of a habeas court\u2019s judgment on ineffective assistance of counsel claims is well settled. \u201cIn a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 170, 172, 774 A.2d 148 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201cA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel .... In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court established that for a petitioner to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u2018that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of [the] conviction . . . .\u2019 That requires the petitioner to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Minnifield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 68, 70-71, 767 A.2d 1262, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 907, 772 A.2d 596 (2001); <em>see Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cThe first component of the <em>Strickland </em>test, generally referred to as the performance prong, requires that the petitioner show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. ... In <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that [jjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a [petitioner] to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. . . . [C]oun-sel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Minnifield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u201cEven if a petitioner shows that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the second prong, or prejudice prong, requires that the petitioner show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 72. Therefore, \u201c[a] habeas court deciding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim need not address the question of counsel\u2019s performance, if the claim may be disposed of on the ground of an insufficient showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>41 Conn. App. 515, 519, 677 A.2d 1 (1996), appeal dismissed, 240 Conn. 547, 692 A.2d 1231 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">With those standards in mind, we will examine each of the petitioner\u2019s claims in turn. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The petitioner first claims that his counsel made a number of errors at trial, each of which amounted to ineffective assistance pursuant to the standards of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The petitioner claims that his counsel was ineffective because, when cross-examining a state\u2019s witness, he elicited testimony unfavorable to the petitioner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">At trial, the state called Detective Thomas Trochio of the New Haven police department in its case-in-chief. Trochio testified that, while conducting surveillance at 265 Dixwell Avenue, he saw the petitioner enter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>building carrying a brown paper bag and that, when the petitioner exited the building, he no longer had the bag. The police subsequently entered the building, specifically, the apartment of the petitioner\u2019s brother within, and discovered a large amount of what was later determined to be cocaine and heroin. The drugs were in a brown paper bag bearing a McDonald\u2019s restaurant logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On cross-examination, the petitioner\u2019s counsel questioned Trochio about the specifics of the brown paper bag. In answering, Trochio testified that the bag he saw the petitioner carrying looked similar to the bag in which the drugs were found. Particularly, he testified that both bags had color on them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On redirect examination, Trochio added that the bags appeared to be the same size. Similarly, in response to another question from the petitioner\u2019s counsel, Trochio testified that rubber bands found at 265 Dixwell Avenue were of a similar type to those found at 377 Shelton Avenue, where the petitioner lived and was arrested. The petitioner claims that those questions evidence his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness because they had the effect of causing the jury to draw a connection between the petitioner and the drugs found at his brother\u2019s residence. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We think it clear that the state, in its direct examination of Trochio, elicited testimony implying that the witness saw a similarity between the bag held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>petitioner and the bag found at 265 Dixwell Avenue and, additionally, between the two sets of rubber bands. We note that it is likely that the jurors, presumably competent individuals, already appreciated the connections the state intended to draw between the various items before the petitioner\u2019s counsel began questioning the witness. Any reinforcement of the idea brought out on cross-examination was minimal or cumulative at best. Further, as we concluded in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, there was ample additional evidence before the jury that connected the petitioner to the drugs he was found to have possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The petitioner, therefore, has failed to show that the challenged line of questioning by his counsel prejudiced him in any way. Further, in that Trochio\u2019s answer also conveyed that he was unable to see the McDonald\u2019s logo on the bag carried by the petitioner, the testimony arguably was favorable to the petitioner. Keeping in mind that our standard of review requires us to indulge a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s questions were shaped by reasonable professional judgment, without the \u201cdistorting effects of hindsight,\u201d they easily could be considered \u201csound trial strategy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Minnifield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 71-72. As such, we cannot say that they amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree, therefore, with the court\u2019s judgment that the petitioner, in making his claim, failed to satisfy either prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The petitioner also claims that his counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on exclusive possession of the drugs at issue pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624,490 A.2d 75 (1985). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The drugs that the petitioner was convicted of possessing were not found on his person. As a consequence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the state had to establish at trial that he constructively possessed the drugs. Further, the drugs were found in a location to which both the petitioner and other people had access. Our Supreme Court in <em>Alfonso </em>\u201cestablished the principle that a jury may not infer possession of illegal drugs solely from a person\u2019s presence on premises where drugs are found, if the person is not in exclusive possession of such premises.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nes-mith, </em>220 Conn. 628, 635, 600 A.2d 780 (1991). \u201cWhere the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, \u2018it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 633. The petitioner claims ineffectiveness in his counsel's failure to request a jury charge explaining that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We addressed that issue in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal within the framework of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the issue was unpreserved at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held that the third prong of <em>Golding </em>was unsatisfied because \u201c[t]he trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>court gave a thorough definition of the terms \u2018possession\u2019 and \u2018constructive possession\u2019,\u201d and \u201cproperly informed the jurors that they could not find that the defendant possessed the narcotic substance unless they concluded that he \u2018knew of its presence, and that he exercised dominion and control over it\u2019.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodrum, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 542. We further held that the charge overall \u201cgave the jury \u2018a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged and the proper guidance to determine if those elements were present.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Had the petitioner\u2019s counsel requested the exclusive possession charge and the court refused to give it, we would have employed the well settled standard of review on direct appeal to assess whether the charge that was given was adequate. \u201cWhen reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the juiy in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . [this court] will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>61 Conn. App. 496, 507, 765 A.2d 14 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the charge as a whole, the instructions need not be perfect, as long as they are legally correct, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the jury\u2019s guidance. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered in its entirety, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 507-508. \u201c[I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>dard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 119-20, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">If we had more explicitly applied the previously discussed standard to the charge given to the jury in this case, we would have arrived at the same result. Because, as we found in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, there was ample additional testimonial and circumstantial evidence connecting him to the drugs, it is not reasonably possible that the jury found the element of possession satisfied solely because the petitioner had been present at the location where the drugs were found. The petitioner has not demonstrated that injustice resulted from the lack of an exclusive possession charge and that he was, consequently, prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request the desired charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We agree, therefore, with the court that the petitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because of the failure of counsel to request a specific charge on exclusive possession of the drugs at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Last, the petitioner claims that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to take exception to two jury instructions requested by the state. See footnote 3. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The petitioner claims that his counsel was ineffective in failing to except to the court\u2019s giving of a Secondino<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, the petitioner\u2019s counsel introduced evidence that suggested that the petitioner, at the time he was being watched by the police, was at 265 Dixwell Avenue to visit his son, rather than at his brother\u2019s apartment where the drugs were found. The petitioner\u2019s son apparently lived in a different unit within the same building. It was determined at the close of evidence that the petitioner\u2019s son had been present in the courtroom during the trial. The petitioner\u2019s counsel, however, declined to call him as a witness. As a result, the state requested and the court agreed to give a <em>Secondino </em>charge. The petitioner\u2019s counsel did not except to that charge. Accordingly, in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, we limited our review of whether the charge was improper to a search for plain error and found that none existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The habeas court held that had the issue been properly preserved and considered by this court in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, it would not have resulted in a reversal of the judgment of conviction. In other words, the petitioner failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s actions, as required under the second prong of <em>Strickland. </em>We agree with the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The prerequisites to the giving of <em>a Secondino </em>instruction are twofold. First, it must be shown that the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>who declined to call the witness was in fact able to procure that witness\u2019 physical presence in court, i.e., the witness was available. Second, under the facts of the case, it must be shown that the witness was one whom that party naturally would be expected to have testify. <em>State v. Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 140, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988); 1 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 65 (b). Here, the parties do not dispute that the petitioner\u2019s son was present in court and, therefore, was available to testify. Further, insofar as the petitioner was claiming that he had been at 265 Dixwell Avenue to visit his son and had not been at his brother\u2019s apartment where the drugs were seized, it naturally was expected that he would have called his son to the witness stand to verify the visit. The court\u2019s instruction, therefore, was proper and would have been upheld on appeal had the petitioner\u2019s counsel taken exception to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The petitioner also claims error in his counsel\u2019s failure to except to the court\u2019s charge to the jury on consciousness of guilt. See footnote 3. When the petitioner was arrested, he had $307 on his person. The police asked him how much money he had, and the petitioner stated that it was only $30 or $40. At trial, the state introduced testimony regarding that exchange. The court gave the jury an instruction on consciousness of guilt, directing the jurors as to how they might interpret the petitioner\u2019s false statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As part of the charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the court used the phrase, \u201cguilty connection,\u201d a phrase that the petitioner claims would have been reversible error had he preserved it for appellate review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The habeas court held that had the issue properly been preserved and considered by this court in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, it would not have resulted in a reversal of the judgment of conviction. As with the <em>Secondino </em>charge, the petitioner failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to except to the charge. We agree with the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The petitioner cites no case law in support of the proposition that the court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cguilty connection\u201d in a consciousness of guilt instruction is an error mandating automatic reversal of a judgment of conviction. In fact, our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 635 A.2d 762 (1993), rejected that very claim. After stating the well established principle that jury instructions are to be considered in their entirety rather than be critically dissected, the court in <em>Francis </em>held that \u201cthe instruction as a whole identified a permissive inference of consciousness of guilt that the jury might draw from the defendant\u2019s false statement, an item of circumstantial evidence,\u201d rather than a forced conclusion. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 133; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 289, 623 A.2d 42 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Here, as in <em>Francis, </em>the court\u2019s charge was otherwise \u201cthorough and proper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 133. As with the instruction challenged in <em>Adams, </em>\u201cthe language \u2018guilty connection\u2019 did not mandate that the jury find that the facts about which the defendant had made the false statements were conclusively established. Rather, the instruction as a whole identified a permissive inference of consciousness of guilt that the jury might draw from the defendant\u2019s false statement, an item of circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 289. The petitioner makes no attempt to distinguish those cases and to show how his claim would have fared differently on appeal. We therefore agree with the habeas court that the petitioner has failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to take exception to the trial court\u2019s consciousness of guilt charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The petitioner next claims that he was denied effective assistance when his counsel advised him to plead guilty before trial to the count of possession of marijuana in violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (c), with the understanding that the marijuana would not be introduced into evidence at trial. Further, he claims counsel was ineffective for failing to state the basis of his objection when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the marijuana subsequently was introduced into evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">When searching the residence at 377 Shelton Avenue, where the petitioner was arrested, the police found more than $1550, a jacket similar to one the petitioner was seen wearing earlier in the day at 265 Dixwell Avenue, six packets of marijuana, and a tray containing marijuana residue and seeds. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodrum, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 530. Before trial on the charges of which he was convicted, the petitioner agreed to plead guilty to possession of marijuana. When accepting his plea of guilty on the marijuana charge, the court canvassed the petitioner and advised him of the consequences of the plea, including that it could, subsequently, be admitted into evidence against him. The petitioner, in response, indicated that he understood. At trial, the marijuana was admitted into evidence without the petitioner\u2019s counsel objecting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The petitioner now claims that he agreed to the plea on the incompetent advice of counsel. Particularly, he complains that the seized marijuana was introduced into evidence at his trial when he believed that, because of the plea, it would not be introduced. He argues that the admission of the marijuana changed the outcome of his trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">To prevail on his claim, the petitioner must demonstrate prejudice. He must show that he would not have pleaded guilty on the marijuana charge but for the advice of counsel, that the evidence of the seized marijuana would have been ruled inadmissible at trial but for counsel\u2019s actions and that the admission of the evidence changed the outcome of the trial. That he has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>First, the petitioner cannot show that, but for his counsel\u2019s assurance that the marijuana would be inadmissible at trial, he would not have agreed to the guilty plea on the marijuana charge. That is because the court, when accepting the plea, clearly conveyed to him the fact that evidence of his guilty plea could be admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Second, even if the petitioner\u2019s counsel had raised a specific objection, the evidence regarding his possession of the marijuana still would have been admissible at trial. Evidence of other misconduct, as a general rule, is not admissible to show that a criminal defendant likely is guilty of the charges for which he is being tried. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 15, 526 A.2d 1311, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 955, 108 S. Ct. 348, 98 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1987). Such evidence, \u201chowever, may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as <em>intent, </em>identity, malice, <em>motive </em>or a system of criminal activity.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cSuch evidence is admissible if the trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, determines that its probative value, for one or more of the purposes for which it is admissible, outweighs its prejudicial impact on the accused.\u201d Id. Here, the trial court properly allowed the state to introduce evidence of the marijuana to establish that the petitioner intended to run a drug operation from 265 Dixwell Avenue and 377 Shelton Avenue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Last, as we held in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, much other evidence was introduced at trial to prove the petitioner\u2019s guilt, including the testimony of police and the petitioner\u2019s brother, and the petitioner\u2019s connections to various items seized at 265 Dixwell Avenue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Therefore, we cannot say that the marijuana was a decisive factor in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The evidence concerning the marijuana likely would have been admissible irrespective of whether the petitioner had pleaded not guilty or whether a proper objection had been advanced. Additionally, even if it were not admitted, there remained ample other evidence to support the petitioner\u2019s conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell. Therefore, the court correctly determined that the petitioner failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s actions, as required by the second prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The petitioner next claims that the court improperly failed to find that his counsel was ineffective in failing to advance the petitioner\u2019s drug dependency as a defense at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The petitioner was convicted of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Drug dependency is an affirmative defense to a charged violation under that statute. Thus, a drug-dependent defendant may be exempt from liability under \u00a7 2 la-278 if he or she proves that dependency by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 607-11, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). A person exempt from liability under \u00a7 21a-278 by virtue of drug dependency still may be held liable under \u00a7 21a-277, which proscribes similar conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cThe difference between these statutes is not in their elements but in the potential mandatory minimum sentence provision of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). If the defendant does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is drug-dependent, he is subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), whereas, if he proves that he is drug-dependent, the mandatory minimum sentence does not apply.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>54 Conn. App. 580, 585, 738 A.2d 195 (1999). \u201cThe design and effect of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is to punish persons who are not drug-dependent and sell narcotics more severely than drug-dependent persons who sell narcotics.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>53 Conn. App. 661, 666, 733 A.2d 856, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 922, 738 A.2d 662 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The petitioner presented evidence to the habeas court that tended to show that he has been drug-dependent for many years and that he had communicated as much to his counsel. He claimed, therefore, that his counsel was ineffective in failing to put forth his drug dependency as a defense at trial. The habeas court found that, in regard to that claim, the petitioner had failed to satisfy both prongs of <em>Strickland. </em>The court apparently was persuaded by testimony suggesting that counsel\u2019s choice not to pursue a drug dependency defense was a reasonable tactical decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">A defendant facing a charge, pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278, of possession with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent may pursue different strategies on defense. He may, as did the petitioner, argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>element of possession was unproven. He may, alternatively or additionally, present evidence of his drug dependency which, if proven, may be rebutted by the state. If the defense is successful to the extent that the state fails to prove the element of possession, the defendant will be fully acquitted. A defendant who fails to negate the state\u2019s proof on the element of possession, but who puts forth unrebutted evidence of his own drug dependency, still may be subject to conviction under \u00a7 21a-277, a lesser offense included within \u00a7 21a-278. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>60 Conn. App. 534, 545, 760 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 921, 763 A.2d 1042 (2000). If the state proves possession and the defendant fails to prove drug dependency, the defendant faces conviction under \u00a7 21a-278.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Faced with those alternative possible outcomes, it is not unreasonable for counsel to choose to defend only on the element of possession, risking a mandatory minimum sentence, but with the aim of full acquittal. Moreover, pursuing both defenses simultaneously is a risky approach when the defendant is being tried before a jury in that there is some degree of inconsistency in acknowledging one\u2019s dependency on drugs but denying having engaged in sales to support that dependency. The risk is that a jury perceiving inconsistency in various defense theories may, as a result, find the entire defense case incredible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 764-65, 719 A.2d 440 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">At the time of his arrest, the petitioner was living at 377 Shelton Avenue with his girlfriend, Ford. The police also arrested Ford and charged her with possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to sell narcotics. The petitioner and Ford retained the same counsel to represent them in their respective cases. The petitioner went to trial first. Counsel obtained continuances on Ford\u2019s case and expended no other efforts on her behalf, since he believed that the state would not pursue the charges against her. At trial, the petitioner called Ford as his first witness. The court, noticing that her attorney of record was also the petitioner\u2019s attorney, called the situation \u201cintolerable\u201d and immediately appointed a special public defender to represent her.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Pursuant to the state<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and federal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> constitutions, \u201ca criminal defendant is entitled to be represented by an attorney free from conflicts of interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 417, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). The test for an alleged conflict of interest differs from that for ineffective assistance claims generally. \u201cIn a case of a claimed [actual] conflict of interest ... in order to establish a violation of [his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>constitutional rights], the [petitioner] has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 689, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S.

Ed. 2d 909 (1999), citing <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u201cCases involving conflicts of interest usually arise in the context of representation of multiple codefendants by one attorney where the attorney adduces evidence or advances arguments on behalf of one defendant that are damaging to the interests of the other defendant. ... A conflict of interest also arises if trial counsel simultaneously represents the defendant and another individual associated with the incident and that representation inhibits counsel's ability to represent the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>41 Conn. App. 809, 812, 678 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 908, 682 A.2d 1008 (1996). \u201c[0]ne of the principal safeguards of [the right to conflict free representation] is the rule announced by [our Supreme Court] that \u2018 [a trial] court must explore the possibility of conflict . . . when it knows or reasonably should know of a conflict ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 79, 513 A.2d 116 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">When the matter of the dual representation by counsel of both the petitioner and Ford was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, it conducted an immediate inquiry and appointed a special public defender to represent Ford. Her testimony at the hearing revealed that, although counsel had been retained to represent both Ford and the petitioner, she in fact had never spoken with counsel and had been present only when he conversed with the petitioner. Counsel had requested continuances of her case on her behalf and nothing more. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Ford never discussed her case or the petitioner\u2019s case with counsel prior to the appointment of the special public defender to represent her. Her special public defender advised her not to testify, and the court advised her regarding her fifth amendment right not to incriminate herself. Nevertheless, she chose to testify and her testimony was very favorable to the petitioner. Ford\u2019s case subsequently was nolled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u201cWe have had occasion to point out the caution from the United States Supreme Court that the <em>possibility </em>of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. . . . <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>[446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980)]. To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, the petitioner must be able to point to <em>specific instances </em>in the record which suggest impairment or compromise of his interests for the benefit of another party.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>53 Conn. App. 678, 689, 736 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 920, 738 A.2d 663 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The petitioner in his brief only speculates as to the possibility that his counsel compromised his interest for Ford\u2019s benefit. He argues that counsel would have pursued a drug dependency defense if he were not worried about incriminating Ford, but points to no evidence in the record in support of that assertion. As discussed in part III, counsel\u2019s choice in that regard reflects a reasonable trial strategy. The petitioner also contends that had there been no conflict, counsel would have \u201cquestioned] . . . Ford\u2019s involvement\u201d to prevent the petitioner from being \u201cset up as the bad guy.\u201d There is no indication in the record, however, that Ford was involved in the drug operation in any way. As pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>viously mentioned, her case subsequently was nolled. Furthermore, because separate counsel was appointed for Ford prior to her taking the witness stand to testify, the petitioner\u2019s counsel was free to question her in any manner he saw fit. As such, the petitioner has not demonstrated a violation of his right to counsel predicated on an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> The testimony at issue was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u201cQ.

Certain conduct of a person may be considered by you to show a guilty knowledge or consciousness of guilt. When a person is on trial for a criminal offense it is proper to show his conduct as well as any declarations made by him subsequent to the alleged criminal offense which may fairly have been influenced by that act.
