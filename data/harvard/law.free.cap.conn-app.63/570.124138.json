We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The commissioner held a formal hearing on the plaintiffs claim for heart and hypertension benefits provided by \u00a7 7-433c and made findings that may be briefly recited. The plaintiff began his career as a firefighter in June, 1970. Prior to being hired as a firefighter by the defendant, the plaintiff underwent a preemployment medical examination that did not reveal any evidence of hypertension. For approximately nineteen years prior to May 4, 1989, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a uniformed firefighter. On that date, he was serving as the commanding officer at the Woodward Avenue firehouse in New Haven when he experienced some dizziness, light-headedness and nausea at the firehouse. An emergency medical response unit was stationed at that firehouse, and a paramedic assigned to that unit responded to the plaintiffs request for assistance. The paramedic tested the plaintiffs blood pressure and obtained a reading of 184 over 124. He then called for the fire department\u2019s emergency one unit so that the plaintiff could be transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital. The paramedic assigned to the emergency one unit remained in contact with the medical staff at that hospital while the plaintiff was being transported there. At the hospital, the plaintiff underwent a series of tests. The hospital released the plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>submitted its bill of $215.15 for services on May 4,1989, which the defendant, as the employer, was obligated to pay. The plaintiff did not work on May 5 or 6, and he was not scheduled to work on May 7, 8, 9 or 10, 1989. On May 11, 1989, he filed a first report of injury for high blood pressure with the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation division. Such a report is required by General Statutes \u00a7 31-294b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The controller\u2019s office for the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation division completed an accident investigation form concerning the May 4, 1989 incident, which stated that the plaintiff was treated by a physician for high blood pressure on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Michael Parker, the plaintiffs primary care physician, indicated that in January, 1992, the plaintiff had mild borderline hypertension. In October, 1994, Parker began treating the plaintiffs hypertension with medication and has continued to do so. On June 26, 1996, the plaintiff filed a standard form for notice of a claim for compensation (form 30C) in which he stated that, while in the employ of the defendant\u2019s fire service in May, 1989, he sustained injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment, and described his injuries as \u201cmedication, hypertension 7-433c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Generally, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are not recoverable \u201cunless a written notice of a claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident . . . which caused the personal injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., however, provides an exception to that rule. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 31-294c provides that a \u201c[fjailure to provide a notice of claim under subsection (a) of this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>shall not bar maintenance of the proceedings if . . . within the applicable period an employee has been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care as provided in section 31-294d. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe employer, as soon as he has knowledge of an injury, shall provide a competent physician or surgeon to attend the injured employee and, in addition, shall furnish any medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service, including medical rehabilitation services, as the physician or surgeon deems reasonable or necessary. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The commissioner concluded that the defendant had notice of the plaintiffs high blood pressure incident on May 4, 1989, through the investigative report that was prepared by the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation division for the defendant\u2019s controller\u2019s office. The commissioner also relied on the fact that the plaintiff \u201cwas transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital in a city emergency unit staffed with New Haven fire department paramedics who were in contact with hospital personnel so that the [plaintiffs] condition could be monitored on the way to the hospital.\u201d Accordingly, the commissioner awarded benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The defendant does not dispute the commissioner\u2019s finding that it had notice of the plaintiffs high blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>pressure incident on May 4, 1989, but maintains that notice of high blood pressure, even such an abnormal reading as the plaintiffs, is not equivalent to notice of hypertension, which it did not receive until the plaintiff filed a form 30C on June 26, 1996, describing his injury as \u201cmedication, hypertension 7-433C.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, however, defines \u201chypertension\u201d as abnormally high arterial blood pressure. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Neither party has referred to any medical evidence submitted at the hearing before the commissioner that might elucidate the relationship between high blood pressure and hypertension. In January, 1992, Parker found that the plaintiff had mild borderline hypertension, but the doctor did not begin treating the plaintiff for hypertension with medication until October, 1994. The plaintiff filed his Form 30C, notifying the defendant of his hypertension on June 26, 1996, less than two years after beginning his treatment for hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On appeal to the board, the board affirmed the decision of the commissioner to award the plaintiff benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. The board recognized, as this court has held, that \u201c[a] claimant for workers\u2019 compensation benefits must provide both notice of injury; General Statutes \u00a7 31-294b . . . and notice of a claim. General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Funaioli </em>v. <em>New London, </em>52 Conn. App. 194, 195, 726 A.2d 626 (1999) (first report of injury together with letter from claimant\u2019s lawyer stating that claimant not requesting hearing \u201cat this time\u201d sufficient to satisfy notice of claim requirement of \u00a7 31-294c). \u201c[T]he written notice intended is one which will reasonably inform the employer that the employee is claiming or proposes to claim compensation under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act.\u201d <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corp., </em>118 Conn. 315, 317, 172 A. 353 (1934); <em>Black </em>v. <em>London &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Egazarian Associates, Inc., </em>30 Conn. App. 295, 303, 620 A.2d 176, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 916, 623 A.2d 1024 (1993). \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 31-294 [notice of injury and of claim for compensation], in particular, is to alert the employer to the fact that a person has sustained an injury that may be compensable . . . and that such person is claiming or proposes to claim compensation under the Act.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Black </em>v. <em>London &amp; Egazarian Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The board concluded, and we agree, that, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, the notice provided by the [plaintiff] constituted \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 with the notice content requirements of \u00a7 31-294c.\u201d On May 11, 1989, upon returning to work after the May 4, 1989 incident, the plaintiff filed a first report of injury for high blood pressure -with the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation division. Furthermore, following the incident, the defendant\u2019s fire department completed an accident investigation form that indicated that the plaintiff had been transported to the hospital for high blood pressure. The board stated that \u201c[t]he employer\u2019s investigation form amply supports the conclusion that the employer had notice of the [plaintiff\u2019s] high blood pressure incident on May 4,1989, and, because the [plaintiff] was a uniformed firefighter who had passed his preem-ployment physical, the employer was thus on notice that he could file a hypertension claim under \u00a7 7-433c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The board also concluded that in addition to having notice pursuant to \u00a7 31-294c (a), the defendant had notice of the plaintiffs injury pursuant to the \u00a7 31-294c (c) exception, which does not bar a claim for benefits in the absence of written notice where \u201can employee has been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (c). The exception in \u00a7 31-294c (c) to the notice requirement \u201cis, no doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>based upon the fact that if the employer furnishes medical treatment he must know that an injuiy has been suffered which at least may be the basis of such a claim.\u201d <em>Gesmundo </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>133 Conn. 607, 612, 53 A.2d 392 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In its brief to this court, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs transportation to the hospital by the defendant\u2019s ambulance service, which was staffed by the defendant\u2019s emergency medical technicians, who monitored the plaintiffs blood pressure and also remained in contact with the hospital until the ambulance arrived there, does not constitute providing \u201ca competent physician or surgeon to attend the injured employee\u201d or furnishing \u201cany medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service ... as the physician or surgeon deems reasonable or necessary\u201d as required by \u00a7 31-294d. We agree with the commissioner and the board that the defendant had notice of the blood pressure incident because the plaintiff was transported to the hospital in an ambulance staffed with the defendant\u2019s fire department par amedics, who monitored his condition on the way to the hospital, and through the investigative report of the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation division. Whether or not the ride in the ambulance while attended by paramedics qualifies as a medical service, the commissioner also found that the plaintiff underwent a series of tests at the hospital for which the hospital submitted a bill of $215.15, an obligation of the defendant. It can hardly be disputed that the tests performed by the hospital were medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We agree with the conclusion of the majority of the board that the exception to the requirement of \u00a7 31-294c (a) that a written notice of claim for compensation be given within one year from the date of the accident that caused the personal injury created by \u00a7 31-294c (c) is applicable because the defendant, immediately after the accident, furnished the plaintiff with medical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>hospital care, as provided in \u00a7 31-294d. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board upholding the commissioner\u2019s award of benefits to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\"> The defendant city\u2019s insurer, the other defendant in this action, is not involved in this appeal.
