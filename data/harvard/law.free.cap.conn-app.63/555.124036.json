On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury, (2) excluded evidence and (3) failed to grant their motion to set aside the verdict. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 7, 1996, Richard Opotzner and the defendant Wayne Bass<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were each operating motor vehicles in a southerly direction on Pershing Drive in Anso-nia. Opotzner stopped his vehicle and waited for an opportunity to turn left. At that moment, Bass\u2019 vehicle struck Opotzner\u2019s vehicle from behind. The accident was relatively minor. Opotzner reported the accident and told a police officer that he was not injured. More than two weeks later, Opotzner sought medical treatment for neck, leg and arm pain that he claimed was caused by the accident. Opotzner worked and received treatment for pain for several months following the accident. In September, 1996, one of Opotzner\u2019s physicians performed surgery in an attempt to relieve Opot-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>zner\u2019s pain. Opotzner claimed that the surgery was relatively unsuccessful and he did not return to work. Opotzner eventually claimed that, as a result of the accident, he suffered from a variety of ailments, including traumatic brain injury, chronic pain and depression. The defendants claimed that Opotzner had preexisting medical conditions that could have caused his chronic pain and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The primary issue of contention during the trial was whether the alleged injuries were caused by the accident. The jury found that they were and awarded the plaintiffs $5400 in damages. Other facts will be discussed where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding (1) whether adverse inferences could be drawn from the plaintiffs\u2019 introduction of medical reports as evidence of causation rather than medical testimony, (2) the burden of proof for future pain and physical impairment, (3) the credibility of the witnesses and (4) comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u201cOur standard of review concerning claims of instructional error is well settled. [Jjury instructions must be read as a whole and . . . are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jurors in guiding them to a proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . The instruction must be adapted to the issues and may not mislead the jury but should reasonably guide it in reaching a verdict. . . . We must review the charge as a whole to determine whether it was correct in law and sufficiently guided the jury on the issues presented at trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">\u201cOur standard of review on this claim is whether it is reasonably [possible] that the jury was misled. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the <em>jury in </em>such a way th\u00e1t injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Therefore, jury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect, or technically accurate. Nonetheless, the trial court must correctly adapt the law to the case in question and must provide the jury with sufficient guidance in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>55 Conn. App. 801, 804-805, 740 A.2d 909 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 918, 744 A.2d 438 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it could not draw adverse inferences from the plaintiffs\u2019 introduction of medical reports as evidence of causation in lieu of medical testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The following additional facts are necessaiy for our resolution of this claim. In support of their position that the accident caused Opotzner\u2019s injuries, the plaintiffs introduced medical reports. The physicians who authored the reports did not testify. After the trial, the plaintiffs submitted a request to charge the jury that (1) the use of the medical reports as opposed to live testimony was allowed by statute and (2) adverse inferences could not be drawn against the plaintiffs because the physicians that authored the reports did not testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>In its charge to the jury, the court addressed whether inferences could be drawn because a party introduced reports in lieu of live testimony: \u201cA number of reports and records, and written and documentary kinds of exhibits will be presented, they\u2019ve been entered into evidence and you will have them with you in deliberations. Now, those should be evaluated by you with the same principles in mind. An exhibit or a report or a record should neither be especially believed, nor especially disbelieved merely because it is a report or an exhibit as opposed to oral testimony. There should be no inferences made for or against a party merely because reports are offered. And I\u2019d add in that context that it is perfectly permissible to read from exhibits as has been done during the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Applying our standard of review, we conclude that when read as a whole, the court\u2019s charge was correct in law and it was sufficient to guide the jury regarding the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 use of medical reports in lieu of live testimony. More specifically, the charge complied with the provisions of \u00a7 52-174 (b) in that it instructed the jury that \u201cno inferences [could be] made for or against a party merely because reports are offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The plaintiffs, however, argue that their proposed charge should have been given because the court\u2019s charge did not instruct the jury that (1) the use of medical reports in lieu of medical testimony is permitted pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b) and (2) no adverse inferences could be drawn from the plaintiffs introduction of <em>medical reports </em>concerning causation rather than live medical testimony. \u201c[A] refusal to charge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Stanback, </em>36 Conn. App. 328, 332, 650 A.2d 920 (1994). Here, the substance of the requested charge was given because the court instructed the jury that no inferences could be drawn against aparty \u201cmerely because reports [were] offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly instructed the jury on the burden of proof for future noneconomic damages and that the juiy was misled by the instruction. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court improperly instructed the jury that future noneconomic damages needed to be proven by a reasonable certainty rather than by a reasonable probability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. The plaintiffs submitted a request to charge the jury for noneconomic damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During its charge, the court instructed the jury that for it to give an award for future damages it \u201cmust be satisfied with a <em>reasonable degree of certainty </em>that the results for which [it was] attempting to compensate [Opotzner] are <em>reasonably probable.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>other parts of the charge, however, the court instructed the jury that the burden of proof for future noneconomic damages was a reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the court\u2019s use of the phrase reasonable degree of certainty in its instruction for future noneconomic damages was improper. See <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>185 Conn. 390, 395, 440 A.2d 952 (1981) (burden of proof for future noneconomic damages is reasonable probability). We conclude, however, that the court\u2019s use of the phrase did not mislead the jury. \u201c[J]ury instructions must be read as a whole and . . . are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 804. When giving a lengthy jury instruction, the court may have a slip of the tongue. <em>Thames River Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>50 Conn. App. 767, 787, 720 A.2d 242 (1998), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Delosantos, </em>13 Conn. App. 386, 391, 536 A.2d 609 (1988). The improper instruction is, however, \u201charmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thames River Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>supra, 787 (improper instruction harmless where court once incorrectly stated law of negligence and unfair trade practices but twice stated law correctly); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Delosantos, </em>supra, 391. Here, the court cited an improper standard in one part of its charge. The court also repeatedly cited the proper standard during the rest of its charge. Examining the charge as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. The court\u2019s improper charge was, therefore, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The plaintiffs also claim that the court improperly charged the jury regarding the credibility of witnesses. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court improperly instructed the jury that if it found that a witness intentionally or wilfully lied about a fact, it could choose to disregard all of that witness\u2019 testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In its charge, the court instructed the jury that it was the jury\u2019s function to determine \u201c[t]he credibility of [the] witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony . . . .\u201d The court also instructed the juiy that if it concluded that \u201ca witness has not only testified falsely, but has done so intentionally or wilfully, this fact casts a serious doubt on all testimony and you may, but don\u2019t have to, conclude that you cannot accept any of the testimony. . . . And even if you should find that someone gave false testimony as to some matters, you may find that as to other matters the testimony was worthy of acceptance by you. It\u2019s a matter for, you should regard all the testimony of a witness and believe those parts of it which you think in your exercise of judgment and discretion you should believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Connecticut recognizes the maxim \u201cfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\u201d as a permissive instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Raia </em>v. <em>Topehius, </em>165 Conn. 231, 234-35, 332 A.2d 93 (1973). The plaintiffs argue that where, as is the case here, the instruction is given, the jury must be instructed that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>can disregard all of a witness\u2019 testimony only if that witness has testified falsely as to a <em>material </em>issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus instruction simply \u201cdeals with the weight and credibility of testimony .... It serves as an aid to the jury in weighing and sifting the evidence. ... It has long been an established legal principle in this state that the trier of fact has the right to accept part and disregard part of the testimony of a witness. . . . [I]t is for the jury as the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses and what testimony they believe and what they consider is unworthy of credence. The approved instruction on the maxim, in its permissive form, is at best merely advisory. . . . Under the proper instruction the jury may or may not, as they see fit, reject all the testimony of the witness, and act on their own judgment as to the value and credibility of the testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 235-36. Under a general instruction concerning the credibility of the witnesses, however, the jury is also instructed that it may or may not, in its judgment, reject all of a witness\u2019 testimony. See id., 236. \u201cInstruction on the maxim is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Here, the court advised the jury that if it found that a witness \u201cgave false testimony . . . you should . . . believe those parts of it which you think in your exercise of judgment and discretion you should believe.\u201d The court\u2019s instruction was not an incorrect statement of the law, as \u201cit is well established that the evaluation of a witness\u2019 testimony and credibility is wholly within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Szczerkowski </em>v. <em>Karmelowicz, </em>60 Conn. App. 429, 434, 759 A.2d 1050 (2000). Furthermore, the court has broad discretion regarding the instruction on the falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus maxim. <em>Raia </em>v. <em>Topehius, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 236. Applying our standard of review, we conclude that the it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction regarding the credibility of the witnesses and false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim with respect to the court\u2019s charge is that the court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of comparative negligence. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury that any negligence on the part of Opotzner must have been the proximate cause of his injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The following facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. The plaintiffs submitted a request to charge the jury on the issue of comparative negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs requested that the court instruct the jury that to reduce the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, it must find that any comparative negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>gence on the part of Opotzner was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of his injuries. In its instructions on comparative negligence, the court did not use the phrase proximate cause. Instead, the court used the phrase \u201csubstantial factor\u201d to describe the standard of causation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our Supreme Court \u201chas defined proximate cause <em>as [a]n actual cause </em>that is a <em>substantial factor </em>in the resulting harm . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 606, 662 A.2d 753 (1995); see also <em>Paige </em>v. <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>250 Conn. 14, 25, 734 A.2d 85 (1999) (test of proximate cause is whether defendant\u2019s conduct is substantial factor in bringing about plaintiffs injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Here, the court instructed the jury that it must determine whether Opotzner\u2019s \u201cnegligence was a substantial factor\u201d in bringing about the accident and his resulting injuries. \u201cThat the court did not adopt the [plaintiffs\u2019] requests verbatim does not afford a ground for reversal so long as the jury [was] adequately apprised of the relevant issues.\u201d <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 394. Proximate cause is \u201c \u2018[a]n actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm . . . <em>Stewart v. Federated Dept. Stores, </em>Inc., supra, 234 Conn. 606. The court\u2019s instruction was, therefore, sufficient to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict. See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court abused its discretion by improperly redacting portions of a medical report from evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. In January, 1997, the plaintiffs disclosed that they intended to call Joel S. Zaretzky, the plaintiffs\u2019 family physician, as an expert witness. At the time of the disclosure, Zaretzky was to offer his opinion regarding Opotzner\u2019s neck and arm pain, back pain, and muscle, ligament and joint injuries. Evidence was scheduled to begin in the trial on January 11, 1999. Zaretzky drafted a report dated January 6, 1999, and addressed it to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The report included, inter alia, Zaretzky\u2019s opinion that Opotzner suffered from a traumatic brain injury, chronic pain and depression. The report also stated that there was a causal relationship between the accident and Opotzner\u2019s medical conditions. On January 7, 1999, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disclosed the report to counsel for the defendants. On January 11, 1999, the defendant Ford Motor Credit Company (Ford) filed a motion in limine to preclude the report from evidence on the grounds that the report was not filed in a timely manner in violation of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 13-4 (4)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 13-15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ford argued that it would be prejudiced by the introduction of the report at such a late date because there was no opportunity to depose Zaretzky and because Zaretzky would not be subject to cross-examination. The court denied Ford\u2019s motion and allowed the report to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>admitted. The court did, however, redact portions of the report in which Zaretzky offered his opinion rather than facts and those portions of the report that were more prejudicial than probative. Specifically, the court redacted Zaretzky\u2019s opinion that Opotzner suffered from a traumatic brain injury, that he was suicidal and that he was a broken man.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Our standard of review is well established. \u201cGenerally, evidence is admissible to prove a material fact that is relevant to the cause of action alleged by the plaintiff. ... It is a well established principle of law that the trial court may exercise its discretion with regard to evidentiary rulings, and the trial court\u2019s rulings will not be disturbed on appellate review absent abuse of that discretion. . . . Sound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law .... And [it] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter .... In our review of these discretionary determinations, we make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>58 Conn. App. 96, 99-100, 752 A.2d 1127, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 906, 755 A.2d 884 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Not only was Zaretzky\u2019s report created and disclosed on the eve of trial, it contained new opinions regarding Opotzner\u2019s medical conditions. The court exercised its discretion and redacted those portions of the report in which Zaretzky offered his opinions and those portions of the report that were more prejudicial than probative. In making discretionary evidentiary rulings, the court is charged with doing what is \u201cright and equitable under the circumstances and the law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 100. If the court had admitted the entire report on the eve of trial, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>would have been prejudiced because they did not have an opportunity to depose Zaretzky regarding his opinions. We, therefore, conclude that under the circumstances of the case the court did not abuse its discretion by redacting portions of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the court improperly denied their motion to set aside the verdict because the jury could not reasonably have found that the plaintiffs were entitled to only $5400 in damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Our standard of review of the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside the verdict is clear. We review the court\u2019s decision under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Card v. State, </em>57 Conn. App. 134, 138, 747 A.2d 32 (2000). More specifically, we \u201cconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, according particular weight to the congruence of the judgment of the trial judge and the jury, who saw the witnesses and heard their testimony. . . . The verdict will be set aside and judgment directed only if we find that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached their conclusion. . . . While it is the jury\u2019s right to draw logical deductions and make reasonable inferences from the facts proven ... it may not resort to mere conjecture and speculation. ... If the evidence would not reasonably support a finding of the particular issue, the trial court has a duty not to submit it to the jury. . . . <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>45 Conn. App. 686, 691, 697 A.2d 1162 (1997).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sandella </em>v. <em>Dick Corp., </em>53 Conn. App. 213, 218-19, 729 A.2d 813, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 926, 733 A.2d 849 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Much of the dispute at trial centered on whether the accident caused Opotzner\u2019s injuries. The plaintiffs introduced evidence, which if believed, could have supported a substantial damages award. The defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>however, countered with evidence that tended to show that the accident was relatively minor, that Opotzner was not injured in the accident, that his claimed injuries were actually caused by preexisting medical conditions and that the accident did little to exacerbate those conditions. Where an issue is disputed, it is the jury\u2019s job to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of conflicting testimony. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 58, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). After a review of the evidence, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to only $5400 in damages. The court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> The plaintiffs are husband and wife.

If you find that any negligence of Richard Opotzner was a condition and not a causal factor in bringing about his injuries, such negligence shall not bar Richard Opotzner\u2019s recovery.
