We reverse the judgment of conviction of attempt to commit assault in the first degree and remand the case for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>on that charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of conviction of having a weapon in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">To understand the incident that gave rise to the criminal charges against the defendant and his interposition of a justification defense, we first discuss the background events that eventually led to his arrest. According to the defense, on- February 28, 1997, the defendant unsuccessfully telephoned M,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his live-in girlfriend, at their residence. The defendant returned home later that evening to find the door to their residence open, the television on and other indications that M had quickly left the premises. Concerned about his girlfriend, the defendant began to search for her. When he could not locate M, he reported her as missing to the West Haven police department in the early morning hours of March 1, 1997.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Soon after notifying the West Haven police, the defendant received a telephone call from M during which she stated that Michael Dziemkiewicz had abducted her from their residence and taken her to a house on Greenwich Avenue in New Haven, where he forced her to smoke cocaine and raped her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She further told the defendant that she had managed to escape and was calling from her friend\u2019s home. After speaking with the defendant, M called the West Haven police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Although the state agreed at trial that M was absent from the residence on the night of February 28, 1997, the state disagreed as to the reason for her absence. The state presented evidence that M voluntarily left the residence with Dziemkiewicz on the afternoon of February 28, 1997, and joined others at the Greenwich Avenue house. There, according to the state, M and Dziemkiewicz smoked cocaine and engaged in sexual activity. M was concerned as to what the defendant would do if he discovered that she had spent the night taking drugs with Dziemkiewicz. The state maintained that after M learned that the defendant already had called her friend\u2019s home, she misled him by telling him that Dziemkiewicz abducted her, forced drugs on her and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Following the alleged abduction, the defendant and M both complained to the West Haven and New Haven police over the next several days.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On March 1, 1997, the defendant and M set out to find the Greenwich Avenue house to which M was taken. After locating the house, they found two New Haven police officers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>told them what had occurred there the preceding night. Their efforts were to no avail, however, because the doorbell went unanswered and, without a search warrant, the police refused to enter the premises. On March 2, 1997, the defendant and M returned to the house in search of Dziemkiewicz. The defendant entered the house through a broken front door. Not finding anyone home, he broke several items and returned to his vehicle in which M was waiting. M then pointed out to the defendant the vehicle of Dziemkiewicz\u2019s friend, the same individual who gave M a ride to her friend\u2019s home from which she called the defendant on the morning of March 1, 1997. The defendant smashed the windshield and thereafter returned with M to West Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Several days later, on March 5, 1997, the defendant was driving his vehicle in New Haven when he observed Dziemkiewicz at the corner of Kimberly Avenue and Ella Grasso Boulevard. It was there that the events ensued that gave rise to the criminal charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The defendant used his vehicle to chase Dziemkie-wicz onto sidewalks and into the street until finally cornering him on the front porch of a nearby home. As the defendant\u2019s vehicle came to an abrupt halt, Dziem-kiewicz yelled to the defendant, \u201cI\u2019m packing, I\u2019m packing.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant exited his vehicle, with the engine still running, and ran onto the porch carrying an aluminum baseball bat. In the ensuing scuffle, Dziemkiewicz threw the wooden base of a plant container at the defendant. The defendant, in turn, hit Dziemkiewicz several times with and without the baseball bat, causing injuries to Dziemkiewicz\u2019s head, right ear and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">As those events were unfolding on the porch, the defendant repeatedly yelled to a small crowd that had gathered that he was making a citizen\u2019s arrest and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the police should be called. Officer John Goad of the New Haven police department arrived shortly thereafter. Goad placed the defendant under arrest and the victim was transported to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The defendant was charged with one count of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), two counts of attempt to commit assault in the first degree and one count of having a weapon in a motor vehicle. He was convicted of count two, attempt to commit assault (with a baseball bat) in the first degree and count four, having a weapon in a motor vehicle. The defendant received an effective sentence of ten years incarceration, suspended after six years, and three years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly excluded evidence in support of his defense of citizen\u2019s arrest<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, thereafter, improperly denied his request to instruct the jury on the defense of citizen\u2019s arrest. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly interpreted \u00a7 53a-22 (f) as requiring the person making the arrest to have been present at the time the felony was committed for the defense of citizen\u2019s arrest to apply. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to resolve this issue. At a September 21, 1998 pretrial hearing, the defendant argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Connecticut law allows a private citizen to make a citizen\u2019s arrest of a felon though the private person was not present when the felony was committed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Citing <em>Wrexford v. Smith, </em>2 Root (Conn.) 171 (1795), and <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>v. <em>Ghiloni, 35 </em>Conn. Sup. 570, 398 A.2d 1204 (1978),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the state argued that \u201cthere is an in presence requirement both at common law and under the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The court agreed with the state and ruled that \u201cthe concept of citizen\u2019s arrest is [inapplicable] to [the] stipulated facts in this case. It is stipulated that this defendant did not observe the alleged kidnapping and rape reported to him, and therefore as I have indicated I don\u2019t think the concept is applicable to these stipulated facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant filed a request to charge the jury on the defense of justification that was based on the making of a citizen\u2019s arrest. On September 28, 1998, the defendant filed an amended request to charge on the defense, which the court denied. The defendant\u2019s request would have instructed the jury that it was the state\u2019s obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Dziemkiewicz had not committed some felony or that the amount of force the defendant used to hold and subdue him was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>excessive under the circumstances. In accordance with the state\u2019s supplemental request to charge dated September 28,1998, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow in this case when he was testifying the defendant made reference that he was effecting a citizen\u2019s arrest during his confrontation with Mr. Dziemkiewicz. The defendant had no legal right to make a citizen\u2019s arrest under the facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Regarding the court\u2019s refusal to give the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction that was based on the making of a citizen\u2019s arrest, \u201c[i]t is a well established principle that a defendant is entitled to have the jury correctly and adequately instructed on the pertinent principles of substantive law. . . . The charge must be correct in the law, adapted to the issues and sufficient to guide the jury. . . . The primary purpose of the charge to the jury is to assist them in applying the law correctly to the facts which they find to be established. . . . On review, we examine the charge to see if it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice was not done under the law to the legal rights of the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>252 Conn. 533, 560-61, 747 A.2d 487 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The dispositive issue is whether \u00a7 53a-22 requires that a felony be committed in the presence of the citizen who makes the arrest. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 487, 757 A.2d 578 (2000). Section 53a-22 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) For purposes of this section, a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts or circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>justifiable the use of physical force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody. ...\u201d Subsection (f) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-22 provides in relevant part: \u201cA private person acting on his own account is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes such to be necessary to effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person whom he reasonably believes to have committed an offense and who in fact has committed such offense; but he is not justified in using deadly physical force in such circumstances . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">According to the plain language of the statute, a private citizen may use reasonable force in arresting an individual whom he reasonably believes has committed an offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If the arrested individual did not commit an offense, however, regardless of the reasonableness of the private citizen\u2019s belief, the latter is not justified in making a citizen\u2019s arrest. There is no requirement in \u00a7 53a-22 that the citizen making the arrest must also have witnessed the commission of the offense or have come upon the scene shortly after its occurrence,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> nor has our Supreme Court put such a gloss on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On appeal, the state concedes that neither the common law nor \u00a7 53a-22 requires that a felony be committed in the presence of the person making the citizen\u2019s arrest. The state argues, however, that we nevertheless may uphold the defendant\u2019s conviction on the alternate ground that the defendant used unreasonable force when effecting the arrest. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u201cIf the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction. ... [A] defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible .... A fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>55 Conn. App. 298, 301-302, 739 A.2d 1264 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 923, 747 A.2d 519 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Here, the evidence presented demonstrates that the defendant lived with M for several months before the events of February 28,1997. M suffered a previous drug and alcohol problem during part of which time she was a prostitute and Dziemkiewicz was her procurer. At trial, M claimed, and Dziemkiewicz disputed, that he had abducted and raped her. On February 28, 1997, the defendant tried calling M several times and when he could not reach her, he returned home to find the door to their residence open, the television on, their money undisturbed, and an uneaten sandwich and a cup of coffee on the dining table. All of those facts could lead a reasonable person to infer that M\u2019s departure from the premises was unplanned and precipitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Additionally, the defendant notified the West Haven police. After reporting to the police that M was missing, the defendant went looking for M but could not find her. M called the defendant the following day and advised him that Dziemkiewicz had abducted and raped her. Both M and the defendant again called the West Haven police. On March 5, 1997, the defendant saw Dziemkiewicz in New Haven and ultimately stopped him. All of those facts establish a legally sufficient factual predicate for the defense of justification by virtue of making a citizen\u2019s arrest and, therefore, the defendant was entitled to have the jury decide and determine that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Whether the defendant used unreasonable force under the circumstances also is a question for the jury to decide. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hallowell, </em>61 Conn. App. 463, 470, 766 A.2d 950 (2001) (whether state disproved defense of justified use of force is question of fact for jury). We, as a reviewing court, do not sit as a seventh juror. We conclude that, as a matter of law, the evidence presented at trial warranted an instruction on the defense of justification on the theory that the defendant was effecting a citizen\u2019s arrest and, therefore, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request for such an instruction. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claims that (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction of \u201cknowingly\u201d having a knife in a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38, and (2) the court improperly refused to sever the charge of having a weapon in a motor vehicle from the other charges in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The defendant first claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction of knowingly possessing a knife in a motor vehicle. Specifically, he argues that \u201cthere is a reasonable doubt regarding whether [he] \u2018knowingly\u2019 possessed the knife,\u201d and the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was in exclusive possession of the vehicle in which the knife was found because the vehicle was registered in his father\u2019s name. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. . . . When viewing evidence that could lead to contrary inferences, the jury may make inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to only make inferences consistent with innocence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>61 Conn. App. 417, 425-26, 767 A.2d 107, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 947, 769 A.2d 64 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the jury had sufficient evidence before it to conclude that the defendant knowingly possessed a knife in the vehicle that he operated or occupied. First, the defendant misconstrues the intent of \u00a7 29-38. The statute does not require the state to prove that the defendant possessed the knife in the vehicle; it is sufficient for the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the knife was in the vehicle. \u201cThe clear intent of \u00a7 29-38 is to make it a crime to have a weapon in a motor vehicle, and [t]he statute is not concerned with possession or ownership of a weapon, but rather aims to penalize those who know that there is a weapon inside a motor vehicle.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>25 Conn. App. 181, 187-88, 594 A.2d 991, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 910, 597 A.2d 337 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s further argument that the vehicle he was operating was registered in his father\u2019s name, the evidence in the record shows that the defendant was operating the vehicle on March 5, 1997, and that he was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Furthermore, the defendant had been operating the vehicle for several months prior to March 5, 1997. We conclude that this evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude, as it did, that the defendant knew the knife was in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s denial of his motion to sever the weapon charge from the charges of assault in the first degree and attempt to commit assault in the first degree resulted in substantial prejudice or injustice because the latter charges alleged bru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tal or shocking conduct by the defendant. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. After speaking with several witnesses at the scene, Goad, the New Haven police officer, learned that the defendant was the operator of the still-running vehicle, a small Chevrolet Celebrity wagon. At some point during his investigation of the scene, Goad approached the unoccupied vehicle, checked the interior before shutting off the engine, and noticed a large knife in the well between the seat and the driver\u2019s side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On appeal, the defendant has the burden of proving that substantial prejudice or injustice resulted from the court\u2019s denial of the motion to sever. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 42, 671 A.2d 323 (1996). \u201cSubstantial prejudice is more than disadvantage .... In this context, prejudice means more than just a better chance of acquittal at a separate trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Radzvilowicz, </em>47 Conn. App. 1, 25, 703 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 955, 704 A.2d 806 (1997). \u201cOnly when joinder will work a substantial injustice should a trial court sever the charges.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 24. \u201cWhether to grant a severance, however, is a decision committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal absent manifest abuse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>supra, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u201cThe court\u2019s discretion regarding joinder, however, is not unlimited; rather, that discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Consequently, we have identified several factors that a trial court should consider in deciding whether a severance may be necessary to avoid undue prejudice resulting from consolidation of multiple charges for trial. These factors include: (1) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>charges involved discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes were of a violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant\u2019s part; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial. ... If any or all of these factors are present, a reviewing court must decide whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>243 Conn. 523, 532-33, 707 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We conclude that the defendant has failed to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that the denial of his motion to sever resulted in substantial injustice. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 523, our Supreme Court did not find substantial injustice where the trial court refused to sever the charge of manslaughter from the charge of risk of injury to a child. In that case, although the court determined that the injuries, including death, inflicted upon a sixteen month old victim with Down\u2019s syndrome were indeed shocking,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it did not find that \u201cjoinder of the counts seriously prejudiced [the defendant\u2019s] defense of the manslaughter count.\u201d Id., 534. We cannot say that the injuries or manner in which the defendant in this case inflicted the injuries on Dziemkiewicz were any more shocking or brutal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The defendant further argues, however, that the prosecution \u201csought to link the charge of [possession of a [w]eapon in a [mjotor [v]ehicle to the more serious assault and attempted assault charges, although there was no evidence that the knife was used or its use contemplated in the alleged assault and, in fact, there was no evidence that the knife ever left the vehicle while the alleged attempted assault occurred outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the vehicle on a porch . . . .\u201d The defendant is referring to a single question that the prosecution posed to him on cross-examination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We cannot say that the comment unto itself so prejudiced the rights of the defendant that the court improperly denied his motion to sever. Moreover, the court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred. The court clearly explained that each count was a separate offense and the jury was to consider each offense individually. The court further charged that it would be the jury\u2019s \u201cduty to consider the evidence relating to each one of those charges separately, although a lot of the evidence does overlap. . . . [Y]ou consider the evidence separately. Consider each charge separately . . . .\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The judgment is reversed as to the conviction of attempt to commit assault in the first degree and the case is remanded for a new trial on that offense. The judgment of conviction of having a weapon in a motor vehicle is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such irqury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

The defendant further claims in the alternative that the court improperly prevented him from presenting evidence and declined to charge the jury that his belief that the victim was a felon wanted by the police constituted a mistake of fact under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-6 (a) (1) and (3).

Because those issues are not likely to arise in a new trial, we decline to address them in this appeal. In light of our reversal of the judgment of conviction of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, we further decline to review the defendant\u2019s additional claims that the court improperly (1) admitted into evidence his statement to the police officer at the scene that he was wearing gloves to avoid the danger of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and (2) denied his motion to dismiss the prosecution or to declare a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct, as those claims related solely to the charges of attempt to commit assault in the first degree and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), with which the defendant also was charged.

Torcia 1989) \u00a7 59, for the proposition that a private citizen may make an arrest, regardless of whether he actually was present at the time the felony was committed, if he reasonably believes the individual committed a felony and the individual, in fact, did commit such felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Accordingly, \u201c[ujnder the common law rule, still in effect in many jurisdictions, a private person may arrest without a warrant in a felony case if the felony has actually been committed and he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person arrested was the one who committed it.

He then retrieved his handgun and returned to the window, only to find that the assault had ended and the assailants were walking away. Id. The defendant ordered the assailants to stop. Id.

Section 2.43 (C) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe last situation involves the right of a private person who is not a peace officer to use reasonable force in effecting what is known as a civilian arrest. Our law allows a civilian arrest for any offense, whether it be a felony, misdemeanor, traffic violation or other infraction, but the arrestor is held to a very high standard of conduct. Unlike a peace officer, the civilian making an arrest may not claim justification merely because he believes that the arrested person committed an offense. Rather, regardless of the reasonableness of his belief, his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>make a civilian arrest is allowed only if the person actually committed an offense. A mistaken arrest, no matter how well-intentioned, is not justified under our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThe test you are to use to determine whether the civilian arrest was justified is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201c(1) Did the complainant actually commit some offense? It is not necessary that the defendant actually saw the offense being committed if, under the circumstances his belief was reasonable. But regardless of his belief, the privilege is lost if the complainant did not actually commit an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u201c(2) Was the amount of force used to effect the arrest <em>reasonable </em>\u2014 and <em>not excessive </em>\u2014 under the circumstances? He may never use deadly force except if necessary to defend himself or another from the use or imminent use of deadly force. Note that deadly force may not be used to effect the arrest or prevent the escape of one who has committed a <em>felony </em>....</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u201cIf you find that the purported civilian arrest met these conditions, then you must find the defendant not guilty of assault. If you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that either of these necessary elements of justification were not present, then you must proceed, without any thought of the claimed justification, to decide whether the defendant committed an assault upon the person he arrested.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\"> The victim\u2019s injuries included bruising over both eyes and on her cheek, neck and chest, a cut on the upper lip, bleeding behind the eyes, a fractured skull with associated bleeding within the brain and \u201ca healing fracture of the victim\u2019s right upper leg that would have been caused by a \u2018tremendous amount of force.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">\u201cQ.
