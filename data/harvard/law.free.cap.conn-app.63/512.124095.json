Blatt, trustee, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his appeal from the decision of the board of assessment appeals of the town of East Lyme (board). At issue is the board\u2019s valuation of 200 acres of property that the plaintiff owns. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) found that the property had not been overvalued and (2) concluded that the board\u2019s valuation of the property did not constitute an illegal tax pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff owns property in the town consisting of a 200 acre parcel of land improved with one building. The town assessor (assessor) determined that, as of the assessment year commencing October 1, 1991, the true and actual value of the plaintiffs property was $1,464,500. In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b), the assessor assessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>property at 70 percent of that value. Disputing the valuation, the plaintiff appealed to the board seeking a considerable reduction in the property assessment. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (providing for appeal to board). The board reduced the value of the building from $126,490 to $111,930, thereby slightly reducing the value of the property to $1,443,700. Accordingly, the board assessed the property at $1,010,590. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court for the judicial district of New London.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The court conducted a trial de novo<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> during which the board called Robert Flanagan, a real estate appraiser, as an expert witness. Flanagan testified as follows. The highest and best use of the plaintiffs property was as raw land included in a golf course development. He arrived at that conclusion after considering the history of the property, the permits that had been obtained for the property and the intrinsic characteristics of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>property, including a natural pond and rolling elevations. In his opinion, the true and accurate value of the plaintiffs property was $1,455,000. In arriving at that value, which equals $7300 per acre, he considered residential development as a competing use and analyzed the sale prices of comparable properties that had been obtained for that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. In its memorandum of decision, the court summarized Flanagan\u2019s testimony and stated: \u201cThe court finds the evidence presented by the defendant regarding comparable sales of raw land for development (whether for golf course or residential use) more convincing than that presented by the plaintiff. Based upon the evidence presented, the court finds that the plaintiff has not met [his] burden of showing that the property was overvalued for tax assessment purposes.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff asks this court to review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. It is well established that an appellate court cannot find new facts. Our review is limited to determining whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous or contrary to law. <em>Northeast Parking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>47 Conn. App. 284, 290-91, 703 A.2d 797 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 969, 707 A.2d 1269 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In the present case, the court filed a detailed and comprehensive memorandum of decision reciting the facts that it found to support its decision. \u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. ... In a case that is tried to the court . . . the judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>specific testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wieler v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 59, 61, 702 A.2d 1195, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 957, 704 A.2d 806 (1997). After a complete review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs property was not overvalued is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot succeed in either of the claims raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 \u201callows a taxpayer to bring a claim that the tax was imposed by a town that had no authority to tax the subject property, or that the assessment was manifestly excessive <em>and </em>could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of [the real] property . . .
