We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On February 24,1992, at approximately 3:30 p.m., the victim, Jose Reynolds, and an individual known to the victim as \u201cAkeem\u201d exchanged words and engaged in a twenty minute fistfight at 86 Bassett Street in New Haven. After the fight, the victim returned to his house at 66 Bassett Street to clean up, where he found two of his brothers, Ralph Reynolds and William Reynolds. As the three brothers began walking back toward 86 Bassett Street where the altercation between the victim and \u201cAkeem\u201d had taken place, a man ran toward them firing a nine millimeter gun several times. One of the bullets struck the victim in the left tricep.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Officers from the New Haven police department responded to the shooting. Paramedics transported the victim to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where he underwent two surgeries during his two week hospitalization. The police ultimately learned that the defendant used the alias \u201cAkeem.\u201d They showed a photographic array to the victim and his two brothers, all of whom made positive identifications of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The police arrested the defendant, and the state charged him in a three count information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded not guilty to the three counts. At trial, the victim and his two brothers each made an in-court identification of the defendant as the shooter. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts one and three, assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit, respectively. The court sentenced the defendant to a term of twenty years on count one and five years, consecutive to count one, on count three, for a total effective sentence of twenty-five years incarceration. This appeal followed. We will provide additional facts as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendant first claims that the evidence did not sufficiently establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our standard of review is well settled. In reviewing an insufficiency of the evidence claim, we invoke a two step inquiry. First, we review the evidence in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we decide whether the jury reasonably could have concluded as it did, given the facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>62 Conn. App. 665, 670, 772 A.2d 657 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The defendant specifically asserts that three factors render his conviction infirm: The victim\u2019s intoxication at the time of the shooting; the eyewitnesses\u2019 inconsistent and biased testimony; and the state\u2019s failure to verify that the defendant had a \u201clazy eye.\u201d The state argues that because each of those assertions attacks credibility determinations made by the jury, as a reviewing court we must defer to such determinations. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">At trial, the state introduced the victim\u2019s medical record, which disclosed that his blood alcohol level was 0.145 percent upon his arrival at the hospital. The record also contained a statement that the victim had consumed three beers and two shots of whiskey. The victim testified that he was not intoxicated and did not remember telling anyone at the hospital that he had consumed two shots of whiskey. The defense presented Conner Farren, an expert in the treatment of substance abuse, who testified that a blood alcohol level of 0.145 percent indicates gross intoxication. Farren testified further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that gross intoxication could lead to perceptual, concentration and memory difficulties, to an inability to focus or to control eye movement and to staggering. Moreover, Farren testified that given the time lapse, it is possible that the victim\u2019s blood alcohol level was even higher, perhaps as high as 0.165 percent, at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The jury, therefore, heard conflicting evidence as to the victim\u2019s level of intoxication and how that level may have affected his ability to perceive and to recall events. The defendant introduced ample evidence to call into question the victim\u2019s credibility. That evidence did not, however, obligate the jury to disregard or discredit, in whole or in part, the victim\u2019s testimony. It is beyond question that credibility determinations fall uniquely within the province of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 786, 601 A.2d 521 (1992); <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>60 Conn. App. 68, 73, 758 A.2d 432, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 920, 763 A.2d 1042 (2000). Furthermore, the jury\u2019s finding of guilt did not hinge solely on the victim\u2019s recollection of events, as two other witnesses made positive identifications. We conclude that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that the victim\u2019s blood alcohol level did not impede his ability to identify the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The defendant also argues that the victim and his two brothers offered differing accounts of the shooting. The defendant argues in his brief that those inconsistencies and the fact that the witnesses were the victim\u2019s brothers indicate that \u201c[sjurely, such witnesses were not impartial and their credibility [was] suspect.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We have reviewed the record and recognize that the victim and the other two eyewitnesses to the shooting did indeed offer conflicting testimony. The accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>differed as to where the three brothers were heading when the shooting started, when and where the shooter began shooting, how many people were on the porch before the shooting, where the victim\u2019s car was parked, who ran in which direction when the shooting started and the March 9,1992 photographic array identification procedure. The jury knew that the eyewitnesses were the victim\u2019s brothers, and it could therefore consider any bias when weighing their testimony. Moreover, the court never precluded the defendant from impeaching the brothers\u2019 testimony. Indeed, defense counsel\u2019s entire closing argument highlighted the inconsistencies in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201c[W]e do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>States. Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 464, 758 A.2d 824 (2000). \u201cThe resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court. . . . [W]e cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of . . . witnesses].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crepeau </em>v. <em>Gronager, </em>41 Conn. App. 302, 310, 675 A.2d 1361 (1996). We therefore conclude that the jury reasonably could have credited the brothers\u2019 testimony and identifications of the defendant despite their blood relation to the victim and the inconsistencies about certain events surrounding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The defendant\u2019s last claim concerning the sufficiency of the evidence is that the state needed to verify that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the defendant had a \u201clazy eye\u201d condition. The victim and the witnesses testified that the shooter had a \u201clazy eye,\u201d which was one of the reasons why they had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array. According to their testimony, the defendant\u2019s photograph in the array depicted him with a \u201cdroopy\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d eye. The defendant asserts that he has never experienced any vision problem. The defendant seems to argue that the state needed to present evidence to verify the existence of the condition because the witnesses testified as to that condition. The defendant does not cite, nor has our research unearthed, any law to support that proposition. The witnesses were not medical doctors offering expert testimony as to a documented, verifiable medical condition. The witnesses merely offered testimony that, in their nonexpert opinions, the defendant had one eye that \u201cdrooped\u201d more than the other and that that characteristic was one reason why they had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph. Whether the defendant had an actual medical condition was not material to the identifications. Such testimony, therefore, cannot sustain an insufficiency of the evidence challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The defendant next claims that certain police testimony tainted the constitutionality of the trial and that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence concerning the ownership of the shooter\u2019s vehicle in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The following facts are necessary to place the defendant\u2019s claim in proper context. Detective Gil Burton of the New Haven police department interviewed the witnesses after the shooting. The witnesses informed Burton that they knew the defendant only as \u201cAkeem.\u201d Burton eventually obtained the defendant\u2019s real name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>and his photograph from police records. On February 29, 1992, Burton presented five photographs to one of the brothers, Ralph Reynolds, who selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array. On March 9, 1992, Burton presented five photographs to the victim and the other brother, William Reynolds, both of whom selected the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the identifications as overly suggestive and violative of his right to due process. At the June 17, 1997 suppression hearing, defense counsel questioned Burton as to how he had obtained the defendant\u2019s real name when he knew only the alias \u201cAkeem.\u201d Burton testified that he had used the computer system of the department\u2019s investigative service. According to Burton, the system generated the defendant\u2019s identity after Burton entered the alias \u201cAkeem.\u201d Once he had obtained the defendant\u2019s real name, Burton was able to retrieve the defendant\u2019s photograph from the police files. Burton used that photograph in the array that he showed to the witnesses and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On June 19, 1997, the court denied the motion to suppress the identifications. It found that the victim and the two witnesses had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the photographic array. The court also found that the contents of the photographs were not unnecessarily suggestive. According to the court, each of the three identifying witnesses had a full opportunity to observe the shooter both at the time of the incident and prior to it. The victim\u2019s fistfight with the shooter shortly before the incident gave him a full opportunity to observe the defendant, and each of the witnesses had seen the shooter several times in the neighborhood before the shooting. The court also determined that the victim\u2019s beer consumption did not affect his ability to identify the defendant as the shooter. Moreover, the court determined that under a totality of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>stances analysis, the out-of-court identifications were reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial began on June 24, 1997, one week after the suppression hearing. At trial, defense counsel again cross-examined Burton as to the procedure that he had used to obtain the defendant\u2019s real name. Burton recanted his suppression hearing testimony and offered a wholly different account.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, Burton testified that he did not, in fact, use any computer program, nor had the computer been installed in February, 1992, and that he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d that another officer had informed him that the defendant used the alias \u201cAkeem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The defendant argues that Burton\u2019s fabrication of an alias processing program rendered the suppression hearing suspect and tainted the constitutionality of the trial. The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial and it is unclear which type of review he requests. In his brief to this court, we glean no allegation of a violation of a constitutional right, which allegation is neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sary to invoke review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant makes the broad assertion that Burton\u2019s conflicting testimony deprived him of a fair trial. He does not, however, identify a constitutional violation necessary to trigger review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The defendant here merely has asserted that he was deprived of a fair trial without identifying the constitutional violation that forms the basis for that claimed deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We note that the defendant\u2019s claim seems to involve not a constitutional violation, but an attack on the witness\u2019 credibility. Burton\u2019s conflicting testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial does not bear on the reliability of the witnesses\u2019 identification and the integrity of the verdict. It bears, instead, on Burton\u2019s own credibility as a witness. Defense counsel cross-examined Burton and elicited from him an acknowledgement that he had given inaccurate testimony only one week before trial. Defense counsel also referred to Burton\u2019s inaccuracies during closing argument. It was for the jury to ascertain the effect of Burton\u2019s differing accounts on his credibility. We fail to see, therefore, how Burton\u2019s testimony tainted the constitutionality of the trial and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We do find it troublesome that Burton\u2019s testimony at trial, which occurred only one week after the suppression hearing, reveals that Burton testified as to a nonexistent alias processing computer program operating on a computer that had not yet been installed, all to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the simple and seemingly nonmaterial and innocuous fact of how he had obtained the defendant\u2019s real name. We do not agree, however, that his false testimony amounts to an allegation of a constitutional violation that affected the integrity of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor withheld exculpatory evidence regarding the ownership of the shooter\u2019s automobile, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. According to the defendant, if the state had investigated who owned the car in which the defendant was located just before the initial altercation with the victim, that investigation would have produced exculpatory evidence. He argues that the state\u2019s failure to investigate resulted in a violation of his constitutional right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this claim. The victim testified that the defendant had exited a maroon or burgundy car shortly before the fistfight. Other witnesses also testified that a maroon car was parked in the driveway at 86 Bassett Street when the shooting occurred. After Burton arrived at the scene, he checked the maroon car for identification and, finding none, had it towed to police facilities. Burton\u2019s police report omits any reference to his checking the plates to determine who owned the car, but Burton testified that he believed that he had done so. According to his testimony, the police never determined who owned the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial, but urges us to exercise our supervisory power to order a new trial because of the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We will not \u201cinvoke our supervisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>authority to reverse an otherwise lawful criminal conviction absent a showing that the conduct of the prosecutor was so offensive to the judicial process that a new trial is necessary to deter such misconduct in the future.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 564, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998). The defendant cannot show that the state\u2019s failure to ascertain the owner of the maroon car in which the defendant was riding prior to his fistfight with the victim amounted to misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201cWe often have stated our standard of review of a claim of prosecutorial misconduct that allegedly results in an unfair trial. [T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial . . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>61 Conn. App. 430, 442, 769 A.2d 708, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 954, 772 A.2d 152 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In his brief, the defendant maintains that the prosecutor \u201cbears the responsibility of convicting a person on the basis of suspicious evidence.\u201d While we do not necessarily disagree with that statement, we disagree that the evidence in this case was suspicious. Three individuals positively identified the defendant as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>shooter during both in-court and out-of-court identification procedures. We have reviewed the record and cannot find a single action, let alone an egregious pattern, that remotely could be characterized as prosecutorial misconduct. We therefore decline to exercise our supervisory powers to order a new trial where we find no evidence that the prosecutor engaged in anything but proper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim involves several alleged improprieties by the court. He claims that the court, sua sponte, should have declared a mistrial, that it imposed an excessive sentence and that it improperly instructed the jury regarding reasonable doubt. We disagree with each of those assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The defendant argues that the court, sua sponte, should have declared a mistrial in light of Burton\u2019s conflicting testimony and the alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Trial counsel never moved for a mistrial, but the defendant surmises now in his brief that \u201c[h]ad [counsel] done so, perhaps the trial court would have been compelled to grant it.\u201d We decline the invitation to engage in such a speculative exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The defendant is not entitled to <em>Golding </em>review because we cannot determine that any constitutional right was violated. <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Because it is within the court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a mistrial or to order one sua sponte; <em>State </em>v. <em>Phidd, </em>42 Conn. App. 17, 38, 681 A.2d 310, cert. denied, 238 Conn. 907, 679 A.2d 2 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1108, 117 S. Ct. 1115, 137 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1997); this case is inappropriate for plain error review. Moreover, in light of our conclusion in part II of this opinion that Burton\u2019s testimony bore only on his credibility as a witness and not on the reliability of the identifications, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct, we will not invoke our supervisory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The defendant also argues that the court imposed an excessive sentence in retribution for his refusal to accept a plea bargain. There is no record to support his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The court sentenced the defendant to a term of twenty years incarceration for assault in the first degree and a consecutive term of five years for carrying a pistol without a permit. The defendant maintains that the sentence he received was in retaliation for his decision to reject a plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial and therefore has not preserved it for appellate review. In his brief to this court, the defendant does not request <em>Golding </em>or plain error review. We agree with the state that the inadequate record renders us unable to ascertain the precise basis for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In his brief, the defendant argues that \u201cpressure was asserted to convince him to dispense with trial in light of his present term.\u201d He also asserts that the court should not have imposed a harsh and excessive sentence as punishment for his refusing to plead guilty. There is no record, however, that establishes either that plea bargaining actually occurred or the content and nature of the plea bargaining that the defendant now challenges. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 581, 484 A.2d 435 (1984). It is the defendant\u2019s responsibility to provide an adequate record for review. Id. The absence of any record makes it impossible for us to determine whether there was any instigative or vindictive conduct by the judge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunori, </em>21 Conn. App. 331, 336, 574 A.2d 222 (1990); or even before which judge the alleged plea bargaining occurred. If the presid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ing trial judge in fact actively participated in the plea bargaining, which practice is not condoned; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 47, 475 A.2d 269 (1984); the fact that the defendant never filed a motion for disqualification of the trial judge suggests that he acquiesced to that judge presiding over the trial. We cannot reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim because there is no record of any plea bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury as to reasonable doubt. The state argues that this court recently considered and rejected a similar claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>62 Conn. App. 217, 241-45, 774 A.2d 157 (2001). We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The court charged the jury as follows: \u201cThis phrase, reasonable doubt, has no technical or unusual meaning. You get the real meaning of the phrase if you emphasize the word reasonable. It is a doubt which is something more than a guess or a surmise. A reasonable doubt is not such a doubt as raised by one who questions simply for the sake of argument, it is not a doubt suggested by counsel which is not warranted by the evidence. A reasonable doubt is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence offered in the case or in the absence of evidence. It is such a doubt as in serious affairs which concern yourselves you would heed. That is such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The defendant urges review of this unpreserved claim under <em>Golding. </em>The record is adequate for our review, and a claim of instructional error concerning the state\u2019s burden of proof is of constitutional dimension. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 687, 701 A.2d 1 (1997) (defendant\u2019s Unpreserved claim of improper jury instruction as to reasonable doubt meets second prong of Golding). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The defendant fails, however, to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly existed that deprived him of a lair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In reviewing the propriety of a jury instruction, we scrutinize the entirety of the charge rather than in a piecemeal fashion judging the charge in \u201cartificial isolation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>237 Conn. 518, 536, 679 A.2d 902 (1996). We examine the charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. Id., 537. This court and our Supreme Court have rejected challenges to reasonable doubt instructions that indicate that the jury should not equate such a doubt with a surmise, guess, conjecture or a speculation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>242 Conn. 93, 114-15 &amp; n.17, 700 A.2d 617 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 634, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 420, 518 A.2d 35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The challenged instruction in this case is almost identical to the language we approved of in <em>Green. </em>In <em>Green, </em>we stated that \u201c[w]e also repeatedly have upheld the constitutionality of an instruction characterizing reasonable doubt as a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 504-505, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 816-20, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). Furthermore, both the United States Supreme Court; see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 18, 21, 114 S. Ct. 1239, 127 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1994); and [our Supreme Court]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>[supra, 242 Conn. 688]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 147-50, 554 A.2d 713 (1989); have reached the same conclusion with respect to an explanation that reasonable doubt is a doubt that would cause a reasonably prudent person to hesitate to act in matters of importance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 244. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>light of our reasoning and decision in <em>Green, </em>which involved an instruction almost identical to the one here, we conclude that the defendant has failed to show that he was deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The defendant next claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. \u201cOur Supreme Court has consistently concluded that the preferred vehicle for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is either a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or a petition for a new trial, not a direct appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 579, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 370, 441 A.2d 98 (1981). \u2018Absent the evidentiary hearing available in the collateral action, review in this court of the ineffective assistance claim is at best difficult and sometimes impossible. The evidentiary hearing provides the trial court with the evidence that is often necessary to evaluate the competency of the defense and the harmfulness of any incompetency.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>supra, 579.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>42 Conn. App. 640, 650-51, 681 A.2d 380 (1996). We conclude, therefore, that the defendant has improperly raised this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In his final claim, the defendant asserts that the state improperly excused the sole remaining African-American venireperson on the basis of race in violation of <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state argues that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>is not entitled to review of this unpreserved claim due to the inadequacy of the record. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The defendant must satisfy the reviewability requirements of <em>Golding </em>before we consider his unpreserved claim. He did not object to the state\u2019s exercise of any peremptoiy challenge during voir dire, and the transcripts of the voir dire do not indicate the race of any venireperson. The absence of a record bars our review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same issued as provided in section 29-28. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> The three counts were assault in the first <em>degree, </em>attempt to commit assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> In his brief to this court and at (he time counsel for the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, the defendant did not specify which count he claimed was not supported by sufficient evidence. We, therefore, assume that he seeks to challenge his conviction on both counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> The following colloquy occurred on cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u201cQ. Detective Burton, you testified in this courtroom in a hearing about this matter about a week or so ago, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u201cQ. All Right. And at that time do you remember answering some questions concerning how you came up with the photograph of \u2018Akeem\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. And at that time, you told the court, I believe, that you had run it through a computer?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">\u201cQ. All right. And you had indicated that you had ran just the name \u2018Akeem\u2019 and, as a result of running the name \u2018Akeem,\u2019 this computer had popped-up Andrew Owens, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, now your testimony today is that, in fact, that computer was not on line back in that \u2014 February of 1992, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">\u201cA. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">\u201cQ. So, you did not get the name Andrew Owens by using any kind of alias processing?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">\u201cA. Right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), empowers an appellate court to review an unpreserved claim if the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional dimension. Once a defendant satisfies those two initial requirements, the reviewing court then reaches the merits of the claim. The defendant must demonstrate the existence of a constitutional violation that clearly deprived him of a fair trial. If the claim is subject to harmless error analysis, the defendant must also demonstrate that the state failed to establish harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> We note that despite the prosecutorial misconduct label the defendant has put on this claim, his brief suggests that his claim is, rather, one of failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence. We are unpersuaded. The defendant has failed to demonstrate that the ownership of the car was material to an issue at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 360-61, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>696 A.2d 944 (1997). In his brief, the defendant suggests that \u201cexculpatory evidence would have been produced had the officer conducted an investigation of the vehicle.\u201d The identification of the shooter did not hinge on the ownership of the automobile; rather, it depended on the three witnesses\u2019 prior contact with the defendant and their in-court, and out-of-court identifications. We see no reasonable probability that knowledge of the owner of the automobile would have affected the result. See id., 361. The defendant cannot, therefore, prevail on a claim of failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> The United State Supreme Court promulgated a three step evidentiary procedure to determine whether the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge violates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection. \u201cFirst, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race. <em>[Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 96-97). Second, if the requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. Id., [97-98]. Finally, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>[98].\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991). Connecticut has adopted a more lenient procedure, abandoning the requirement of a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised the challenge on the basis of race. Pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 &amp; n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989), a defendant need demonstrate only that the challenged venireperson belongs to the same cognizable racial group as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
