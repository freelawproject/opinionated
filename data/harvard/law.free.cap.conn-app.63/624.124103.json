The dispositive issue is whether the defendant should have been a defendant in the tax lien foreclosure action by which the plaintiff, the city of Bridgeport (city), acquired title.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The following relevant facts are taken from a stipulation of the parties. In 1993, the defendant entered into a written lease and took possession as a tenant of 2288 and 2294 Fairfield Avenue in Bridgeport. The lease was not witnessed, notarized or recorded. In 1994, the city foreclosed tax liens on the property in an action in which the defendant was not named as an encum-brancer. The court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, and title vested in the city on October 15,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">After obtaining title, the city commenced this summary process action against the defendant on the ground, inter alia, that the defendant had no right to possession of the property. By way of special defense, the defendant pleaded to the effect that the foreclosure judgment was not effective against it because it had not been made a party and, consequently, was not served with process in the foreclosure proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The defendant argues that although its lease was not recorded on the land records, it was nevertheless entitled to be named as a defendant and given a law day. This argument ignores Practice Book \u00a7 10-69, which requires that \u201c <em>[a]ll encumbrances of record\u201d </em>be set forth in the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We are not aware of any authority, nor has any been brought to our atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>tion, that mandates naming unrecorded encumbrances<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in a foreclosure complaint. While the city had the option of naming the defendant as a party in the foreclosure and then proceeding to obtain possession by way of ejectment, it was not required to follow that course. Instead, it could elect not to name the defendant, and then to proceed, as it did, to obtain possession by way of summary process. <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Van Sickle, </em>52 Conn. App. 37, 42, 726 A.2d 600 (1999); D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures (3d Ed. 1997) pp. 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We decline to establish a rule that would require foreclosing plaintiffs to include all tenants as defendants in foreclosure actions. The ramifications of such a rule would be far reaching. For instance, it would impose a duty on foreclosing plaintiffs to conduct an investigation to learn who was occupying portions of the premises under unrecorded and perhaps unwritten leases. Because there is no privity between a foreclosing plaintiff and a defendant\u2019s tenants, we dare not predict the extent of cooperation and the accuracy of the information that such an investigation would produce. We hold that if a tenant\u2019s lease is not recorded, the tenant has no right to be part of the foreclosure action and, more specifically, is not entitled to a law day.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The defendant contends that General Statutes \u00a7 49-30 supports its position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not agree. Section 49-30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>establishes a procedure for foreclosing an encumbrance that is omitted in the original foreclosure. As used in \u00a7 49-30, the term encumbrance refers to recorded encumbrances. We are aware of no case law that suggests otherwise. Moreover, the tenor of \u00a7 49-30 makes it clear that it was intended to benefit the foreclosing party who, through mistake or oversight, omitted an encumbrance. It is not intended to be used as a sword by the omitted party.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bombero, </em>37 Conn. App. 764, 769, 657 A.2d 668 (1995) , appeal dismissed, 236 Conn. 744, 674 A.2d 1324 (1996) , is misplaced. In <em>Bombero, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 49-30 is to provide for a cure in the event that a <em>party </em>is omitted from foreclosure proceedings. This purpose is unambiguously apparent from the statutory language and its delineation of the methods of curing the omission by deed or foreclosure or other legal proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The fallacy in the defendant\u2019s reasoning is that it assumes that the defendant is a party that holds an encumbrance on the property. As we concluded earlier in this opinion, the defendant\u2019s unrecorded lease does not constitute an encumbrance and, thus, there is no omission that needs curing.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant was not required to be made a party in the foreclosure action, and the city\u2019s foreclosure of its tax hens extinguished the defendant\u2019s lease. See <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Van Sickle, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Even if the defendant could persuade us that foreclosure procedure entitled it to a law day, it cannot survive General Statutes \u00a7 47-19, which provides that a lease for more than one year will be ineffectual against anyone other than the lessor and lessee \u201cunless it is in writing, executed, attested, acknowledged and recorded in the same manner as a deed of land . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The lease in the present case was not witnessed, acknowledged or recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The defendant argues that because the city knew or should have known of its lease, \u00a7 47-19 does not apply and that under some circumstances an unrecorded lease has been held to bind a third party who had actual notice of the existence of the lease. See <em>Drazen Properties Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>E. F. Mahon, Inc., </em>19 Conn. App. 471, 562 A.2d 1142 (1989). There are two fallacies to this argument as applied here. First, the cases on which the defendant relies concern bona fide purchasers for value. See id., 477. A bona fide purchaser is a buyer who pays full and fair price for property without notice that another person has an interest in that property. Id. A city that forecloses a tax lien does not meet that definition. Second, the defendant does not cite authority as to who, when dealing with a city, the public official is who would be charged with notice of the lease. Would it be the tax collector, the assessor, the city attorney, any individual councilman, the entire city council or some other municipal functionary?</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>We conclude that the defendant\u2019s unrecorded and defectively executed lease gave it no rights in the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> In its brief, the defendant states the issues as follows: (1) \u201cSince 2284 Corporation was not a defendant in the city\u2019s tax foreclosure action, its lease was not extinguished by the judgment in that action\u201d; (2) \u201csince 2284 Corporation had a property interest in its lease and was not a party to the city\u2019s foreclosure action, its lease survived strict foreclosure\u201d; (3) \u201csince the city had or should have had notice of the defendant\u2019s lease at the time it took title to the premises, it is bound by that actual or constructive knowledge and cannot therefore avoid the corporation\u2019s unrecorded lease\u201d; and (4) because the city did not have legal title to the premises when the defendant received its lease, 2284 Corporation did not take possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>subject to the city\u2019s interest when it took possession. Therefore its lease survived strict foreclosure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> In an attempt to name the defendant as a party during the foreclosure proceeding, the city moved to name Louis Pagliuco as a defendant, claiming that he individually had an interest in the property that would be affected by a judgment. Louis <em>M. </em>Pagliuco was a shareholder, officer and director of the defendant corporation, but the notice was served on a Louis <em>R. </em>Pagliuco, who had no interest in the corporation. In view of our analysis, this ineffective attempt to serve Pagliuco as a defendant is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 10-69 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe complaint in all actions seeking the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien upon real estate shall set forth, in addition to the other essentials of such complaint: <em>All encumbrances of record </em>upon the property both prior and subsequent to the encumbrance sought to be foreclosed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\"> Query as to whether ait unrecorded lease is even an encumbrance. In <em>Palmeri </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 56, 59, 299 A.2d 552 (1972), the Superior Court held that a recorded agreement did not constitute an encumbrance but constituted only a cloud on the title because it was not executed in accordance with the statute relating to conveyances of interest in real estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-30 provides: \u201cOmission of Parties in Foreclosure Actions. When a mortgage or lien on real estate has been foreclosed and one or more parties owning any interest in or holding an encumbrance on such real estate subsequent or subordinate to such mortgage or lien has been omitted or has not been foreclosed of such interest or encumbrance because of improper service of process or for any other reason, all other parties foreclosed by the foreclosure judgment shall be bound thereby as fully as if no such omission or defect had occurred and shall not retain any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>equity or right to redeem such foreclosed real estate. Such omission or failure to properly foreclose such party or parties may be completely cured and cleared by deed or foreclosure or other proper legal proceedings to which the only necessary parties shall be the party acquiring such foreclosure title, or his successor in title, and the party or parties thus not foreclosed, or their respective successors in title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-19 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo lease of any building, land or tenement . . . for any term exceeding one year or which provides for the renewal thereof or an option to purchase such . . . tenement, shall be effectual against any persons other than the lessor and lessee and their respective heirs, successors, administrators and executors, <em>unless it is in writing, executed, attested, acknowledged and recorded in the same manner as a deed of land . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
