We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Janet Griffin, a friend of the defendant, and Gina Coccia, an acquaintance of the defendant, had a romantic relationship for several years in Vermont. Coccia ended the relationship in 1992 and, one year later, moved to Connecticut with Patricia Steller, one of the two victims, while Griffin remained in Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Griffin visited Middletown, the town in which Coccia resided, with her friend, Natalie Jurgen, on three separate occasions during the fall of 1993. Her purpose in doing so was to gather information about Steller\u2019s home and the surrounding area. On November 1,1993, Griffin rented an automobile that she had reserved, specifically selecting a rental company in New York that did not require credit cards. The defendant drove Griffin and Griffin\u2019s daughter to Steller\u2019s home in Middletown. Once they arrived at the home, Griffin sent her daughter to the store. Griffin and the defendant then walked to the back of the home. The defendant climbed through the \u201cdog door\u201d from the deck and opened the back door so that Griffin could enter the home. The two waited for Steller to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Steller and Ronald King, Steller\u2019s nephew, entered the home. Griffin fired an antique gun, which the defendant had supplied to her, at both King and Steller until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>all of the bullets were spent. The victims survived the shooting. Griffin then asked the defendant for help in killing the victims. The defendant responded by handing a knife to Griffin, who in turn proceeded to stab Steller with the knife. The defendant also handed Griffin a lamp, which Griffin used to strike Steller. Griffin returned the gun to the defendant before the two left the home. They drove away from the home and threw the gun and holster into a pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Coccia returned to the home approximately two hours after the attack. Upon finding the bodies, she ran from the home to find help and called the Middletown police. One of the first officers on the scene heard the answering machine playing a message that stated that the recorder was full. Police officers seized the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">When investigators played the tape, the recording contained the defendant\u2019s voice stating, \u201cDo it!\u201d In response to Griffin\u2019s request for assistance, the defendant is heard to say, \u201cHere!\u201d Sounds of a struggle are then heard, followed by the sound of an object striking another object. One of the voices on the tape states, \u201cDone,\u201d and later, \u201cNot done,\u201d which is followed by the sound of an object breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The police questioned the defendant, who gave several statements to the police. His statements reflected varying levels of involvement. The defendant ultimately admitted that he was involved in the killings and that he had helped clean Griffin\u2019s car before returning it to the rental company. He accompanied the police to the pond in Middletown, where the police recovered the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">At trial, the defendant was charged with two counts of murder as an accessory in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-8<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of capital felony as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54b (8)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 53a-8. The defendant testified at his trial, admitting his role in the killings. Medical testimony indicated that the gunshot wounds inflicted on each victim were potentially fatal. The defendant pleaded duress and extreme emotional disturbance as defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney requested that the court instruct the jury on proximate cause. When the court questioned whether proximate cause was at issue in the case, the defendant\u2019s attorney replied that \u201cwe think it may be with respect to the handing a knife.\u201d The court refused the request to charge, and the defendant took exception to the charge as given. The court noted that it believed \u201cthat the state did not allege . . . that the defendant proxima[tely] caused anything.\u201d The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>found the defendant guilty of the lesser offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55. The defendant received a sentence of thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the court improperly instructed the jury on causation. Specifically, the defendant claims that he was entitled to an instruction on proximate cause because the victims already had been mortally wounded at the time that he handed Griffin the knife. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Our analysis begins with a well established standard of review. \u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the puipose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>251 Conn. 671, 714, 741 A.2d 913 (1999). \u201c[I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 119\u201420, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">It is well settled that \u201caccessorial liability does not attach unless the defendant has the same degree of criminal intent required to commit the offense as the principal. [T]o establish the guilt of an accused as an accessory for aiding and abetting the criminal act of another the state must prove criminality of intent and community of unlawful purpose. It is not enough that the accused committed acts which may in fact have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>aided the committing of the criminal act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211, 233, 700 A.2d 1 (1997). \u201c[A] conviction under \u00a7 53a-8 requires proof of a dual intent . . . that the accessory have the intent to aid the principal and that in so aiding he intend to commit the offense with which he is charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 525-26, 522 A.2d 277 (1987). Furthermore, \u201c[t]o be guilty as an accessory one must share the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose with the perpetrator of the crime and one must knowingly and wilfully assist the perpetrator in the acts which prepare for, facilitate or consummate it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>254 Conn. 739, 783, 760 A.2d 82 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Section 53a-8 provides that \u201ca person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he solicits the other person to commit it, or <em>aids or agrees or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it, </em>or <em>(having a legal duty to prevent the crime) fails to make the proper effort to prevent it. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201c[T]o convict one as an accessory for aiding and abetting, the state must prove that the accused had both criminal intent and community of purpose with the principal perpetrator of the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 requires (1) that the accessory have the intent to aid the principal, and (2) that, in so doing, he have the intent to commit the offense with which he is charged. . . . These two requirements effectively exclude from the statute\u2019s purview those whose innocent acts do in fact aid one who commits a crime . . . while still including those who have criminal intent and community of purpose even though not present actively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>aiding, abetting or being guilty of a positive act in the commission of an offense.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>9 Conn. App. 161, 164, 517 A.2d 640 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Our Supreme Court has approved a jury instruction that provides: \u201cWhere it cannot be determined who fired the fatal shot, beyond a reasonable doubt, the element of murder as to who caused the death has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, persons acting with the mental state required for commission of murder, who intentionally aid one another to engage in . . . such conduct, and cause the death, are accessories to one another, and would be criminally liable for such conduct as accessories to murder.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 627, 725 A.2d 306 (1999). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is of no consequence that the evidence does not clearly establish which of the killings were committed by the defendant and which were done by his accomplice . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 437 n.6, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992). Therefore, once the court correctly instructed the jury on accomplice responsibility and intent, it is of little moment whether the potential existed that the knife or lamp did not inflict the fatal blow to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on proximate cause and theories of intervening and superseding causes is misplaced. \u201cThe doctrine of intervening cause, which has deep roots in the law of proximate cause, both criminal and civil, has been referred to several times in our case law. ... It refers to a situation in which the defendant\u2019s conduct is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause, or cause in fact, of the victim\u2019s injury, but nonetheless some other circumstance subsequently occurs \u2014 the source of which may be <em>an act of the victim, the a,ct of some other person, or some nonhuman force </em>\u2014 that <em>does more than supply a concurring or contributing cause of the injury, but </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>is unforeseeable and sufficiently powerful in its effect that it serves to relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility for his conduct. . . . </em>Thus, the doctrine serves as a dividing line between two closely related factual situations: (1) where two or more acts or forces, one of which was set in motion by the defendant, combine to cause the victim\u2019s injuries, in which case the doctrine will not relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility; and (2) where an act or force intervenes in such a way as to relieve a defendant, whose conduct contributed in fact to the victim\u2019s injuries, from responsibility, in which case the doctrine will apply.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 124-25, 659 A.2d 683 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury on his theory of proximate cause. \u201cWe emphasize that . . . the requirement of language in the jury instructions regarding an efficient, intervening cause is not ironclad. It <em>arises in those cases in which the evidence could support a finding by the jury that the defendant\u2019s conduct was overcome by an efficient, intervening cause, or in which the evidence regarding proximate causation was such that, based on the doctrine of efficient, intervening cause, the jury could have a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt. </em>Thus, in the general run of cases, in which the evidence is susceptible of a finding of only one cause of harm contemplated by the statute, a statement in the jury instruction referring to an efficient, intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>cause might well be unnecessary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 121-22 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In the present case, the court properly declined the request to charge on proximate cause. Under the facts of this case, the defendant allowed Griffin, known to be armed at the time, entry to the home and stood by as she fired the gun that he had supplied to her. He also handed the knife and lamp to Griffin after she had shot the victims. The recording of the attack established the defendant\u2019s substantial involvement in Griffin\u2019s execution of the plan, both in the form of encouragement (\u201cDo it!\u201d) and assistance (\u201cHere!\u201d). This is not a case in which the defendant claims that another person or force interrupted the chain of causation that led to the victims\u2019 demise, indicating the defendant\u2019s innocence. See id., 121-22 n.8. Rather, the defendant\u2019s claim consists of an assertion that the act of handing the knife to Griffin when the victims already were mortally wounded was a futile act that could not affect the outcome. The instruction as requested misstated and misapplied the concepts of proximate cause and accessory liability and was properly rejected. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lepri, </em>56 Conn. App. 403, 414, 743 A.2d 626 (requested charge properly rejected on basis of potential to confuse jury on applicable law), cert. denied, 253 Conn. 902, 753 A.2d 938 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim is similar to that raised before this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>53 Conn. App. 581, 734 A.2d 991, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 918, 738 A.2d 659 (1999). In that case, we concluded that \u201cthe defendant was charged with assault against [the victim] as an accessory, and, therefore, the state did not need to prove that the defendant actually caused serious physical injury to [the victim]. It is enough for the state to prove that the defendant, acting with the intent to cause serious injury to [the victim], solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided another per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>son to cause serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous weapon.\u201d Id., 588. Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We conclude that the evidence before the court was not such as to require a jury instruction on proximate cause. The defendant cannot claim that the factual situation before the court presented a situation in which he could assert the existence of an intervening cause that broke the chain of causation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 121-22 n.8. The court, therefore, properly declined to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person; or (2) with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, as provided in subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>(a) of section 53a-54a, except that the fact that homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing murder to manslaughter in the first degree and need not be proved in any prosecution initiated under this subsection; or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201c(b) A person who sells, delivers or provides any firearm ... to another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense knowing or under circumstances in which he should know that such other person intends to use such firearm in such conduct shall be criminally liable for such conduct and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of . . .

The court concluded that \u201cthe jury instruction . . . was improper because the court did not indicate that, for the defendant to be found guilty, \u2018the defendant\u2019s conduct cannot have been superseded by an efficient, intervening cause that produced\u2019 [the victim\u2019s] death.\u201d Id., 122.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
