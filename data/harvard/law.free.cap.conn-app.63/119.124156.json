On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) instructed the jury concerning his breach of contract claim and (2) excluded expert testimony relating to his scholarship. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. On January 26, 1987, the defendant offered the plaintiff a four year initial appointment as an assistant professor in its department of government. The following month, the plaintiff accepted the offer, which included an annual salary of $26,500. The position commenced on July 1,1987, and was scheduled to terminate on June 30, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">When the plaintiff began his employment, the defendant provided him with a manual titled, \u201cThe Blue Book,\u201d which included the bylaws of the faculty. It is undisputed that the employment contract between the parties incorporated the provisions of The Blue Book, and that The Blue Book\u2019s terms and provisions apply to every faculty member.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">During the third year of the plaintiffs initial appointment, the tenured faculty of the department of govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ment (tenured faculty) evaluated his performance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Three basic criteria were used: Teaching, scholarship and colleagueship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Overall, the tenured faculty\u2019s evaluation of him was favorable; however, concerns were expressed about the plaintiffs level of scholarship. On or about July 2, 1990, the plaintiff received a letter from the chairperson of the department of government (chairperson), informing him of the favorable evaluation and that he had been reappointed to a second four year term, which would expire on June 30, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>letter also conveyed the tenured faculty\u2019s concerns about his scholarship: \u201cWe are concerned that you take the time to revise your dissertation before getting too far along in your new project. It is important to complete the dissertation project in its revision to a book manuscript and sent [sic] out for review. The dissertation is a little unwieldy in length and focus. You have proposed revisions that will make the work more sharply focused .... We are confident that you will be able to make the necessary changes, and that the resulting book will be first-rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">During the next three years, the plaintiff, in an effort to generate a quality manuscript, revised his dissertation by adding five new chapters and modifying three existing chapters. The plaintiff, however, declined offers from the tenured faculty to review his manuscript and to counsel him on how to improve his scholarship.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In May, 1993, the plaintiff, who was nearing the end of his sixth year as an assistant professor, applied for tenure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs application included his manuscript, the names of three professors outside of Wesleyan and a request that the department of government consult them when evaluating his scholarship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>response, the department of government solicited appraisals of the plaintiffs scholarship from nine professors outside of Wesleyan, including the three named in the plaintiffs application. By October 12, 1993, each of the nine professors had responded by letter. Generally, the appraisals of the plaintiffs scholarship were mixed. Several of the professors criticized the manuscript for its lack of clarity and organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The tenured faculty convened eight times to consider the plaintiffs application for tenure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, the three basic criteria were used: Teaching, scholarship and colleagueship.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The tenured faculty conducted a lengthy and thorough review of the plaintiffs record, which included (1) all the published and unpublished material that the plaintiff authored and submitted,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) the plaintiffs statement about his research, teaching and scholarship, (3) syllabi from the courses that the plaintiff taught, (4) evaluations of the plaintiffs teaching and (5) the nine letters of appraisal from professors outside of Wesleyan. At the conclusion of its deliberations, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tenured faculty voted eight to one not to recommend the plaintiff for tenure. On October 26, 1993, the chairperson notified the plaintiff of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On November 2, 1993, the chairperson wrote a letter to the vice president for academic affairs, detailing why the plaintiff was not recommended for tenure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The letter also contained and discussed excerpts from several of the appraisals that had been received from professors outside of Wesleyan. In sum, eight of the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tenured faculty members of the department of government did not consider the plaintiffs scholarship to be of sufficient strength to merit tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">During the plaintiffs eighth and final year as an assistant professor, the department of government permitted him to apply for reconsideration of its decision. The tenured faculty unanimously found that the plaintiffs scholarly record failed to meet \u201cthe exceptional standards required for an eighth year reconsideration.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiff exercised all of the procedural rights of review afforded to him under The Blue Book. The decisions of the tenured faculty were affirmed, and the plaintiffs employment ended on June 30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">On December 5,1995, the plaintiff brought the action that is the subject of this appeal. On January 11, 1996, the plaintiff filed a four count amended complaint, alleging, inter alia, that the defendant had breached its employment contract with him. Additional facts and procedural history will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The plaintiffs first claim consists of several related challenges to the jury instructions concerning his breach of contract claim. The plaintiff alleges that the court improperly instructed the jury to find in his favor on his breach of contract claim only if he proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s decision denying his application for tenure was made arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith. The plaintiff also argues that (1) the court, in its instructions, failed to \u201c \u2018unlink\u2019 what could be considered two separate contract claims\u201d and that (2) neither of those contract claims required him to prove that the defendant acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith to prevail. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In part I A, we will examine the plaintiffs amended complaint and determine (1) the scope of his contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>claims, (2) which facts properly were alleged in support of those claims and (3) of those facts, which were placed at issue by virtue of the evidence in the case. In part I B, we determine, given our conclusions in part I A, that the plaintiff did have the burden of establishing, inter aha, that the defendant acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The Amended Complaint and the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s charge is not to be examined in a vacuum. Rather, it is to be viewed in the context of the factual issues raised at the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Austin, 244 Conn. 226, 237, 710 A.2d 732 (1998). Because \u201c[f]acts found but not averred cannot be made the basis for a recovery\u201d; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952); accord <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>20 Conn. App. 51, 57, 563 A.2d 1046 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 215 Conn. 450, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990); \u201c[i]t is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of his complaint.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>F.M.C. Corp., </em>190 Conn. 700,705,462 A.2d 376 (1983). Consequently, \u201c[t]he plaintiff was entitled to have the jury correctly, fairly and adequately instructed in accordance with the matters and law in issue by virtue of the pleadings and the evidence in the case\u201d; <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>176 Conn. 280, 281, 407 A.2d 958 (1978); and \u201c[t]he trial court need charge only on those points of law that arise pursuant to the claims of proof advanced by the parties in their pleadings.\u201d <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>24 Conn. App. 247, 248, 588 A.2d 223 (1991); accord <em>Nesbitt </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>11 Conn. App. 348, 351, 527 A.2d 1195, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 805, 531 A.2d 936 (1987); see <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>225 Conn. 637, 648, 625 A.2d 1366 (1993) (\u201c[t]he court should, however, submit to the jury all \u2018issues as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>outlined by the pleadings and as reasonably supported by the evidence\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, our analysis begins with an examination of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The second count of the amended complaint consists of the plaintiffs allegation that the defendant breached its contract with him. The facts alleged by the plaintiff as constituting the breach are contained in paragraphs eighteen and nineteen. They state as follows: \u201c18. The University has <em>breached the contract of employment between itself and Daley, including the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, </em>by violating the <em>specific </em>and <em>implicit promises </em>made to Daley with respect to the <em>methods </em>to be employed by the University to determine his eligibility for tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u201c19. <em>More specifically, </em>the University failed to make a <em>good faith effort </em>to determine the quality of Daley\u2019s work by <em>ignoring </em>the opinions of those qualified to judge the merits of Daley\u2019s work. Instead, the University relied upon the recommendations of the Government Department which were <em>biased, inexpert, </em>and <em>inaccurate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u201c [T]he interpretation of pleadings is always a question of law for the court .... [Our Supreme Court has] pointed out that [t]he burden [is] upon the pleaders to make such averments that the material facts should appear with reasonable certainty; and for that purpose [the pleaders] were allowed to use their own language. Whenever that language fails to define clearly the issues in dispute, the court will put upon it such reasonable construction as will give effect to the pleadings in conformity with the general theory which it was intended to follow, and do substantial justice between the parties. . . . But essential allegations may not be supplied by conjecture or remote implication.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 236, 502 A.2d 410 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that the court, in its jury instructions, failed to \u201c \u2018unlink\u2019 what could be considered two separate contract claims,\u201d namely, that the defendant (1) breached the contract when it erroneously concluded that the plaintiffs scholarship was insufficient to merit tenure and (2) breached the contract when the department of government either (a) failed to inform him of its \u201cconception of what constituted a \u2018completed major work\u2019 \u201d or (b) failed to apply the definition of \u201ccompleted major work\u201d that it communicated to him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Implicit in the plaintiffs argument is the assumption that both of those contract claims were pleaded adequately. See <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Our examination of paragraphs eighteen and nineteen of the second count discloses that two separate claims for breach of contract are pleaded; however, we disagree with the plaintiffs implicit characterization of them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Paragraph eighteen of the amended complaint is unartfully drafted. Its language, which presumably was chosen by the plaintiff, fails to define clearly the issues in dispute, for it does not aver material facts with reasonable certainty. See <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 236. The phrase \u201cspecific and implicit promises,\u201d and the word \u201cmethods\u201d are imprecise and, when unaccompanied by further defining language, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>inadequate to convey material facts with reasonable certainty. Only by conjecture or remote implication can a court or an opposing party hope to ascertain what promises were made and which were broken, and what methods were promised and which were employed instead.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Construing paragraph eighteen reasonably, all we discern is that the plaintiff alleges that the defendant (1) breached a contract with the plaintiff, and (2) breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">While paragraph nineteen is also unartfully drafted, it does provide some guidance. In it, the plaintiff claims that the defendant \u201cfailed to make a good faith effort to determine the quality of [his] work,\u201d and he alleges two facts in support of his claim: The defendant (1) \u201cignorfed] the opinions of those qualified to judge the merits of [his] work\u201d and (2) \u201crelied upon the recommendations of the Government Department which were biased, inexpert, and inaccurate.\u201d While the latter of the two facts is averred with reasonable certainty, the former is not, for it does not, inter alia, indicate who is qualified to judge the plaintiffs work. Although we recognize that \u201cessential allegations may not be supplied by conjecture or remote implication\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; we assume arguendo that the former is adequate and that, in it, the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant \u201cignor[ed]\u201d the nine letters appraising his scholarship that were received from professors outside of Wesleyan. Furthermore, in paragraph nineteen, the plaintiff expressly claims only that the defendant breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Because paragraph nineteen begins with the phrase \u201c[m]ore specifically,\u201d the factual allegations contained therein reasonably can be construed as supporting the two claims alleged in paragraph eighteen, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">From here on, we assume arguendo that in the second count of his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached its contract with him, along with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, when it \u201cignor[ed]\u201d the nine letters appraising his scholarship that were received from professors outside of Wesleyan and relied on the department of government\u2019s recommendations, \u201cwhich were biased, inexpert, and <em>inaccu</em>rate..\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As alluded to previously, \u201c[t]he [trial] court has a duty to submit to the jury no issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goodmaster </em>v. Houser, supra, 225 Conn. 648. Our exhaustive review of the record discloses that the jury could not reasonably have found that the defendant \u201cignor[ed]\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the nine letters. The plaintiff did not present any evidence that tended to prove that the defendant did not consider all nine letters before determining that he did not merit tenure. In fact, there was strong evidence to the contrary: The defendant\u2019s employees, namely the tenured faculty, included and discussed excerpts of several of the letters in its letter to the vice president for academic affairs that detailed why it decided not to recommend the plaintiff for tenure. We assume arguendo, however, that the plaintiff instead alleged that the defendant, through the tenured faculty, did not afford enough weight to the nine letters when evaluating the plaintiffs scholarship in connection with his application for tenure. We also conclude that the plaintiff, through that allegation, seeks to prove that the tenured faculty\u2019s determination that he did not merit tenure was inaccu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>rate. Consequently, that factual allegation is subsumed by the plaintiffs remaining factual allegation that the defendant relied on the department of government\u2019s recommendations, \u201cwhich were biased, inexpert, and inaccurate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Regarding the remaining factual allegation, the plaintiff at trial did not argue or present evidence indicating that the tenured faculty was not authorized to consider his application for tenure. In fact, The Blue Book, which was admitted into evidence at trial, overwhelmingly establishes that the tenured faculty was authorized to consider his application for tenure. See footnote 7. The evidence also overwhelmingly establishes that the defendant did not \u201crely\u201d on the tenured faculty\u2019s recommendation <em>until after </em>the plaintiff had exhausted all of the procedural rights of review afforded to him under The Blue Book.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In sum, two contract claims remain: The defendant (1) breached its contract with the plaintiff, along with (2) the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, when some of its employees, specifically, the tenured faculty of the department of government, rendered negative recommendations concerning the plaintiffs tenure application that \u201cwere biased, inexpert, and inaccurate,\u201d recommendations that, in effect, foreclosed the possibility that the defendant would award him tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The Burden</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The plaintiff, in effect, claims also that the court mischaracterized the tenured faculty\u2019s decision not to recommend him for tenure as an academic decision and that, consequently, the court\u2019s instructions to the jury were improper. The plaintiff argues that the court should not have instructed the jury to find in his favor on his contract claims only if he proved by a preponder-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>anee of the evidence that the tenured faculty\u2019s decision not to recommend him for tenure was made arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith. The plaintiff argues that (1) the tenured faculty\u2019s decision not to recommend him for tenure was an employment decision, and (2) consequently, he should not have been required to prove that the tenured faculty acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith to prevail. We conclude that the court properly characterized the tenured faculty\u2019s decision and that the plaintiff was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it made its decision arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">A proper characterization of the tenured faculty\u2019s decision must take into account the language of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant as well as any circumstances that provide assistance in interpreting the contract language. See <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>239 Conn. 574, 582, 687 A.2d 111 (1996). On the present record, that assessment is purely a question of law. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The Blue Book created a hybrid relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, for on its face it enumerates requirements representative of an employment relationship as well as requirements representative of an academic relationship. See id. Under The Blue Book, a full-time, nontenured member of the faculty is required, inter alia, to teach, engage in scholarly pursuits and contribute to the collegial life of the faculty,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the defendant is required, inter alia, to pay him a salary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An inquiry such as whether the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff, for example, concerns a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>representative of an employment relationship. See id., 587 &amp; n.12. In contrast, an inquiry into whether an evaluation of a faculty member\u2019s \u201cteaching,\u201d \u201cscholarship\u201d or \u201ccolleagueship\u201d was accurate, as those terms are defined in The Blue Book,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> concerns a requirement representative of an academic relationship because conducting such evaluations is a specialty that is strongly associated with institutions of higher learning, <em>and </em>such an evaluation \u201chas little to do with the normal attributes of an employee relationship.\u201d Id., 586-87. Because of the hybrid nature of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, a functional analysis of its terms in relation to the alleged breach is required. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The plaintiff, in effect, alleges that the defendant (1) breached its contract with him, along with (2) the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, when some of its employees, specifically, the tenured faculty of the department of government, rendered negative recommendations concerning his tenure application that \u201cwere biased, inexpert, and inaccurate,\u201d recommendations that, in effect, foreclosed the possibility that the defendant would award him tenure. Under The Blue Book, the tenured faculty, when considering an application for tenure, is required to judge the applicant\u2019s performance and promise in three categories: Teaching, scholarship and colleagueship. See footnote 3. As we previously intimated, we conclude that a decision that, on its face, is based exclusively on a faculty member\u2019s \u201cteaching,\u201d \u201cscholarship\u201d and \u201ccolleagueship,\u201d is an academic decision. Accordingly, we conclude that the tenured faculty\u2019s decision in this case not to recommend the plaintiff for tenure is, on its face, an academic decision. Because an academic institution is afforded considerable discretion when, through its employees, it exercises its professional judgment on academic mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ters, the plaintiff was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenured faculty\u2019s decision not to recommend him for tenure was made arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith. See id., 595. In sum, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs claim that the jury instructions were improper.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly excluded the testimony of five expert witnesses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the plaintiffs claim. At trial, the plaintiff offered expert testimony from five of the nine professors outside of Wesleyan who had provided the tenured faculty with written appraisals of his scholarship. The plaintiff offered the five professors\u2019 testimony for the purpose of having each of them (1) explain further the content of his appraisal, specifically (a) his written opinion concerning the quality of the plaintiffs scholarship, (b) his written opinion of the plaintiffs standing in his field among scholars of comparable age and experience, and (c) his written opinion as to whether the plaintiff would merit tenure either at the professor\u2019s institution or at a comparable institution; (2) testify that, in his opinion, the standard employed by the tenured faculty when evaluating the plaintiffs scholarship was \u201cinappropriately narrow;\u201d (3) testify that, in his opinion, the tenured faculty, in its letter to the vice president for academic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>affairs, misrepresented the letters of appraisal in a manner that \u201cwas unsavory in academic quarters\u201d; and (4) testify that, in his opinion, the tenured faculty\u2019s decision not to recommend the plaintiff for tenure was made arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The court did not permit the five professors to present expert testimony; however, all nine letters of appraisal were admitted into evidence, as was the tenured faculty\u2019s letter to the vice president for academic affairs. Furthermore, no evidence was presented that tended to prove that the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed (1) to supplement the definition of scholarship that is expressed in The Blue Book or (2) to evaluate the plaintiffs scholarship in accordance with a standard used by other academic institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. . . . Expert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>250 Conn. 172, 180, 738 A.2d 586 (1999). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 747, 657 A.2d 611 (1995). \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>supra, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We now consider, in the order that they previously were presented, the plaintiffs four purposes for offering the professors\u2019 testimony. First, the plaintiff sought to have each of the professors further explain the content of his letter of appraisal. When the tenured faculty was considering the plaintiffs application for tenure, it did not have the benefit of the explanations of the letters of appraisal that the plaintiff proffered. Moreover, The Blue Book did not require the tenured faculty to solicit such explanations. The issue before the jury was whether the tenured faculty <em>made </em>its decision arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith, and, thus, each of the letters of appraisal, all of which were admitted into evidence, \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>36 Conn. App. 774, 791, 654 A.2d 761, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 922, 656 A.2d 671 (1995). Because the proffered testimony did not have \u201ca logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of [the] issue\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 181; it properly was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Second, the plaintiff sought to have each of the professors testify that, in his opinion, the standard employed by the tenured faculty when evaluating the plaintiffs scholarship was \u201cinappropriately narrow.\u201d At trial, no evidence was presented that tended to establish that the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed (1) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>supplement the definition of scholarship that is expressed in The Blue Book or (2) to evaluate the plaintiffs scholarship in accordance with a standard used by other academic institutions. Moreover, none of the five professors had special knowledge regarding the defendant\u2019s standards for granting tenure. Thus, the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of establishing a proper foundation for that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Third, the plaintiff sought to have each of the professors testify that, in his opinion, the tenured faculty, in its letter to the vice president for academic affairs, misrepresented the letters of appraisal in a manner that \u201cwas unsavory in academic quarters.\u201d Presumably, the plaintiff offered that testimony as circumstantial evidence that the tenured faculty acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> when it decided not to recommend him for tenure. All of the letters that ordinarily would be scrutinized when conducting such an inquiry were admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Expert testimony should be admitted only when, inter alia, the expert\u2019s \u201cskill or knowledge is not common to the average person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Billie, supra, 250 Conn. 180. It is unclear why the jury, absent the assistance of expert testimony, could not have read and compared the letters at issue, and properly discerned whether they constituted evidence of bad faith on the part of the tenured faculty. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its wide discretion in excluding the professors\u2019 testimony. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Fourth, the plaintiff sought to have each of the professors testify that, in his opinion, the tenured faculty\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>decision not to recommend the plaintiff for tenure was made arbitrarily or capriciously. \u201cAn expert witness ordinarily may not express an opinion on an ultimate issue of fact, which must be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). An expert may, however, \u201cgive an opinion on an ultimate issue where the trier, in order to make intelligent findings, needs expert assistance on the precise question on which it must pass. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Rodgers, 207 Conn. 646, 652, 542 A.2d 1136 (1988). The plaintiff did not argue in his briefs to this court or at oral argument why the jury needed expert testimony to decide the ultimate issue in this case. Furthermore, our review of the record does not disclose any basis for concluding that the court abused its wide discretion when it excluded that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly excluded the expert testimony proffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\"> The Blue Book states in relevant part: \u201cPREAMBLE TO FACULTY GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES.

Of particular importance is effectiveness in stimulating the thinking of colleagues, and encouragement and constructive criticism of their work, both on the more formal occasions when Faculty meet for serious discussion and in day-to-day associations with colleagues inside or outside the department.

Bases of Judgment. The usual evidence of scholarly publications consists of books, monographs, and articles published in, or accepted for publication by, recognized scholarly journals. Such evidence might include anthologies, translations, technical reports, reviews, commentaries, textbooks, and so on, where such productions are pertinent to the evaluation of the candidate\u2019s performance and promise as a scholar.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> In the letter, the chaiiperson states in relevant part: \u201cThe decision not to recommend tenure is based principally on our assessment of the scholarly record. The Department\u2019s customary standard for tenure is the completion of a maj or project of research and writing in the form of a book, a monograph, or a series of related articles. We also require significant progress toward the completion of a second scholarly project. In our judgment, Tony has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">***</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u201cTony\u2019s chief scholarly undertaking to date is his manuscript \u2018Labor Mobilization and Labor Policy: The Demise of French Exceptionalism.\u2019 The manuscript is an outgrowth of his dissertation, \u2018Labor and Industrial Change: The Politics of Steel in France.\u2019 Tony did not include the dissertation in the material he submitted for the tenure review. In response to an inquiry from us, he reported that the manuscript and the dissertation were, in his own words, \u2018two very different projects which share the same empirical base.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u201cThe manuscript has not been published in either form, and this weighed heavily in our deliberations. But the lack of a published manuscript was not decisive. All of us agree the manuscript as it now stands needs revisions, and, with one exception, we believe it is in need of major substantive changes before it can be considered a completed, major project of research and writing, even if published in its current draft. Essentially, the project remains unfinished. Let me elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u201cIn his manuscript, Tony undertook a case study of managed capitalism, using France and the French steel industry as his focal point. Case studies of this kind are widely accepted and widely employed in political science. The best case studies go beyond the mere descriptive, or the mere telling of a story. The best are rooted in the literature and are used to confirm, dispute and refine general propositions, and on occasion to generate new ones. In our judgment, Tony\u2019s manuscript does not measure up to what is expected of such a study.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\u201cNor, in our judgment, has Tony produced a series of related articles that would constitute a major project of research and writing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> The Blue Book states in relevant part: \u201cThese general University criteria [i.e., teaching, scholarship and colleagueship] are meant to be interpreted by departments and programs in the specific terms appropriate to their fields and disciplines. Such interpretations, which may be in writing, should be communicated by department and program chairs both to faculty members when hired and to the administration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> It is important to note that the plaintiff never filed a motion for permission to file a second amended complaint. During a trial, whenever a disparity develops between a party\u2019s allegations and the evidence that has been admitted, it is that party\u2019s responsibility to file a motion for permission to amend its pleadings, and then, if permission is granted, to amend its pleadings so that they conform to the evidence.

See <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General </em>Hospital, supra, 239 Conn. 598.
