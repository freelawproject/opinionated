On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied (1) his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because he (a) did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty and (b) was denied the effective assistance of counsel, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(2) his motion to transfer the cases to a particular trial court for sentencing. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our review of the defendant\u2019s claims. On October 16, 1997, the defendant, accompanied by his counsel from the public defender\u2019s office, appeared before the court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>and pleaded guilty to the charges of possession of heroin with intent to sell, possession of narcotics and violation of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to accepting the guilty pleas, Judge Mia\u00f1o canvassed the defendant and concluded that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and tendered with the effective assistance of counsel. The state and the defendant had entered into a plea agreement with respect to the narcotics offenses, whereby the state would recommend a total effective sentence of ten years incarceration, execution suspended after three years and three years probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Mia\u00f1o ordered a presentence investigation. Before the hearing concluded, Judge Mia\u00f1o stated to the defendant, \u201cI think you\u2019re an unusual young man, and if you get in trouble between now and December second, it\u2019s going to hurt you. It\u2019s not going to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">On November 20, 1997, the defendant was arrested and charged with murder. On February 11, 1998, prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to being sentenced for the crimes at issue here, the defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas, and private counsel entered an appearance on behalf of the defendant in lieu of the public defender. The defendant subsequently amended his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Because he had an ongoing business relationship with the defendant\u2019s private counsel, Judge Mia\u00f1o recused himself from the cases and assigned them to another court, <em>Parker, J., </em>for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On July 21,1998, following a hearing conducted over several days, Judge Parker denied the defendant\u2019s amended motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. On July 24, 1998, the day he was scheduled to be sentenced, the defendant filed a motion requesting that the cases be transferred to Judge Mia\u00f1o for sentencing. Judge Parker denied the motion to transfer and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of ten years imprisonment, suspended after three years and three years probation in accordance with the plea agreement, in addition to the reinstatement of the six months incarceration on a previous conviction as a youthful offender. See footnote 2. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that Judge Parker improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 39-27<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because (1) the court accepted his pleas without substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 and, therefore, the defendant did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty, and (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The defendant claims that Judge Parker improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 because his pleas were not accepted in substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that his pleas were not knowing and voluntary because Judge Mia\u00f1o misstated the maximum possible sentence confronting him on the two narcotics charges, which is a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also claims that his public defender misled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The following portion of Judge Miano\u2019s canvass of the defendant pertains to our resolution of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u201cThe Court: Now, on possession with intent to sell, \u00a7 21a-277 (a), your exposure here by law is not less than one year, which is suspendable, up to fifteen years in jail and up to a $50,000 fine. Do you [understand] that?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. And as to the possession of narcotics charge under \u00a7 21a-279 (a), the penalty is up to seven years and not less than one year, which is suspendable, up to seven years in jail and again up to a $50,000 fine. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. So your exposure here by law is not less than one year, which is suspendable, up to twelve years in jail and up to a $100,000 fine. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\u201cThe Court: And added on top of that would be the six months for the violation of probation. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">\u201cThe Court: So your exposure here is not less than one year, which is suspendable, up to twelve years and six months in jail. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The misstatement identified by the defendant is that Judge Mia\u00f1o said the total possible sentence was twelve years and six months rather than twenty-two years and six months, which is the sentence the defendant potentially faced for the narcotics violations, i.e., fifteen years plus seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u201c[0]nce entered, a guilty plea cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the court, within its sound discretion, and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion . . . and that [t]he burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. . . . Those statements, however, apply only to the withdrawal of pleas which are valid in the first instance. . . . Before the imposition of a sentence the trial court is required to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty upon proof of any of the grounds set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-27]. . . . One of these grounds is that [t]he plea was accepted without substantial compliance with [Practice Book \u00a7 39-19].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>53 Conn. App. 243, 247-48, 729 A.2d 795 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u201cThe judicial authority shall not accept the plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that he or she fully understands ... (4) The maximum possible sentence on the charge, including, if there are several charges, the maximum sentence possible from the consecutive sentences and including, when applicable the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)] is an express recognition [t]hat the defendant\u2019s awareness of the maximum sentence possible is an <em>essential </em>factor in determining whether to plead guilty. . . . The length of time a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>have to spend in prison is clearly crucial to a decision of whether or not to plead guilty. . . . Accordingly, Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)] require[s] that the court determine that the defendant fully understands those consequences. . . . We must determine whether the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant accurately of the maximum possible sentence to which his plea exposed him fell below the standard that constitutes substantial compliance with \u00a7 39-19 (4).\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>supra, 53 Conn. 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 361, 497 A.2d 402 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 243, in support of his argument without distinguishing the facts of either of those cases from the facts here. In <em>James, </em>the trial court completely failed to inform the defendant of the maximum possible sentence, and in <em>Bowden, </em>the trial court mistakenly informed the defendant that he faced a maximum sentence of thirty years when he actually faced twenty years imprisonment. The judgments in <em>James </em>and <em>Bow-den </em>were reversed on appeal because the trial courts in those cases did not substantially comply with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4). We are not presented with a similar factual scenario here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The following additional facts concerning the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas before Judge Parker are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the hearing, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>dant admitted that Judge Mia\u00f1o correctly informed him of the maximum term for each of the narcotics offenses with which he was charged. He also admitted that he could add, and that he knew that fifteen and seven equal twenty-two. The defendant\u2019s claim tests the bounds of credulity. <em>In Bowden, </em>the trial court overstated the maximum sentence that could be imposed against the defendant, and that overstatement may have induced the defendant to accept the state\u2019s recommendation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 250. Here, where the court <em>understated </em>the maximum sentence, it is unlikely that this misstatement had any effect on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. Given the fact that the defendant had knowledge of the maximum term of each of the narcotics offenses, we conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas were made knowingly and voluntarily, and that Judge Parker did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because Judge Mia\u00f1o substantially complied with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The defendant also claims that his public defender misled him by assuring him that, despite the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>agreement, the court would sentence the defendant to probation only. That claim lacks merit as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendant\u2019s public defender took the witness stand and testified as follows in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question as to exactly what he advised the defendant concerning the parameters of the plea agreement: \u201cThat he could receive on sentencing day a sentence up to three years of imprisonment followed by a period of probation, during which period of probation the unexecuted balance of the sentence would be hanging over his head as the deterrent in a possible future sentence should he violate any of the conditions of his probation, and that would be the maximum sentence that he could receive. The least sentence that he could receive would be a fully suspended sentence. Well, a fully suspended sentence is certainly what I told [the defendant] would be the least sentence that he could receive, with the suspended portion being as much as, theoretically, as much as ten years and the probation period being as much as three years.\u201d The public defender had eighteen years of experience. The only evidence the defendant produced during the hearing to counter that testimony was his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">That evidence required the court to weigh the credibility of the parties. We repeatedly have stated that credibility is a matter for the trier of fact to determine. \u201cIn a [proceeding] tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . Where there is conflicting evidence . . . we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. . . . The probative force of conflicting evidence is for the trier to determine.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 407, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996). \u201cOn appeal ... [a] factual finding may be rejected by this court only if it is clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coscuna, </em>59 Conn. App. 434, 444-45, 757 A.2d 659 (2000). The court also was aware that the defendant may have been motivated to withdraw his guilty pleas on the narcotics charges because he had been charged with murder subsequent to his pleas. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the court reasonably accepted the public defender\u2019s version of his conversation with the defendant and rejected the testimony of the defendant. We therefore conclude that Judge Parker did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is generally made pursuant to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus rather than in a direct appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). Section 39-27 of the Practice Book, however, provides an exception to that general rule when ineffective assistance of counsel results in a guilty plea. \u201cA defendant must satisfy two requirements ... to prevail on a claim that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. . . . First, he must prove that the assistance was not within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in criminal law .... Second, there must exist such an interrelationship between the ineffective assistance of counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the guilty plea that it can be said that the plea was not voluntary and intelligent because of the ineffective assistance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 342, 497 A.2d 390 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">During the canvass on his guilty plea, Judge Mia\u00f1o asked the defendant: \u201cAnd are you satisfied with the advice your [attorney has] given you?\u201d The defendant answered: \u201cVery, Your Honor, yes.\u201d At the hearing before Judge Parker on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and on appeal, the defendant claims that his public defender rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to file a motion to suppress the narcotics that the police found when they arrested the defendant for a curfew violation. The defendant claims that because he was arrested on the date of his eighteenth birthday, a \u201cstrong possibility existed\u201d that his arrest for violation of a curfew was improper. He further argues that the public defender should have moved to suppress the evidence that was the result of an illegal arrest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">No evidence was presented to Judge Parker that the defendant\u2019s arrest for violation of a curfew occurred on the day when the defendant reached the age of majority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the defendant has not cited any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>law in his brief to this court to support his claim that the narcotics found incident to his arrest were the fruit of an illegal arrest or search. We therefore conclude that the defendant did not meet his burden before Judge Parker of demonstrating how his public defender\u2019s performance was ineffective or that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to transfer his cases to a particular trial court for sentencing and, therefore, his pleas were not made knowingly and voluntarily. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">As previously mentioned, Judge Mia\u00f1o recused himself from the cases and transferred them to Judge Parker. The defendant moved that his cases be transferred back to Judge Mia\u00f1o after Judge Parker denied his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. He argues, on appeal, that he was entitled to be sentenced by Judge Mia\u00f1o because he had entered his pleas in the belief that Judge Mia\u00f1o considered him a good candidate for a fully suspended sentence. He maintains, therefore, that his pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered. The defendant did not raise this claim with respect to the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty pleas when Judge Parker was considering the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. The defendant therefore did not preserve his claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>To obtain review of an unpreserved claim on appeal, a defendant must deserve review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), for claims of a constitutional nature or under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. The defendant here cannot prevail on his unpreserved claim under either doctrine. We therefore decline to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-12\"> We note that the judgment file and the defendant\u2019s appeal form identify the statute as General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278, which we attribute to a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> The defendant, who was eighteen years old at the time of his plea, previously had been convicted as a youthful offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-761) through 54-76n. He originally was sentenced to six months incarceration, execution suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> The prosecutor informed Judge Mia\u00f1o of the plea agreement, stating: \u201cThe state\u2019s recommendation on the possession of heroin with intent to sell, is a ten year sentence, execution suspended alter serving three years and probation for three years. On the possession of narcotics, it\u2019s a concurrent two year sentence, and on the violation of probation, a concurrent six month sentence for a total effective sentence of ten years, execution suspended after three years, probation for a period of three years, this with a right to argue for a lesser sentence at the time of sentencing. And also by agreement, those other two part B criminal files and the four other part B motor vehicle files that I had named before, Your Honor, would be nolled at sentencing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe grounds for allowing the defendant to withdraw his or her plea of guilty after acceptance are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u201c(1) The plea was accepted without substantial compliance with Section 39-19;</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u201c(2) The plea was involuntary, or it was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge or without knowledge that the sentence actually imposed could be imposed . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">\u201c(4) The plea resulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel .. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 provides: \u201cThe judicial authority shall not accept the plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that he or she fully understands:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u201c(1) The nature of the charge to which the plea is offered;</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u201c(2) The mandatory minimum sentence, if any;</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u201c(3) The fact that the statute for the particular offense does not permit the sentence to be suspended;</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\u201c(4) <em>The maximum, possible sentence on the charge, including, if there are several charges, the maximum sentence possible from consecutive sentences </em>and including, when applicable, the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction; and</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">\u201c(5) The fact that he or she has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and the fact that he or she has the right to be tried by a jury or a judge and that at that trial the defendant has the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him or her, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself or herself.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\"> The defendant also claims that Judge Mia\u00f1o improperly informed him that he faced seven years probation when in fact he faced only three years probation. On the basis of our review of that portion of the transcript identified by the defendant, we conclude that there is no factual basis for that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">\u201cThe Court: . . .
