J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4j\">The defendant, Thaddeus Taylor, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of three counts of assault of an employee of the department of correction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-167c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the court improperly (1) ordered, without first holding a hearing, that he be restrained with leg shackles throughout the proceedings, (2) accepted his waiver of his right to counsel without performing an adequate canvass, (3) failed to ensure that he had access to a law library prior to and dining the proceedings, (4) denied his motion to dismiss the assault charges because the proceedings violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), General Statutes \u00a7 54-186 et seq., and (5) interpreted General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-167c (b) as requiring the imposition of a consecutive rather than a concurrent sentence for the assault conviction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant was arrested on July 24, 1996, for assaults of correction department employees after he was involved in an altercation with several correction officers at the New Haven Correctional Center. At that time, he was a sentenced federal prisoner en route to a federal prison in Otisville, New York. The defendant was temporarily transferred to the custody of Connecticut for the resolution of other outstanding charges against him in Enfield and Bridgeport,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was being housed at the New Haven Correctional Center between court appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In late August, 1996, after being arraigned on the assault charges in New Haven, the defendant was transferred back to federal custody and taken to the prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>in Otisville, New York. He was returned to Connecticut on December 3,1996, for trial on the New Haven assault charges and for the Bridgeport case, which was still pending. The Bridgeport case ended in a mistrial. Thereafter, the New Haven charges were resolved in a jury trial lasting from January 21 to February 7, 1997. The defendant acted pro se throughout the proceedings in both Bridgeport and New Haven. The New Haven jury found him guilty of three counts of assault of a correction officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On April 11, 1997, the court sentenced the defendant to twelve years imprisonment, suspended after six years, and five years probation. The court, after considering that it lacked the discretion to order otherwise, held that this sentence was to run consecutively, rather than concurrently, to the term that the defendant already was serving in federal prison. Additional facts will be set forth where pertinent to the claim being addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion in ordering, without holding a hearing, that he wear leg shackles throughout the proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>argues that being shackled infringed on his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial before an impartial jury by unnecessarily suggesting that he was dangerous and implying that he was guilty of the charges against him. He claims further that the shackles interfered with his right to represent himself at trial because they limited his movement and deprived him of the full use of his faculties. We disagree with each of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to those claims. The defendant initially was brought to court for pretrial proceedings in both leg shackles and handcuffs. On January 13, 1997, prior to the start of jury selection, the court granted the defendant\u2019s request to remove the handcuffs but, due to security considerations, denied his request to remove the leg shackles. The trial was being held in a wing of the courthouse that normally was used for civil trials. There was a domestic relations courtroom nearby and, accordingly, many people were present in the hallways. Further, the courtroom in which the defendant was being tried had several entrances that could not adequately be secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Responding to the defendant\u2019s concerns that the shackles would leave a negative impression with the jury, the state\u2019s attorney constructed skirts around both the defense and prosecution tables, and suggested that both sides remain seated while presenting their cases. Alternatively, the state\u2019s attorney suggested that the defendant\u2019s standby counsel could present evidence to the jury while the defendant remained seated at the table. The defendant rejected both of those options. The jury panel was summoned, and the parties proceeded to voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The defendant pointed out his shackles to the first prospective juror, who ultimately was dismissed. The court proceeded to instruct subsequent panel members, before they were questioned, that the fact that the defendant was wearing shackles meant nothing and ought not to weigh in the determination of whether he was guilty of the charges against him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During voir dire, the defendant asked each prospective juror if he or she had any opinion regarding the shackles, and each responded that the shackles would not influence his or her judgment regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt. Some said they had not noticed the shackles until they were pointed out or that they thought they were standard procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A jury was selected and the trial proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to conclusion. In its charge to the jury, the court again instructed it not to consider the shackles as any indication of the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty on three counts of assault of a correction officer. At his sentencing hearing, the defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>a motion for a new trial on the basis of, inter alia, the shackling. The court denied his motion and sentenced him as previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The defendant claims that being shackled deprived him of his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial before an impartial jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also claims that the court improperly failed to hold a hearing on the matter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u201cAs a general proposition, a criminal defendant has the right to appear in court free from physical restraints. . . . Grounded in the common law, this right evolved in order to preserve the presumption favoring a criminal defendant\u2019s innocence, while eliminating any detrimental effects to the defendant that could result if he were physically restrained in the courtroom. . . . \u2018The presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.\u2019 <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126, reh. denied, 426 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 3182, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1194 (1976). . . . Nonetheless, a defendant\u2019s right to appear before the jury unfettered is not absolute. ... A trial court may employ a \u2018reasonable means of restraint\u2019 upon a defendant if, exercising its broad discretion in such matters, the court finds that restraints are \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 under the circumstances. Practice Book \u00a7 892 [now \u00a7 42-46] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn 489, 505, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cIn reviewing a shackling claim, our task is to determine whether the court\u2019s decision to employ restraints constituted a clear abuse of discretion. . . . While appellate review is greatly aided when a court develops the record by conducting an evidentiary hearing concerning the necessity for restraints, \u2018such a hearing is not mandatory.\u2019 ... A record in some fashion disclosing the justification for using restraints, however, is essential to meaningful appellate review of a shackling claim. . . . This is particularly so because of the potential for prejudice in the use of shackles. . . . Accordingly, a trial court must ensure that its reasons for ordering the use of restraints are detailed in the record.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">A court may consider a variety of factors when exercising its discretion to order that a defendant be shackled. \u201cIn view of the fact that the law enforcement personnel at our courthouses are responsible for and possess superior experience in matters of courtroom security, it is practicable for a court to rely heavily upon the advice of such personnel in determining whether a criminal defendant should be restrained. ... A court</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>may also consider other information not in evidence, including official records, information supplied by correctional officers and attorneys, and facts generally known within the limits of its jurisdiction. . . . Such information or knowledge, however, should be placed on the record outside the presence of the jury and the defendant given the opportunity to respond to that information.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 506-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Many courts rejecting claims of improper restraint of criminal defendants in the courtroom have held that the trial court, in exercising its discretion, properly considered the lack of security at the facilities. See, e.g., <em>Patterson v. Estelle, </em>494 F.2d 37, 38 (5th Cir.) (defendant being tried in courtroom with several exits that could not adequately be guarded), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 871, 95 S. Ct. 130, 42 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1974); <em>People v. Burnett, </em>251 Cal. App. 2d 651, 653, 59 Cal. Rptr. 652 (1967) (trial conducted in nonsecure, temporary quarters while courthouse undergoing repairs); <em>People v. Boose, </em>66 Ill. 2d 261, 267, 362 N.E.2d 303 (1977) (nature, physical security of courtroom one of several factors properly considered); <em>People v. Rouse, </em>167 App. Div. 2d 854, 854, 562 N.Y.S.2d 256 (1990) (courtroom had five exits, insufficient security to guard them), aff'd, 79 N.Y.2d 934, 591 N.E.2d 1172, 582 N.Y.S.2d 986 (1992); <em>State v. Tolley, </em>290 N.C. 349, 368, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976) (nature, physical security of courtroom one of several factors properly considered); <em>Commonwealth v. Jasper, </em>531 Pa. 1, 12, 610 A.2d 949 (1992) (proceedings held on Sunday when court lacked usual security).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Courts also have found that the prejudicial effects of shackling were negligible where the defendants were being tried for offenses such as escape from prison or assault of a prison guard. That is because the nature of the charges and the evidence presented would inevitably have conveyed to the jury that the accused already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>was a convict and a prisoner. See, e.g., <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>State, </em>336 Ark. 244, 248, 983 S.W.2d 956 (1999) (affirming conviction for murder of fellow inmate); <em>State ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>329 So. 2d 707, 712 (La. 1976) (affirming conviction for attempted escape); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. 471, 480, 305 N.E.2d 830 (1973) (affirming conviction for assault of correctional officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Here, the court properly based its decision to order that the defendant be shackled on the knowledgeable advice of the sheriffs in the courthouse and on its repeated observation that the trial was being held in a nonsecure arena. Although it did not hold a hearing, the court detailed those reasons on the record. The defendant was allowed to respond to the court\u2019s concerns each time, although the court ultimately rejected his arguments. Further, the court was aware of the violent nature of the crimes of which the defendant was accused and the fact that he allegedly had committed them in a correctional setting,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it rightly considered that as one of several factors in making its decision. See <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 692, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We note that the court and the prosecution made every attempt to conceal from the jury the fact that the defendant was wearing shackles by constructing skirts for the tables and offering to adjust the format of the trial accordingly. The defendant rejected those efforts and, in fact, drew attention to the shackles himself during voir dire. He now claims that it was inevitable that the jury would notice his shackles and draw negative inferences, but that assertion is belied by the jurors\u2019 responses to his questioning on the matter. Many stated that they had not noticed the shackles before the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>dant drew them to their attention. Some jurors expressed a belief that they were standard operating procedure in a criminal trial. See footnote 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Furthermore, the nature of the charges against the defendant made it inevitable that the jury would become aware during the proceedings that he was a sentenced federal prisoner who was in Connecticut to face additional charges at the time of the alleged assaults. Given that the defendant was charged with attacking guards while he was incarcerated, \u201cit is not unreasonable to assume that the jury would naturally expect that, when a defendant inmate appear [s] in court, adequate security measures would be taken . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>195 Conn. 1, 10 n.7, 485 A.2d 570 (1985). In light of the facts and the charges against him, any effect that the shackles may have had on the jury\u2019s impression of the defendant was negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Last, the court gave curative instructions, both during voir dire and before jury deliberations, directing the jurors that the shackles were of no consequence. See footnotes 5 and 7. There is no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption that the jury listened to and followed the court\u2019s curative instructions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the defendant remain shackled throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The defendant also argues that being shackled interfered with his right to self-representation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In its recent holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>251 Conn. 768, 742 A.2d 786 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1094, 120 S. Ct. 1734, 146 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2000), our Supreme Court addressed a defendant\u2019s claim that being shackled violated his right to self-representation. The court rejected that claim, noting that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s decision to proceed pro se does not vitiate the trial court\u2019s ability to employ a reasonable means of restraint upon [the] defendant if, exercising its broad discretion in such matters, the court finds that restraints are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 787. Moreover, the court found that there was \u201cno showing that the shackles denied the defendant \u2018actual control over the case he [chose] to present to the jury.\u2019 \u201d Id., 787-88. Accordingly, the court found no abuse of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Similarly, the defendant in the present case has made no such showing. He argues only that the shackles embarrassed him and restricted his freedom of movement. The record reveals that he was able to stand, move around the courtroom, call witnesses, introduce evidence, object to the state\u2019s evidence and direct the witnesses\u2019 attention toward portions of a videotape. He had full use of his hands to gesture and take notes. The defendant\u2019s case strategy largely consisted of attempting to impeach the credibility of witnesses, and he has not argued that the shackles impaired his ability to do that. Nor does he say how he would have presented his case differently had the restraints been removed. The defendant has not shown that he lacked actual control over the case he presented to the jury. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the defendant remain shackled throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The defendant next claims that his waiver of counsel was ineffective because the court did not properly can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>vass him pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 to ensure that his waiver of the right to counsel was voluntary and intelligent. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court never cautioned him regarding the dangers of self-representation. See Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (4). Alternatively, the defendant claims that even if the court\u2019s canvass was adequate, he conditioned his waiver on having access to a law library. We disagree with each of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">At the defendant\u2019s July 26, 1996 arraignment for the assault charges in New Haven, the defendant, who already had been proceeding pro se in his case in Bridgeport, informed the court that he wanted to proceed pro se in New Haven as well. Attorney Shawn G. Tieman of the public defender\u2019s office had been appointed to represent the defendant at that hearing and subsequently was dismissed. The court, <em>Lager, J., </em>did not canvass the defendant regarding his waiver of counsel, stating that it more appropriately would be done in future proceedings. In a motion dated August 8, 1996, the defendant requested the appointment of standby counsel and, on August 23, 1996, the court, <em>McMahon, J., </em>granted his request. At the January 13, 1997 pretrial proceedings, held to address several motions that the defendant had filed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court, <em>Clark, J., </em>noted that the defendant had decided to proceed pro se and that standby counsel had been appointed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court verified that the defendant could read. The court proceeded to read to the defendant the statute under which he had been charged and explained to him the sentence to which he was exposed. In response to the court\u2019s query about whether he understood that information, the defendant answered affirmatively. The court also determined that the defendant recently had been evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ated and judged competent in connection with the proceedings in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The court then asked the defendant whether Judge Lager had advised him about his right to counsel and the defendant replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The court then asked him whether he had been read the provisions of the rules of practice regarding his waiver of that right, referring generally to their content.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant replied that it was \u201c[his] best recollection [that] it was absolutely clear that [he] wanted to go pro se.\u201d The court also discussed with the defendant the provisions of the rules of practice that explain the duties of standby counsel, which the defendant said that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The court then asked the defendant to answer questions about himself, explaining that \u201ceven though it\u2019s been made sure in Judge Lager\u2019s mind, but just to make sure in my mind that you\u2019re competent to defend yourself.\u201d The defendant told the court that he had three and one-half years of college education, a similar amount of experience as a Connecticut correction officer and that he had served in the National Guard. The court remarked \u201cthat [the defendant] seemjed] to be competent to represent [him]self \u2019 and, accordingly, found that he was competent to do so. Throughout the January 13, 1997 hearing, the defendant argued clearly and coherently in support of a number of his motions and evinced a solid understanding of court procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>On January 14, 1997, the pretrial proceedings continued. Directly after the lunch recess, the court stated, apparently referring to an earlier off-the-record discussion, \u201cNow, just to reiterate a little bit, we spent time discussing the obligations and rights to represent oneself, and the pitfalls of doing that. And we viewed the matter of <em>[State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 661 A.2d 539 (1995), regarding competency to proceed pro se], as well as the Practice Book sections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On January 21, 1997, after a jury had been selected, the court again made an effort to assure itself that the defendant was competent to continue representing himself, reiterating what it already had conveyed and warning the defendant of the dangers of self-representation. The defendant again chose to continue pro se.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThere is no question that a defendant in a criminal matter has the right to represent himself and waive the assistance of an attorney. [Id., 820], He properly exercises this right of self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>counsel. Id., 821. Several criteria must be met, to the satisfaction of the trial court, before a defendant in a criminal case may properly be allowed to proceed pro se, as set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 429, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). The waiver of counsel will be allowed only after the trial court makes a thorough inquiry and is satisfied that the following four conditions are met: The defendant (1) has been clearly advised of his right to the assistance of counsel, including his right to the assignment of counsel if he is so entitled, (2) possesses the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of the decision to represent himself, (3) comprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings, the range of permissible punishments, and any additional facts essential to a broad understanding of the case, and (4) has been made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. Practice Book \u00a7 44-3.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Copp, </em>54 Conn. App. 695, 702, 736 A.2d 941, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 901, 743 A.2d 615 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The defendant does not claim that his waiver of counsel was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, but only that the court\u2019s canvass was not adequate to ascertain a valid waiver. \u201c[A] defendant, however, does not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing. ... In other words, the court may accept a waiver of the right to counsel without specifically questioning a defendant on each of the factors listed in Practice Book \u00a7 961 if the record is sufficient to establish that the waiver is voluntary and knowing.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 429; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 653-58, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cSome of the factors bearing on the defendant\u2019s capacity include age, education, mental health, prior experience with criminal trials and consultation with counsel prior to proceeding pro se, although none of these inquiries is a constitutional necessity. . . . However, a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation .... Rather a record that affirmatively shows that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>47 Conn. App. 271, 277-78, 702 A.2d 1206 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 904, 714 A.2d 3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cThe fact that the defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself was misguided or based on his erroneous perceptions of . . . his own ability to defend himself and resulted in a conviction is of no consequence. We review the record to determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was competent to make the decision to waive counsel, and that his decision was made in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent fashion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 822.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Copp, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">On January 13, 1997, the court encountered, by all appearances, a competent and knowledgeable pro se defendant. The court knew that he had been representing himself in Bridgeport. The defendant had the chance to confer with court-appointed counsel before he directed the dismissal of that counsel. Further, the defendant already was deeply enmeshed in self-representation in the New Haven case, filing a large number of pretrial motions and, presently, coherently arguing in support of several of them. The court, understandably, believed the defendant when he stated that he had been canvassed on his waiver of counsel in the prior proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ings. Nonetheless, the court engaged in a fairly thorough discussion with the defendant to convince itself that the defendant was competent and that his waiver was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The court discussed the charges against the defendant, reading him the relevant statute and verifying that he understood it and the sentence to which he was exposed. The court inquired about the defendant\u2019s educational background, ascertaining that he had nearly completed college. It was apparent that the defendant knew that he had the right to have counsel appointed in that he had dismissed earlier public defenders and secured standby counsel. The court remarked on the record that it was satisfied as to the defendant\u2019s competence to represent himself. It is clear from the record, and the defendant does not contest, that the first three requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 thus were met on January 13, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The defendant argues that the court failed to apprise him of the dangers of self-representation, as directed by Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (4). We note that the transcript of January 14, 1997, indicates that this was discussed off the record and that the court clearly conveyed to the defendant the warnings regarding the pitfalls of proceeding pro se, on the record, prior to the start of evidence on January 21, 1997. Because our case law has established that literal compliance with the rules of practice, i.e., a specifically formatted canvass covering all four subsections of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, is not required for a court to find a valid waiver of the right to counsel, we are unconvinced that any delay in the delivery of the warning in subsection (4) rendered the court\u2019s inquiry inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s acceptance of his waiver of counsel was improper because that waiver was conditioned on his having access to a law library. As discussed more fully in part III, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>repeatedly complained to the court, throughout the pretrial proceedings and the early days of trial, that he needed access to a law library. The court initially ordered that access be granted, but vacated that order midtrial, on January 31, 1997, when it learned that access was neither feasible nor, apparently, legally required. The defendant continued to represent himself after the court vacated the order. He remained pro se to the conclusion of the trial and also at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u201c[A] waiver of the right to counsel must be clear and unequivocal. <em>Faretta, </em>v. <em>California, </em>[422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975)]____\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 829. \u201cWhen a defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to self-representation is not clear and unequivocal, recognition of the right becomes a matter entrusted to the exercise of discretion by the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>200 Conn. 607, 613-14, 513 A.2d 47 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">It is clear from the record that the defendant, from his experiences in other correctional facilities, believed that he would have access to a law library. He was insistent about his desire to use a law library until the court vacated its access order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It also is clear that the defendant waived his right to counsel unconditionally at the start of the proceedings. The defendant accompanied a subsequent reassertion of his desire to proceed pro se<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> with a reiteration of his need to use a law library, but did not explicitly condition the former on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the latter. Though proximate in time, the defendant\u2019s expressions of the desire to proceed pro se and the need to use the law library were independent of one another. We emphasize that the defendant chose to continue with self-representation even after it was established definitively that library access was not forthcoming. That evidences the defendant\u2019s inclination to proceed pro se in any event. The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in allowing the defendant to exercise his right to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">After our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant competently made the decision to proceed pro se, and made his decision knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The defendant next claims that, because he did not have access to a law library while preparing for trial, his right to self-representation was infringed. See footnote 12. He argues that the appointment of standby counsel was insufficient to rectify that constitutional defect. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. While he was in Connecticut to be tried on the charges at issue in this appeal, the defendant was held at Northern Correctional Institution (Northern), a maximum security facility. He complained repeatedly throughout the proceedings that he did not have access to a law library at Northern.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court initially ordered that the defendant have access to a law library, but later vacated that order on January 31, 1997, after hearing testimony from Margaret Q. Chappie, assistant attorney general, and John J. Armstrong, commissioner of correction. Chappie testified as to the security situation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Northern and why the defendant was being housed there. She noted that the institution had some law books, but not a formal library. She explained that, because of the defendant\u2019s history of violent and disruptive behavior and his past employment as a correction officer, a transferral to a less secure facility with greater library resources was not advisable. Chappie emphasized the importance of leaving to the department of correction the discretion over where to house prisoners and how to manage its facilities. She noted that this discretion would be undermined by courts ordering that library access be given to certain defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Armstrong also spoke of the security level at Northern and about the types of prisoners housed there. He noted that there was only a loose collection of legal reference materials at Northern and that they were not maintained or kept up to date. He explained that it was not a formal, staffed library and that only death row inmates were permitted access to the materials. Armstrong also explained why the defendant was considered a high security risk. After considering the testimony and the current case law, the court vacated the order allowing the defendant access to a law library.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We decline to analyze at length the issue of whether an incarcerated pro se defendant must have access to a law library because it was recently addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>254 Conn. 637, 758 A.2d 842 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 913, 121 S. Ct. 1247, 149 L. Ed. 2d 153 (2001). In that case, the court held that neither the sixth nor the fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, nor article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut mandate that an incarcerated pro se defendant have access to a law library where state financed legal assistance is available instead. Id., 653-57. Specifically, the court held that the provision of standby counsel afforded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>defendant an adequate link to the legal information necessary for self-representation. Id., 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendant filed his brief for this appeal prior to the court\u2019s decision in <em>Fernandez </em>and submitted a reply brief after the decision was released. He concedes that <em>Fernandez </em>controls and, therefore, his right to represent himself was not violated because he was denied access to a law library. The defendant still argues, nonetheless, that his standby counsel did not provide adequate access to legal materials in that counsel did not provide all of the materials that the defendant desired or give the defendant advice supported by thorough research.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The <em>Fernandez </em>court established a bright line rule articulated as follows: \u201c[A] criminal defendant who knowingly and intelligently waives the right to counsel and who has been appointed standby counsel is not constitutionally entitled to access to a law library. Rather, the appointment of standby counsel satisfies the state\u2019s obligation to provide the defendant with access to the courts. . . . [T]he role of standby counsel is essentially to be present with the defendant in court and to supply the limited assistance provided for in Practice Book \u00a7 44-5,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the provision governing the firnc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>tion of standby counsel. . . . <em>[S\\tandby counsel does not, however, have any obligation to perform legal researchfor the </em>defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The defendant asks that we ignore the plain language of that recently enunciated rule and hold that his standby counsel was required to perform legal research. That we cannot do. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vas, </em>44 Conn. App. 70, 78, 687 A.2d 1295, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 910, 689 A.2d 474 (1997). We hold that the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to represent himself were not infringed under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The defendant next claims, on a variety of theories, that the proceedings violated provisions of the IAD.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion of this claim. The defendant was a sentenced federal prisoner as of April 4, 1996. On or about May 31, 1996, he was brought to Connecticut to face charges for offenses he allegedly committed in April and May, 1995. The record indicates that he was held in Rhode Island during his federal trial and was en route to a designated facility in Otisville, New York. On July 24, 1996, while being held at the New Haven Correctional Center, he committed the assaults for which he was convicted, which conviction he now appeals. As a result of those assaults, the defendant was transferred to Northem, a higher security facility, that same day. The defendant was arraigned on the assault charges on July 26, 1996. The state\u2019s attorney secured his presence in court that day by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad respondendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">On August 15, 1996, the defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-39 and 43-40, in which he stated that he was in the custody of the Connecticut department of correction pursuant to a \u201chabeas.\u201d His release to the federal authorities was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>delayed so that motion could be addressed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On August 23, 1996, the court, <em>McMahon, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s speedy trial motion and, after determining that he was only temporarily in the custody of Connecticut, ordered that the state\u2019s attorney file an interstate detainer to secure the defendant\u2019s presence before the proceedings could continue. On August 27, 1996, the defendant was returned to federal custody and transported to the New York prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">On September 3, 1996, the state\u2019s attorney sent the warden at Otisville, New York, a copy of the New Haven information containing the assault charges and asked that it be lodged against the defendant. The United States Department of Justice lodged the information as a detainer on September 11, 1996, and the defendant was returned to Connecticut on December 3,1996. After the still pending proceedings in Bridgeport ended in a mistrial, the defendant was tried on the assault charges in New Haven. Voir dire for the New Haven trial commenced on January 15, 1997. The trial concluded on February 7,1997. At the start of the New Haven proceedings, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that the trial violated provisions of the IAD, and argued that his May 31,1996 presence in Connecticut had been secured pursuant to that statute and that the current proceedings were in violation of its provisions. The court denied his motion, finding the IAD provisions inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cThe IAD is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact the interpretation of which presents a question of federal law. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 442, 101 S. Ct. 703, 66 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1981).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>203 Conn. 494, 498, 525 A.2d 502 (1987). \u201cOur standard of review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>[defendant\u2019s] claim is plenary. We must decide whether the court\u2019s conclusion is legally and logically correct and find[s] support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pinto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 24, 30, 768 A.2d 456, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 906, 772 A.2d 596 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the IAD is to establish a cooperative procedure for disposition of charges against a prisoner in one state who is wanted to respond to untried criminal charges in another state. General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, art. I. The IAD is activated when the state seeking the prisoner (the receiving state) files written notice that he is wanted to answer charges in that state. [General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, art. IV.] This notice, referred to as a detainer, is simply a notification filed with the institution in which the prisoner is serving a sentence, advising that he is wanted to face pending criminal charges in another jurisdiction. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 359, 98 S. Ct. 1834, 56 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1978).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>57 Conn. App. 478, 481-82, 749 A.2d 67 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The IAD is intended to expedite the disposition of untried charges against incarcerated defendants in support of programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation, and thus contains two speedy trial trigger mechanisms. <em>Narel </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>185 Conn. 562, 567, 441 A.2d 177 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928, 102 S. Ct. 1974, 72 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1982). Once a detainer has been lodged by the receiving state, \u201cthe time clock can be activated by the detainee, under article III, or by the prosecuting authority in the [receiving] state, under article IV.\u201d Id. In this case, the parties agree that the applicable provision of the IAD is article IV (c), which requires trial on the untried charges to begin within \u201cone hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state\u201d and to be completed before the prisoner is returned to the original place of incarceration. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>footnote 22. (The latter requirement is known as an \u201cantishuttling\u201d provision.) If the receiving state violates the time limits proscribed by the statute [or its antishut-tling provisions], the pending charge or charges must be nullified and dismissed with prejudice, and the detainer invalidated. <em>Narel </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>supra, 569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The defendant first argues that he was brought to Connecticut on May 31, 1996, pursuant to the IAD and, therefore, his return to the federal authorities and subsequent transfer back to Connecticut to face the assault charges violated the speedy trial and antishuttling provisions of article IV of the IAD. He claims that, once he was here initially, Connecticut was obligated to try all outstanding charges against him within 120 days and before returning him to federal custody, including those resulting from the July, 1996 assaults. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">First, we note that the record does not establish that the defendant was originally in Connecticut pursuant to the IAD. The record lacks copies of the documentation pursuant to which the defendant initially was transferred to the Connecticut authorities, and, otherwise, contains conflicting characterizations of the transfer.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide this court with an adequate record as to the issues raised for review. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. \u201cFor purposes of this section, the term \u2018record\u2019 . . . includes all trial court decisions, <em>documents </em>and exhibits necessary and appropriate for appellate review of any claimed impropriety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Failure to do so will result in abandonment of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Even if we assume arguendo that the defendant initially was brought to Connecticut pursuant to a detainer and that the IAD provisions applied, there still would be no violation on the facts of this case. By the plain language of \u00a7 54-186, the statute\u2019s provisions apply only to trial on charges that form the <em>basis of the detainer, </em>that is, the reason for its being lodged. See footnote 22. Because the assaults and the charges therefor did not even occur until the defendant already was in Connecticut, they clearly were not the reason for, i.e., the basis of, the May 31, 1996 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The defendant claims that charges arising <em>after </em>a prisoner is brought to a state pursuant to a detainer also must be disposed of in compliance with the IAD, but cites no case law in support of that assertion. To the contrary, our review of the case law discloses that courts considering the issue, or analogous ones, have held that the IAD requirements apply only to the charges specifically contemplated by the detainer. See, e.g., <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>State, </em>719 S.W.2d 86, 89-90 (Mo. App. 1986) (no violation of speedy trial provision for delayed robbery trial where detainer had been filed against defendant on some charges but not robbery charge); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Boyd, </em>451 Pa. Super. 404, 409-10, 679 A.2d 1284 (1996) (no violation of speedy trial provision where Pennsylvania tried defendant for new charges that were not basis of detainer to New Jersey authorities), appeal denied, 547 Pa. 723, 689 A.2d 230 (1997). We hold that, because the defendant was not in Connecticut\u2019s custody in July, 1996, pursuant to a detainer based on the assault charges, his transfer to federal custody in August, 1996, and subsequent return to Connecticut for trial on those charges in January, 1997, did not violate the speedy trial or antishuttling provisions of the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The defendant further argues that a July 24, 1996 \u201ctemporary surrender form\u201d or, alternatively, the New Haven state\u2019s attorney\u2019s request that he remain in state custody after being released by the Bridgeport court operated as effective detainers, and he claims various violations of the IAD premised on those assertions. We decline to address those claims because the record is unclear as to the exact nature of those communications<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and, further, because the defendant provides sparse legal analysis as to why they ought to be considered detainers. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10; <em>State v. Miller, </em>59 Conn. App. 406, 409-10, 757 A.2d 69 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 942, 769 A.2d 60 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Last, the defendant claims that even if we find the September 11,1996 formal detainer to be the only operative one as to the assault charges, there still was a violation of the IAD because he was not brought to trial until 126 days after the filing of that detainer. That claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The defendant does not contest the validity of the September 11, 1996 detainer. As previously discussed, we reject his claims that any earlier communications between state and federal officials constituted detainers and, thus, accept that only the September 11, 1996 detainer was operative for purposes of the IAD and the assault charges against the defendant. The defendant argues that his trial commenced 126 days after the filing of the detainer and after a continuance was granted in his absence, contrary to the IAD. In so claiming, the defendant ignores the plain language of the statute, which requires that \u201ctrial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days <em>of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state\u201d; </em>(emphasis added) General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, art. IV (c); <em>not </em>within 120 days of the lodging of the detainer. The defendant arrived in Connecticut on December 3, 1996. His trial commenced in mid-January, 1997, well within the IAD speedy trial deadline, and was concluded by mid-February, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the defendant\u2019s trial proceedings did not violate the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly interpreted \u00a7 53a-167c (b) as requiring the imposition of a sentence consecutive to the one he already was serving in federal prison. He argues that the statute mandates consecutive sentencing only if the convicted prisoner is serving a sentence in a Connecticut prison at the time of the assault. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>At his sentencing hearing, the defendant asked the court to impose his sentence concurrently to the federal one that he already was serving. The court imposed a consecutive sentence. In its July 7, 1998 articulation, the court reiterated its belief that, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-167c (b), it lacked discretion to impose a concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Section 53a-167c (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAssault of a[n] . . . employee of the department of correction ... is a class C felony. If any person who is confined in an institution or facility of the department of correction is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for assault of an employee of the department of correction under this section, such term shall run consecutively to the term for which the person was serving at the time of the assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Whether \u00a7 53a-167c (b) requires a consecutive rather than concurrent sentence in the current circumstances is a question of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>61 Conn. App. 9, 13-14, 762 A.2d 480 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 933, 767 A.2d 104 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that penal statutes . . . are to be strictly construed to protect the fundamental constitutional right to liberty. . . . Equally fundamental, however, is the principle of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 630, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986). \u201c[T]he application of common sense to the language of a penal law is not to be excluded in a way which would involve absurdity or frustrate the evident design of the lawgiver.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 630-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) is to prevent and punish injurious behavior intended to interfere with public servants\u2019 performing their duties.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>37 Conn. App. 338, 347, 656 A.2d 672, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 906, 657 A.2d 644 (1995). \u201cThe statute is intended to protect peace officers in the performance of their duty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 631. It is common sense that the mechanism of mandatory consecutive sentencing for assaults of correction officers is meant to deter such assaults by disallowing what would essentially amount to a free ride for such an offense, i.e., a prisoner who received a concurrent sentence for an assault of a correction officer would be no worse off for having committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The defendant was confined in the New Haven Correctional Center, a \u201cfacility of the department of correction,\u201d and committed assaults upon \u201cemployee[s] of the department of correction . . . acting in the performance of [their] duties.\u201d His actions, therefore, were precisely those that \u00a7 53a-167c was intended to deter. The defendant\u2019s argument implies that the legislature did not intend to deter federal prisoners from assaulting Connecticut correction employees, only state prisoners. That construction defies common sense. We find that the legislature intended to deter <em>all </em>prisoners being held in Connecticut facilities, whether there temporarily or for the duration of a sentence, from assaulting employees of those facilities. The court, therefore, correctly determined that it lacked discretion to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>defendant\u2019s sentence concurrently to his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\"> The defendant was acquitted on a fourth count of assault of an employee of the department of correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-167e (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault of a[n] . . . employee of the department of correction . . . when, with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable . . . employee of the department of correction . . . from performing his duty, and while such . . . employee ... is acting in the performance of his duties, (1) he causes physical injury to such . . . employee . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> Those charges are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> The defendant argues further that the court improperly allowed to be in the courtroom two correction officers wearing bulletproof vests and that the officers\u2019 presence violated his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. The defendant objected several times to the court\u2019s order that he be shackled and, therefore, clearly preserved that issue for our review. The defendant did not object, however, to the presence of the correction officers in the courtroom and now requests review pursuant to the doctrine enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Pursuant to <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239\u201440.

Writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum generally are held not to be detainers within the meaning of the IAD. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>supra, 436 U.S. 361; see also annot., 98 A.L.R.3d 149 \u00a7 9[b] (1980), and cases discussed therein.

Therein, the court refers to his initial presence in Connecticut as being pursuant to the IAD. The court, however, did not state any basis for that finding or even characterize it as a finding.
