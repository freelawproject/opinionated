J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO0\">The defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff on her two count complaint. We affirm the judgment of the trial court with the exception of the $625 in attorney\u2019s fees that the court awarded to the plaintiff on the first count of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff, an attorney, brought this collection action in two counts. In the first count, the plaintiff alleged that in July, 1996, she was retained by the defendants to perform services in a real estate matter involving the Silver Meadow Condominium Association. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants agreed to pay her $100 per hour through December 31, 1997, and $110 per hour as of January 1, 1998. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants owed her the sum of $4845.70 for her work in that matter. In the second count, the plaintiff alleged that on or about July 28, 1997, the defendants retained her in a foreclosure action pursuant to a signed retainer agreement. The agreement provided that the defendants were to pay the plaintiff $100 per hour and to reimburse the plaintiff for any out of pocket costs. The agreement also provided that the defendants would be responsible for all costs of collection, attorney\u2019s fees and statutory interest for unpaid balances. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants owed her the sum of $9863.47 for her work in that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The plaintiff prevailed at trial and was awarded $4414.57 plus $625 in attorney\u2019s fees on the first count, and $9663.47 plus $1450 in attorney\u2019s fees on the second count. The defendants filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendants challenge the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees on each count of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The defendants first argue that the court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees on count one, the Silver Meadow case, where there was no evidence of a contractual or statutory basis for such an award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">\u201cIn the United States, the general rule of law known as the American Rule is that a prevailing litigant ordinarily is not entitled to collect a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the opposing party as part of his or her damages or costs. . . . There are certain exceptions to this rule. ... In the main, exceptions are based upon statutory or contract provisions authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a prevailing litigant. . . . Attorney\u2019s fees may also be awarded as a component of punitive damages.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Raph </em>v. <em>Vogeler, </em>45 Conn. App. 56, 65, 695 A.2d 1066, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 920, 696 A.2d 342 (1997). In the present case, no exception exists that would justify the award of attorney\u2019s fees on count one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We, therefore, vacate that portion of the court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The defendants next argue that the court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff on the second count when there was no evidence of attorney\u2019s fees presented to the court. The defendants, relying on <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 440 A.2d 306 (1982), argue that because the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence as to the amount of attorney\u2019s fees incurred, the award of attorney\u2019s fees was improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The parties\u2019 contract regarding the foreclosure matter specifically states: \u201cIt is further understood that if client defaults in payment of the fee and/or costs, he/she shall be responsible for all costs of collection and attorney\u2019s fees incurred therein and statutory interest for unpaid balance(s).\u201d The contract, therefore, authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The court awarded $1450 to the plaintiff as attorney\u2019s fees for her work in this matter. The court\u2019s decision, however, does not indicate how it calculated this amount, and the defendants did not seek an articulation from the court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">It is the appellant\u2019s duty to furnish this court with a record that is adequate to afford review. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Without knowing the basis for the court\u2019s award, any decision by this court respecting this claim would be entirely speculative. <em>Alix </em>v. <em>Leech, </em>45 Conn. App. 1, 5, 692 A.2d 1309 (1997). In view of the inadequate record, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The defendants raise several claims regarding the calculation of the plaintiffs fees. The defendants first claim that the court improperly awarded damages for hourly charges to the plaintiff for work done prior to trial in the foreclosure case. The defendants further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>claim that the court improperly found that the plaintiff had sustained her burden of proof regarding damages where she could not specify the amount on her billings that were improper charges for secretarial time. The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the plaintiff already has been paid the full value of services rendered to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">As with the defendants\u2019 claim regarding attorney\u2019s fees on count two of the plaintiffs complaint, the record is inadequate to review these claims. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is silent regarding its interpretation of the fee agreement in the foreclosure case, and, absent an articulation of the court\u2019s reasoning, we are unable to review the claim that the plaintiff billed for work done prior to that action. Similarly, although the court found that it was improper for the plaintiff to bill at her own hourly rate when she performed a secretarial task,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court made no findings regarding a secretary billing for his or her time at the plaintiffs hourly rate. We are, therefore, unable to review that claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees on count one and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified to eliminate the award of attorney\u2019s fees on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Count one of the plaintiffs complaint is directed against Paul R. Brown, doing business as Greentrees, LLC, and/or Greentrees Development, LLC, and/or Greentrees, Ltd., and Decorator Telephone Company, Inc. Count two is directed against Paul R. Brown and Decorator Telephone Company, Inc. The present appeal was filed by Paul R. Brown, Greentrees Development, LLC, and Decorator Telephones, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fifteen per cent of the amount of any judgment which is entered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> In so holding, we note the defendants\u2019 reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa, entitled \u201cAttorney\u2019s fees limited in actions on consumer contracts or leases.\u201d That statute provides: \u201c(a) The holder of any contract or lease entered into on or before October 1, 1979, the subject of which is money, property or services intended to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes and which contains a provision for payment of attorney\u2019s fees of a creditor, seller or lessor, shall not receive, claim or collect any paymentfor attorney\u2019s fees (1) for an attorney who is asalaried employee of such holder or (2) prior to the commencement of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">\u201c(b) If a lawsuit in which money damages are claimed is commenced by an attorney who is not a salaried employee of the holder of a contract or lease subject to the provisions of this section, such holder may receive or collect attorney\u2019s fees, if not otherwise prohibited by law, of not more than</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> The court credited the balance due on the foreclosure case by $200 as a result of this billing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> The defendants\u2019 last claim is that the plaintiff already has been paid the full value of services rendered to the defendants. Specifically, the defendants argue that the plaintiff was paid for 60 percent of the invoices that she submitted and that, coupled with the plaintiffs improper billing, the plaintiff has failed to establish that she was entitled to any more than she received. Our conclusion that there is an inadequate record to review the defendants\u2019 claim of improper billing is dispositive of this claim as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
