On appeal, the respondent claims that the court (1) abused its discretion in denying her motion for visitation and (2) imper-missibly delegated to the department of children and families (department) and to the child\u2019s paternal aunt and uncle the responsibility of determining, in the future, whether visitation by the respondent is in the child\u2019s best interest. We conclude that the court properly denied the respondent\u2019s motion for visitation, but impermissibly delegated to the department and to the aunt and uncle its independent obligation to determine and further the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. On May 29, 1998, the respondent gave birth to a daughter. Shortly thereafter, the respondent voluntarily placed the child in a foster home associated with Lutheran Social Services of New England (social services agency), a private, nonprofit social service agency. She asked the social services agency to assist her in placing the child up for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>On June 12, 1998, the respondent informed the social services agency that she no longer wanted to put the child up for adoption. Three days later, however, the respondent reconsidered, and the social services agency continued to provide a foster home for the child. She later reconsidered again. On July 16, 1998, the respondent took the child home.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Only eight days later, on July 24, 1998, the respondent became overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for the child and voluntarily placed her in the care of the department. As the end of the period of voluntary placement was nearing, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) applied for an order of temporary custody pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46b-129 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 32-6 (a).3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On November 24, 1998, the court granted the commissioner\u2019s application. The trial court renewed the order of temporary custody on December 3, 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">On February 10, 1999, a paternity test revealed that the respondent\u2019s ex-husband was the child\u2019s father. On February 22, 1999, the department placed the child in the care of her paternal aunt and uncle. On December 1, 1999, the commissioner moved for review of its permanency plan for the child pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (k) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As articulated in its motion, the commissioner intended to petition for the termination of parental rights with respect to the child to allow the child\u2019s paternal aunt and uncle to adopt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">On January 24,2000, pursuant to an agreement among the respondent, the father, and the aunt and uncle, the court adjudicated the child a neglected child and committed her to the custody of the commissioner for twelve months, as permitted by General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46b-129 (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ten days later, on February 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>2000, the respondent filed a motion for an order of visitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Practice Book (2000) \u00a7 25-4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On February 10, 2000, at the conclusion of a two day hearing, the court approved the commissioner\u2019s permanency plan and denied the respondent\u2019s motion for visitation. On March 30, 2000, the respondent appealed, challenging the court\u2019s approval of the permanency plan and its denial of her motion for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>On June 2, 2000, the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for, inter alia, the lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On July 13, 2000, this court concluded that the approval of a permanency plan was not a final judgment and, accordingly, granted the motion to dismiss the appeal as to the respondent\u2019s challenge to the permanency plan that the trial court had approved for the child. This court denied, however, the motion to dismiss the challenge to the visitation order, concluding that a visitation order entered in the course of a termination proceeding was a final judgment for the purposes of appellate review. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The respondent first claims that the court abused its discretion in denying her motion for visitation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The guiding principle in determining whether visitation is proper is the best interest of the child. \u201cIn making or modifying any order with respect to custody or visitation, the court shall ... be guided by the best interests of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe best interests of the child include the child\u2019s interests in sustained growth, development, well-being, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>continuity and stability of its environment. . . . The trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining what is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Schult </em>v. <em>Schult, </em>241 Conn. 767, 777, 699 A.2d 134 (1997). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did. . . . Accordingly, it is only in rare instances that the trial court\u2019s decision will be disturbed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 175, 708 A.2d 949 (1998). With this standard in mind, we turn to the respondent\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this claim. The court requested that Carol Swenson, a psychologist, evaluate the respondent\u2019s level of psychological functioning and her capacity to care for and interact with the child. The court also requested that Swenson conduct a similar evaluation of the father, and evaluate the nature of the relationship between the child and her potential adult caregivers, her aunt and uncle. On July 8,1999, Swenson interviewed and evaluated the respondent, and, on July 6,1999, she interviewed and evaluated the father. Swen-son also observed the child interact with her aunt and uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On August 16, 1999, the court received a written report from Swenson, which included the results of her evaluations of the respondent<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>father.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In her report, Swenson stated: \u201cIt is my recommendation that [the respondent\u2019s] and [the father\u2019s] parental rights be terminated and that [the aunt and uncle] adopt [the child]. It is recommended that this be an open adoption but that [the child\u2019s] contact with [the respondent] be quite limited during the early years as [the respondent\u2019s] behavior is odd and inconsistently appropriate and could easily be distressing and confusing for a young child. Visits, when they occur, should always be supervised and of limited duration. ... If the visits of either of the biological parents [become] a source of distress or concern to [the child] or the [aunt and uncle], it is recommended that visits cease until she is old enough to have a clear understanding of the limitations of her biological mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">During the hearing on the motion for visitation, Swen-son testified consistently with her report, which the court admitted into evidence. Carolyn Powell, a marriage and family therapy intern at Southern Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>State University, and Joseph Ovide, a social worker employed at the department, also testified at the hearing. Powell testified that she had facilitated and supervised two visits between the respondent and the child. She testified that the visits occurred on January 13 and 27, 2000. Regarding the first visit, Powell testified as follows: \u201cWe brought [the child] in the room with the [respondent] and she continued to cry. Every effort the [respondent] attempted to soothe and pacify her was not successful; she cried the whole time. At which point, after about twenty-five minutes, I said we had to cancel the visit because the child would not calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Regarding the second visit, Powell testified as follows: \u201cWhen the [respondent] came, I asked the [uncle] ... to leave the room so the [respondent] can have the interaction with the child. And [the child] attempted to follow [the uncle] out of the room. . . . [The child] started crying and chasing after [the uncle] and she kept crying the whole time we tried to keep her in the room. She would just not calm down, even after the [respondent] attempted to calm her. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201c[The respondent] picked [the child] up. [The respondent] held her close. She patted [the child] on the back and walked around the room with her, and [the child] still kept screaming and pointing towards the door. . . . I decided that the time was up for \u2014 she was crying so hard that I decided it was uncomfortable for her and we should end the visit. At that point, my supervisor came in the room and said she heard the child crying down the hallway. And [the uncle] had also heard the child crying and said we should end the visit. So, the visit was ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Ovide testified that he was a case manager for the department and that he had supervised visits between the respondent and the child. Regarding the visits, he testified as follows: \u201c[The respondent] was a bit with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>drawn from the child at times. The child would need to venture forth and play with the toys and that would annoy \u2014 well, that would seem to bother the [respondent] at times. She would try to get the child\u2019s attention, but, at that point, the child would either cry or just resist tremendously and tend to gravitate towards the person she knew most, which was me. So, there really wasn\u2019t a connection at times.\u201d Ovide also testified that \u201c[the respondent] would consistently call and cancel visits because she wasn\u2019t comfortable with the situation or the people around the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that (1) the respondent had not been consistent in maintaining visitation with the child, (2) the visits that had taken place had not gone well, (3) the child had become attached to her aunt and uncle, (4) the respondent had not related naturally or interacted appropriately with the child and (5) the respondent\u2019s visits had been upsetting to the child. On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that visitation by the respondent was not in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We have reviewed the record, including the evidence previously discussed, and we conclude that the court\u2019s factual findings are reasonable and that the court reasonably concluded that continued visitation was not in the child\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its broad discretion in declining to order visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The respondent also claims that the court impermissi-bly delegated to the department and to the aunt and uncle the responsibility of determining, in the future, whether visitation by the respondent is in the best interest of the child. We agree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our disposition of this claim. On February 10, 2000, the court rendered an oral decision denying the respondent\u2019s motion for visitation. In so doing, the court stated in relevant part: \u201c[C]ourt-ordered visitation with the [respondent] does not make much sense to me. . . . As for the [respondent], she has not been consistent in maintaining visitation. The visits that have taken place have not gone particularly well, perhaps because [the child] is so young and has become attached to her [aunt and uncle], or perhaps because the [respondent] [did] not relate that naturally or interact appropriately with [the child]. The visits are in fact quite upsetting to [the child].</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u201cI therefore find that court-ordered visitation is not in [the child\u2019s] best interest. Based on that, I deny the [respondent\u2019s] motion for visitation and decline to order any visitation. This order, of course, or absence of an order, does not mean that visitation may not take place or should not take place. <em>[The department] may decide to permit it if it concludes that it is in [the child's] best interest. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u201cIn short, I trust and believe that [the aunt and uncle], who have demonstrated their ability to care for [the child], will use discretion and will take an enlightened approach in deciding this issue. <em>I therefore leave it to them and [the department] to decide.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">As stated in part I of this opinion, \u201c[t]he standard for reviewing a visitation order is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making that order.\u201d <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 43, 440 A.2d 782 (1981). \u201cIn exercising that discretion the court considers the rights and wishes of the parents and may hear the recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tions of professionals in the family relations field, but the court must ultimately be controlled by the welfare of the particular child.\u201d Id. Furthermore, the court has an \u201cindependent obligation for the welfare of the children before it, an obligation that has deep roots in our <em>jurisprudence.\u201dNewman v. Newman, </em>235 Conn. 82, 98, 663 A.2d 980 (1995). In the present case, the court\u2019s order empowered the department and the aunt and uncle to determine, in the future, whether the child\u2019s best interest would be served by permitting the respondent to visit her. In so doing, the court impermissibly delegated its \u201cindependent obligation\u201d to determine and further the child\u2019s best interest. See id.; cf. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>18 Conn. App. 622, 629, 561 A.2d 443 (1989) (orders empowering counsel for minor children to select evening when plaintiff could see children for dinner was improper delegation of judicial function). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its legal discretion. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The judgment is affirmed as to the denial of the respondent\u2019s motion for visitation. The judgment is reversed as to the order empowering the department and the aunt and uncle to determine, in the future, whether visits by the respondent are in the child\u2019s best interest, and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\"> Only the respondent mother is involved in this appeal.
