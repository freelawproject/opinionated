The dispositive question in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>whether, for an accident that occurred in 1993, our statutes required a self-insured municipality to provide limitless underinsured motorist coverage. The municipality and the employee disagree about whether the municipality\u2019s exposure exceeds the statutorily defined minimum of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 38a-371 (a) (l)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 14-112.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Like the trial court, we are persuaded that, in 1993, a self-insured municipality was not obligated to provide more coverage than the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The plaintiff, William Boynton, Jr., brought two actions to recover underinsured motorist benefits, which were consolidated for trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 9-5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In one action, he sought to recover underin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>sured motorist benefits allegedly included in an insurance policy issued to him by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. That action is not part of this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the other action, because he is a city employee, he sought similar benefits from the defendant city of New Haven (city).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In the plaintiffs complaint against the city, he alleged that, on December 9,1993, while driving a police motorcycle in New Haven in the course of his duty, he was involved in a collision resulting from the negligence of Shawn Lavoie. He further alleged that he had suffered severe personal injuries from the collision, for which he had recovered, in part, by his receipt of the maximum $25,000 available to him from Lavoie\u2019s liability insurer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the complaint, the city\u2019s duty to provide underinsured motorist benefits required it to cover the unpaid portion of the damages arising out of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The city filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-49.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court granted that motion on the ground that Lavoie\u2019s vehicle was not underinsured with respect to the city\u2019s liability as self-insurer. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That conclusion was based on the court\u2019s acceptance of the city\u2019s position that its potential liability was limited to the statutory minimum of $20,000, which had been exceeded by the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of $25,000 from Lavoie\u2019s insurer. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is well established. [W]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>241 Conn. 24, 37, 694 A.2d 1246 (1997); <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 292, 596 A.2d 414 (1991); <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). Because neither party has claimed that this case concerns disputed material facts, we are concerned only with the city\u2019s right to judgment as a matter of law. The only questions of law in this case are questions of statutoiy construction. Accordingly, our review is plenary. <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 318, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The undisputed facts establish that, at all relevant times, the city had opted to provide the insurance coverage mandated by our statutes through self-insurance and had properly so notified the insurance commissioner in 1965. Unlike private owners of a fleet of motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>vehicles, the city was not required to provide evidence of financial responsibility. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-371 (c). Not until June 8, 1998, years after the plaintiffs injury, did the city notify the insurance commissioner that its self-insured liability for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage was limited to the statutory minimum of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence. Indeed, at the time of the accident, the city\u2019s self-insurance plan had not been memorialized in a written document of any kind. See <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>254 Conn. 404, 409, 757 A.2d 1083 (2000) (another underinsured motorist insurance claim against city of New Haven). The court concluded that the city had no liability to the plaintiff because he had recovered more than the statutory minimum defined in \u00a7 14-112. Although General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>includes a special procedure for waiving underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the statutory minimum, the court held that that provision was inapplicable because it did not become effective until 1994, while the plaintiff\u2019s accident occurred in 1993.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Before turning to the specific issues of statutory interpretation that we must address, we review the applicable underlying principles. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 410. The parties in this case have cited no legislative history. Common-law principles do not inform the scope of the requirement of underinsured motorist coverage because such insurance is entirely a creature of statute presenting only issues of statutory interpretation. See id. Our focus, therefore, is on the words of the statutes and the policies they embody.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">To state the obvious, no statute expressly directs a self-insurer to pay underinsured motorist benefits in excess of the minimum amount prescribed in \u00a7 14-112. On the other hand, no statute expressly permits the city, without notice or documentation, to limit its exposure to the statutory minimum. The parties are not tilting at windmills.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Our task is to glean what we can from three relevant statutory propositions. These propositions govern (1) the undisputed fiscal responsibility of the city as self-insurer, (2) the undisputed obligation of the city to provide underinsured motorist coverage, and (3) the disputed relationship between the city\u2019s liability coverage and its underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">We address the first proposition in two parts. First and foremost, \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371 (c) authorize the city to become self-insured. Second, those authorizing statutes do not impose greater liability on a self-insurer than they impose on a commercial insurer. <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 437. As our Supreme Court has stated recently, the funding mechanism by which an owner of multiple vehicles decides to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>its fiscal obligations \u201cis irrelevant to the obligation of that funding entity to comply with such requirements . . . . [S] elf-insurance is the functional equivalent of commercial insurance. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 374, 378 n.4, 713 A.2d 820 (1998); see also <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>243 Conn. 677, 686, 705 A.2d 1020 (1998) ([t]he legislature intended to create a uniform scheme of uninsured motorist insurance coverage applicable to self-insurers as well as commercial insurance carriers).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 437. The fiscal responsibility, therefore, is the same for a self-insurer as it is for a commercial insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">With regard to the second proposition, the city is required to provide underinsured motorist coverage on certain municipal motor vehicles, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-336 (a),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to protect city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>employees from the costs of accidental injuries that occur while the employee drives a covered vehicle in the course of his employment. \u201cAlthough \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) states generally that automobile liability insurance policies must provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, it provides that such coverage is governed by the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334 . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 414. \u201cSection 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that the uninsured motorist coverage that it requires \u2018shall insure the occupants of every motor vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies. . . .\u2019 It is therefore necessary to refer to \u00a7 38a-334-5 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which covers liability coverage. Section 38a-334-5 (a) of the regulations provides that its liability coverage requirements apply to \u2018motor vehicle [s] owned or long-term leased by the named insured. . . .\u2019 The term \u2018[mjotor [vjehicle,\u2019 as used in the regulations, is defined as: \u2018private passenger motor vehicle . . . commercial motor vehicle . . . motorcycle . . . public service motor vehicles . . . motor vehicle in livery service . . . and vanpool vehicle . . . .\u2019 Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38a-334-2 (c).\u201d <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 415-19.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because a motorcycle is a covered vehicle, the plaintiff has a rightful claim for under-insured motorist coverage pursuant to \u00a7 38a-336 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The relationship between the city\u2019s liability coverage and its underinsured motorist coverage is indirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>addressed in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 38a-335 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 38a-336 (a) (2). The city, relying on the former, and the plaintiff, relying on the latter, look to these sections for answers to the thorny and disputed question of <em>how much </em>underinsured motorist coverage the city must provide. Section 38a-335 (a) permits the statutorily enumerated class of motor vehicle owners to limit their mandatory insurance coverage to the minimum of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident. See footnote 14. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2) provided for parity between \u201cuninsured\u201d motorist coverage<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and liability coverage \u201cimposed by law.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We turn now to a discussion of this contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the city was entitled to limit its underinsured motorist coverage in accordance with \u00a7 38a-336 (a). It relied on the absence of any statutory provision that \u201crequires a self-insured entity to exceed the minimum coverage required by statute.\u201d In support of its reasoning, it cited <em>Orkney </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>248 Conn. 195, 205, 727 A.2d 700 (1999). In a related context,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that case stated that the underinsured motorist statute \u201cmerely requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>that a certain minimum level of protection be provided . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The plaintiff proffers two arguments to the contrary. First, the plaintiff maintains that, under the principle of parity between liability coverage and underinsured motorist coverage, the city was required to provide underinsured motorist coverage in the same amount as its unlimited liability coverage. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2). Second, he maintains that the city could not invoke the statutory minimum without having executed some kind of written waiver or notice. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The plaintiffs argument, which is based on the principle of parity under \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2), is that, in 1993, the city\u2019s exposure for liability coverage was unlimited. He relies on the text of the self-insurer statute, which does not specify the amount of the city\u2019s exposure in its posture as self-insurer. General Statutes \u00a7 14-129. Because the city\u2019s notification to the insurance commissioner did not specify the amount of the city\u2019s exposure as self-insurer, he maintains that the city must be deemed to have agreed to assume unlimited liability coverage.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Ergo, the city was required to provide unlimited underinsured motorist coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The flaw in the plaintiffs argument is its assumption of a linkage between \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-336. As our Supreme Court recently observed, \u201c\u00a7 14-129 was part of the legislative effort to impose minimum liability coverage. Nothing in its history suggests that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ever intended to trump the subsequently enacted, and more specific, provision regarding uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 434. Under <em>Willoughby, </em>although specific statutes after \u00a7 14-129 could place an additional insurance burden on the city, \u00a7 14-129 does not, and cannot, define the amount of coverage that the city agreed to provide when it became a self-insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In the absence of linkage to \u00a7 14-129, the plaintiff is left with the text of \u00a7 38a-336. It is true that subsection (a) (2) requires parity between liability and underin-sured motorist coverage. It is equally true that the subsection does not mandate the amount of coverage to be provided. That gap is filled by the statutory minimum specified in \u00a7 14-112, which defines the limit of the city\u2019s fiscal obligation. The applicability of the statutory minimum is reasonable because the exposure of commercial insurers is not unlimited. As noted earlier, self-insurers are entitled to the same protection as is afforded to commercial insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Our conclusion finds support in numerous out-of-state authorities cited by the city. 1L. Russ &amp; T. Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed. 1997) \u00a7 10:3, p. 10-9, states that \u201cit is generally held that the self-insured must provide the minimum amount of coverage that is allowed by the [underinsured motorist] statute.\u201d See generally <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 287 n.10, 572 N.E.2d 1 (1991); <em>Heavens </em>v. <em>Laclede Gas Co., </em>809 S.W.2d 162, 163 (Mo. App. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The argument based on parity, therefore, does not establish that the city was required to provide underin-sured motorist coverage in an amount greater than the statutory minimum of $20,000. Once it is determined that the statutory minimum is applicable, the plaintiffs receipt of $25,000 from Lavoie\u2019s insurance carrier fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>closes his access to further reimbursement from the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that the city could not avail itself of the statutory minimum because it had failed properly to document, in writing, its intention to do so. In 1993, \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2) allowed commercial insurers to limit their liability, and thereby to reduce insurance premiums, upon the <em>written request </em>of the insured. It is undisputed that, in 1993, the city had not filed any such written request.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We disagree with the plaintiffs argument because, under the circumstances of this case, it would make no sense for us to apply the written request requirement literally. \u201c[U]pon electing to become a self-insurer, [the city] not only became an insurer . . . but also, the functional equivalent of a \u2018named insured\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 683. A literal reading of the statute would have required the city, wearing its hat as insured, to file a written request with itself, wearing its hat as insurer. That reading is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">As the city notes, its self-insurer status with respect to its fleet of passenger motor vehicles bears a closer resemblance to fleet insurance generally. \u201c[F]leet insurance gives rise to a significantly different set of expectations and considerations than does personal automobile insurance.\u201d <em>Frantz </em>v. <em>United States Fleet Leasing, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 727, 741-42, 714 A.2d 1222 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">\u201c[T]he primary legislative purpose in requiring a written request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage is to ensure that one named insured not be bound, to his or her detriment, by the unilateral decision of another named insured to seek such a reduction. . . . Such a concern has little or no applicability in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>text of a commercial fleet policy.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">In light of this legislative purpose, we are persuaded that it would be an exercise in futility to require the city to file a written request to itself. We presume that the legislature did not intend such an outcome. See, e.g, <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 597, 737 A.2d 916 (1999). The plaintiffs reliance on the written waiver requirement stated in \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2) is, therefore, unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In summary, the plaintiff is entitled only to the statutory minimum amount of underinsured motorist coverage because the applicable statutes impose no greater obligation on the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In light of the city\u2019s simultaneous roles as self-insurer and self-insured, the plaintiff can recover only the statutory minimum despite the fact that the city never submitted a written request for such coverage to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-371 (c) provides: \u201cSubject to approval of the insurance commissioner the security required by sections 38a-363 to 38a-388, inclusive, may be provided by self-insurance by filing with the commissioner in satisfactory form: (1) A continuing undertaking by the owner or other appropriate person to pay basic reparations benefits and the liabilities covered by residual liability insurance and to perform all other obligations imposed by said sections; (2) evidence that appropriate provision exists for the prompt and efficient administration of all claims, benefits, and obligations provided by said sections; and (3) evidence that reliable financial arrangements, deposits or commitments exist providing assurance for payment of basic reparations benefits and the liabilities covered by residual liability insurance and all other obligations imposed by said sections substantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with said sections.
