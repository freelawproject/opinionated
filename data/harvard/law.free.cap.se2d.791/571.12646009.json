MIMS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the circuit court erred by placing the burden of proof in a garnishment proceeding on SunTrust Bank, the garnishee, rather than on PS Business Parks, L.P. (\"PS Business\"), the judgment creditor. Additionally, we consider whether the circuit court erred by finding that SunTrust was indebted to Deutsch &amp; Gilden, Inc. (\"Deutsch\"), the judgment debtor, in the amount of $1.2 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   PS Business leased a storefront to Family Furniture Centers, Inc. Deutsch guaranteed the lease. After Family Furniture Centers and Deutsch stopped paying rent, PS Business obtained a judgment against the companies in the amount of $664,923.34 plus interest and attorney's fees. PS Business filed a garnishment summons, which named Deutsch as the judgment debtor and SunTrust as the garnishee, against \"all accounts, including [the] account ending [in] 61663.\" The garnishment summons was served on SunTrust on March 5, 2013 with a return date of April 12, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response, SunTrust processed a $15,050.11 legal order debit against an account titled to Deutsch ending in 95497 and filed a check in that amount with the circuit court. SunTrust also filed a check for $133,656.69 drawn from an account ending in 61663, which was owned by G&amp;D Furniture Holdings, Inc. (\"G&amp;D\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   G&amp;D filed a motion to quash the garnishment of account 61663. PS Business filed a cross-motion to ascertain the funds held by SunTrust in accounts 61663 and 95497. At the hearing on the motions, Andrew Dolson, vice president and assistant general counsel for SunTrust, testified that accounts 61663\n   and 95497 were part of a \"zero balance account arrangement.\" In such arrangements there is a master account and several subsidiary accounts. The funds in the subsidiary accounts are transferred daily into the master account. According to Dolson, this consolidation of available funds from the subsidiary accounts allows the master account owner to \"put the cash to some good effective use.\" For example, the funds \"might be invested overnight in some securities investment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Funds are transferred from the master account back to subsidiary accounts as needed to answer for demands presented against them such as paying checks, honoring automated clearing house debits, and performing wire transfers. Dolson indicated that account 61663 is the master account in the zero balance arrangement and account 95497 is a subsidiary account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When SunTrust receives a garnishment summons for an account that is a part of a zero balance arrangement, it typically severs the ties between the master and subsidiary accounts. This was not done when SunTrust received the garnishment summons for account 95497, which caused \"funds to flow into [it] from the master [account].\" Dolson testified that as a result the balances reflected on the account statements were \"not just faulty ... or unreliable\" but \"preposterously oversized amounts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The circuit court granted G&amp;D's motion to quash the garnishment of account 61663. The court also ordered payment to PS Business of $15,050.11, the amount of the check drawn on account 95497. PS Business appealed to this Court. We affirmed the circuit court's ruling with respect to the garnishment of account 61663:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In the absence of evidence regarding the contractual relationship between the Deutsch and G&amp;D accounts, the periodic transfer of funds between those accounts does not establish a debtor relationship between SunTrust and Deutsch to the funds in G&amp;D account 61663 that would subject those funds to a claim by a creditor with a judgment against Deutsch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    PS Business L.P. v.

When the sums were credited to Deutsch's account, they became subject to SunTrust's obligation as debtor to the depositor, Deutsch, and thus subject to garnishment by Deutsch's judgment creditors, including PS Business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   However, the extent to which the deposits exceeded $15,050.11 is not clear from the record before us because the circuit court did not make any factual determination to ascertain funds held by SunTrust in Deutsch account 95497 during the garnishment period as requested by PS Business in its cross-motion. Absent this requisite inquiry, the record is silent as to which deposits were funds circulating between G&amp;D account 61663 and Deutsch account 95497 during the garnishment period, and which deposits contained new funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20S.E.2d%20508\">\n    758 S.E.2d at 512-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, we remanded the case for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a detailed inquiry into SunTrust's indebtedness to Deutsch for funds in account 95497 over the garnishment period which would create an obligation to PS Business through its garnishment summons. During the course of this inquiry, G&amp;D and SunTrust will have the opportunity to assert defenses raised below that the funds belonged to G&amp;D and not Deutsch, and that any funds deposited were revolving funds, the same funds repeatedly passing between G&amp;D account 61663 and Deutsch\n   account 95497, or any other relevant defense to liability....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20S.E.2d%20508\">\n    758 S.E.2d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On remand, PS Business entered into evidence account statements covering the garnishment period for accounts 61663 and 95497. The statements for account 95497 showed that more than $1.2 million in deposits and credits reached the account in March 2013. PS Business then rested its case. SunTrust called Dolson as a witness, who again explained the nature of zero account balance arrangements and the relationship between accounts 61663 and 95497. He also explained that when SunTrust receives a garnishment summons it places a \"post no debits\" hold on the subject account in an amount sufficient to satisfy the garnishment. A \"post no debits\" hold allows the account to receive deposits but prevents debits that would cause the account to fall below the amount of the hold. Dolson testified that SunTrust placed a \"post no debits\" hold in account 95497, but it failed to sever it from account 61663. As a result, zero balance credits \"start[ed] flowing from the master account\" into account 95497. Notably, these credits were not caused by \"normal [demands] like checks and other items being presented for payment.\" In turn, these credits were swept back to the master account at the end of each day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dolson testified that these revolving daily transfers did not \"even reflect real money.\" He compared the situation to \"check kiting,\" \"where [the balance] just gets larger and larger because it is taking ... nonexistent money and sweeping it over here and then sending that money back and then bringing it back again as though it's a fresh new deposit.\" Dolson testified that \"the master account didn't really ever have that kind of money in it.\" He then apologized, admitting that SunTrust should have severed the relationship between the accounts, which would have prevented the zero balance credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dolson also identified several deposits into account 95497 during the garnishment period that reflected \"real dollars.\" For example, on March 6, 2013, there was a $896.40 entry entitled \"ELECTRONIC/ACH CREDIT FAMILYFURNLANDOV MERC DEP,\" which represented a \"payment from the outside world for $896.40 worth of goods or services.\" He explained that these were deposits of \"real dollars\" that SunTrust should have captured pursuant to the garnishment. He concluded that the sum of these deposits totaled $2,142.42 in addition to the $15,050.11 SunTrust previously admitted to owing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During closing argument, SunTrust argued that PS Business bore the burden of proof to show the extent of the obligation owed by SunTrust to Deutsch. PS Business responded by arguing that it had met its burden of proof by entering the account statements into evidence. In its view, SunTrust bore the burden of proof to show which deposits were \"revolving funds\" and which were \"real\" money. In other words, PS Business took the position that SunTrust was presenting an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After taking the matter under advisement, the circuit court issued a letter opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Supreme Court of Virginia noted that during the garnishment period (March 5, 2013 to April 12, 2013), more than $1.2 million in deposits reached the account.... The Supreme Court pointed out that I had failed to conduct the required evidentiary hearing to determine how much of the $1.2 million exceeded the amount ordered ($15,050.11). This Court conducted that evidentiary hearing on October 30, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Supreme Court stated that during the [hearing on remand] \"G&amp;D and SunTrust will have the opportunity to assert defenses raised below that the funds belonged to G&amp;D and not Deutsch, and that any funds deposited were revolving funds, the same funds repeatedly passing between G&amp;D account 61663 and Deutsch account 95497, or any other relevant defense to liability for the amount of the judgment based upon SunTrust's indebtedness to Deutsch for the sums in Deutsch account 95497 during the garnishment period.\" ... In other words, as [counsel for PS Business] argued, G&amp;D and SunTrust have the burden of proof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [N]either G&amp;D nor SunTrust has satisfied that burden of proof. The fact that the accounts and the linking of the accounts\n   were a confused mess does not justify dismissing the garnishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court denies the motion to dismiss the garnishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The circuit court subsequently ordered a payment of $706,755.17 to PS Business. This order found that Deutsch was indebted to PS Business for this amount, and that SunTrust was indebted to Deutsch \"in the sum of One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars.\" After thirty days elapsed without payment, the court entered judgment against SunTrust pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-516.1 for $706,755.17 plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Burden of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On appeal, SunTrust argues that the circuit court erred by placing the burden of proof on it, the garnishee, instead of on PS Business, the judgment creditor. To address this argument, we must consider whether the extent of SunTrust's liability to Deutsch constitutes a prima facie element of PS Business' claim or is an affirmative defense. This is a question of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

This administrative error is the sole cause of the zero balance credits. Normally, under the zero balance arrangement, outside demands presented against the subsidiary account cause funds to flow into it from the master account. Indeed, Deutsch was not \"entitled to\" the funds in the master account until they \"reached\" its subsidiary account to satisfy such demands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 417-18, 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20S.E.2d%20508\">\n    758 S.E.2d at 511, 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In the absence of evidence regarding the contractual relationship between the Deutsch and G&amp;D accounts, the periodic transfer of funds between those accounts does not establish a debtor relationship between SunTrust and Deutsch\n   <em>\n    to the funds in G&amp;D account 61663\n   </em>\n   that would subject those funds to a claim by a creditor with a judgment against Deutsch.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The zero balance credits were not the result of a demand. They appeared in Deutsch's account because of SunTrust's administrative error. The record contains no evidence to suggest that this error gave Deutsch an ownership interest in these funds that it did not otherwise have.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5A Addinell H. Michie, Michie on Banks and Banking \u00a7 45, at 189 (2014 Rep.

The overwhelming majority of the funds that reached account 95497, however, were the zero balance credits.
