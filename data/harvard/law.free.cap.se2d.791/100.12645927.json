Plaintiff argues that the court committed reversible error when it changed venue to Lee County\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . We conclude that the trial court had no legal basis upon which to change venue since no defendant had answered or objected to venue. Nor did the trial court have any inherent power to change venue for the \"convenience of the court.\" We therefore vacate the trial court's order and remand to Durham County for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On 1 May 2015, plaintiff filed a complaint in Durham County, seeking custody of her grandchildren, Javier, born in 2006, and Maria, born in 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the verified complaint, defendants are the children's mother and father. Both of the children and defendants are citizens of El Salvador. Plaintiff, the children's maternal grandmother, had lived in North Carolina for about 15 years prior to filing this action, and the two children had resided with her in Sanford, North Carolina, since May 2014, or for about 12 months before the filing of the action. Plaintiff's complaint set forth extensive details regarding how the children ended up in\n   her care. They have never lived with defendant-father, whom plaintiff alleged was involved in \"Mara 18, one of the principal criminal gangs in El Salvador that controls many communities and subjects local residents to violence and terror.\" Defendant-father has also never provided financially for the children or assisted in their care. She further alleged that defendant-mother had fled El Salvador \"[f]earing for her life and for the well-being of the Minor Children,\" due to defendant-father's criminal activities and the \"extreme violence committed by organized criminal gangs that have taken control of\" much of El Salvador as the \"de facto government.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2014, defendant-mother and the children were \"apprehended by U.S. Immigration officers\" in Texas and later released on their own recognizance; they then moved to North Carolina to live with plaintiff. Defendant-mother failed to appear at her scheduled immigration hearing on 24 November 2014 and absconded. Plaintiff alleged that defendant-mother has made only one phone call to her since she absconded and has failed to provide any support for the children. When defendant-mother absconded, she left the children with plaintiff but failed to sign any documents which would give plaintiff legal authority to \"fulfill the regular legal, medical, and educational decisionmaking that may only be done by a legal custodian.\" In addition, plaintiff alleged that Javier has \"very extensive special needs\" which require special services in school, including occupational therapy and speech therapy. Without any legal authority to authorize care or make decisions regarding Javier's services, plaintiff has had extreme difficulty maintaining the care that Javier needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint requested full physical and legal custody of the children and also requested additional factual findings by the trial court regarding \"Special Immigrant Juvenile Status\" of the children pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J) and 8 CFR 204.11. Plaintiff alleged that these findings would assist her in preventing removal of the children\n   by immigration authorities and possible deportation, since return of the children to El Salvador would subject them to abuse and neglect from defendant-father, disruption of their education, and risk from the \"extraordinarily high levels of crime and violence\" in El Salvador. The complaint had many attached exhibits including birth certificates of the children and affidavits regarding the situation in El Salvador and risks to the children should they have to return there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed a motion for emergency temporary custody along with the verified complaint and a notice of hearing for 14 May 2015 for an emergency temporary custody hearing. On 14 May 2015, the Honorable James T. Hill, District Court Judge presiding, entered a temporary custody order granting plaintiff full legal and physical custody of the children. In this order, the court concluded that the children are \"at risk of irreparable harm if an emergency custody order is not issued to allow their legal, educational, and medical needs to be met.\" The temporary custody order also provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The terms of this order will remain in effect until such time as a further hearing occurs, and is entered without prejudice to the rights of the parties to a full and fair hearing on the merits of this matter. Should no further hearing occur in a reasonable time frame, this order will become the permanent order of this court, subject to modification only by a showing of a substantial change in circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The temporary custody order also set the case for a pre-trial hearing and \"any necessary review of this temporary order\" on 14 August 2015 at 9:30 am and set a permanent custody hearing on 10 September 2015 at 9:30 am in Courtroom 6B of the Durham County Courthouse. The complaint was served on both defendants by publication, in both Spanish and English in Durham and in Spanish in El Salvador; the affidavit of service was filed on 24 July 2015. The publication also included the dates set by the temporary order for the pretrial hearing and trial. The first publication date was 10 June 2015, so defendants' answers were due by 20 July 2015. Neither defendant filed any answer or other response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On Friday, 14 August 2015, the matter came on for pretrial hearing as scheduled by the temporary order, but before a different\n   judge. Plaintiff, her counsel, and the minor children were present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case was called for hearing, and the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Good morning, Your Honor. That's on for pretrial this morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Does everybody live in Durham?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Your Honor, nobody lives in Durham.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: All right. It will be the Court's own motion will be transferring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Your Honor, if I may be heard briefly. I prepared-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: I'll hear you briefly. Just be brief. Tell me what county you want this transferred to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: We will not be transferring this, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court then called another case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the trial court returned to plaintiff's case, the following discussion continued between the court and plaintiff's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Now you want to address something with me, Aurora Cruz?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: I'm listening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: If I could switch out my piles here. Your Honor, it came to my attention yesterday afternoon that the question of venue had recently come to your attention. I previously prepared a memorandum for Judge Battaglia on this subject which was in my understanding satisfactory to him. So I prepared a memorandum for you this morning. If I may approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: I do have two copies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: What county is this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: The Plaintiff and the children happen to reside in Lee County but they may be found as contemplated by the statute and case law in the County of Durham.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: I already looked this up. The Court is changing venue to Lee County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Your Honor-Your Honor, if I could go back to the table and be heard briefly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: I'm listening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: So I would like to first object to lack of notice for this Court's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: I have so noted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: And, Your Honor, the matter of venue is a substantive procedural right for the plaintiff and for the defendant when timely objected to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case the defendant has not objected and it is convenient to the Plaintiffs to be heard in the County of Durham wherein the children may be found on the occasion of filing the complaint and case law specifies that that is sufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, I'm representing these individuals and it is most convenient for them to have an attorney practice in its own district in order to have most efficient representation possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   And beyond that, Your Honor, the case law specifically gives the right to object to venue only to the defendant, the parties may agree otherwise, but the only statutory basis for changing venue is by objection of a defendant and ask that you carefully read the memorandum before issuing any order in this matter, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: I carefully read the law and I transfer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: And the only other-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: -the venue to Lee County and you may have the same option as the people that you talked to yesterday. Thank you very much.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Your Honor, could you please state for the record what that option would be. I would like to have a full and complete record of these proceedings and what you mean by these things because I was not given any notice. I was not given a written motion. I just heard\n   from a\n   friend yesterday afternoon that there was a question of venue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: This transfers to Lee County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: And what are the alternatives that you spoke of just a moment ago, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: I happen to move my calendar, Mr. Hensley, which consist [sic] of you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court never identified what the \"same option as the people that you talked to yesterday\" was. The trial court then called another case. After completion of all of the remaining cases plaintiff's counsel had with the court, the trial court returned to plaintiff's case, and counsel asked the trial court the following in relation to this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: ... Is there a written ruling with regards to the out-of-county matter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Yes, sir, there is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: All right. Is there a copy available for me at this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: Ask the clerk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   MR. HENSLEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Both plaintiff's memorandum regarding child custody venue, which was handed up to the trial court during the hearing, and the trial court's order changing venue were filed at 9:40 am on the same day as the hearing, Friday, 14 August 2015 with the Durham County Clerk of Superior Court. Plaintiff filed notice of appeal from the order in Durham County on 28 August 2015 and an alternative notice of appeal from the order in Lee County on 31 August 2015, since the case had been transferred to Lee County. Defendants were served with the notices of appeal by filing with the clerk of court, in accord with Rule 26(c) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Neither has appeared in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Interlocutory appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the order on appeal does not finally resolve the case, it is interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pay Tel Commc'ns, Inc. v. Caldwell Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175793\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/203/692/#p694\">\n    203 N.C.App. 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=692%20S.E.2d%20885\">\n    692 S.E.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (2010) (\"[T]he trial court's order\n   granting defendants' motion to change venue is an interlocutory order, and thus, not generally subject to appellate review.\"). Plaintiff argues that the order changing venue affects her substantial rights and thus she has a right to immediate appeal. Plaintiff notes that the trial court relied upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50-13.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (2015) as authority for the change of venue. This statute provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (f) Venue.-An action or proceeding in the courts of this State for custody and support of a minor child\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be maintained in the county where the child resides or\n   <em>\n    is physically present\n   </em>\n   or in a county where a parent resides, except as hereinafter provided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50-13.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, plaintiff argues that she had a statutory right to file the lawsuit in Durham County, since she claims that the children were \"physically present\" in Durham County, even if she and the children reside in Lee County. In addition, she argues that even if Durham County was an improper venue based upon residence of the parties, venue is not jurisdictional and may be waived. Our case law agrees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bass v. Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8550787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/43/212/#p215\">\n    43 N.C.App. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=258%20S.E.2d%20391\">\n    258 S.E.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (1979) (\"Venue may be waived by any party.

Unfortunately, we have only the appellant's brief in this case, since neither defendant has appeared. Furthermore, since the trial court's action was\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , we\n   also have no argument or legal authority, other than that cited in the order itself, addressing the rationale behind the trial court's ruling. Based upon the cases discussed in detail below, however, plaintiff had a statutory right for the action to remain in Durham County, unless and until a defendant should\n   file a motion for change of venue to a proper county.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The first step is determining the proper venue for a case, which is based upon the substantive statute for the particular type of claim. This determination of proper venue under the substantive statute presents a question of law which is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The second step is determining whether a change of venue is appropriate under the procedural statute regarding changes of venue, which in this instance appears to be\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-83\">\n    N.C.

Moreover, plaintiff does not challenge the trial court's findings of fact on appeal, and plaintiff has never disputed that she lives in Lee County. In any event, the trial court did not hear any evidence upon which it could make findings of fact. Plaintiff does challenge the trial court's legal conclusions on appeal, both those contained within the \"Findings of Fact\" and the one conclusion of law titled as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the trial court skipped the first requisite inquiry into whether venue was proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C.

The\n   order contains no findings of fact upon which a determination of proper or improper venue could be made. Yet to the extent that the trial court's conclusion of law is based upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C.

Venue is based upon residence of the\n   <em>\n    parents\n   </em>\n   or a child or where a child is \"physically present.\" Plaintiff is the children's grandmother, not their parent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C.

The complaint does show that the children reside with plaintiff, but the record also indicates that the children were \"physically present\" in Durham County for the hearing, as noted in plaintiff's memorandum regarding child custody venue. In any event, the order made no factual findings about the children's residence or physical presence. Nevertheless, it would appear that even under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C. Gen.

And basing venue on the physical presence of the children would seem entirely appropriate, particularly where a grandparent is seeking to protect grandchildren whose parents have disappeared. In fact, the order does not really conclude that venue in Durham County is \"improper\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-13.5\">\n    N.C.

This Court has previously addressed a situation in which a trial court changed venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-83\">\n    N.C.

Whether to transfer venue for this reason, however, is a matter firmly within the discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned unless the court manifestly abused that discretion. Moreover, motions for change of venue based on the convenience of witnesses, pursuant to section 1-83(2), must be filed after the answer is filed. Defendant's motion, based upon the \"convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice,\" was filed prior to an answer and it was therefore prematurely filed. As the trial court abused its discretion to the\n   extent that it prematurely made a discretionary ruling to remove the case to Haywood County, we believe that this Court must reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    ITS Leasing, Inc. v.
