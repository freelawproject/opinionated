Rule 12(b)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellants\u2019 wrongful death action brought against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). We hold that the district court was in error and, accordingly, reverse and remand the ease for appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-24\">Curtis E. Hoston, Jr. died on October 27, 1976, as a result of injuries inflicted by deputy United States Marshals and other federal officials who held him in custody while he was awaiting arraignment before the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. Appellants\u2019 Complaint avers that Hoston was beaten to death while \u201cunarmed, prone and manacled\u201d and \u201cleft to die for over <em>1/2 </em>hour without medical attention\u201d in a holding cell. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 14. Appellees, on the other hand, claim that Hoston seized a revolver from one of the deputies and fired a shot in the courtroom and that he was fatally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>jured during the ensuing effort to subdue him. In May 1979, appellants, who are the administrator and next friends of Hoston\u2019s estate, brought this action against forty individual defendants and the United States under a variety of statutory and common law theories, including wrongful death, civil conspiracy and failure to prosecute. Appellants limit this appeal, however, to the dismissal of the wrongful death claim against defendant United States. .</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The FTCA vests in the district court exclusive jurisdiction over claims for money damages against the United States for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH7\">personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The district court concluded that appellants\u2019 pleadings failed to satisfy the FTCA requirement that an official\u2019s tortious acts be committed \u201cwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d The court relied primarily upon that portion of appellants\u2019 complaint which states that the officials who beat Hoston to death</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJm\">were at all times duly appointed and qualified U S Marshalls [sic] agents of the U. S. Government and acting in the course of their employment &amp; duties, however certain of the activities complained of herein were willfully &amp; maliciously in <em>excess of and outside the scope of their employment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">J.A. at 13 (emphasis added). The court further observed that the theme of willful and malicious misconduct is reflected throughout the complaint, and \u201cnowhere does the complaint state a cause of action for negligence.\u201d <em>Hoston v. Silbert, </em>514 F.Supp. 1239, 1242, (D.D.C.1981), J.A. at 37, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The quoted language notwithstanding, we think that appellants\u2019 complaint, taken as a whole, alleges acts sufficient to establish jurisdiction, although it may fall at the outer limits of liberal reading.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, while appellants did not employ the term \u201cnegligence,\u201d the allegation that the deceased was \u201cleft to die for over Vfe hour without medical attention\u201d raises the issue of negligence as a basis of relief if the facts fail to show intentional wrongdoing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>We must also reject the district court\u2019s implication that willful and malicious misconduct is not actionable under the FTCA. Congress has specifically provided that section 1346(b) shall apply to the intentional torts of federal law enforcement officers, including claims arising out of assault and battery. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, appellants\u2019 allegation of willful conduct by the government agents should not in itself deprive the district court of jurisdiction where, as here, the claim arose out of an alleged battery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question remaining is whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to meet the FTCA requirement that the government employee\u2019s tortious act be committed \u201cwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Whether given acts are within the scope of employment is ultimately a legal question. <em>See, e.g., Dornan v. United States, </em>460 F.2d 425, 427 (9th Cir. 1972) (whether particular act \u201cwithin the scope of an employee\u2019s federal employment depends upon an analysis of the facts under the law of the place where the tort occurred\u201d). Thus, our inquiry into the adequacy of the factual allegations to meet the applicable legal standard is not foreclosed by the conclusory opinion expressed in the complaint. Because liability depends upon \u201ccircumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), we must look to District of Columbia <em>respondeat superior </em>and agency rules to determine whether these United States employees were acting within the scope of their employment. We find that appellants have alleged facts which, if proved, would establish vicarious liability under the laws of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">In <em>Lyon v. Carey, </em>533 F.2d 649 (D.C.Cir. 1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this court described the \u201couter bounds of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d Id. </em>at 651. The court held that an employer would be liable if an assault by an employee grew out of a foreseeable \u201cjob-related controversy\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>as opposed to a \u201cpersonal adventure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A subsequent case, <em>International Distributing Corp. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>569 F.2d 136, 139 (D.C.Cir. 1977),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> clarified that foreseeability must be combined with a purpose to further the employer\u2019s interest: \u201cIn the District of Columbia, \u2018[u]nless an assault ... is activated in part at least by a purpose to serve a principal, the principal is not liable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Meyers v. National Detective Agency, Inc., </em>281 A.2d 435, 437 (D.C.App.1971)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Appellants\u2019 pleadings make out a case which could satisfy the <em>Lyon-International Distributing Corp. </em>scope-of-employment criteria. A United States Marshal\u2019s duties\u2014 escorting and supervising frequently hostile and potentially dangerous prisoners \u2014 create a strong likelihood of violent confrontations in the course of which an officer could lose his temper and use tortiously excessive force.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In paragraph one of the complaint, appellants allege that marshals assaulted the deceased while he was a \u201cprisoner of the U. S. Marshals in the lock-up of the Arraignment Court of the District of Columbia Superior Court.\u201d J.A. at 14. Appellants thus placed the deceased in the marshals\u2019 custody at the time of the alleged assault, connecting the alleged tort with \u201ca purpose to serve [the] principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that appellants have alleged facts upon which jurisdiction can be based. We therefore <em>reverse </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 wrongful death claim against the United States and <em>remand </em>the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-15\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-25\">[T]he following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. The overstatement of the complaint tends to obscure any legitimate claim appellants may have. The complaint largely spends its force on extreme accusations and unnecessarily includes language damaging to appellants\u2019 case. The following verbatim excerpt is characteristic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">4. Plaintiffs complain of a conspiracy of injustice &amp; tyranny entrenched within the Federal Bureaucracy which is presently so pervasive as to insulate criminal public officials who as here murdered the deceased Mr. Hoston as in par. 1 above. This conspiracy against the public trust has prevailed to the detriment of the remaining public citizens because tentacles of that conspiracy now extend and infiltrate into the Congress &amp; STAFF, the Executive Branch, National security &amp; defense, The Judiciary, The Ensuing Agro-Energy Resource Monopoly, The financial sector, and the media and communications sector.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">This is made possible by the combination of: A. Having now co-opted the independent, investigative and deliberative citizen Grand Jury Power as guaranteed by the 9th. Amendment to the U.S. Const, so as to preclude all but a rare criminal prosecution of public officials within the Federal bureaucracy, cooperating State Officials, and captains of U.S. Industry.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\">. <em>Cf. e.g., International Distributing Corp. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>569 F.2d 136, 139 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">It is true that plaintiff IDC did not plead the theory of negligent supervision. However federal courts grant the parties the relief to which the facts entitle them, even if the proper theory has not been pled. 10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2664 at 120-121 (1973), and cases cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">Similarly, Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-19\">Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, any final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-20\">28 U.S.C. Rule 54(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-4\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 is a list of exceptions to \u00a7 1346(b) jurisdiction. In 1974 Congress amended \u00a7 2680(h) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u00a7 2680. Exceptions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnT\">(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights: <em>Provided, </em>That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government, the provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising, on or after the date of th\u2019e enactment of this proviso, out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. Although appellants did not use the word \u201cbattery\u201d in their pleadings, the complaint graphically alleges that the decedent\u2019s fatal injuries were the result of a beating by the Deputy Marshal and others; appellants thus plainly have alleged a battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Additionally, it is settled that the FTCA is available to federal prisoners. <em>United States v. Muniz, </em>374 U.S. 150, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 10 L.Ed.2d 805 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\">. In <em>Lyon, </em>an employer was held liable for an assault with a knife, including rape, committed by its deliveryman upon a customer. The assault and rape followed a dispute between the deliveryman and the customer over whether he would carry upstairs the merchandise he had delivered and whether he could accept a check.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b410-14\">. The <em>Lyon </em>court emphasized that \u201c[t]he dispute arose out of the very transaction which had brought Carey to the premises, and, according to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, out of the employer\u2019s instructions to get cash only before delivery.\u201d 533 F.2d at 652. The court concluded that it was \u201cwithin the enterprise liability\u201d of merchants that deliverymen \u201care likely to be in situations of friction with their customers\u201d and that \u201cthese foreseeable altercations may precipitate violence for which recovery may be had, even though the particular type of violence was not in itself anticipated or foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">In <em>Davis v. United States, </em>542 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir. 1976), the court described the relationship between enterprise liability and <em>respondeat superior:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-16\">In the final analysis, the various embellishments upon 'the general doctrine of respondeat superior are simply shorthand devices developed to allocate risk justly. A business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>should bear all risks which are usually associated with carrying on a business, but it should not be saddled with risks which arise solely by virtue of its employee\u2019s pursuit of purely personal convenience.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">. In <em>International Distributing Corp., </em>the defendant (ADT) contracted to provide burglar alarm service to plaintiff, a liquor distributor. Part of the arrangement provided that, upon hearing an alarm, ADT would dispatch employees to plaintiffs storeroom. Plaintiff had provided keys for the ADT employees and in so doing left the fox to guard the henhouse. Defendant was held not vicariously liable for its employees\u2019 subsequent pilferage of plaintiff\u2019s merchandise. The court distinguished <em>Lyon: </em>\u201cIt is clear that the thefts in this case were \u2018simply a personal adventure\u2019 which did not spring from any purpose to serve the employer.\u201d 569 F.2d at 139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. For further clarification of this test <em>compare Neary v. Hertz Corp., </em>231 F.Supp. 480, 484 (D.D.C.1964) (agent committed assault in course of flight from hit-and-run accident while driving employer\u2019s vehicle, flight regarded as \u201cessential link in the unbroken chain of events\u201d such that the assault must be held \u201cdone in the prosecution of [employer\u2019s] business\u201d), <em>and Dilli v.

Central Transp. Co. v. Reddick, </em>398 A.2d at 31:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-17\">The present trend is to extend liability for intentional torts to situations where the employment provides a \u201cpeculiar opportunity and ... incentive for such loss of temper,\u201d as where an argument is likely by virtue of the servant\u2019s duties, and the conduct is wholly or partially in furtherance of the master\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">Escorting potentially dangerous prisoners would seem to be the epitome of a \u201cpeculiar opportunity\u201d for \u201csuch loss of temper.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b411-12\">ROBB, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">As I understand the majority opinion it concludes that the complaint alleges that Deputy Marshal Burch and the other marshals, acting within the scope of their employment, assaulted Hoston and then negligently left him to die without medical attention; in sum, that in performing their duties the marshals negligently injured Hoston. The difficulty with this theory is that it can be supported only by radical plastic surgery on the complaint. The theory of the case alleged in the complaint is that the marshals murdered Hoston and that in so doing they acted outside the scope of their employment. Thus, paragraph 1, J.A. 14 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>I. <em>This cause of action arises because of the murder, homicide and wrongful death </em>of Curtis Hoston Jr. on Oct. 27, 1976 while a prisoner of the U. S. Marshalls in the lock-up of the Arraignment Court of the District of Columbia Superior Court. Defendant Asst. U. S. Marshall Carlisle Burch and others did willfully and maliciously and with a sadistic disregard for human life, \u201cstomped\u201d to death Mr. Hoston who being unarmed, prone and manacled was the recipient of such a frenzied profusion of blows that he was beaten repeatedly after loosing [sic] consciousness from his breastplate having been conpressed to such a degree that his heart became ruptured after being impailed upon the vertebrae of his spine and then left to die for over <em>1/2 </em>hour without medical attention in the U. S. Marshall\u2019s holding cell of the District of Columbia Superior Courthouse, and [sic] the official conspiracy and cover-up thereafter, [emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Paragraph 21, J.A. 13 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">21. Defendants Burch and John Doe I, II, III &amp; IV were at all times duly appointed a'\u00f1d qualified US Marshalls agents of the U. S. Government and acting in the course of their employment &amp; duties, <em>however certain of the activities complained of herein were willfully &amp; maliciously in excess of and outside the scope of their employment, </em>[emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">I reject as fanciful any suggestion that murder is within the scope of the employment of a deputy marshal; and the complaint also in paragraph 21 recognizes that the alleged homicidal activities of the marshals were \u201cwillfully and maliciously in excess of and outside the scope of their employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Nowhere in the complaint is there any allegation of negligence on the part of the deputy marshals; the charge that Hoston was left to die is simply an allegation of the means whereby he was murdered. In short, this is not an action for negligence. A liberal reading should not permit the substitution on appeal of a new theory of recovery for the one alleged in the complaint. I note that this is not a <em>pro se </em>complaint, but one filed by a member of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">I would not inflict upon the District Court the task of trying this case upon the basis of a fatally defective complaint.

Marshall Carlisle Burch and others did willfully and maliciously and with a sadistic disregard for human life, \u201cstomped\u201d to death Mr. Hoston who being unarmed, prone and manacled was the recipient of such a frenzied profusion of blows that he was beaten repeatedly after loosing consciousness from his breastplate having been compressed to such a degree that his heart became ruptured after being impailed upon the vertebrae of his spine and then left to die for over V2 hour without medical attention in the U. S. Marshall\u2019s holding cell of the District of Columbia Superior Courthouse. and the official conspiracy and cover-up thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-21\">2. Primary jurisdiction is vested in this honorable Court pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act 28 USC 1346 <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiffs having exhausted their administrative claim which was perfected within two years of Oct. 2, 1976. This instant suit is filed within six months of the denial of that administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">3.

Both Criminal &amp; Civil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Common Law offenses remain in force in the District of Columbia (49 D.C.Code 301) such that the Court had found inapplicable the rule that there is no common law offenses against the U.

Public Officials violating their oaths of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">iii. Commonlaw obstruction of justice including Grand Jury rigging &amp; corrupt failure to prosecute</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">iv. Murder and accessory after the fact thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">v. Misprison of felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">vi. Intimidation of witnesses to that murder</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">vii. Conspiracies involving i through vi above, including secreting witnesses from the Grand Juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">C. Torts arising under the U.S. Constitution 5th. Amend, denial of life without due process; denial to Plaintiffs, the deceased and the public of ensuring the equal protection of the laws by corruptly conspiring and failure to prosecute public officials for Mr. Hoston\u2019s murder as well as the violation of his Civil Rights under the U.S.Code and the violation of his civil rights which resulted in a death under 18 USC 241 &amp; 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">D.

Prosecutors do not enjoy absolute immunity for activities in aid of an investigatory (grand jury) function as opposed to an advocate (prosecutorial) function (Briggs v. Goodwin 186 USAppl DC 179)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-20\">4. Plaintiffs complain of a conspiracy of injustice &amp; tyranny entrenched within the Federal Bureaucracy which is presently so pervasive as to insulate criminal public officials who as here murdered the deceased Mr. Hoston as in para. 1. above. This conspiracy against the public trust has prevailed to the detriment of the remaining public citizens because tentacles of that conspiracy now extend and infiltrate into the Congress &amp; STAFF, the Executive Branch, National security &amp; defense, The Judiciary, The Ensuing Agro-Energy Resource Monopoly, The financial sector, and the media and communications sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-21\">This is made possible by the combination of?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">A. Having now co-opted the independent, investigative and deliberative citizen Grand Jury Power as guaranteed by the 9th. Amendment to the U.S. Const, so as to preclude all but a rare criminal prosecution of public officials with in the Federal bureaucracy, cooperating State Officials, and captains of U.S. Industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-23\">The U.S.Ct. of Appeals for D.C. appears to have taken judicial notice of this sickness and fascist characteristic of our now crippled system of justice where in <em>Briggs v. Asst. U.S. Atty Gen\u2019l Guy Goodwin, 185 </em>US App DC 179, at pg. 193 after noting that there was a remedy of criminal sanctions to be employed against the perjurious U.S. Atty. or that the Federal Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>could on its own motion punish Mr. Goodwin, found the fact that during the five years between the perjury and the Court\u2019s opinion that nothing had been done &amp; went on to note that same \u201cundercores the fact that such restraints on prosecutorial excesses are likely to remain theoretical only\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANl\">Criminals within the Dept, of Justice can also insulate the fact that they join into a further conspiracy to cover-up these crimes and thereby become accessories after the fact to those crimes as well as practice misprison of felony by failure to report the crime to the attention of the Grand Juries, itself a Federal Crime (18 USC 5) and do so with impunity knowing that if they did not go along, and \u201cplay ball\u201d and \u201cblow the whistle\u201d that nothing would be accomplished except that they would be \u201ccutting their own throats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">B. While violating their oaths of office to \u201cexecute faithfully their duties, they use the excuse of prosecutorial discretion or lack of \u00e9mployee moral and with regard to maintaining employed moral they pay millions of taxpayer dollars to reimburse the legal costs of defending the few officials who have been indicted thereby generally practicing a not so subtle form of bribery, itself an obstruction of justice and the commonlaw crime of CHAMPERTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">C. Utilization of self serving pleas of national security or highly \u201cclassified\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d classifications to avoid their own criminal exposure, indictment and prosecutions' such that they further obstruct justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">D. Employ the fact that Grand Jury proceedings are secret for self-serving cover-up purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">E. Having entrenched an inordinate number of former DOJ attorneys as a percentage of U.S. Magistrates and Judges (over 50%) while that class represents less than 4% of all attorneys. So that the scales of justice are tilted toward a pro government bias by jurists \u2014 many of . whom can be relied upon to save harmless and protect public officials who appear to either commit or coverup crimes with impunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">5. The conspiracy and illegal acts complained of in paragraph 4 above which are adopted here by reference with respect to the murder and cover-up of Mr. Hoston\u2019s death is made actionable against various of the defendants on a commonlaw basis within the District of Columbia as more particularly laid out in paragraph 3.B. above. Misfeasance comprises nonfeasance and Plaintiff\u2019s complain that NO evidence was presented to any U.S. Grand Jury regarding violations of Mr. Hoston\u2019s Civil Rights 18 USC 241 &amp; 242 and same was coordinated by an illegal combination and conspiracy of defendants Silbert, Shulke, Postacher, Bell, Pottinger, McDonald, Days, McKinney, Thornburgh, Cullinhane, C. Kelly and Washington or their nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">6. The conspiracy and illegal acts complained of in paragraph 4. above is hereby adopted by reference and is made actionable against various of the defendants on a commonlaw basis as per paragraph 3.B. above with respect to the murder and cover-up of Mr. Hoston\u2019s death, and Plaintiffs complain that advice, instructions, witnesses and evidence were corruptly presented to the D.C. Superior Court Grand Juries and was carefully orchastrated to preclude any indictment of public officials in general and U.S. Marshalls in particular and the defendants thereby commited the commonlaw crime of EMBRACY, obstruction of justice, and violation of their oaths of office and especially that some witnesses were systematically bribed or otherwise placed under duress in order that their testimony be not forthcoming or else at the behest of and in furtherance of a conspiracy to suborn perjurious testimony and same was adduced and by the illegal combination of defendants Silbert, Shulke, Roistacher, Bell, Pottinger, McDonald, Days, Hon. Richard Thornburgh, McKinneky, Burch, John Doe I, II, III &amp; IV, Cullinhane &amp; C. Kelly, or made possible by their nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>7.Plaintiffs complain that with regard to the U.S. Marshalls service the hereinabove mentioned conspiracy (paragraphs 4, 5, &amp; 6) had particular application to the murder and coverup of Mr. Hoston\u2019s death because the U.S. Marshalls service is in a position to practice \u201cextortion\u201d against the Dept, of Justice to effectuate an avoidance of prosecution against members of that service; their having in the past been, along with the F.B.I. \u201chandmaidens\u201d and part of rampant illegalities and an on-going conspiracy with those organizations and \u25a0 Organized Crime, and having remained \u201cloyal\u201d i.e.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO9\">Witness under protection .in organized crime trial murdered/hunting accident, while in custody of US Marshalls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">New York Police Dept. Officers rewarded by being promoted up to U.S. Marshall\u2019s service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Substantial corrupters infiltrate the U.S. Marshalls. (N.Y.P.D. almost totally corrupt as per Frank Serpico) Organized crime then in a position to perform (services to convicted felons in prison) (women, liquer and drugs), &amp; while being transported from institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Marshalls are then in a position to extort and remain under the protectionist umbrella of the conspiracy complained of and the incumbent illegality which has been before and above characterized by a failure to fairly administer Justice by career corrupters within the Department of Justice bureaucracy who for over 30 years have systematically covered up crimes by public officials with illegal working agreements not to prosecute U.S. Government officials within the Depts. of Defense, intelligence, Law Enforcement, Treasury and others for crimes ranging from Murder, drug sales and smuggling, black market profiteering both personally and for U.S. Agencies, wholesale violations of civilian and citizen constitutional &amp; human rights, opening citizen mail, reading private telegrams, unsuspected druggings, employing prostitutes, burgleries, hate mail campaigns, amassing tons of manufactured intelligence against law abiding citizens for purposes of bureaucratic self assasinations, plotting assesinations and effectuating same, suborning perjury to congressional committees, infiltrating congress and their Staff, the judiciary, the executive, branch and infiltrating and corruptly influencing grand juries of which the exoneration of the particular defendant murderers Burch and John Does I, II, III &amp; IV is complained of here.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">All defendants with the exception of Bullock, Barry &amp; Burtell Jefferson, by having adopted that conspiracy to coverup the Murder of Mr. Hoston and having given aid and effectuation to that purpose thereby became accessories after the fact to that crime and are liable over to the plaintiffs for their mis feasance or mal feasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Alternatively the hereinbeforenamed defendants in this Court are liable to the plaintiffs for their nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">8. The defendant McKinney is liable over to the plaintiffs for his nonfeasance and dereliction of duty to properly supervise defendants Burch and John Does I, II, III &amp; IV by failing to have psychological stress testing performed upon those employees to ferret out and deal with their sadistic propensities which would allow the \u201cstomping to death\u201d of the unarmed, manacled &amp; prone Mr.. Hoston. The defendant is charged with particular knowledge of the psychological infirmities of Burch and John Does I, II, III &amp; IV such that had he exercised the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent man would have exercised, Mr. Hoston\u2019s life would remain viable and sacred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">9. Defendants Burch and John Doe I, II, III &amp; IV are sued in their individual capacities for the heinous murder and unjustifiable homicide of Mr. Hoston as above complained and adopted here by reference as a constitutional tort; under the D.C. Wrongful Death Statute and under the common-law for malfeasance in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">10. The allegations in the foregoing counts are adopted here by reference as against the United States of America, The Department of Justice and the U.S. Marshalls Service and these defendants are liable over to Plaintiffs under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">11. The allegations in the foregoing counts are adopted here by reference as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the defendant District of Columbia whereby the past Mayor Washington and all defendant Metropolitan police Officers adopted the illegal conspiracy to cover-up the murder of Mr. Hoston and are liable over to the plaintiffs including defendant Cullinhane \u25a0for commonlaw misfeasance &amp;\u2022.malfeasance or nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">12. All defendants who are employed as attorneys for the Dept, of Justice or were so employed are liable over to the plaintiffs personally (See: <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Guy Goodwin </em>186 US Appl DC 179) in that their criminal and tortious conduct complained of in counts 5 &amp; 6 above and which is hereby adopted for reference and fell outside the confines of those prosecutorial activities for which absolute prosecutorial immunity applies and they are thereby liable over to Plaintiffs for misfeasance, malfeasance or corrupt nonfeasance as per paragraph 3 above, or are liable over for accepting the illegal conspiracy in regard thereto and giving aid and effectuation thereto. This is so because their activities were in aid of an investigative (grand jury) function as opposed to an advocate (prosecutorial) function.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">WHEREFORE premises considered Plaintiffs and each of them demand judgment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">1. As against the United States of America in an amount of Five Million Dollars each for a total of Fifteen Million Dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">2.
