Barnes for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b300-10\">THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"Abj\">In this action the trial court entered a decree for plaintiff, quieting her title to a parcel of real property in Los Angeles County, and allowing her costs in the sum of $23.30. Defendant Anna Meadville, wife of defendant G. G. Meadville, appealed. Plaintiff now moves to dismiss the appeal or affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The appeal does not present any substantial question. Appellant contends that as she was merely her husband\u2019s scribe in his dealings with plaintiff and claimed no personal interest in plaintiff\u2019s property, it was improper to join her as a party defendant in this action, and the evidence affords no support for a decree against her with costs. This position is untenable because in the answer to the complaint, appellant joined with her husband in asserting that they had a leasehold interest in the premises. The evidence affords ample support for entry of the decree with costs against both the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Appellant further claims that the court failed to find upon material issues raised by the answer. This contention arises from the fact that the findings erroneously refer to the answer as the \u201ccross-complaint\u201d. The findings are: \u201cThat all the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint are true; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>allegations of defendants\u2019 cross-complaint admitting that plaintiff is the owner of and in possession of the property described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint are true; that all of the rest of the allegations of defendants\u2019 cross-complaint are not true.\u201d The record shows that the use of the word \u201ccross-complaint\u201d to designate the answer was a pure inadvertence, which calls for correction by this court. (Sec. 956a, Code Civ. Proc.; 1 Cal. Jur. Supp., p. 602, see. 588b.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">It is ordered that the word \u201ccross-complaint\u201d be stricken from the findings, and that the word \u201canswer\u201d be substituted in its place and stead. The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
