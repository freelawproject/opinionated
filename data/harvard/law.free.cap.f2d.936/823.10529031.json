Hilton\u2019s suit against his employer, Defendant-Appellee, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, a Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>corporation, claiming employment discrimination against a \u201chandicapped person\u201d under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5221k (Vernon, 1987)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter TCHRA), was dismissed by the district court when it granted Southwestern\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held \u201cas a matter of law\u201d that AIDS and its related illnesses \u201cby themselves\u201d are not \u201chandicaps\u201d as defined in TCHRA. The district court also dismissed as moot Hilton\u2019s pending motion for a preliminary injunction. Concluding that the district court committed no reversible error, we affirm and, in so doing, find it unnecessary to consider the issues raised by Southwestern on cross appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Hilton sued Southwestern in state district court claiming that Southwestern had refused to allow him to return to work, had ultimately fired him, and had otherwise discriminated against him, on the basis of a \u201chandicap\u201d (AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex (ARC)), in violation of TCHRA. After Southwestern removed the case to federal district court on diversity of citizenship, Hilton moved for a preliminary injunction. Following an evidentiary hearing on the injunction at which considerable evidence was adduced \u2014 including evidence of the diagnoses and opinions of four physicians\u2014 and after the filing of briefs, but before a decision was rendered on the injunction, Southwestern filed its motion for summary judgment to which plaintiff responded. The district court granted Southwestern\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on that court\u2019s determination that Hilton was not \u201chandicapped\u201d for purposes of the TCHRA. Hilton\u2019s suit was dismissed, and his motion for injunctive relief was denied as moot. Hilton timely filed his notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">The historical facts of this case exemplify an often replicated modern tragedy, evoking the sympathy of this court and, we speculate, that of the district court and of Hilton\u2019s employer, thereby making more difficult the 'decisions at each such level. Stripped of'its pathos, however, this case hinges on the distinction between the meanings of <em>handicapped </em>under TCHRA and <em>disability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Southwestern hired Hilton in December, 1976. He worked in the field until a knee injury unrelated to AIDS terminated his ability to climb telephone poles, after which his employment was changed to drafting clerk in the Engineering Design section of Southwestern\u2019s Network Distribution Services Department. Late in October, 1986, Hilton\u2019s physician, Terry Pulse, M.D., diagnosed Hilton as having \u201cHIV +/ARC with thrombocytopenia/ITP.\u201d ITP is a low blood platelet count condition described by Dr. Pulse as \u201clife threatening!\u201d at a time when Hilton had a platelet count of 14,000/mm<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the normal platelet count range being from 140,000 to 250,000)/mm<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Southwestern is a subsidiary of Southwestern Bell Corporation. Southwestern\u2019s employees participate in several of Southwestern Bell Corporation\u2019s non-contributory benefit plans. One is the Southwestern Bell Corporation Sickness and Accident Disability Benefit Plan (the Temporary Plan), providing up to fifty-two weeks of sickness disability benefits for employees with at least six months of service who are totally disabled from available telephone company work. Non-management employees, such as Hilton, who exhaust sickness disability benefits under the Temporary Plan, may apply for benefits under another Southwestern Bell Corporation Plan (the Long Term Plan). Both the Temporary Plan and the Long Term Plan provide wage replacement benefits. Separate plans pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>vide medical expense reimbursement for both active and retired employees. For purposes of medical coverage, a former employee receiving benefits under the Long Term Plan is treated the same as is a retired employee. All of Southwestern\u2019s employees who exhaust their benefits under the Temporary Plan and who apply for and are approved for benefits under the Long Term Plan are effectively terminated from employment by being removed from the active payroll. If such an employee should recover, he may apply for re-employment, but re-employment is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">On or about October 31, 1986, Hilton was absent from work claiming total disability due to a medical condition. On November 7, 1986, he began receiving sickness disability benefits under the Temporary Plan. From November 3, 1986, through September 23, 1987, Dr. Pulse submitted at least twelve separate documents substantiating Hilton\u2019s total disability from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">At the direction of Southwestern\u2019s supervisory personnel, Brady L. Allen, M.D., an internist and an independent medical consultant, examined Hilton on August 18, 1987. In his August 20, 1987, report Dr. Allen found Hilton to be \u201ctotally disabled at this point secondary to rather severe ARC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On October 1, 1987, approximately eleven months following commencement of Hilton\u2019s disability benefit period, Hilton advised his supervisor that Dr. Pulse had released him to return to work and that he (Hilton) intended to return. His supervisors immediately advised him that he should not return to work until further notification and that another medical examination and consultation were being scheduled. On the following day another independent medical consultant, James R. Far-ris, M.D., examined Hilton and found him to have a blood platelet count of 6,000/mm<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Dr. Farris advised that, due to the \u201cseverity of this patient\u2019s thrombocy-topenia,\u201d Hilton should not be returned to work and that even sedentary job duties were \u201cimplausible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"An_F\">The issue was then considered by James T. Wheeler, M.D., Southwestern\u2019s Medical Advisor and a specialist whom Hilton\u2019s physician, Dr. Pulse, identified as an expert Pulse would consult in an ITP situation. Based on the Farris examination and report, on previous medical examinations and laboratory test results, and on other information available to Southwestern\u2019s Benefit Office concerning Hilton\u2019s disability status, Dr. Wheeler advised Southwestern that Hilton was totally disabled from even his sedentary drafting position.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">On October 16, 1987, supervisors in Hilton\u2019s department considered and accepted Dr. Wheeler\u2019s conclusions and decided to advise Hilton that he would not be allowed to return to work. Hilton was so advised that day and was told that upon acceptance of long term disability benefits he would be removed from the payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Hilton responded to supervisors that, in his opinion, Southwestern was discriminating against him and that he intended to file legal charges against Southwestern. Hilton\u2019s attorney contacted Dr. Wheeler to discuss the basis of Southwestern\u2019s decision. A short time later, however, Hilton applied for and was granted disability status under the Long Term Plan, and was removed from Southwestern\u2019s active payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Both Hilton and Southwestern agree \u2014 in fact insist \u2014 that Hilton was not allowed to return to work because Southwestern determined that Hilton would be subjected to an unacceptable risk of harm. The parties also agree that Hilton exhausted his 52-week period of temporary disability, at the end of which he either had to go on permanent disability or return to work, but that Southwestern had denied him the latter alternative. And the parties agree that (1) Hilton\u2019s return to his job would pose no real risk to those around him; (2) the risk posed by ITP was to Hilton and Hilton alone; and (3) Hilton\u2019s termination was the direct result of his low platelet count associated with his ITP. Hilton does not contend that Southwestern's placing him on permanent disability due to his ITP was a pretext, agreeing that the real reason was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>his ITP resulting from AIDS or ARC. In fact, Hilton purports to support his case by quoting Dr. Wheeler\u2019s statement that Hilton\u2019s low platelet count was the \u201cexclusive\u201d reason for Southwestern\u2019s action, and that, as a matter of course, Southwestern disqualifies all individuals suffering from low platelet counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Hilton also cites in support of his claim the acknowledgment by Southwestern\u2019s Dr. Wheeler that Hilton\u2019s medical condition is one which is generally perceived as severely limiting one\u2019s work-related functions, adding that both Hilton\u2019s and Southwestern\u2019s evidence supports such a view as well as the opinion that Hilton\u2019s condition is terminal and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment motion de novo, using the same criteria used by the district court in the first instance. <em>Walker v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>853 F.2d 355, 358 (5th Cir.1988). We \u201creview the evidence and inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Baton Rouge Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Jacobs Constructors, Inc., </em>804 F.2d 879, 881 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (citing <em>Southmark Properties v. Charles House Corp., </em>742 F.2d 862, 873 (5th Cir.1984)). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c). A dispute about a material fact is genuine \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cMaterial facts\u201d are \u201cfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">If, in our de novo review, we find on the basis of the extensive summary judgment evidence presented in this case that there is no genuine issue of material historical fact or expert opinion, but only a difference of opinion between Hilton and Southwestern as to the conclusion to be drawn from those uncontested historical facts and expert opinions, the question whether the inference to be drawn therefrom is legal or factual becomes a non-issue. We find, for the reasons set forth below, that in October, 1987, Hilton was \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of both the Temporary Plan and the Long Term Plan but was not \u201chandicapped\u201d for purposes of TCHRA. And, albeit a non-issue, we confirm on the basis of the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Chevron Corp. v. Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d 314, 318 (Tex.1987), that determination of whether Hilton was handicapped for purposes of TCHRA is a question of law under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">\n<em>A. Statutory Definitions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">We begin with the plain wording of the applicable portions of TCHRA. Section 2.01(7)(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-13\">\u201cHandicapped person\u201d means a person who has a mental or physical handicap, including mental retardation, hardness of hearing, deafness, speech impairment, visual handicap, being crippled, or any other health impairment that requires special ambulatory devices or services, as defined in Section 121.002(4) of Human Resources Code....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5221k, \u00a7 2.01(7)(A). We find no additional clarification in that section\u2019s reference to the Human Resources Code because, in \u00a7 121.002(4) of the HRC, the definition of a \u201chandicapped person\u201d is, verbatim, the same as in TCHRA. Likewise, Section 2.01(7)(B) of TCHRA defines \u201chandicap\u201d in essentially identical terms as those used in its preceding subsection to define \u201chandicapped person,\u201d and likewise refers to the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>definition in the Human Resources Code, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-3\">\u201cHandicap\u201d means a condition either mental or physical that includes mental retardation, hardness of hearing, deafness, speech impairment, visual handicap, being crippled, or any other health impairment that requires special ambulatory devices or services, as defined in Section 121.002(4), Human Resources Code....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Tex.Rev.Stat.Ann. art. 5221k, \u00a7 2.01(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In looking to the two definitional subsections in TCHRA to determine whether, in fact or in law, Hilton\u2019s ITP was a \u201chandicap\u201d and whether Hilton was a \u201chandicapped person,\u201d we first encounter \u00a7 2.01(7)(A) which defines a handicapped person as \u201ca person who has a mental or physical handicap.\u201d Needing a definition of \u201chandicap,\u201d we must move immediately to \u00a7 2.01(7)(B) which purports to define \u201chandicap.\u201d There we are told that \u201chandicap\u201d is either a mental or physical condition, but we are not told what characteristics or effects a mental or physical condition must have in order to constitute a handicap. The only clue we are given is a non-exclusive list of some of the particular mental or physical conditions that TCHRA deems to be handicaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">For definitional statements of that ilk, the only interpretative tool available is the classic <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule: When general words follow an enumeration of persons or things, such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned. That rule is one of limitation, restricting general terms, such as \u201cany other\u201d and \u201cand the like,\u201d which follow specific terms, to matters similar to those specified. <em>See, e.g., United States v. La Brecque, </em>419 F.Supp. 430, 434 (D.N.J.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">While TCHRA\u2019s definitional subsections\u2019 use of \u201cincludes\u201d immediately preceding the list of specific handicaps precludes that list from being interpreted as exclusive, the specific handicaps thus listed, followed by the general words, \u201cor any other health impairment that requires special ambulatory or services\u201d is clearly restrictive. Given the types of handicaps listed and the general language that follows the list, \u201chandicapped\u201d cannot mean simply <em>any </em>mental or physical condition. In applying the <em>ejus-dem generis </em>rule we must, \u25a0 therefore, determine what element or elements are common to each of the particular handicaps identified in the illustrative list. Only by finding such a common thread can we gain insight into the breadth or narrowness of the category being defined by example.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">In the instant case we are not concerned with a question of <em>mental </em>handicap, so we disregard the particular condition appearing first in the list, mental -retardation. The element common to each of the remaining, <em>physical </em>conditions in the statutory list\u2014hardness of hearing, deafness, speech impairment, visual handicap, and being crippled\u2014is that each is a <em>physiological </em>rather than <em>pathological </em>condition of physical health. Although the original <em>cause </em>of each condition could be pathological, congenital, traumatic or the like, in each instance the resulting <em>condition </em>is physiological. Thus, a proper application of the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule leads us to conclude that, other than the particular physical conditions identified in the list, the only physical health conditions capable of constituting a \u201chandicap\u201d for purposes of TCHRA are those which may properly be classified as <em>physiological </em>impairments. Every individual condition in the non-exclusive list is a physiological health impairment, so any \u201cother\u201d condition must be a physiological impairment if it is to be deemed a handicap under TCHRA. Moreover, a properly strict application of the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule would add to the list of specific handicaps only such \u201cother\u201d physiological health impairments as also \u201crequire special ambulatory devices or services.\u201d TCHRA \u00a7 2.01(7)(A) and (B). <em>See also </em>Human Resources Code, \u00a7 121.002(4). Ambulatory devices are only needed to mitigate the debilitating effects of physiological impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">From the standpoint of statutory construction, then, the summary judgment evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>dence in this case eschews any possibility that Hilton\u2019s AIDS, ARC or ITP come within the ambit of TCHRA\u2019s definition of \u201chandicapped.\u201d For all of their horrors, those diseases and conditions have produced in Hilton essentially invisible, pathological results, but no physiological impairments. His ITP has not affected his hearing, speech, vision, taste or smell. Neither has his ITP affected his ability to walk, use his hands and arms, sit or stand. The ITP has not physically \u201ccrippled\u201d Hilton. We speculate that neither a layman nor a physician who is unknowledgeable about Hilton\u2019s disease would suspect a problem merely by looking at him and watching his physical activities on or off the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">As TCHRA fails to define <em>handicap </em>or <em>handicapped person </em>in any manner except by analogical extension of the non-exclusive, illustrative list of health impairments of the type that constitute handicaps, our only source of information is that list of examples. Even if we disregard the additional restriction of \u201cspecial ambulatory devices or services,\u201d we still cannot force AIDS or ARC or ITP into the category of health impairments defined by an <em>ejusdem generis </em>extension of that non-exclusive list of impairing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">\n<em>B. Discrimination Because of Handicap.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The substantive provision of TCHRA applicable to the instant case is contained in ARTICLE 5. DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">Sec. 5.01. It is an unlawful practice for an employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">(1) to ... discharge an individual or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges or employment because of ... handicap....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Basically ignoring the definitional provisions of \u00a7 2.01(7)(A) and (B), Hilton insists that one of the \u201c[Sjpecific rules of construction\u201d found in \u00a7 1.04 of TCHRA somehow mandates a determination in his favor under the above quoted discrimination provision of ARTICLE 5. The special rule of construction relied on by Hilton is subsection (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-11\">(b) In Article 5, \u201cbecause of handicap\u201d or \u201con the basis of handicap\u201d refers to discrimination because of or on the basis of a physical or mental condition that does <em>not </em>impair an individual\u2019s ability to reasonably perform a job. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5221k, \u00a7 1.04(b). Agreeing with Southwestern that his medical condition, ITP, is one which is generally perceived as severely limiting one\u2019s work-related functions and that it is \u201cbeyond dispute\u201d that his condition is \u201clife threatening,\u201d Hilton emphasizes in his brief to this court that \u201c[nevertheless, [Hilton\u2019s] illness, which restricts his ability to perform various physical functions,.... <em>does not </em>affect his ability to reasonably perform the duties required by the sedentary job of a Drafting Clerk.\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Accepting, arguendo, Hilton\u2019s first thesis that, as per <em>Redmon, </em>a claimant\u2019s threshold burden in seeking to establish that he is \u201chandicapped\u201d for purposes of TCHRA is to show that his disqualifying condition is one which is \u201cgenerally perceived as severely limiting him in performing work-related functions in general,\u201d <em>Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d at 318; and accepting, arguendo, his second thesis that his own illness does not prevent the reasonable performance of duties associated with his Drafting Clerk job, we must nevertheless conclude that he is neither \u201chandicapped\u201d as defined in TCHRA, nor, if he were handicapped, discriminated against, under that act. To hold otherwise would be to treat \u00a7 1.04(b) as a mandatory, per se rule, requiring an automatic finding of discrimination in every instance of a \u201chandicap\u201d that does <em>not </em>impair the employee\u2019s ability to perform the specific functions of a job. Even accepting Hilton\u2019s first two theses, his logic to reach the conclusion of his syllogism is severely flawed, as is his reliance on <em>Redmon. </em>First, the obvious and only purposes of \u00a7 1.04(b) of TCHRA is to shield employers from claims of discrimination by an employee whose physical or mental condition is a \u201chandicap\u201d which does in fact impair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>his \u201cability to reasonably perform a job.\u201d Simply put, TCHRA does not force employers to hire or retain a handicapped person who, because of his handicap, simply cannot perform a job. But Hilton would have us turn this employer\u2019s shield into an employee\u2019s per se sword, so that the firing of any employee who has a handicap that does <em>not </em>impair his ability \u201cto reasonably perform a job\u201d will automatically be deemed a termination \u201cbecause of\u201d such handicap and thus per se discriminatory. Such a converse application of \u00a7 1.04(b) simply is not warranted. In fact, it was just such an approach by the Texas Court of Appeals that the Texas Supreme Court rejected in <em>Redmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">\n<em>C. Other Authorities.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">But even if that were the rule \u2014 and certainly no Texas court has held it to be \u2014 Hilton could not rely on it under the facts of his case. Remembering that our task here is to determine whether Hilton\u2019s AIDS or ARC, or his ITP produced by those conditions, is a \u201chandicap\u201d within the meaning of TCHRA, we are forced to reject Hilton\u2019s urgings that we be guided by cases which have classified AIDS and AIDS related conditions as handicaps under the Federal Rehabilitation Act. The Texas Supreme Court in <em>Redmon </em>forbids such unwarranted analogy. <em>Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Neither is Hilton\u2019s reliance on a 1987 opinion of the Texas Attorney General (Tex.Atty.Gen.Op. No. JM-648 (March 19, 1987)) valid. Most significantly, that opinion predated <em>Redmon </em>which obliterated the premises on which the Attorney General\u2019s opinion was based. Also, that Attorney General\u2019s opinion, issued to the Texas Commission on Human Rights, dealt solely with <em>standing </em>and merely concluded, in the negative, that \u201ca number of mental and physical conditions, including chronic illnesses and diseases may be covered under the Act for purposes of a person having a standing to file a complaint\u201d so that, for purposes of standing, \u201ca handicap is not limited to mental and physical conditions expressly enumerated section 2.01(7) of the act and may include chronic illnesses and contagious diseases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 6. Hilton\u2019s standing is not at issue; and Southwestern has nowhere argued that the illustrative definitional lists in \u00a7 2.01(7)(A) and (B) are exclusive. We certainly recognize that a physical condition, such as those of a physiological nature identified in the non-exclusive lists in TCHRA, which <em>results from </em>a chronic illness or contagious disease may well constitute a \u201chandicap\u201d for purposes of TCHRA. In those instances, however, it is the physiological condition produced by the disease or illness, not the disease or illness itself, that is the handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">We concur in the determination of the district court that Hilton\u2019s ITP is <em>not </em>a handicap for purposes of TCHRA. It clearly produces no mental condition affecting his job performance; neither does it produce an impairing, job-related physiological condition that, under the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule, could be found to fit into the same set of conditions as by analogical extension is defined in the non-exclusive list of examples of the members of that set.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Not only does Hilton misconstrue the purpose and use of the special rule of construction of \u00a7 1.04(b) of TCHRA, he also reaches an erroneous conclusion that his \u201cphysical or mental condition ... does not impair [his] ability to reasonably perform a job.\u201d Had Southwestern terminated him for ITP at the time he was a lineman and not reassigned him to the position of drafting clerk, a position which by his own declaration is the most sedentary job in the company, he may well have been able to show discrimination because of handicap within the meaning of TCHRA because \u00a7 1.04(b) talks about performing <em>\u201ca </em>job\u201d and not <em>\u201chis </em>job.\u201d But even if we read \u201ca job\u201d to mean \u201cany job,\u201d Southwestern met that test because when Hilton advised Southwestern of his AIDS/ARC/ITP, he already held the safest job Southwestern had for sufferers of ITP.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Hilton\u2019s problem with \u00a7 1.04(b) is with the word \u201creasonably.\u201d Agreeing for the sake of argument that Hilton\u2019s ITP does not impair his ability to perform the specific work functions of a drafting clerk, we nevertheless find it inescapable that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>performance cannot be deemed reasonable. Although he poses no threat to others, Hilton\u2019s return to work as a drafting clerk would pose to himself a constant risk of instant death. The testimony of his physician, of two independent consulting physicians, and of Southwestern\u2019s physician are unanimous in the conclusion that Hilton\u2019s alarmingly low platelet count places him in harm\u2019s way with his every move. The mere act of traveling from home to work and back each day would be death defying. The slightest jar, whether from a \u201cfender bender,\u201d from his own elbow, or from the most innocuous object \u2014 the corner of a drafting table, a file cabinet, a water fountain, or a fellow worker's slightest jostle\u2014 could rupture his spleen or otherwise cause uncontrollable, fatal bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">TCHRA does not tell employers that, despite such constant exposure to job-related fatality, a condition such as Hilton\u2019s does not impair an employee\u2019s ability to \u201creasonably\u201d perform a job. What could be more unreasonable than to tell an employer that, simply because the employee\u2019s mental or physical condition does not prevent his drawing lines on tracing paper, using a T-square, or otherwise physically drafting, the employee\u2019s physical condition cannot be said to prevent the <em>reasonable </em>performance of duties generally associated with or related to the drafting clerk job. Every trip to the pencil sharpener, to the supply closet, to the restroom, to a supervisor\u2019s office, or elsewhere \u2014 each a job-related function \u2014 is for Hilton a potentially fatal act. Working under such Damoclean conditions simply cannot be construed to be a <em>reasonable </em>job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\n<em>D. The Lessons of Redmon.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">As Hilton states in his brief, there are no court decisions construing ITP, or for that matter AIDS or ARC, in the context of TCHRA. Hilton acknowledges that the Texas Attorney General\u2019s opinion on standing is the only Texas authority touching on Hilton\u2019s disease or contagious diseases generally and, as we have already determined, it is inapposite. <em>Redmon </em>is the only significant Texas ease to date treating in depth the definition of <em>handicapped </em>under TCHRA. Although Hilton purports to rely on <em>Redmon, </em>that reliance is sorely misplaced; <em>Redmon </em>actually supports Southwestern\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Admittedly, <em>Redmon </em>is somewhat distinguishable from this case on its facts \u2014 Ms. Redmon\u2019s condition was sight impairment which, unlike Hilton\u2019s ITP, is not only a physiological impairment in the nature of those contained on the definitional lists but, as a \u201cvisual handicap,\u201d is one of the illustrative examples expressly listed in \u00a7 2.01(7)(A) and (B). Ms. Redmon\u2019s visual impairment was moderate while Hilton\u2019s disability is extreme. <em>Redmon </em>is nevertheless instructive. The Texas Supreme Court found, as we noted above, that TCHRA\u2019s definitions of \u201c \u2018handicap\u2019 and \u2018handicapped person\u2019 do not detail what is covered by that term....\u201d So, said that court, \u201c[w]e have therefore examined the entire Act, the predecessor acts, and the legislative history of these acts to determine what the Act is intended to cover.\u201d <em>Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d at 316 (citations omitted). Through its exhaustive examination the Texas Supreme Court found, inter alia, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvnQ\">A review of the statutes and the legislative history of this Act reveals that the legislature was concerned with protecting persons with impairments of an incapacitating nature. Furthermore, the legislature obviously chose not to employ the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d in the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 \u2014 796(i). In fact, the legislature did not even refer to that Act in section 1.02 describing the purposes of the Act. We therefore choose not to employ the definition of \u201cindividual with handicaps\u201d in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">In light of such strong rejection, the lengthy discussion of cases under the federal Act in Hilton\u2019s brief is unavailing and disingenuous, as is his citation to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s opinion without acknowledging that it was emasculated by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Redmon. </em>Equally disingenuous is Hilton\u2019s argument that <em>Redmon </em>stands for the proposition that determination of a handicapped condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>tion is a question of fact not, as found by the district court, a question of law. In his brief to this court, Hilton quotes <em>Red-</em>mon\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he question of whether a person is \u2018handicapped\u2019 is generally a question of fact for the fact finder.\u201d But deliberately omitted from his brief are the two sentences in the <em>Redmon </em>opinion which immediately follow the one he quoted. Those sentences read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">\u201cWe hold that based on this summary judgment record, however, there is no evidence that Redmon is handicapped and thus, no fact issue has been raised. <em>As a matter of law, </em>Redmon\u2019s disabilities do not constitute those severe impairments which article 5221k was intended to protect.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-5\"><em>Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">As was the ease with Ms. Redmon whose left eye vision could only be corrected to 20-60 and was thus not deemed by the court to be the type of person \u201cwith impairments of an incapacitating nature,\u201d <em>id., </em>Hilton\u2019s disabilities do not constitute those severe impairments which TCHRA was intended to protect. <em>Id. </em>His disease does not produce physiological impairments which prevent him from going to and from work, moving within the building, sitting, standing, obtaining supplies, going to restrooms, lunchrooms, supervisor\u2019s offices, or the like. By his own insistence, Hilton\u2019s ITP has not <em>impaired </em>his ability to perform the professional acts of a drafting clerk. The distinction is that, in performing all of those work-related functions without any limitation, much less severe limitations, he is nevertheless a classical \u201caccident looking for a place to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In a nutshell, Hilton is <em>totally disabled </em>but he is neither \u201cseverely impaired\u201d as required by <em>Redmon </em>nor \u201chandicapped\u201d within the restrictive definition of TCHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">To hold otherwise would transform every characteristic an employer uses to make employment decisions into a \u201chandicap.\u201d Employers should have the right and the freedom to make their employment decisions without interference unless they discriminate against some protected group which might otherwise be unfairly denied employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\"><em>Redmon, </em>745 S.W.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">The summary judgment evidence establishes without factual disagreement that Southwestern treats all employees with ITP as <em>disabled </em>just as it did Hilton. Both the Temporary Plan and the Long Term Plan provide <em>disability </em>income for all employees thus disabled; and Hilton was no exception. Other non-contributory plans sponsored by Southwestern\u2019s parent corporation provide medical expenses reimbursement to such disabled employees. If in the future Hilton\u2019s ITP should diminish to such a degree that his platelet count rises to a safe level, he will be free to apply for reinstatement of employment. All of those benefits that Southwestern provides for its employees hardly paint a picture of a discriminatory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Leaning heavily on professional opinions \u2014 those of its own Medical Advisor, two independent consulting physicians, and Hilton\u2019s own physician \u2014 Southwestern made a totally defensible determination that Hilton is disabled and thus entitled to all disability benefits provided by his employer \u2014 a determination which Hilton neither alleged nor presented evidence to prove to be pretextural. If anything in this case has the appearance of pretext it is the insistence by Hilton and Dr. Pulse that in October, 1987, when Hilton\u2019s platelet count had dropped to 6,000/mm3, he was no longer disabled and was fit for work. After all, it was Hilton and Dr. Pulse who, in October, 1986, and throughout the ensuing eleven months, had maintained continuously that Hilton was totally disabled from working as a drafting clerk because his platelet count was 14,000/mm3! One can only ask rhetorically how a worker can be totally disabled for the fifty-two weeks of the Temporary Plan due to a low platelet count but be fit for work when the benefit period runs out despite a platelet count of less than half the count that was so \u201clife threatening\u201d as to produce total disability only a year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>For the foregoing reasons we concur m the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Southwestern, dismissing Hilton\u2019s lawsuit with prejudice. We also concur in that court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief to Hilton as moot. Our agreement with the district court also makes consideration of the issues raised in Southwestern\u2019s cross appeal unnecessary. The judgment and related rulings of the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-6\">. All the alleged unlawful employment practices made the subject of plaintiff's pleadings took place in 1987, so references to the Act are to that statute prior to September, 1989, the effective date of 1989 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-11\">. Southwestern asserted time bar, absence of evidence of pretext, action taken pursuant to a bona fide employee benefit plan which is not a subterfuge, and federal preemption because Hilton was covered by a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">. The record reveals that, at the time of the injunction hearing on August 4, 1989, Southwestern had 18 employees in the Dallas division who had been diagnosed as having AIDS, and that 11 of those 18 were still working.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
