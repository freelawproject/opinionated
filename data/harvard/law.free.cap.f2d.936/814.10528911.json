JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b895-19\">Two questions are posed in this bankruptcy case: whether the court properly dismissed from Chapter 11 protection a one-asset real estate \u201cdevelopment\u201d whose manager admitted his principal responsibility was \u201cmowing the grass and waiting for the market to turn;\u201d and whether the debt- or\u2019s counsel must disgorge their $40,000 retainer because of an actual conflict between their representation of the debtor and its investors-guarantors of the partnership debt. We affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders of dismissal and disgorgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b895-22\">Humble Place was one of the many would-be commercial developments that sprang from a gleam in a developer\u2019s eye during Houston\u2019s frenzied real estate market of 1980. Starting as a 30-acre tract of raw land, purchased by Humble Place Joint Venture from the Vestal and Fory families, the development never grew past the stage of subdividing the land into 80 parcels and adding streets, curbs and basic utilities. Until 1984, the sales of some lots generated cash from promissory notes. From and after 1985, through the filing of bankruptcy in 1988, Houston\u2019s real estate crash took its toll: one lot was sold in each of 1987 and 1988, but none in 1985 or 1986. Worse yet, Humble Place was forced to foreclose on $2.7 million of the $7 million in tracts previously sold, devastating the project\u2019s cash flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\">The general partnership<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>in September, 1988 to avoid imminent foreclosure by Post Oak Bank, its principal secured creditor. At the date of bankruptcy, Post Oak Bank was owed approximately $2.2 million, secured by liens on various tracts and notes receivable from some of the sales. Post Oak Bank\u2019s lien was at least fully secured as of the hearing on dismissal. Haplessly, Post Oak Bank lent money to the project in late 1985, and more haplessly, the original landowners, Vestal/Fory, had exchanged some of their liens on notes and tracts for other notes and personal guarantees by the individual investors of Humble Place so that Post Oak Bank could step in. Vestal/Fory were owed approximately $800,000 on the date of bankruptcy and were undersecured by their collateral apart from guarantees. There were two unsecured, non-insider creditors of Humble Place, whose total claims were less than $7,000, and unpaid 1987 real estate taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Humble Place had no employees of its own, for its books were kept by National Land Company, the managing general partner. The only \u201cdevelopment\u201d activities still conducted on behalf of Humble Place included the marketing of lots, accounting for note payments, approving construction plans, should construction occur, and property maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Unlike some one-asset debtors, Humble Place had $110,000 in the bank just before it paid counsel\u2019s Chapter 11 retainer. This money included payments from notes collaterally assigned to Vestal/Fory and paid off before the Chapter 11 filing. Humble Place also had some unencumbered assets, including several lots worth an estimated $600,000 to $700,000, some unencumbered promissory notes, monthly maintenance fees and furniture, fixtures and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Hoping to emerge quickly and painlessly from Chapter 11, Humble Place filed a proposed reorganization plan shortly after it commenced the bankruptcy. The thrust of the plan was simple: each secured creditor\u2019s claim would be satisfied in full by an orderly liquidation, whereby Humble Place would abandon property and notes to Post Oak Bank and Vestal/Fory, while the individuals\u2019 guarantees would be released. Humble Place stated its intention to pay all creditors in full. The bankruptcy proceedings were not harmonious, however, because the secured creditors had already negotiated vainly with the debtor for several months, Vestal/Fory continued pursuing its state court lawsuits against the guarantors, and Vestal/Fory were upset by the diversion of its note payments just before bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">When Post Oak Bank moved to dismiss the case under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, Vestal/Fory joined in. The court, after hearing exhaustive testimony, agreed with the creditors and dismissed. After a separate hearing, the court ruled that counsel for Humble Place had labored under an actual conflict of interest proscribed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a), requiring that the attorneys\u2019 retainers be disgorged. Humble Place has appealed both rulings, first, unsuccessfully, to the district court, and now to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">THE DISMISSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to dismiss for abuse of discretion, reversing its findings of fact only if they were clearly erroneous. The court\u2019s finding that Humble Place\u2019s Chapter 11 petition was not filed \u201cin good faith\u201d is one of fact. <em>Little Creek Development Co. v. Commonwealth Mortgage Corp. (In re: Little Creek), 779 </em>F.2d 1068 (5th Cir.1986). The Bankruptcy Code provision that a Chapter 11 case may be dismissed \u201cfor cause\u201d has been interpreted to include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>lack of good faith in its filing. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Little Creek, </em>779 F.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Humble Place objects to the dismissal of its Chapter 11 case for three reasons: the bankruptcy court did not properly apply this court\u2019s test from <em>Little Creek </em>in reaching its decision; the court\u2019s findings of fact based on <em>Little Creek </em>were clearly erroneous; and there is no statutory or constitutional authority for dismissal of a Chapter 11 case for lack of good faith. Taken in reverse order, these arguments show fatal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">First, it does Humble Place no good to challenge the status of <em>Little Creek </em>as governing law in this circuit. Each panel is bound by our prior precedent until and unless en banc review occurs, which Humble Place has not yet sought here. <em>Umphlet v. Connick, </em>815 F.2d 1061, 1063 (5th Cir.1987). Because <em>Little Creek </em>explicitly treated the question of good faith dismissals under \u00a7 1112, the case settles any statutory or constitutional question about that procedure. <em>See also In re Natural Land Corp., </em>825 F.2d 296, 297 (11th Cir.1987); <em>Matter of Winshall\u2019s Settlor\u2019s Trust, </em>758 F.2d 1136, 1137 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Second, the objections that Humble Place levies against specific findings of fact by the bankruptcy court, other than the ultimate finding on lack of good faith, are quibbles. The joint venture contends, for instance, that contrary to the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding, it <em>did </em>have employees. While employees of National Land Company received monthly checks from the joint venture to the extent that they performed any work for it, however, the testimony also showed that they were similarly paid by each of Conner\u2019s several real estate ventures and were not dependent on Humble Place for their livelihood. Insofar as Humble Place suggests that the bankruptcy court erred in intimating a lack of <em>subjective </em>good faith, this is a straw man: the court drew no such conclusion, and there is no suggestion of malfeasance by the partnerships. Humble Place also quarrels with the bankruptcy court\u2019s description of its holding as \u201craw land,\u201d because it allegedly spent $1 million to develop the tracts with paving and utilities. The bankruptcy court\u2019s description serves adequately, however, to distinguish the state of Humble Place from a debtor which owned an <em>operating </em>single asset such as a hotel or restaurant. The \u201cbusiness\u201d of Humble Place, as Conner acknowledged, had for several years consisted of \u201cmowing the grass and waiting for market conditions to turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">More significantly, Humble Place argues that the bankruptcy court misapplied the <em>Little Creek </em>criteria. The joint venture quotes <em>Little Creek </em>as relying on a bankruptcy court\u2019s \u201con-the-spot evaluation of the debtor\u2019s financial condition, motives, and the local financial realities,\u201d 779 F.2d at 1071, but it asserts that the court did not properly analyze the latter two circumstances. According to Humble Place, its motive was to protect its investors\u2019 equity in the project while offering the creditors a full pay-off. Humble Place says it was not motivated by a desire to delay creditors; further, it says, the bankruptcy court simply ignored the impact of \u201clocal financial realities\u201d on the type of plan it could propose.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">We disagree with Humble Place\u2019s characterization of the bankruptcy court decision and with its contention that the bankruptcy court misapplied <em>Little Creek. </em>The bankruptcy court carefully went through the factors listed in <em>Little Creek </em>as indicia of a \u201cbad faith\u201d filing, 779 F.2d at 1072-73, and found most of them applicable to this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>We need not recount all of the parallels with the <em>Little Creek </em>factors, for they are apparent from the previous factual recitation. Two significant factors differentiate this case from <em>Little Creek, </em>but not in any way helpful to Humble Place. First, the bankruptcy court found that the principal purpose of the Chapter 11 filing was to \u201ccleanse the partners of their liability.\u201d Of course, the partners are not the Chapter 11 debtor, and their fate is irrelevant to the propriety of Humble Place\u2019s filing. The court was correct to determine that this impermissible purpose cast doubt on the venture\u2019s objective good faith. Second, the partners\u2019 alleged interest in maintaining their equity was pierced by the court\u2019s logic. There would be equity remaining to the partnership <em>even if </em>Post Oak Bank and Vestal/Fory both foreclosed and all the unsecured, non-insider debts were paid. The partners feared, however, that they could lose additional \u201cequity\u201d in the bank\u2019s specific collateral, while they would individually be called to account on the Vestal/Fory guarantees because of its un-dersecured position. These disputes were fully capable of resolution in state court without the delay and expense caused by bankruptcy. In a case with features similar to these, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a dismissal. <em>In re Phoenix Piccadilly, Ltd., </em>849 F.2d 1393 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Humble Place finally contends that if <em>Little Creek </em>is applied without regard to consideration of overriding motives and local economic realities, \u201cthe result is economic apartheid against the real estate industry,\u201d because many of the factors adduced in <em>Little Creek </em>are typical of real estate development ventures. While the latter observation may be true, the former calumny is surely overblown. There are several instances in which even one-asset real estate ventures would invoke Chapter 11 in good faith: the asset may be an operating business, like a ranch or a hotel; the development might be nearing the end of construction whose completion would markedly enhance the asset\u2019s value; and even a venture including undeveloped property might file to protect true owner equity when market conditions suggest the remedy of a debt restructuring, as opposed to simple liquidation, and the likelihood of prompt resale. <em>See Cohn, </em>Good Faith and the Single-Asset Debtor, 62 Am.Bankr.L.J. 131 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">This case follows none of those models. Humble Place\u2019s developers long ago misinterpreted market conditions in the Houston area. The record shows virtually no sales of lots for four years before bankruptcy, supporting the bankruptcy court\u2019s prediction that there would be no prompt turnaround in Houston. There is no \u201cbusiness\u201d to reorganize nor unsecured creditors who need protection; enough cash was on hand at the date of bankruptcy to pay the non-insider unsecured creditors. The investors\u2019 goal was relief from their personal guarantees to Vestal/Fory<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and preservation of a speculative equity in the property that was subject to Post Oak Bank\u2019s lien. There was no question that, even after paying Vestal/Fory, the investors could retain some unencumbered property. Personal guarantees of non-debtors are not ordinarily, and are certainly not here, a legitimate concern of Chapter 11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, the preservation of the investors\u2019 equity must be evaluated in the harsh light of the ongoing costs of bankruptcy administration and taxes, which deplete such equity at a steady pace. The court implicitly found that the risk to secured creditors of a continuing Chapter 11 case outweighed the benefit to Humble Place, particularly because the partnership\u2019s estimate of \u201cequity\u201d in the property subject to Post Oak Bank\u2019s lien depended upon a five-year sales period to achieve \u201cfair market value\u201d. The record does not give us cause to disagree with the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">DISGORGEMENT OF FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">In order to receive compensation as counsel for the debtor, an attorney must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>disinterested and may hold no interest adverse to the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a). Section 101 of the Code defines \u201ca disinterested person\u201d as one who \u201cdoes not have any interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate ... by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to, connection with, or interest in the debtor ... or for any other reason.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(13). Further, \u00a7 328(e) allows the court to deny compensation to a professional in any case where \u201csuch professional person is not a disinterested person, or represents or holds an interest adverse to the interest of the estate.\u201d <em>See Pierson &amp; Gaylen v. Creel and Atwood (In re: Consolidated Bancshares, Inc., </em>785 F.2d 1249 (5th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Applying the statutory standards, the bankruptcy court found an actual conflict of interest in the representation by debtors\u2019 counsel both of Conner and of the debtor. The court found that the proposed plan was clearly formed to benefit the partners rather than the creditors and that it would have been very hard for debtor\u2019s counsel, in light of this purpose, to decide how to structure the plan. The court reached this conclusion after hearings not only on the motion to disqualify counsel but on several other hotly contested matters in the bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The principal objection of Humble Place to this finding is that its attorneys\u2019 former representation of Conner could not create an actual conflict with its present representation of the joint venture. We disagree. This is in fact a classic case for disqualification of a debtor\u2019s counsel. Although the Code does not prevent counsel from representing a debtor solely because counsel may represent a creditor of the debtor, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(c), here, the counsel\u2019s loyalty to reorganizing the debtor\u2019s estate would be tested at every turn by the very real, continuing interest of his client Conner in avoiding exposure on a guarantee. The bankruptcy court believed that the conflict was evidenced by a proposed plan that actually, and gratuitously, relieved the principals of their guaranty obligations. The finding of an actual conflict is one of fact, and the record does not suggest that the court\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous. We emphasize, however, that such findings are fact-bound, and we venture no pronouncements on the scope of \u00a7 327 beyond the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">It follows that the order requiring the counsel to disgorge its retainer was authorized. Even though the case was dismissed, the $40,000 returned to Humble Place would be available to satisfy claims such as those of taxing authorities, Vestal/Fory or Conner.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, are again AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-14\">.
