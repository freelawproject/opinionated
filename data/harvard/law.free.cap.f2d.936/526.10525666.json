The district court refused to amend the judgment, finding that quadru-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>pie damages were not permitted by CERC-LA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The district court awarded damages to the government under section 9607(c)(3) of CERCLA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">If any person who is liable for a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance fails without sufficient cause to properly provide removal or remedial action ..., such person may be liable to the United States for punitive damages in an amount at least equal to, and not more than three times, the amount of any costs incurred by the Fund as a result of such failure to take proper action. The President is authorized to commence a civil action against any such person to recover the punitive damages, which shall be in addition to any costs recovered from such person pursuant to section 9612(c) of this title. Any moneys received by the United States pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the Fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The district court interpreted this statute to prohibit the award to the government of four times the response costs, because the government did not recover any costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9612(c). Section 9612(c) allows the government to recover against hazardous waste dumpers when an innocent party cleans up the wastes, makes a claim against the Fund established by CERCLA, and is paid by the Fund. When the Fund pays the claim, the government acquires by subrogation the rights of the claimant against the dumpers.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">The district court erred in interpreting the statute so as to prohibit the award of four times the response costs. The precise question of statutory interpretation raised here seems to be one of first impression; no other court has discussed whether the government may recover four times the response costs <em>only </em>when it has received subrogated rights under section 9612(c). None of the cases cited by the district court involve the precise issue of whether the government can recover four times the response costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a number of courts and commentators have assumed that section 9607(c)(3) allows the government to recover both its costs and three times its costs, which recovery is the equivalent of quadruple the response costs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">We have not been able to discover evidence in the legislative history of Congress\u2019 intent with respect to the government\u2019s recovery of both costs and punitive damages. As other courts have noted, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>legislative history of CERCLA is vague, reflecting the compromise nature of the legislation eventually enacted....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore turn to the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Section 9607(c)(3) provides for \u201cpunitive damages.\u201d Punitive damages are \u201cdamages on an increased scale, awarded to the plaintiff <em>over and above </em>what will barely compensate him for his property loss.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the CERCLA context, one court has held, \u201cBy definition, punitive damages do not compensate a plaintiff, nor do they remedy a wrong. Punitive damages are designed to punish a wrongdoer and deter grossly improper conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the ordinary meaning of punitive damages, we hold that Congress intended that punitive damages be <em>in addition to </em>whatever costs had been incurred in cleaning up the waste site.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Our conclusion is bolstered by another provision of CERCLA. The defendants were found liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a), which makes those involved with the disposal of hazardous substances liable for \u201call costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government ... not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.... \u201d Liability is imposed \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection (b) of this section.\u201d Section 9607(a) indicates that liability for the actual costs of a clean-up cannot be avoided, except by operation of section 9607(b), which has no application here. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the government could recover only punitive damages and not also its costs effectively removes defendants\u2019 liability for costs under section 9607(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">More importantly, the district court did not consider the interrelationship of the sentences in section 9607(c)(3) when interpreting the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The section contains three sentences, of which only the first two concern us. The first sentence establishes the liability of persons who violate orders to clean up hazardous wastes \u201cfor punitive damages in an amount at least equal to, and not more than three times, the amount of any costs incurred by the Fund.\u201d The first sentence therefore refers to punitive damages that result from situations in which the government itself has cleaned up the hazardous wastes. Given that punitive damages are traditionally separate and distinct from actual injury, the first sentence does not in any way limit the government\u2019s right of recovery to a total of three times its response costs. The second sentence deals with a completely distinct situation: It authorizes the President \u201cto commence a civil action against [a CERCLA violator] to recover the punitive damages,\u201d which are in addition to costs recovered pursuant to section 9612(c). The just-quoted language matches language in section 9612(c)(3), which authorizes the President to \u201ccommence an action on behalf of the Fund to recover any compensation paid by the Fund to any claimant pursuant to this subchap-ter.\u201d The second sentence of section 9607(c)(3) thus appears to have been added primarily for the purpose of authorizing the <em>commencement </em>of an action to obtain punitive damages as a result of costs recovered by a claimant from the Fund and secondarily to clarify that the response costs plus three times the response costs are recoverable in such an action. The language in the second sentence does not clearly operate to limit the first sentence\u2019s authorization of punitive damages and response costs. And as the second circuit noted with respect to CERCLA, we are unwilling to interpret the statute \u201cin any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>way that apparently frustrates the statute\u2019s goals, in the absence of a specific congressional intention otherwise.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We accordingly believe that the section should be interpreted to allow the government to recover up to a total of four times the amount it expended in cleaning up the hazardous wastes.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">As an aside, we note that the antitrust laws authorize plaintiffs to recover only a total of \u201cthreefold the damages.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the statutory language of this provision is so different from the language at issue that we do not believe it provides any guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED. This case is REMANDED for the district court to redetermine the appropriate amount due from the defendants. The district court is authorized to award the government\u2019s actual response costs plus up to three times those response costs as a result of the defendants\u2019 violation of CERCLA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AjaS\">. <em>United States v.
