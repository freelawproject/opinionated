JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Helen Barber brought this action in a Texas district court against the Security Benefit Life Insurance Company on an insurance policy covering the life of Barber\u2019s deceased husband. Security Benefit removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, and discovery commenced. Security Benefit contends that the parties settled the case for $6,430.22, but Barber vehemently disputes this contention. The district court enforced the alleged settlement and entered an order, filed August 6, 1990, dismissing the case with prejudice. On August 29, Barber filed a \u201cmotion for rehearing\u201d that urged the court to reconsider its decision to enforce the settlement. This motion was denied two days later. Barber filed a notice of appeal on September 27, purporting to appeal from both the order dismissing the case and the order denying rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">Security Benefit has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for Barber\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal within the time provided by Fed.R.App.P. 4(a). We conclude that Barber has not complied with Rule 4 and that we lack appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-19\">Although we hesitate to deny a litigant her day in our court, the requirements of Rule 4 are both clear and strict.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An appellant has 30 days from the entry of a final judgment in which to file a notice of appeal. The 30-day period may be extended if a <em>timely </em>motion is filed in the district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment. By its own terms, a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cshall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d Barber served her motion for rehearing on August 29, some 23 days after entry of judgment on August 6. Thus, her motion was untimely and ineffective to extend the 30-day period. Our court has consistently adhered to this rule. <em>See, e.g., Washing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>ton v. Patlis, </em>868 F.2d 172, 174 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Martin v. Wainwright, </em>469 F.2d 1072 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 1538, 36 L.Ed.2d 199 (1973). The notice of appeal filed on September 27- \u2014 or 52 days after entry of judgment \u2014 was not timely, and we lack jurisdiction to hear Barber\u2019s appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Barber does not dispute any of this analysis. Rather, her counsel, an associate at the firm of Reaud, Morgan &amp; Quinn, attempts to excuse his default by wrapping himself in the cloak of a \u201cprotective order\u201d issued by District Judge Robert Parker in the now-famous class-action asbestos lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas in which Reaud, Morgan &amp; Quinn participated. The order stated: \u201call the attorneys from [two specified law firms] are protected from having to participate in any pretrial or trial matters in any state or federal court from this date until the conclusion of the trial in this case,\u201d which was October 5, 1990. The attorney claims that under Judge Parker\u2019s order, \u201cthe Rules of Procedure were suspended\u201d as to him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">First, the order by its terms applies only to \u201cpretrial or trial matters,\u201d which the attorney might reasonably construe not to include the post-trial filing of a notice of appeal. Second, the attorney did in fact construe the order not to preclude his filing a motion for rehearing. Third, it is evident that the attorney chose to participate in this case during precisely the period covered by Judge Parker\u2019s protective order and notwithstanding that order. We are reluctant to encourage attorneys to have it both ways as a result of the \u201cprotective order\u201d: to participate in other cases despite their ongoing responsibilities in the asbestos litigation, and yet to assert that they may ignore the consequences of other courts\u2019 rulings with impunity. Finally, we doubt that a district court\u2019s order in a separate case can extend the deadline for filing a notice of appeal. Even the court of appeals cannot enlarge the 30-day period prescribed by Rule 4(a). <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 26(b). Only the district court (in which the case was heard), \u201cupon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time prescribed by Rule 4(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>4(a)(5). Although Judge Parker\u2019s order may have given the attorney \u201cgood cause,\u201d he made no motion to extend the time to file his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">For these reasons, the appeal was untimely and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-13\"> Fed.R.App.P. 4 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag9\">(a) Appeals in Civil Cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2L6\">(1) In a civil case in which an appeal is permitted by law as of right from a district <em>court </em>to a court of appeals the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be filed with the clerk of the district court within 30 days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">(4) If a timely motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is filed in the district court by any party: ...
