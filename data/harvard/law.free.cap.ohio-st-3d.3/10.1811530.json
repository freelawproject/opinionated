Moreover, appellant\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of collateral estoppel and double jeopardy, as invoked in <em>People </em>v. <em>Grayson </em>(1974), 58 Ill. 2d 260, 319 N.E. 2d 43, is misplaced. While the court in <em>Grayson </em>did reverse on appeal a probation revocation which took place after a criminal trial had resulted in a not guilty finding to a charge of armed robbery, that revocation hearing did indeed relitigate the same factual issues resolved in such prior criminal proceeding. Here, appellant was not required to run the gauntlet twice as the criminal charge was dismissed after probation was revoked. The instant prohibition action, directed to such probation violation determination, was at the least, misdirected.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Appellant has further made no showing of the inadequacy of the remedy of appeal from the revocation of his probation and his attempt to equate criminal due process rights, including right to trial by jury, with rights attendant a probation violation hearing, would properly be the subject of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">For reason of the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b37-8\">J.P. Celebrezze, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
