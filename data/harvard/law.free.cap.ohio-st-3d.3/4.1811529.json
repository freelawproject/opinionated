Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>57. <em>Wynwood Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 34, 35 [13 O.O.3d 19]. Appellant contends that the BTA erred in determining the true value of the subject property. The true or fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the BTA with respect to such valuation .unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful. <em>Consolidated Aluminum Corp. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 410, 414 [20 O.O.3d 357]; <em>Bd. of Revision </em>v. <em>Fodor </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 52 [44 O.O.2d 30].</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The best evidence of the \u201ctrue value in money\u201d of real property is an actual, recent sale of the property in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. <em>Conalco </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 129 [4 O.O.3d 309], paragraph one of the syllabus. Absent such information, Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-03 sets forth three methods by which true value of real property may be calculated. These three recognized approaches are: (1) the market data approach, in which recent sales of comparable properties are weighed; (2) the income approach, in which net income from the property is capitalized; and (3) the cost approach, which adds the depreciated cost of the improvements to the land to the value of the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Appellant and the BTA had two appraisals of the subject property as of January 1, 1979 available for consideration. William J. Lemmon prepared a report for the board of revision, and developed the following values: market data approach \u2014 not available; income approach \u2014 $4,927,000; cost approach \u2014 $5,392,100. Richard Van Curen prepared a report at the request of appellee, which resulted in the following figures: market data approach \u2014 not available; income approach \u2014 $2,850,000; cost approach \u2014 $3,911,500. Both Lemmon and Van Curen concluded that the best indicator of true value was that derived from the income approach, Lemmon giving an estimated value of $4,927,000, and Van Curen making a final value estimate of $2,850,000. Moreover, both boards apparently accepted the conclusion that the income approach was most appropriate, although appellant adopted Lemmon\u2019s figures, while the BTA followed Van Curen\u2019s estimate!</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Appellant first contends that the BTA abused its discretion by using the income approach instead of the cost approach to valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">However, Lemmon indicated that the cost approach was not appropriate, \u201cdue to the type of property being appraised.\u201d Similarly, Van Curen rejected the reliability of the cost approach because that value \u201cis before any allowance for economic obsolescence. The plain fact of the matter is that the open market rents obtainable in this area would not be high enough to make the construction of this building feasible and it could \u2014 and would \u2014 not have been built if there had not been the very substantial Government subsidy.\u201d Both appraisers recognized that the cost of construction did not indicate the true value of the property, since Canton Towers exists only due to the FHA\u2019s willingness to underwrite its cost and continued maintenance, in the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of providing centrally located low income housing for senior citizens. Without a federal loan guarantee, favorable mortgage terms, rent subsidy, and income tax advantages, the cost of construction for such housing would be prohibitively expensive. Considering the nature of this project, we do not find the BTA\u2019s rejection of the cost approach to be unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Appellant also contends that the BTA abused its discretion when it adopted the income approach valuation recommended by Van Curen. As provided in the Ohio Administrative Code, with this appraisal technique, \u201c[t]he value is estimated by capitalizing the net income after expenses, including normal vacancies and credit losses. While the contract rental or lease of a given property is to be considered the current economic rent should be given weight. * * * Interest and capitalization rates should be determined from market data allowing for current returns on mortgages and equities.\u201d Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-03(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Van Curen\u2019s valuation of $2,850,000 was based on his estimate of fair rental value (economic rent) and current mortgage rates, rather than the \u201ccontrolled contract rent\u201d established by the FHA, and the longer term and lower mortgage rate obtained for the project. Lemmon used the actual fixed rent and mortgage for the property to arrive at his higher valuation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Appellant contends that only actual rents received and the forty year lower mortgage rate should have been used to calculate the income and capitalization rate. However, the Ohio Administrative Code specifically authorizes consideration of \u201ceconomic rent\u201d and \u201ccurrent returns on mortgages and equities\u201d with the income approach to valuation. Moreover, this court has previously recognized that the BTA may consider economic rental value of commercial real property as an <em>indicium of </em>valuation for <em>ad valorem </em>real property taxation purposes. <em>Wynwood Apartments, Inc., supra, </em>syllabus. Although <em>Wynwood </em>involved a commercial property which had been rented for less-than-market rate, the principle applies with equal force to a residential unit in which artificially inflated rents are set. As in <em>Wynwood, </em>\u201ceconomic rent is a proper consideration in a situation in which contract rent is not truly reflective of true value in money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Since it appears the figures used by Van Curen and accepted by the BTA were accurate approximations of current market rents and conventional financing rates, we find that the willingness of the BTA to base its decision upon the appraisal offered by appellee was not unreasonable or unlawful. The decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>W.

Nevertheless, R.C. 5717.04 permits reversal of a BTA decision when it is \u2018unreasonable or unlawful.\u2019 On direct appeal, this court has consistently reviewed the record before the BTA in order to determine whether there is evidence supporting the BTA\u2019s decision. See, <em>e.g., Cardinal Federal S. &amp; L. Assn., supra; Citizens Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 53, 58 [54 O.O.2d 191]; <em>Ace Steel Baling </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 137, 139 [48 O.O.2d 169]; <em>Bd. of Revision </em>v. <em>One Euclid Co. </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 43, 46 [45 O.O.2d 325]; <em>L.

Accordingly, the evidence before the BTA deserves a closer examination.\u201d <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 398, 406 [20 O.O.3d 349] (Locher, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">My review of the facts in this case leads me to a conclusion opposite to that of the majority. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Both appraisers, Lemmon and Van Curen, agreed that this building was unique and would not have been built without a government subsidy. They also agreed that the \u201cincome approach\u201d was the best method of appraisal. (See Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-03[D] for this kind of investment property.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The majority notes that both appraisers deemed the market data approach, which <em>compares </em>the appraised property with recent sales, to be unavailable. Nevertheless, Van Curen used market information and comparisons in order to make his income approach appraisal. In particular, he used market data to arrive at values for rental income and mortgage terms \u2014 including percent borrowed, duration and interest rate. The lower rental income decreased the cash flow; the higher interest rate decreased the present value of future income. The net effect of this was to decrease Van Curen\u2019s valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Unfortunately, Van Curen\u2019s result does not meet the constitutional \u201ctrue value in money\u201d standard, Section 2, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution, and its administrative definition. Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-01 provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">\u201cAs used in rules 5705-3-01 to 5705-3-13 of the Administrative Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">\u201c(A) \u2018True value in money\u2019 or \u2018true value\u2019 means one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">\u201c(1) The fair market value or current market value of property and is the price at which property should change hands on the open market between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having a knowledge of <em>all the relevant facts;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u201c(2) The price at which property did change hands under the conditions described in section 5713.03 of the Revised Code, within a reasonable length of time either before or after the tax lien date, unless subsequent to the sale the property loses value due to some casualty or an improvement is added to the property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">At the heart of the \u201ctrue value in money\u201d standard is the consideration of what price an economically rational buyer would pay in the market place. \u201cThe best evidence of \u2018true value in money\u2019 of real property is an actual, recent sale of the property in an arm\u2019s-length transaction. <em>(State, ex rel. Park Investment Co., </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals, </em>175 Ohio St. 410 [25 O.O.2d 432], approved and followed.)\u201d <em>Conalco </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 129 [4 O.O.3d 309], paragraph one of the syllabus. In the absence of the best evidence, however, an appraisal is an effective means of estimating true value. See Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The BTA erred, therefore, by adopting Van Curen\u2019s appraised value. He admitted, for example, that Canton Towers would not have been built if its income were limited to market or \u201ceconomic\u201d rents. It is self-contradictory, then, to compare this facility with non-subsidized apartments whose rents do not include all utilities and which are both larger and in better locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Wynwood Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 34 [13 O.O.3d 19], therefore, is misplaced. It is worth noting that in <em>Wynwood </em>and the cases on which this court based that decision, using the contract rent would have led to a <em>lower </em>valuation. See 59 Ohio St. 2d, at 36-38, footnote. Furthermore, this court described economic rent as \u201cthe rental warranted to be paid in the open real estate market based upon current rentals being paid for <em>comparable space.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 59 Ohio St. 2d, at 35. As mentioned above, this building is unique in its area. There is no \u201ccomparable space.\u201d It is, therefore, impossible to calculate economic rent. Rather, the contract rent, which is practically guaranteed, and the actual mortgage terms, which specify interest less than the market because the risk is less, are the better means for estimating true value in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The decision of the BTA is, therefore, both unreasonable and unlawful. It is unreasonable because the board accepted a valuation based on an appraisal derived from comparisons in spite of the fact that the building is unique. The decision is unlawful because Van Curen\u2019s appraisal failed to consider all <em>relevant </em>facts as required by the Ohio Administrative Code and the Constitution in order to determine the true value in money. In this case, the relevant facts are the actual values.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b35-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
