Carson, Jr., appellee, an attorney at law, has a mandatory duty to provide appellant all legal material in his possession which relates to a criminal case in which Carson acted as counsel for appellant. This mandatory duty, appellant alleged, arises from an attorney\u2019s responsibility as an officer of the court and from the Code of Professional Responsibility (DR 2-110[A][2]) which states a lawyer is to give to the client \u201c* * * all papers and property to which the client is entitled * * *\u201d when the lawyer-client relationship has terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">The court of appeals, in sustaining Carson\u2019s motion to dismiss stated the well-established principle that a writ of mandamus will not be issued unless the relator shows a clear legal right to the requested relief. It found that appellant referred to no authority giving him such a clear legal right. With specific reference to Carson\u2019s professional responsibilities it was found appellant had failed to demonstrate he was clearly entitled to such documents as is required under DR 2-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">We agree with the conclusion of the court of appeals that appellant has not shown a clear legal right to the relief sought. See <em>State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 41 [8 O.O.3d 36].</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-16\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b48-17\">W. Brown, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b48-18\">J. P.
