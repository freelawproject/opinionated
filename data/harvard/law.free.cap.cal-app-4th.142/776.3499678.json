J.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On March 19, 2003, a jury found, inter alia, Glen Maurice Johnson not guilty of the first degree murder of Lamar Rufus but guilty of second degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and accessory to murder. (\u00a7\u00a7 32, 182, subd. (a)(1), 187, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 23, 2004, we rejected his insufficiency of the evidence argument but reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial since the court impermissibly lowered the prosecution\u2019s constitutional burden of proof by misinstructing the jury on reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 976 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 780].)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">On April 1, 2005, a jury again found Johnson, inter alia, guilty of second degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and accessory to murder. Before his probation and sentencing hearing, his attorney learned, while attending portions of the trial of Arthur Lenix, who likewise was being prosecuted for Lamar\u2019s homicide, that Lenix\u2019s attorney had police reports that he had never seen and that the prosecutor had never disclosed to him, with information about the involvement of the prosecution\u2019s sole eyewitness to the killing, Lamar\u2019s cousin Curtis Rufus, in a shooting outside a convenience store before Johnson\u2019s second trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of the information in those reports, Johnson sought a new trial, but the prosecutor opposed, and the court denied, the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On appeal, Johnson argues, as before, insufficiency of the evidence and raises, inter alia, two new issues. He argues that there is a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different had the prosecutor not withheld those police reports from him. On the ground that the jury\u2019s not guilty verdict of first degree murder at his first trial rejected the mental state of premeditation and deliberation common to first degree murder and conspiracy to murder, he argues that the double jeopardy clause precludes a retrial of the conspiracy to murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Although we will reject Johnson\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence and double jeopardy arguments, we will determine that the prosecutor\u2019s withholding of discovery violated due process and will reverse the judgment and order a new trial on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Having grown up together, worked together, and hung out together, Curtis and Lamar were extremely close to each other \u2014 more like brothers than cousins. On the evening of September 19, 2002, they partied together at the Rockin\u2019 Rodeo nightclub for several hours until closing time. After Curtis gave Lamar a ride to the spot where he had parked his car, they both drove their cars to a convenience store and parked beside each other in an alley behind the store. Curtis went inside the store to get a bottle of water but, noticing \u201csome commotion outside, people were scrambling, and moving fast,\u201d he left the store to look for Lamar and found him waiting outside. Some people were just walking, others were walking fast, and some were running to their vehicles. Everyone seemed to be leaving in a hurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Curtis and Lamar \u201cstood there for a second to kind of let traffic vacate a little bit,\u201d headed down the alley toward their cars, and encountered Johnson and Lenix coming out of a perpendicular alley along the way. Curtis thought Johnson seemed \u201czombied out,\u201d possibly from alcohol, so he patted him on the chest in a friendly way as he and Lamar passed them by and said, \u201c[H]ey, man, wake up.\u201d Moments later, Curtis heard the \u201crather odd sound\u201d of an object hitting the ground. Lamar said, \u201cCurt, this guy dropped a .38.\u201d Curtis saw Lenix pick up and stuff into his waistband an object from the ground. Curtis said, \u201c[H]ey, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s get outta here right now, let\u2019s leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Curtis and Lamar got into their cars, started them up, and turned on the headlights, but before they put their cars into gear Deshonta Grayson walked over and opened the door of Lamar\u2019s car. Curtis got part way out of his car, with his right foot on the floorboard, his left foot on the ground, and his right forearm on the roof, and asked Grayson, \u201c[W]hat are you doin\u2019?\u201d Grayson turned toward where Johnson and Lenix had walked down the alley and said, \u201c[L]et\u2019s get outta here, these East Side Niggers are up here trippin\u2019.\u201d Curtis had seen Country Boy Crips there, but no East Siders (a term for East Side Crips), so he thought Grayson\u2019s comment was odd. He testified, \u201cI\u2019m not gang related, never been gang related, and it just kind of struck me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Curtis told Lamar, \u201c[N]ever mind what this guy\u2019s talkin\u2019 about, let\u2019s go now.\u201d Curtis got back into his car and started driving down the alley to clear a way for Lamar since they \u201cwere trying to leave in a hurry.\u201d He looked into his rear view mirror, saw that Lamar\u2019s car had not moved, and backed up at an angle to make \u201clike a reverse three point turn\u201d so he could go back. Looking over his shoulder while turning, he saw Lamar standing on one side of the car, Grayson standing on the other side of the car, and Lenix walking up behind Lamar.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Still looking over his shoulder, Curtis saw Lenix raise a gun and fire two or three shots at Lamar\u2019s head, saw Lamar fall to the ground, and saw a car enter from the perpendicular alley. Grayson and Lenix stood over Lamar \u201cfor like a split second.\u201d Lenix started to walk away, but Grayson, after taking one or two steps toward the car that entered from the perpendicular alley, started to run toward Curtis. Curtis accelerated toward Grayson and Lenix, hoping to run them over. Lenix fired three or four shots in his direction, but Grayson had cut in front of his car, and a bullet struck him. When the car that entered from the perpendicular alley stopped and Lenix opened the door to get inside, Curtis saw a person driving whom he could not identify by name but whom he had known around town for years and whom he later identified from a high school yearbook photograph as Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">At trial, Curtis narrated a security camera tape showing him and Lamar walking toward their cars, Johnson and Lenix walking out of the perpendicular alley, Lenix bending over to retrieve an object he put into his waistband, and Grayson walking down the alley. The homicide occurred outside camera range. In fear of his life, Curtis initially refused to identify any of the members of the Country Boy Crips he saw that night, but after the court instructed him to answer he identified one, after which he testified he was \u201cnot sure of the rest of their names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Martin Heredia, a police gang expert, identified Johnson and Lenix as members of the Country Boy Crips. He testified that Johnson\u2019s \u201cCBC\u201d (Country Boy Crips) and \u201cNC\u201d (\u201cneighborhood country\u201d or \u201cnotorious country\u201d) tattoos confirmed he was a Country Boy Crips member. A field interview card established his connection with a motel that served predominantly as a hangout for the Country Boy Crips. Police reports showed Johnson wrote a letter to a known Country Boy Crips shooting suspect and admitted to officers his membership in the Country Boy Crips. Another sign of his gang membership was his identifying himself at several of his bookings in the county jail as a Country Boy Crips member.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">With reference to Johnson and Lenix alike, Heredia opined that each had earned the status of \u201cshot caller\u201d or \u201coriginal gangster\u201d (OG) by achieving the deference and respect of other gang members through age, performance of gang activities, and long-term Country Boy Crips membership. Asked the hypothetical question if there was a reasonable possibility that an OG planning to commit a murder by walking up and shooting someone in the head and escaping with the assistance of another OG would not discuss those plans ahead of time with the other OG, Heredia replied in the negative. He identified Lamar as a West Side Crips member on the basis of information from a field interview card and a county jail booking. He interviewed Grayson in the emergency room on the night of the homicide, but Grayson told him nothing about the shooter\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the </em>Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">2. <em>Withheld Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Johnson argues that there is a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different had the prosecutor not withheld from him police reports that he had never seen and that the prosecutor had never disclosed to him with information about Curtis\u2019s involvement in a shooting outside a convenience store before Johnson\u2019s second trial. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194] <em>(Brady), </em>the United States Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is <em>material </em>either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 87, italics added.) In later cases, the high court broadened the scope of the holding in <em>Brady </em>by finding a duty to disclose even in the absence of a request by the accused <em>(United States v. Agurs </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 97, 107 [49 L.Ed.2d 342, 96 S.Ct. 2392]), by finding a duty to disclose not only as to exculpatory evidence but also as to impeachment evidence <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bagley </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 667, 676 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 105 S.Ct. 3375] <em>(Bagley)), </em>and by finding evidence <em>material </em>\u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 682; see also <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 419, 433-434 [131 L.Ed.2d 490, 115 S.Ct. 1555]).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Only a few years ago, citing <em>Brady </em>and its progeny with approval for articulating \u201cthe special role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials,\u201d the high court encapsulated in one sentence the three components of a <em>Brady </em>violation: \u201cThe evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d <em>(Strickler v. Greene </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 263, 281-282 [144 L.Ed.2d 286, 119 S.Ct. 1936] <em>(Strickler).) </em>Here, where the sole component at issue is prejudice, Johnson can meet his burden of establishing a <em>Brady </em>violation only if he shows that the withheld discovery was <em>material </em>in the sense \u201cthat \u2018there is a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>probability\u2019 that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed documents had been disclosed to the defense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 289; see also <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">First, we turn to the record of Johnson\u2019s trial. As to whether Curtis had any gang affiliation, the evidence shows a synergy of the absence of any evidence of any criminal street gang affiliation and the presence of his self-serving testimony that Tm not gang related, never been gang related.\u201d In argument to the jury, the prosecutor took full advantage of that state of the record: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a situation where Curtis would have any reason to come in here and say what he\u2019s told you, unless it were true. [\u00b6] On the other hand he does have every reason, every reason in the world, to come in here and tell you the truth.\u201d He reiterated his point: \u201cCurtis has no reason to want to see the defendant locked up, other than the fact that Curtis knows that he killed Lamar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In argument to the jury, Johnson\u2019s attorney acknowledged the obvious \u2014 the \u201cwhole case keys on Curtis Rufus\u201d \u2014 and emphasized that no evidence corroborated his chronology of the homicide. He implored the jury to find that the images captured by the store\u2019s security tape of traffic speeding through the alley right after the shooting were inconsistent with Curtis\u2019s testimony. He pointed out the lack of any evidence at all that Curtis left tire marks, hit anything, or suffered so much as a scratch to his car. \u201cHe\u2019s making it up,\u201d he argued. \u201cHe made up the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor characterized as nonsensical the notion that Curtis drove by, saw Lamar lying there, and quickly concocted an \u201celaborate\u201d scheme \u201cto frame two people that he doesn\u2019t even really have a clear grudge against.\u201d In summation, he stressed Curtis\u2019s impartiality and precision as an eyewitness: \u201cThe fact of the matter is, ladies and gentlemen, you have a case with frankly a very articulate witness, who has no pre-existing biases or reasons to want to come in here and make up stories against this defendant, if they weren\u2019t true. [\u00b6] The fact of the matter is, I want you to reach for justice, and I would ask you, in doing that, not to let this man get away with murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Second, we turn to the withheld discovery, which comprises 45 pages of police reports about a police investigation into a shooting outside a convenience store after Johnson\u2019s first trial but before his second trial. Those reports paint quite a different picture of Curtis from the one in the record of Johnson\u2019s second trial. Images captured by the store\u2019s security tapes show Curtis taking a chrome semiautomatic pistol from beneath his shirt and pulling back on the slide to chamber a round. The next images show a \u201cheavy set black male\u201d in a white T-shirt, whom officers identified as Deon Davis, a member of the Westside Crips criminal street gang, working his way toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Curtis, with whom he exchanged words and from whom he took the pistol. The next images show Davis walking toward the front of the store with the pistol \u201cfully extended\u201d in his right hand toward the doors. The next images show Davis leaving the store, walking toward a parked silver vehicle, getting into the driver\u2019s door of the car, backing the vehicle out of the parking stall, and driving out of the range of the security camera. Johnson\u2019s new trial motion noted that the security tapes show Curtis \u201cwas somehow involved in an exchange of gang gunfire, spoke with a known gang member, and then allowed that known gang member to take the handgun from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The police reports show that a woman outside the store moments before the shots were fired saw \u201cthree male subjects\u201d standing next to a newsstand not far from a silver vehicle parked nearby. She next saw a \u201cheavy set black male\u201d wearing a white T-shirt walk in front of the store from the direction of the newsstand, hunch down, and run back toward the front of the store. She told officers that she saw \u201cone to three black males\u201d standing next to the newsstand, that \u201cthe subject wearing a white T-shirt\u201d walked to the comer of the store while \u201cthe other two subjects possibly entered the store,\u201d and that during the shooting she saw the feet of someone \u201cfiring toward the heavy set black male wearing the white T-shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">With reference to his involvement in the incident, the police reports show that Curtis denied possessing a weapon and lied to officers about the events inside the store but changed his story after learning of the images captured on the security tapes. He told officers that after witnessing his cousin Lamar\u2019s homicide and receiving death threats he feared for his life so he carried the pistol into the store to defend himself against gang members to whom, according to reliable information from his associates, the homicide suspect had given active orders to murder him to keep him from testifying. He told officers that when he heard the gunshots he thought \u201che was being fired on by a criminal street gang member/s [sic] attempting to kill him\u201d so he took out his handgun and chambered a round.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">With reference to his weapon, Curtis told officers that a suspect who wore a white shirt, who said something to him he could not understand due to the noise of the gunfire, and who apparently was not armed took the pistol out of his hands and walked out the front door of the store. Officers recovered from outside the store five nine-millimeter pistol casings of the same brand as a 50-round box of nine-millimeter ammunition seized from Curtis\u2019s home. Nine rounds were missing from that box. Johnson\u2019s new trial motion noted that Curtis \u201cwas prepared to and did lie about the handgun to law enforcement officers, and only confirmed its possession when confronted with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>evidence of the video,\u201d and that he \u201capparently unlawfully carried a concealed firearm, supplied it to a gang member during a shootout, lied about same to a law enforcement officer, and indicated some acquaintance with the other fellows involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">With reference to his clothing, the police reports show that at the time of his interview with officers Curtis was wearing \u201ca blue work shirt with the name of Curtis on it, a blue baseball cap and grayish-blue sweat pants\u201d and that \u201cwhile he was inside the store during the incident\u201d he was wearing \u201ca dark blue denim, button up shirt\u201d and \u201cdark blue denim jeans.\u201d Johnson\u2019s new trial motion noted that when officers interviewed Curtis he \u201cwas wearing clothing that could reasonably be associated with gang membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Johnson\u2019s new trial motion noted that his attorney ran a search for Curtis in the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) before his second trial but \u201cthe existence of these reports did not show up.\u201d The motion noted that in a conversation with Johnson\u2019s attorney after the verdicts in his second trial the prosecutor candidly acknowledged that his failure to provide the police reports to the defense was \u201can oversight on his part.\u201d The motion argued that Curtis, the prosecution\u2019s \u201cchief witness,\u201d testified \u201che had no gang affiliations or connections\u201d and that \u201cthe prosecution relied upon expert testimony to establish gang connections of the two alleged perpetrators in order to support its theory of the case,\u201d all of which gave the jury a \u201cvital interest\u201d in knowing that Curtis \u201ccarried a gun in circumstances suggestive of gang activity, associated with gang member(s), [and] gave that gun to a known gang member.\u201d In opposition to the motion, the prosecutor stated he \u201cprovided a copy\u201d of the police reports to Lenix\u2019s counsel but not to Johnson\u2019s counsel since Johnson\u2019s \u201ccase was on appeal.\u201d After hearing argument, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On appeal, Johnson argues that Curtis \u201chad lots of reasons to lie. If his gang connections did not give him reason to lie, his fear of prosecution and hope for continued immunity from prosecution, and his consequent wish to be of use to the police and prosecutor[,] gave him motives to lie.\u201d He argues that the prosecutor \u201chad no evidence that corroborated Curtis\u2019s testimony,\u201d \u201cno physical evidence that tended to show [Johnson] drove the killer from the crime scene,\u201d \u201cno confession or admissions,\u201d and no \u201cwitness who lent support to Curtis\u2019s claim that he (Curtis) was in the alley not far from Lamar at the time Lamar was shot.\u201d The record bears out those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The Attorney General commendably acknowledges that since the police reports \u201ccontained some potential impeachment evidence regarding Curtis\u201d the prosecutor should have disclosed that evidence to Johnson. Nonetheless, he argues that the withheld discovery \u201cportrays Curtis as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>neutral bystander during a convenience store shooting.\u201d That is one possible inference from the police reports, but hardly the only one. The prosecutor\u2019s withholding of discovery denied Johnson the opportunity to impeach Curtis with his attire, conduct, and firearm possession during the convenience store shooting and with his lies to the police afterward. Likewise, the prosecutor\u2019s breach of duty denied Johnson the opportunity not only to cross-examine the gang expert about the gang implications of Curtis\u2019s involvement in the convenience store shooting but also to argue to the jury inferences contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cneutral bystander\u201d inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In short, the record of Johnson\u2019s trial and of the withheld discovery show that since the withheld discovery was <em>material </em>in the sense \u201cthat \u2018there is a reasonable probability\u2019 that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed documents had been disclosed to the defense\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s withholding of discovery violated due process. <em>(Strickler, supra, </em>527 U.S. at p. 289; see also <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 682.) That Johnson\u2019s case was on appeal when the prosecutor withheld discovery is no excuse for his \u201cconcealment of relevant and material evidence\u201d from the defense. <em>(In re Ferguson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 525, 531 [96 Cal.Rptr. 594, 487 P.2d 1234]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1179-1182 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 545].) Our duty is to reverse the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">3. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On the ground that the jury\u2019s not guilty verdict of first degree murder at his first trial rejected the mental state of premeditation and deliberation common to first degree murder and conspiracy to murder alike, Johnson argues that the double jeopardy clause precludes a retrial of the conspiracy to murder charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The parties agree on the underlying principle of California criminal law. The mental state of conspiracy to murder is \u201c \u2018functionally indistinguishable from the mental state of premeditating the target offense of murder,\u2019 \u201d so \u201call conspiracy to commit murder is necessarily conspiracy to commit premeditated and deliberated first degree murder.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1223, 1232, 1237 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 733, 960 P.2d 537] <em>(Cortez).) </em>The holding in <em>Cortez </em>repudiated the prior rule that conspiracy to murder could be conspiracy to commit first degree murder, conspiracy to commit second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>degree murder, or conspiracy to commit manslaughter. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1230-1238, overruling <em>People v. Horn </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 290 [115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The parties disagree, however, on the impact, if any, of <em>Cortez </em>on the double jeopardy issue. Johnson posits <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 436 [25 L.Ed.2d 469, 90 S.Ct. 1189] <em>(Swenson) </em>as \u201c[t]he case that governs here.\u201d In <em>Swenson, </em>a jury found the accused not guilty of the armed robbery of a player at a poker game, but after the prosecutor charged him with the armed robbery of another player at the same game a different jury found him guilty of that charge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 437-440.) \u201c[Wjhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit,\u201d the United States Supreme Court held, bringing the collateral estoppel doctrine within the protection of the double jeopardy clause for the first time. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 443, 445.) \u201cThe single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he had not,\u201d the high court wrote, condemning the accused\u2019s second prosecution as \u201cwholly impermissible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">A line of United States Supreme Court cases shows <em>Swenson </em>is inapposite. In <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1932) 284 U.S. 390 [76 L.Ed. 356, 52 S.Ct. 189] <em>(Dunn), </em>disapproved on another ground by <em>United States v. Powell </em>(1984) 469 U.S. 57, 64 [83 L.Ed.2d 461, 105 S.Ct. 471] <em>(Powell), </em>the court held that a person whom a jury finds guilty on one count cannot attack that conviction on the ground of inconsistency with the jury\u2019s not guilty verdict on another count. <em>(Dunn, supra, </em>at pp. 392-394.) \u201c \u2018The most that can be said in such cases is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. We interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 393.) \u201cThat the verdict may have been the result of compromise, or of a mistake on the part of the jury, is possible. But verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In <em>Powell, supra, </em>469 U.S. at pages 64-65, the high court lauded <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>\u201csound rationale\u201d and observed that inconsistent verdicts \u201cpresent a situation where \u2018error,\u2019 in the sense that the jury has not followed the court\u2019s instructions, most certainly has occurred, but it is unclear whose ox has been gored.\u201d As \u201cimprudent and unworkable,\u201d <em>Powell </em>rejected the notion of allowing \u201ccriminal defendants to challenge inconsistent verdicts on the ground that in their case the verdict was not the product of lenity, but of some error that worked against them. Such an individualized assessment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>reason for the inconsistency would be based either on pure speculation, or would require inquiries into the jury\u2019s deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 66.) The high court noted \u201cthat a criminal defendant already is afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Johnson notes that at the probation and sentencing hearing at his first trial the prosecutor commented that the guilty verdict of conspiracy to murder and the not guilty verdict of first degree murder might be \u201cat least understandable\u201d if the jury had \u201cfelt that [a] minute or less was insufficient to constitute premeditation and deliberation.\u201d He urges us to infer from the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the jury \u201ceither believed [he] did <em>not </em>premeditate the murder or deliberate on the murder, or it <em>doubted </em>whether he engaged in premeditation and deliberation. In other words, it acquitted [him] of premeditating and deliberating.\u201d We decline Johnson\u2019s invitation to indulge in the \u201cpure speculation\u201d that <em>Powell </em>decries. Instead, we abide by the general rule that \u201cinherently inconsistent verdicts are allowed to stand. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 656 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392].) \u201cNor does the existence of inconsistent verdicts imply that the jury must have been confused. [Citation.] An inconsistency may show no more than jury lenity, compromise, or mistake, none of which undermines the validity of a verdict. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.; </em>see \u00a7 954 [\u201cAn acquittal of one or more counts shall not be deemed an acquittal of any other count.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Additionally, a \u201csingle rationally conceivable issue\u201d was in dispute before the first jury in <em>Swenson, </em>but several disparate issues were in dispute before Johnson\u2019s first jury. <em>(Swenson, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 445.) Was he guilty of first degree murder? Or was he guilty of second degree murder? Which of the 13 overt act allegations was true? Was he guilty of conspiracy to murder? Was he guilty of accessory to murder? The collateral estoppel doctrine bars relitigation of an issue decided at a previous trial <em>only </em>\u201c \u2018if (1) the issue <em>necessarily decided </em>at the previous trial is <em>identical </em>to the one which is sought to be relitigated; if (2) the previous trial resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and if (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawley </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 163 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 38 P.3d 461], italics added.) The melange of issues implicit in the verdicts here likewise precludes application of the collateral estoppel doctrine. No double jeopardy bar exists to Johnson\u2019s again standing trial on the charge of conspiracy to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial is ordered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"Axm\">Dawson, J., and Hill, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-12\"> Initial references to the decedent, Lamar Rufus, and his cousin, Curtis Rufus, are by first and last names, but for brevity and clarity subsequent references are solely by first names.

It is rooted in the fundamental concept that the proper role of the judiciary does not extend to the resolution of abstract differences of legal opinion.\u201d <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 170 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306], citation omitted.) Whether any of Johnson\u2019s other issues will be ripe after his new trial is purely speculative. Nonetheless, we commend to the court and counsel alike a careful reading of <em>People </em>v. <em>Killebrew </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 644 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 876] since the gang expert who testified before is likely to testify again and since the prosecution, the defense, and the judiciary share a common interest in securing a fair trial that does not sow the seeds of a reversal on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
