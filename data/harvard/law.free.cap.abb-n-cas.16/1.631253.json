His complaint alleged that he had a judgment against the former for $970.60, on which execution had been returned unsatisfied; that the will gave a residue of real and personal estate to the defendants in trust to divide into several parts, and the income of one part pay to the defendant W. S. Wood, &amp;c., but without anticipation; that under the will the defendant was of age, and had been for some ye\u00e1rs entitled to and in receipt of about half the income of the fund, his half amounting to about $7.500 yearly; that he was unmarried, without dependents and lived in furnished lodgings ; and that his income under the will was sufficient to leave a large surplus after deducting a proper sum for his support and maintenance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">The principal defendant did not answer individually.

This court will review and reverse the decision of a referee if such decision is against the undisputed evidence, or if there is a finding of any material fact without any evidence to support it (Sickles <em>v. </em>Flanagan, 79 <em>N. Y. 224 </em>; Draper <em>v. </em>Stouvenel, 38 <em>Id. </em>219 ; Fellows <em>v. </em>Northrup, 39 <em>Id. </em>117; Mason <em>v. </em>Lord, 40 <em>Id. </em>476 ; Potter <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 71 <em>Id. </em>74; Beck <em>v. </em>Sheldon, 48 <em>Id. </em>365).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-8\">II. There was no evidence to support the referee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>finding, that the sum of $1,500 per year, or $125 per month, from January 27, 1883, was a proper sum for proper support and maintenance, and that all income accniing above that sum was surplus, or, to support his finding, that there had accrued as said surplus since January 27, 1883, down to December 4, 1883, the sum of $2,784.86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">III. The allegation in the complaint, that the rent, income and profits yearly accruing to W. Stannard Wood, under the will of his father, was sufficient to leave a large surplus, after deducting therefrom a proper sum for his support and maintenance, was necessary and material, and without it the complaint would have been bad on demurrer ; and that allegation having been made and having been put at issue by the answer, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove affirmatively that it was true, and to show that there was such surplus; but this he failed to do. A judgment creditor\u2019s action can only be maintained against a <em>cestui que trust </em>or his trustees, where there is a surplus beyond that necessary for the support of the person for whose benefit the trust is created. This fact must be pleaded, as that is the gravamen of the action. The absence of such allegation renders the pleading insufficient in law (Bramhall <em>v. </em>Ferris, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>46, 47; Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, 70 <em>Id. </em>274). The fact must not only be well pleaded, but must be established on the trial (Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, <em>supra). </em>The answer put at issue this allegation of the complaint, and there is no proof to sustain that allegation. It therefore followed that the complaint should have been dismissed upon the merits, and that the report of the referee finding that there was a surplus and also an accumulation of income, was not only unsupported by the evidence, but was in fact against the evidence to the contrary in the case (Bramhall <em>v. </em>Ferris, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>46, 47). In Bramhall <em>v. </em>Ferris, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>46, 47, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>court, by Comstock, J., said: \u201c I have no hesitation, therefore, in saying that the fund which the plaintiffs are endeavoring to reach is held in trust and comes within the exception of the statute before referred to. It is consequently exempt from the claims of the creditors of Myron H. Ferris, unless the provision is larger than necessary for the support of himself and family. . . . But in this case there is no averment in the complaint, nor was there any proof or suggestion on the trial, that the provision made for Ferris, the judgment debtor, was any larger than the objects of the trusts strictly required.\u201d In Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, 70 <em>N. Y. 274, </em>Judge Rapallo said, referring to the above case of Bramhall <em>v. </em>Ferris, that case was disposed of on the \u201c ground that there was no allegation or proof that the income was larger than necessary for the support of the debtor and his family.\u201d And Judge Rapallo further said: \u201cMy conclusion is, that as to the income of the real- estate, the surplus income, beyond what is necessary for the suitable support of the debtor and those depending upon him, in the manner in which they have been accustomed to live, is clearly applicable, under section 57, to the claims of his creditors. That as to the surplus income of the personal property it is likewise so applicable.\u201d In determining what sum is necessary for the support of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>it is proper to take into consideration the station in life, and the manner in which he has been reared and educated, his habits, and the means he may have beyond the trust fund to aid in his support, and he is entitled to be supported in his accustomed manner of'living, and is not bound, so far as his creditors are concerned, to contribute to such support by his labor or otherwise (Moulton v. Carty, 6 <em>Rob. </em>533).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">IV. The principal of the estate created by the will and the beneficial interest of the defendant W. S. Wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in the income, to the extent of a fair and reasonable support and maintenance to him in the manner in which he has been accustomed to live, is exempt from the claims of the plaintiff in this action; and at most the plaintiff could only reach such surplus of the income, if any, as remain over and above such support and maintenance. And all the plaintiff asks in the body and also in the prayer of his complaint is to reach such surplus of income (Williams v. Thorn, <em>supra). </em>The right of a court to fix the amount necessary for the support of a party must depend upon the evidence adduced, and the burden was upon the plaintiff to affirmatively establish that a surplus of income in fact existed over and above the amount necessary for simh party\u2019s maintenance. This has not been done. It is erroneous for a court or referee to find, in the absence of direct evidence, that $1,500 is sufficient when it is shown by competent evidence that $5,000 only was adequate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">Suppose the judgment debtor was in fact extravagant or improvident, is that evidence to show conclusively that $1,500 is sufficient, when it was shown that if $20,000 were allowed him he could use all of that sum? We submit not. The very fact that the judgment debtor was inclined to _ extravagance induced his father to place for him a fund in trust in order that he might continue to live in the manner to which he was accustomed to live in his father\u2019s life-time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">The father creating the trust had a right to say what should be done with his money, and it. is not open to the creditor of the son to say that the father\u2019s money shall be applied in violation of the father\u2019s wishes expressed in his will within the limits of the statute. If creditors give credit to persons who have no estate and no property, the fault is entirely their own. So held in Jackson <em>v. </em>Prime (12 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>113).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>V. The referee could not take judicial notice of what amount was necessary for support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-5\">VI. The exception to the exclusion of the question as to what amount was necessary was well taken ; and the question which gave rise to that exception was a proper one, and the witness was competent to testify on the subject, and his answer would have been material to the most important issue in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\">VII. There is no proof of a surplus of income.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-7\"><em>Edgar A. Turrell, </em>for plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKh\">I. The finding of facts is conclusive in this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">II. The action is properly brought (Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, 70 <em>N. Y. 270 </em>; Same <em>v. </em>Same, 81 <em>Id. </em>381; <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1871-9). 1. Section 1879 of the Code has made no change in the law applicable to this case. The object of that section was to leave the law as it was before, by excepting trust funds only from the operation of the creditor\u2019s bill provided for in the previous sections, but still subjecting the surplus income to the claims of creditors, as provided for in the Revised Statutes (1 <em>R. 8. </em>730, \u00a7 57; 3 <em>R. 8. </em>[7th ed.] p. 2182, \u00a7 57; McEvoy <em>v. </em>Appleby, 27 <em>Hun, </em>44; decided April, 1882). 2. Plaintiff can maintain the action alone. <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1871 ; Edmeston <em>v. </em>Lyde, 1 <em>Paige, </em>637-640; Wakeman v. Grover, 4 <em>Id. </em>23; Freedman\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust Co. v. Earle, 110 <em>U. S. </em>716). 3. Plaintiff acquired a lien upon all surplus accruing after January 27,1883, when service of the summons and complaint on the defendant debtor and surviving trustees was completed over and above what the court found to be a proper sum for the support and maintenance of the defendant debtor (Thorn <em>v. </em>Williams, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-9\">III. The only incumbrance that can be placed upon the debtor\u2019s income, after deducting a proper sum for his support and maintenance, is by a creditor\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>like the pending one. There is no allegation in the answer or evidence o\u00ed any other such action now pending. 1. The will provides that the income should not be anticipated; and this means that the debtor cannot sell, assign, pledge or in any way incumber it. It was also inalienable as a matter o\u00ed law (1 <em>R. S. </em>730, \u00a7\u00a7 57, 63 ; p. 773, \u00a7 2; 3 <em>R. S. </em>[7 ed.] p. 2182, \u00a7\u00a7 57, 63 ; p. 2257, \u00a7 2 ; Hone v. Van Schaick, 7 Paige, 221; Clute v. Bool, 8 <em>Id. </em>83 ; Scott v. Nevius, 6 Duer, 672; Jackson v. Bertine, 3 <em>N. Y. Monthly L. Bul. </em>27; Williams v. Thorn, <em>supra). </em>This prohibition of the will and the law against anticipation deprived the defendant debtor of the power of disposing of the income before it became due and payable (L\u2019Amoureux v. Van Rensselaer, 1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>34 ; Gott v. Cook, 7 Paige, 521). If he had that power, the creditor by action could take the whole of it (Hallett v. Thompson, 5 Paige, 583 ; Graff v. Bonnett, 31 <em>N. Y </em>12; Degraw v. Classon, 11 Paige, 137; Hawley v. James, 16 <em>Wend. </em>260). The payments to Center were made upon the voluntary order of the defendant debtor, given at the time of payment, and after the income had accrued. These payments did not go towards his support and maintenance, but for interest upon an indebtedness. The understanding between the defendant debtor and trustees for the payment of the interest and insurance premiums was void as an agreement for future payments, so as to create a lien upon any subsequent income. It was an anticipation which the will forbade. The most that the defendant debtor could do was to apply the income to such payments after it had accrued (Gott v. Cook, <em>supra). </em>The loan itself was contrary to the provisions of the will, as It was. only another mode of allowing the beneficiary to anticipate the income of $27,000 of the estate- by having the use of that sum while it was or should have been earning income for the estate (Havens v. Healy, 15 <em>Barb. </em>301).. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The defendant debtor made default in this action ; and it then proceeded as a contest with the trustees as opposing creditors, seeking to protect themselves and the other creditor Center. As between the defendant debtor and the trustees acting in violation of the will, and a creditor acting under the will and the law, the latter will be favored, and illegal agreements to his prejudice will be disregarded. The foundation of the debt is immaterial, all debts standing upon the same footing (Sillick <em>v. </em>Mason, <em>2 Barb. Ch. </em>83). 3. The plaintiff acquired a lien by this action upon all the surplus above defendant debtor\u2019s necessary and proper support, which might accrue after January 37, 1883 (Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, <em>supra). </em>The defendant debtor had no power to dispose of this surplus before it accrued (Gott v. Cook, <em>supra). </em>And the defendant debtor and trustees could not dispose of it after it had accrued (Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, <em>supra; </em>Edmeston v. Lyde, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">IV. Opinion evidence of what is a proper sum for support is not admissible. It is the province of the court itself to determine, from the best evidence and from the facts of the case, what is a proper sum to allow for the defendant debtor\u2019s support. 1. The opinions of witnesses based upon the facts would not be those of experts, but only the mere judgments of ordinary people upon the every-day facts and experiences of life. In such situations it is the duty of the jury, and, in equity cases, of the court, to form its own opinions and to draw its own conclusions (Ferguson <em>v. </em>Hubbell, 20 <em>W. Dig. </em>386, court of appeals, decided Dec. 16,1884). 3. The figures of the application of the defendant debtor\u2019s income for four years last past, and the fact that he has no one except himself to support, are the best evidence in the nature of the case, and should be controlling with the court (Bryan <em>v. </em>Knickerboecker, 1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>426). A further examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tion of similar cases likewise shows that the court itself should determine this amount from the facts of the case, and not from the opinions of witnesses (Genet <em>v. </em>Beekman, 45 <em>Barb. </em>382; Sillick <em>v. </em>Mason, <em>2 Barb. Ch. </em>79 ; Moulton <em>v. </em>De Ma Carty, 6 <em>Robt. </em>533 ; Paige <em>v. </em>Hazard, 5 <em>Hill, </em>603 ; Morehouse <em>v. </em>Mathews, <em>2 N. Y. </em>514 ; McGregor <em>v. </em>Brown, 10 <em>Id. </em>114, 119 ; Teall <em>v. </em>Barton, 40 <em>Barb. </em>137, 143).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b53-5\">Ruger, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiX\">No serious dispute arose on the argument over the main question of law involved in the controversy, and the following propositions may therefore be assumed as established for all the purposes of this discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">1st. When a trust has been created by one person for the benefit of another, which provides for the payment of the income of the trust fund to the beneficiary, a judgment creditor of the beneficiary is entitled to maintain an action in equity to reach and recover the surplus income beyond what is necessary for the suitable support and maintenance of the <em>cestui que trust </em>and those dependent upon him <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1871-9 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>270; Graff <em>v. </em>Bonnett, 31 <em>N. Y. 9 ; </em>Craig <em>v. </em>Hone, 2 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>570).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">2d. This rule applies as well when the income is derivable from a trust of personal property as that from real estate (Hallett <em>v. </em>Thompson, 5 Paige, 583 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, <em>supra; </em>\u00a7 57, art. 2, title 2, chap. 1, part 2, <em>R. S. </em>2182).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">3d. The disposition of such an income cannot be anticipated by the <em>cestui que trust </em>or incumbered by any contract entered into by him providing for its pledge, transfer or alienation previous to its accumulation (\u00a7 63, <em>R. S. </em>2182; Graff <em>v. </em>Bonnett, <em>supra; </em>Scott <em>v. </em>Nevius, 6 Duer, 672).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">4th. The creditor of such a beneficiary acquires a lien upon the accrued and unexpended surplus income or that subsequently arising from such fund, superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>to the claims of the general creditors or assignee of the <em>cestui que trust </em>by the commencement of an action in equity to reach and appropriate it to the satisfaction of his judgment (Williams <em>v. </em>Thorn, <em>supra). </em>The trust fund in this case consisted of both real and personal property, and the will creating it expressly provided that the <em>cestui que trust </em>should have no power to anticipate the rents, income or profits thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The <em>cestui que </em>trust, although served with process in the action, suffered default so far as he was individually concerned, but is defending as one of the trustees of the fund from which the income in dispute is derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The following facts, among others, were found by the referee upon the trial, and, so far as they are supported by the evidence, must be regarded as conclusively established in the consideration of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">That Silas Wood died prior .to the year 1852, leaving a last will and testament whereby he devised certain real and personal property to his executors in trust to pay the rents, income and profits thereof to his son Wilmer S. for his use, but without any power of anticipation on his part; that the defendants are now the trustees of the said fund, the said Wilmer S. Wood having been duly appointed as such on the death of one of the original trustees on March 21, 1863 ; that said Wilmer S. Wood for a long time previous to the trial had been entitled to and in receipt of said income ; and that the complaint in this action was served on said Wilmer S. Wood on the 27th day of January, 1883 ; that the net income of said fund accruing to the said Wilmer S. Wood between the said January 27, and the date of said report, December 4, thereafter, was $4,159.86, and the amount paid personally to said beneficiary betwee\u00f1 said dates was $1,375 ; that during the same time the trustees paid by \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the direction of the <em>cestui que trust </em>$1,099.80 as interest upon the debt owing by him to one Robert Center, and the further sum of $708.82 for premiums upon life insurance policies held by said trustees upon the life of said Wilmer S. as security for an indebtedness of $27,000 owing by him to the trust fund, and they retained the further sum of $810 as interest upon said debt; that during the years 1880, 1881 and 1882, the average net income accruing to said Wilmer S. from the trust estate was $4,833.01, and the average yearly payments to him on account thereof were $1,286.33, the balance of such income having been expended by the trustees annually in the payment of interest upon the debts before mentioned, and premiums upon said life insurance policies ; that the said Wilmer S. Wood is forty-three years of age, an unmarried man, and has no children or other person dependent upon him for support, and is a person of education and refinement, and of good social position ; that he is a gentleman of leisure, inclined to extravagance and unaccustomed to earn his own living; that he has no other means or income except that derivable from the trust fund; that he is a member of the Union and other clubs in New York, and associates with gentlemen of wealth and leisure; that he keeps no horses cfr valet, and lodges in furnished rooms in Forty-fifth street, residing there for six months, and with his sister at New-burgh for the remainder of the year; that his father was a merchant in New York, and of good social position, and all his relatives are persons of education and refinement, and of more or less wealth ; that it was the intention of the trustees, in limiting the annual payments to said <em>cestui que trust </em>in the years 1880, 1881 and 1882, to confine his expenditures for support and maintenance to the sums advanced, and without supposing that they thereby derogated from the standing and position in society which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Wilmer S. had always sustained ; that in view of the facts above stated, the sum of $1,500 annually is a proper sum for the proper support and maintenance of the said <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the income over that sum is surplus. The recovery of a judgment by the plaint-; iff against the said Wilmer S. Wood on March 4, 1881, for $970.60 damages and costs, and the due issue and return of an execution thereon unsatisfied. The referee directed a judgment, among other provisions requiring the defendants to pay to plaintiff so much of the sum of $2,784.86 as might be necessary to satisfy his judgment; holding that such sum was unexpended surplus arising out of said income after the commencement of this action. This judgment was affirmed upon appeal to the general term, and from that affirmance the defendants have appealed to this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Ho question was raised on the argument by the appellant as to the correctness of any of the findings of fact or law except that relating to the sum adjudged annually as a proper amount for the support of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the conclusion therefrom that all above that sum was surplus applicable to the payment of the claims of creditors. With reference to this finding it is now urged that there was no evidence to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Ho question was raised on the trial as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence to sustain the action, and so far as appears from the record this question was made for the first time on the argument in this court. A request was, however, made to the referee to find that the whole of the income was necessary for the suitable support and maintenance of the <em>cestui que trust </em>in the manner in which he has been accustomed to live, and, assuming that the appellants could properly raise the question argued upon a refusal to find as requested, we are of the opinion that the finding of the referee is amply sustained by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The evidence showed that for the period of three years prior to the commencement of this action a sum considerably less than SI,500 per annum had been agreed upon between the beneficiary and the trustees, of whom he was one, as an adequate amount for his maintenance and support in the manner that his habits and position in society required.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The circumstances also tended to show that this arrangement was intended to be continued indefinitely, inasmuch as the fixed charges thereby settled upon the income could only be relieved by payment of the debts upon which they accrued, and that, under the circumstances, was impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The arrangement thus made amounted to a practical determination by the parties most interested in the question as to how much of the income they regarded as surplus, and furnishes strong, if not controlling, evidence as against those parties upon the question of fact in dispute (Bryan <em>v. </em>Knickerbocker, 1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>427).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Evidence was also given by the defendants as to the amount and costs of the various items going to make up the expenses of living in New York to a gentleman in the position of Mr. Wood, and the referee could, from such evidence, by rejecting such expenses as he deemed fanciful, unnecessary or extravagant, arrive at a reasonable and just conclusion as to the necessary cost of such living; and, indeed, we think that such evidence, aside from proof as to the actual cost of living to a party, is the best, if not the only competent, proof to be given on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In Sillick <em>v. </em>Mason (2 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>79) the chancellor determined the amount necessary to be expended for the support of a gentleman and his wife in New York upon his own judgment and contrary to the opinion of the vice chancellor and the witnesses who gave opinions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Upon the trial, the defendant excepted to the exclusion by the court of an answer to the following question put to a witness called by him : \u201c What, in your judgment, would be a proper sum for the proper support and maintenance of Mr. Wilmer S. Wood in the manner and life in which he has been in the habit of living, and associating with the friends whom he does associate with, so far as you know, in your judgment ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">This exception is now claimed to have been well taken by the appellant. The witness was shown to be a single gentleman, living in New York, and\" a member of the clubs and social circle to which Mr. Wood belonged, and acquainted with him and his associates and his general manner of living. If the question was properly framed and opinions upon such a subject were competent as evidence upon the issue, the witness was undoubtedly qualified to express one. There seems to us, however, to be several reasons why this exception is untenable. The evidence called for' by the question was not as to a fact, but related to a mere matter of opinion, and was also cumulative. In both of these cases, the extent to which such evidence should be allowed is held to be in the discretion of the trial court, and an appellate tribunal will not interfere with the exercise of such discretion unless there has been a clear abuse of it, shown by the exclusion of the evidence (Sizer <em>v. </em>Burt, 4 <em>Den. </em>426; Anthony <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>503).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">No witnesses on the subject had been examined by the plaintiff, and two witnesses had already been allowed to testify without objection as to the amount they considered necessary to support Mr. Wood in the manner in which he was entitled to live under all of the circumstances, and had stated that $5,000 annually would not be too large a sum for that purpose. Several witnesses had been allowed to state in detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the expenses which a gentleman living in New York in the manner that Mr. Wood did would probably incur, and mentioned among those expenses the payment of club dues and expenses, the cost of clothing and food, the expense of giving dinner, opera and theater parties in return for civilities extended to him by his associates, and traveling expenses for summer recreation and pleasure, and aggregated a sum amounting to $3,000 and upwards a year for what were termed by them necessary expenses. It will thus be seen that the evidence was quite sufficient to enable the referee and the court to determine the amount necessary to support and maintain the <em>cestui que trust </em>in a proper and suitable manner, without the aid of any opinions on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">But we think the question was objectionable in form as well as substance. The statute requires such an inquiry to be confined to the surplus of the income beyond the \u201csum that may be necessary for the education and support\u201d of the <em>cestui que trust </em>(\u00a7 57, 3d vol. 7th ed. <em>R. S. 2182).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Judge Woodruff, in Scott <em>v. </em>Nevins <em>(6 </em>Duer, 676), said the amount liable to be sequestrated for the payment of creditors was what remained after deducting a sufficient sum to suitably support and maintain \u201c the judgment debtor, taking into view his condition in life, his health, and the condition of his family, if any he has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In Sillick <em>v. </em>Mason (2 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>79) the chancellor said, \u201cthe interest of the <em>cestui que trust </em>in such a trust as this, beyond what may be necessary for the support of himself and family, may be reached by a creditor\u2019s bill and applied to the payment of his debts.\u201d The case showed that the beneficiary had lived in his father\u2019s family, uneducated to any business, and entertaining the idea that a fortune would be provided for him, and had a wife whom he supported. The chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>cellor said: \u201c Two thousand dollars would enable them to live respectably in New York according to their condition in life, even if the defendant should not think proper to do anything for his own support; and they should not upon a fair construction of the statute on this subject be permitted to indulge in extravagant expenditures while the defendant\u2019s creditors remained unpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The question in this case was objectionable in assuming that the manner of life in which Mr. Wood had been in the habit of living was one of the conditions upon which the amount necessary for his support was to be predicated. His manner of life had been shown by his cousin and co-trustee and defendant as recklessly extravagant and profuse, and the evidence of all of his witnesses shows that a large part of his annual expenses were incurred in repaying his supposed obligations for social courtesies and civilities extended to him by his associates and acquaintances. However pleasant and agreeable it may be for individuals to incur and repay such obligations, the law is concerned only with real obligations and necessary expenditures, and cannot properly estimate or determine the amount, which according to social requirements an individual should lavish or expend in voluntary entertainments in repayment of conventional obligations. Doubtless the court may take into account to a certain extent the differences existing in the education, habits and condition of individuals, with a view of ascertaining their respective necessities and wants, in order to determine the amount which may be necessary to supply them ; but even in that case I apprehend it cannot go beyond the sum needed to discharge real obligations and pay proper and reasonable expenses for necessary support. The evidence sought by the question objected to, furnished no information upon the issue tried by the court. Neither the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ner in which the party has been accustomed to live or the style in which his associates and acquaintances expect him to live, furnishes a just criterion for determining the amount necessary to furnish a suitable support for the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We think also, within the rules laid down in Ferguson <em>v. </em>Hubbell (97 N. <em>Y. </em>507), that the evidence was incompetent. It was there said by Judge Earle : It is not sufficient to warrant the introduction of expert evidence that the witness may know more of the subject of inquiry, and may better comprehend and appreciate it than the jury; but to warrant its introduction the subject of the inquiry must be one relating to some trade, profession, science or art in which persons instructed therein, by study or experience, may be supposed to have more skill and knowledge than jurors of average intelligence may be presumed generally to have.\u201d . . . \u201c Where the facts can be placed before a jury, and they are of such a nature that persons generally are just as competent to form, opinions in reference to them and draw inferences from them as witnesses, then there is no occasion to resort to expert or opinion evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">It seems to us that the question in issue here was one peculiarly proper for the determination of a court or jury, after hearing evidence as to the character, circumstances and condition of the party, and the price and value of articles required to furnish suitable food, clothing, shelter and other necessaries adapted to the condition in life of the person whose support is the subject of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Expert evidence on such a subject would be peculiarly unreliable, owing to the wide diversity of opinion existing among different individuals of various degrees of education, intelligence and refinement, and possessing discordant habits and views of life as to what might be regarded as a proper sum for the support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>an individual. The subject is one of which every individual has had more or less experience and knowledge, and is neither adapted to nor requires the opinion of persons in special classes of life to elucidate or explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">No person can by achieving a certain position in society secure to himself a protection from the claims of his creditors which is denied to others who are less favored in a social point of view. The opinions of experts are admitted \u201c upon the supposition that the question involves matters which lie beyond the scope of the observation, knowledge and experience of men in general, and that consequently the jury could not be presumed competent to arrive at a proper determination by the unaided exercise of their judgments\u201d (De Witt <em>v. </em>Barley, 8 N. <em>Y. </em>376).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Few subjects exist where knowledge and information concerning them are so universal and general as those pertaining to the cost and expense of living; and where all are so competent to form an opinion with respect to them, such questions must not only form the nature of the subject, but also, from the requirements of law, be left to the judgment and experience of the tribunal before whom they are tried (McGregor v. Brown, 10 N. <em>Y. </em>114; Genet <em>v. </em>Beekman, 45 <em>Barb. </em>382). Thus, opinions of witnesses as to the amount of damages sustained by a party have been held inadmissible (Morehouse <em>v. </em>Matthews, 2 N. <em>Y. </em>514; Norman <em>v. </em>Wells, 17 <em>Wend. </em>161; Simons <em>v. </em>Monier, 29 <em>Barb. </em>419).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Questions as to what are necessaries for an infant or married woman cannot be proved by the opinions of witnesses (Johnson <em>v. </em>Lines, 6 <em>Watts &amp; </em>S.80). In an action against a father for clothing furnished to his infant children, the opinion of witnesses as to its being necessary were held inadmissible (Poock <em>v. </em>Miller, 1 <em>Hilt. </em>108). So, too, opinions that a husband did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>furnish Ids wife and family a suitable home to live in were held inadmissible in an action by him against another for the seduction of his wife (Dallas <em>v. </em>Sellers, 17 <em>Ind. </em>479).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The case of Merritt <em>v. </em>Seaman (6 <em>N. Y. </em>168) seems to be decisive of the question presented by this exception. The claim was for an offset for necessaries furnished to a nephew of the plaintiff\u2019s testator under an agreement by him, when his nephew entered the defendant\u2019s service as a clerk, that they should allow him the customary compensation, and if anything more was needed for his support he would pay it himself. A list of articles furnished by the defendants to the nephew was presented to the witness, and he was asked whether those items were proper for a young man so situated. The evidence was admitted under objection, and for that reason the judgment was reversed on appeal. The head-note of this case (Johnson <em>v. </em>Lines, <em>supra) </em>states that \u201c what are necessaries is a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d and therefore the opinion of a witness as to what was a proper expenditure is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We are also of the opinion that the judgment of the court below should be sustained upon the ground that there was an accumulated surplus in the hands of the defendants at the time of the rendition of the j udgment which had accrued during the pendency of the action, and was applicable to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment and was sufficient to discharge the same. The expenditure of that sum by them for the purposes, and under the circumstances found by the referee, was a violation of the rights secured by the plaintiff by the commencement of this action, and was unauthorized by any power vested in them. This sum was inalienable by the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and actual experiment had demonstrated that it was not needed for his support during the period of its accumulation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The amount of this accumulation would seem to be more than sufficient to discharge the obligations of the plaintiff, and if this should prove to be so would render the provision in the decree for a further application of surplus income unnecessary.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b64-7\">Note on the Rights of a Creditor to reach a Trust for THE DEBTOR\u2019S BENEFIT.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"A_l\">I. <em>The right of the Creditor.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"Ax\">This subject is of an increasing importance, and either its difficulties or their explanation are not appreciated by recent writers on the law of Trusts and of Fraudulent Conveyances. The reader who seeks a clear understanding of the very complex principles regulating the right of a creditor to have his judgment satisfied out of a fund claimed to be held in trust for the benefit of his debtor, will be repaid by attention to the manner in which this subject has been contested in this country, and the <em>coarse </em>of legislation in which our complex statutes affecting it have come into existence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"A-5\">After it had been well settled in accordance with English law, that a creditor with judgment, and execution issued thereon, who found himself met by the existence of a fraudulent transfer of assets on which he might otherwise have freely levied, could file a bill in chancery, in aid of his execution, to have the fraudulent obstruction set aside, the question arose whether, if a creditor showed that the debtor had no leviable property, but that he had <em>property </em>of other kinds, such as rights in action, contracts, corporate stock, &amp;c., chancery ought to entertain a bill to compel him to apply such assets to the satisfaction of the judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"ACn\">The courts of New York, in 1822, after a notable contest, determined this question in favor of the creditor; and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>appears to be'in accordance with equity and the general welfare.

Spader is not included in the extensive collection of noted cases, published under the name of <em>American Decisions, </em>but the adverse case of Donovan <em>v. </em>Finn (1 <em>Hopk. </em>59), is (14 <em>Am. Dec. </em>531), with a note characterizing it as a leading case, and inclining to the view that the weight of American authority is against the doctrine of allowing creditors to reach non-leviable assets generally.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b65-10\">If we judge the weight of authority by the number of cases in the books, perhaps this estimate is correct. If we understand by the weight of authority the preponderance of present judicial opinion as now in actual operation, and to a considerable extent embodied in reported cases, I think it correct to say that the weight of authority is in favor of the doctrine (except, perhaps, in those jurisdictions where the free use of attachment as a provisional remedy has made the question one of very little importance). See Ager v. Murray, 105 U. <em>S. </em>(15 <em>Otto) </em>126; Lord v. Brete Hart, 118 <em>Mass. </em>271; Carver v. Peck, 131 <em>Id. </em>291; Matthews v. Green, 19 <em>Fed.

And if it was suggested in opposition that the real protection of income from creditors was afforded by the provisions first above noticed, defining the power of chancery as not extending to a trust created by some person other than the debtor, the answer was made that as the statute of trusts had abolished that protection so far as concerns surplus of income, as well as ignored it in respect to pecuniary legacies and annuities charged on land ; the court might, by analogy, ignore it in respect to surplus income of personalty held in trust, without any valid direction to accumulate. Some recent opinions incline rather to the idea that trusts in personal property are wholly free from these provisions ; but if this be sound, the logical conclusion would be that a creditor\u2019s action would not reach even surplus income, because it is only these provisions that make an exception to the restraint on creditor\u2019s actions, reaching trusts proceeding from a third person. Moreover, the mixed funds that are so common would make such a rule very difficult of administration.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b71-6\">The general understanding of the law I take to be that while the prohibition on unenumerated express trusts does not apply to personal property, the provisions intended to maintain the integrity of valid trusts are to be applied by the courts by analogy, so far as in their nature applicable, to trusts of personalty and trusts of mixed or of converted funds.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b71-7\">(See also Benkard <em>v. </em>Hutton, 92 N.

And also to direct that if it was not paid within a limited time, the complainants be at liberty to go before a master upon a reference, to inquire and report the amount of such income which had come to the hands of the trustee, or which might have been received by him with ordinary diligence; and which was applicable to the payment of such debts, interest and costs; with a direction,,th?.t; the trustee pay the,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>amount so reported, or so much as was necessary for the purpose, upon the coming in and confirmation of the master\u2019s report; and if the whole amount should not thus be paid, that the complainants be at liberty to apply, from time to time, for further directions, periodically, as future rents and income which were applicable to that purpose should be received by the trustee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-4\">In a proper case of misapplication, or a disregard of the lien acquired by plaintiff by commencing his action against the trustees, they may be adjudged personally liable, as in the case in the text.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-5\">But they should not be charged with costs personally merely because they have an interest in the income in remainder.1</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-6\">IV. <em>Mode of enforcing resulting trust.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-7\">The trust which results for creditors under 1 <em>R.

The statute creates a trust in favor of the creditor, which must be enforced in equity by him or his successor in interest.2</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-8\">The remedy is not by a judgment creditor\u2019s action under 2 Revised Statutes, 174 <em>(above cited), </em>but by equitable action to subject the lands to the payment of his debt, on establishing the relation of trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>under the statute of \u201c uses and trusts.\u201d3</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-9\">Such relief, however, may be granted under a complaint framed to reach the supposed interest of the debtor.4</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-10\">The statute itself does not effect the lien, but a lien must be got either by judgment or by commencement of a creditor\u2019s action, <em>&amp;o., </em>and if the judgment is discharged in bankruptcy before this is done, the creditor\u2019s remedy fails.5</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b84-12\">1 Bryan <em>v. </em>Knickerbacker, 1 <em>Barb.

It was alleged that the debtor was a non-resident and insolvent, and had no property in this State. <em>Held, </em>that conceding the creditor must, in such a case, have exhausted bis legal remedy, it was enough, in the absence of the person and property of the debtor here, to show that he had exhausted it in the jurisdiction of the debtor\u2019s residence and property, especially as the statute created a pure trust and did not make the right dependent on the rules applicable to creditors\u2019 bills.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b85-13\">In Jones <em>v. </em>Green, 1 <em>Wall. </em>330, plaintiS thought to reach real property the debtor had purchased and caused to be conveyed to one of the defendants upon a secret trust for the debtor, and it was <em>held </em>that execution was necessary; and its issue not having been proved, the bill must be dismissed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b85-14\">Estes v.

So that if there is such a custodian of the assets, he alone should sue, and can do so without any judgment having been recovered.
