Dill </em>and <em>Edward C. James (Dill &amp; Chandler, </em>attorneys), for the plaintiff and the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEr\">I. The original syndicate agreement constituted a simple tenancy or ownership in common between the parries, and not a partnership (Livingston <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 <em>Johns. Ch. 573, 593; </em>Irvine <em>v. </em>Forbes, 11 <em>Barb. </em>587; Cox <em>v. </em>Bodfish, 35 <em>Me. </em>302, 307). The majority cannot bind the minority, except by special agreement (Livingston <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 <em>Johns. Ch. 573; </em>Frothingham v. Barney, 6 <em>Hun, </em>366; Barr <em>v. </em>N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 96 <em>N. Y. </em>444 ; Mann <em>v. </em>Butler, 2 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>362 ; <em>High on </em>Inj. 1207). \u201cTo constitute a partnership there must be a reciprocal agreement of the parties, not only to unite their stock, but to share in the risks of profit and of loss by the disposition to be made of it. Where several parties agree to purchase personal prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>erty in the name of one of them, and to take aliquot shares o\u00a3 the purchase, without agreeing to re-sell jointly, there is no partnership\u201d (Baldwin <em>v. </em>Burrows, 47 <em>N. Y </em>199, 206 ; Holmes v. United Ins. Co., 2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>329, 331; Post <em>v. </em>Kimberly, 9 Johns. 470, 491). Section 10 of the agreement does not justify a pretense of doubt, or enable a majority to give a false construction to plain language as a pretext for altering the terms of the original agreement. The terms of the agreement cannot be altered except by the consent of all (Natusch v. Irving, <em>Gow on Partn. </em>App. 398; Const v. Harris, <em>Turn. &amp; R. </em>496, 524 ; Livingston <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>573 ; Abbott v. Johnson, 32 <em>N. H. </em>9). The relation, therefore, of the subscribers to each other under this original syndicate agreement is that of tenants in common. The relation of the committee to the subscribers is that of trustees to, <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>and to third persons, that of special agents for the subscribers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">II. The alteration of this agreement, giving the subscribers the right to share ratably in all benefits resulting from a sale of the bonds of the subscribers, supplies the missing factor necessary to constitute a partnership\u2014an agreement to sell jointly and share the proceeds of the sale (Baldwin v. Burrows, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>199, 206; Holmes <em>v. </em>United Ins. Co., 2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>329, 331; Post v. Kimberly, 9 <em>Johns. </em>470, 491). If the plaintiff signed this agreement or acquiesced in it, the whole syndicate would be converted into a partnership, and subjected to the liabilities of that relation. Acquiescence in such a case would be quite as fatal to plaintiff\u2019s prior rights as signing the new agreement (Kent v. Quicksilver Mining Co., 78 <em>N. Y. </em>159 ; Const <em>v. </em>Harris, <em>Turn. &amp; R. </em>496, 523.) The plaintiff cannot be forced into such a relation against his will. He is entitled, in equity, either to compel the others to a specific performance of the original articles (Natusch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>v. </em>Irving, <em>above ; </em>Livingston <em>v. </em>Harris, <em>above), </em>or he is entitled, in equity, to rescind the agreement and have the syndicate dissolved and its affairs wound up, precisely as in cases of the dissolution of partnerships or joint-stock associations ; and, as equitable aids to such relief, he is entitled to an accounting, injunction and receiver. No man who agrees to subscribe to an enterprise can be forced to go on under the alteration here attempted (Abbott <em>v. </em>Johnson, 32 <em>N. H. </em>9, 20 ; Blarchford <em>v. </em>Ross, 54 <em>Barb. </em>42 ; H. <em>&amp; </em>W. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Croswell, 5 <em>Hill, </em>383; Frothingham <em>v. </em>Barney, 6 <em>Hun, </em>366). Equity requires the utmost good faith as among associates in respect to the common property, and will not permit an undue advantage to be taken of or by a single member (Getty <em>v. </em>Devlin, 54 <em>N. Y. </em>403, 412 : 70 <em>Id. </em>504). A contract is rescindable for non-performance as well as for fraud (Freer <em>v. </em>Denton, 61 <em>N. Y. </em>492 ; Lawrence <em>v. </em>Van Deventer, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>676 ; See F. N. Bangs\u2019 Brief, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>foot of page 507). This modification of the original agreement by all the other members is a sufficient ground for a rescission in equity on the part of this plaintiff, and entitles him to maintain this action for such purpose, and to have an accounting of the moneys paid in, and a winding-up of the association, with an injunction against the committee, and a receiver <em>pendiente lite </em>(White v. Colfax, 33 <em>Super. Ct. </em>(J. <em>&amp; S.) </em>297 ; Shehan v. Mahar, 17 <em>Hun, </em>129, 130 ; Andrews <em>v. </em>Betts, 8 <em>Id. </em>322). The proceedings and practice in winding up a syndicate of subscribers, who are tenants in common, are so analogous to those upon the dissolution of a partnership, that an injunction and receiver follow the righ t to close the affairs of the syndicate, almost as a matter of course (White v. Colfax, <em>above; </em>McElvey <em>v. </em>Lewis, 76 <em>N. Y. </em>373 ; Mann v. Butler, 2 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>362).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">III. The misconduct on the part of the committee in advancing money to the construction company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>without requiring stock and bonds in return, entitles this plaintiff, as one of the <em>cestuis que </em>trustent, to have them removed at once, and the trust property put into the hands of a receiver <em>pendente lite (Perry on Trusts, </em>\u00a7 818; Hollenbeck <em>v. </em>Donnell, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>342, 346). The rule of decision is nob whether the plaintiff will ultimately establish a breach of trust, but whether he has made a <em>prima facie </em>case (Evans <em>v. </em>Coventry, 5 <em>De </em>Gex. <em>M. &amp; G. </em>911, 918 ; Turner <em>v. </em>Crichton, 53 <em>N. Y </em>641). W here there has been negligence or improper conduct on the part of a trustee, and the fund is in danger, the appointment of a receiver, upon the application of a <em>cestui que </em>trust, is a matter of right i Jenkins <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 1 <em>Paige, </em>243 ; Boyd <em>v. </em>Murray, 3 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>48 ; State of Illinois <em>v. </em>Delafield, 8 <em>Paige, </em>527 ; aff\u2019d in 2 <em>Hill, </em>159; Turner v. Crichton, 53 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">The complaint asks a judgment which, among other things, shall adjudge that the said syndicate agreement and the contract of sa d committee and of said American Construction Company, are incapable of performance by reason of the incapacity of said South Pennsylvania Railroad Company to carry out its said contract, and further shall adjudge this plaintiff .to be relieved of his obligations under the said syndicate agreement by reason of the violation and alteration thereof, by the said committee and the other parties thereto, and the other matters set forth in the said complaint, and which shall dissolve the said syndicate or association of subscribers and wind up its affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The motion is for an injunction and a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">To justify the granting of the motion, it must appear that defendants will, unless restrained, commit some act during the pendency of the action which will produce injury to the plaintiff, or now threatens to do some act. in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual. In a case where the plaintiff does not show that the defendants are about to do, during the pendency of the action, something which will injure the plaintiff, it is not necessary to determine whether or not there is any cause of action. In this case the plaintiff does not show that if he should hereafter obtain the judgment now asked, his interests, as he states them, will have been in the mean time changed or affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">He paid to the committee $320,000. His complaint asserts that he is not bound to pay any further sum upon a call by the committee. If his position be correct, he cannot be compelled to pay or risk any further amount of money. His only interest, then, relates to the money he has already paid. His affidavit shows that the most of it has been disbursed by the committee, and the committee have received bonds and stocks for that, while the plaintiff believes that a part remains not disbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The affidavit of membeis of the committee shows that all money paid in by the plaintiff to the committee upon calls, has been paid out by it to the construction company, and by that company to the railroad company, excepting what was paid to the existing shareholders and the existing creditors of the railroad company, and that the company have in its possession, certain shares and bonds, in which, under the syndicate agreement, the plaintiff has an interest. The proportion of these shares and bonds to which the plaintiff would be entitled on a view-favorable to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>is eleven one-hundred-and-fiftieths. If he had judgment now in his favor, he could have no more of this property than the part represented by such a proportion. It is suggested that he has a money demand against the committee for acts done by them. The claim cannot be injured by any act that the defend-an ts may do during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It is not charged that the defendants intend to convert or dispose of the property in which the plaintiff has an interest, as it has been described, excepting that it is argued from their conduct that it is their intention to make a call upon him, which it is the theory of the action cannot be competently made under the. syndicate agreement inasmuch as the plaintiff is not bound by that agreement, and, after making the call,,to attempt under the agreement to forfeit the plaintiff\u2019s interest, in the property the committee now has. The affidavits present a suspicion that the committee may have this object,rather than proof that they have. Present facts tend to show that they do not purpose to make a call under existing circumstances. Their object seems to be to substitute voluntary contributions paid under what they call requests.\u201d This, however, is not a subject of complaint in the present action\u2014for if it were, it would assume that the agreement was in force. So long as no new call is made, it cannot be shown that the defendants now intend to attempt a forfeiture of plaintiff\u2019s interest; and if it. be hereafter, the plaintiff can obtain the proper protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It is manifest that if the syndicate agreement be prosecuted in the future, it will not be by aid of plaintiff\u2019s money, but by the money of other people in which he has no legal interest. It is, however, suggested that the expenditure of the money upon the construction of the railroad may give rise to some equity, as to the road itself, in favor of the persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>whose money was expended, that will be detrimental to the stock and bonds in the hands of the committee, to a part of which the plaintiff is entitled, or to their' value. This supposed equity is not definitely described. If it exist, it cannot be superior to that based upon the investment of plaintiff\u2019s money in the construction of the railroad, and, upon the assumptions of the complaint, must be inferior to it. The only object in appointing a receiver would be to have the bonds and stock safe for the plaintiff, if he have a judgment that he is entitled to a part of them.
