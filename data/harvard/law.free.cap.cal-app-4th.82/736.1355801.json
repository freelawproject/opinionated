He contends he was entitled to a jury instruction regarding temporary possession for purposes of disposal. (CALJIC No. 12.06.) We disagree and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Defendant was a prisoner in state prison, housed at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, Corcoran. One day, the lieutenant received information there was going to be gang fighting in one of the yards. He went to the yard and requested that additional officers join him. While he waited for backup, he noticed defendant swaggering in a \u201cgangster\u201d fashion. He searched defendant and found a razor blade, which had been removed from its plastic casing (having been originally supplied as a disposable shaver) and fashioned into a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Defendant was charged and convicted of a violation of Penal Code section 4502. He was sentenced to eight years fully consecutive to the term he was currently serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether, under the circumstances presented here, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction informing the jury that temporary possession for disposal is not unlawful possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">At trial, counsel for defendant requested CALJIC No. 12.06,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an instruction which essentially states, as arguably applicable here, that possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>contraband is not unlawful if the possession is \u201csolely for the purpose of abandonment, disposal, or destruction.\u201d In support of the request, counsel made an offer of proof that defendant would testify that he came upon the object on the ground, was concerned for his own safety and the safety of others and therefore picked it up, put it into his pocket and was proceeding to the outdoor toilet to dispose of it. Counsel also stated that he was prepared to call another witness to testify that he saw defendant pick it up. The court refused to give the instruction, ruling that the instruction has no application in a state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The genesis of the instruction requested is in the case of <em>People v. Mijares </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 415 [99 Cal.Rptr. 139, 491 P.2d 1115]. In <em>Mijares, </em>evidence was presented to show that the defendant\u2019s only possession of the narcotic was for disposal. (At p. 419.) The Supreme Court held that the jury should have been instructed that temporary possession for the purpose of disposal does not constitute possession pursuant to then Health and Safety Code section 11500. <em>(Mijares, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 423.) Significantly, the court stated that to deny the instruction \u201ccould result in manifest injustice to admittedly innocent individuals.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Subsequently, two appellate court cases were published which dealt with \u201cinnocent\u201d possession in a different context, felons in possession of firearms. The first case, <em>People v. Pepper </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1038 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 877], held that Penal Code \u201csection 12021 prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a firearm even momentarily except in self-defense, in defense of others, or as a result of legal necessity.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cinnocent\u201d possession could not occur. One would readily know the nature and purpose of a firearm, and one could not legitimately possess a firearm momentarily to prevent its illegal possession by another. <em>(Pepper, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1037.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In <em>People v. Hurtado </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 805 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 853], the court, after discussing several <em>post-Mijares </em>narcotics possession cases, was \u201cconvinced the \u2018momentary possession\u2019 defense recognized in <em>Mijares </em>extends to possession of a firearm by a felon offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 814.) The court declined to adopt <em>Pepper's </em>\u201cstrict liability\u201d approach. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Our case, however, falls outside the circumstances or charging offenses of any of the published cases discussing temporary possession or CALJIC No. 12.06. Therefore, neither <em>Hurtado </em>nor <em>Pepper </em>is singularly persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In this case, defendant was charged with Penal Code section 4502. The fact that the Legislature has made the possession of <em>any </em>weapon, not just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>firearms, in a penal institution a felony is indicative of the danger weapons present in such a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In <em>People v. Pepper, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at page 1037, the court noted that the nature of a firearm is readily apparent; likewise here, the nature of a razor blade with an inmate-manufactured holder is also readily apparent. It is a weapon with the sole purpose of inflicting injury on someone else. It cannot be \u201cinnocently\u201d possessed or picked up out of curiosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The factors which may militate toward temporary possession for disposal purposes or for the protection of others as recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at page 814, do not apply in a penal institution. Defendant could have simply alerted a guard to the existence of the weapon without picking it up. We do not believe the Legislature, by the enactment of Penal Code section 4502, sanctioned self-help or knowing possession of weapons under the circumstances presented here. Whether there can <em>ever </em>be a circumstance justifying temporary possession in a penal institution is a question not presently before us. We simply conclude the judge was correct in denying CALJIC No. 12.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Dibiaso, Acting P. J., and Gildner, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 21, 2000, and on August 1, 2000, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 21, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> CALJIC No. 12.06 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auk\">\u201cA person is not guilty of a crime when his or her possession of [a controlled substance] [marijuana] is shown to be lawful.
