Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of possession of a short-barreled shotgun (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)), one count of robbery (\u00a7 211), and one count of possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)). Ferris contends: (1) the prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing argument; and (2) the trial court erred by (a) admitting evidence on his uncharged criminal conduct, (b) not instructing sua sponte with CALJIC No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>17.01, (c) not striking its findings that he had three prior serious or violent felony convictions, (d) imposing two restitution fines under each of section 1202.4, subdivision (b) and section 1202.45, and (e) not recognizing its discretion to impose concurrent terms for his offenses of possessing a controlled substance and possessing a firearm by a felon. We modify the judgment to impose only one restitution fine under each of section 1202.4, subdivision (b) and section 1202.45 and affirm the judgment as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">About 3:00 a.m. on June 22, 1998, Ferris was walking in the San Diego State University area. A police officer approached Ferris and questioned him. Ferris cooperated but appeared nervous. When the officer asked Ferris if the officer could search his backpack, Ferris expressed an expletive, handed the backpack to the officer, and ran away. The officer found a sawed-off shotgun and Ferris\u2019s parole identification card in the backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">About 2:06 p.m. on July 28, 1998, Ferris entered the Grossmont Bank in Alpine and approached bank teller Rhonda Bardsley. Ferris handed her a note and a bank bag. The note instructed her to put all of her money into the bag and stated, \u201cI have a gun. I\u2019ll shoot and kill you.\u201d The tan canvas bag had a piece of red reflective tape on it. Bardsley took the bag, placed about $700 from her cash drawer in it, and handed it back to Ferris. Ferris took the bag and left the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">About 6:00 p.m. on July 28, law enforcement officers arrived at the Carlton Oaks Country Club in Santee after learning Ferris was there. Unaware that Ferris had committed the bank robbery earlier that day, the officers sought Ferris on an outstanding warrant for the June 22 incident and a parole violation. When Ferris entered the hotel lobby, officers placed him under arrest. Officers found a .357 magnum pistol in the front waistband of Ferris\u2019s pants and a dagger and a small quantity of methamphetamine strapped to his ankle. Officers found a bank bag with red reflective tape on it in the car in which Ferris had arrived at the hotel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also found gloves, some cash, and a duffel bag in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">The information filed in case No. SCD138109 charged Ferris with the June 22, 1998, offenses of possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. The separate information filed in case No. SCE190351 charged Ferris with the July 28, 1998, offenses of robbery, possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of a controlled substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>Both informations alleged Ferris had two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) and three prior strike convictions (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to consolidate the two cases for trial. The jury found Ferris guilty on all charges and, in a bifurcated trial, the trial court found the allegations were true. The trial court imposed a sentence of 105 years to life, consisting of 25 years to life in case No. SCD138109 for possession of a firearm by a felon, and consecutive terms of 25 years to life in case No. SCE190351 for each of the offenses of robbery, possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of a controlled substance, and a consecutive term of five years for one of his prior serious felony convictions. The court also imposed two $10,000 restitution fines (\u00a7 1202.4) and two $10,000 parole revocation restitution fines (\u00a7 1202.45), suspending the latter fines unless parole was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Ferris timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">I-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">\n<em>The Trial Court Improperly Imposed Multiple Restitution Fines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Ferris contends the trial court imposed an unauthorized sentence when it imposed two section 1202.4, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and section 1202.45<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> restitution fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">An information was filed against Ferris for the June 22, 1998, charged offenses and a separate information was filed against him for the July 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>1998, charged offenses. The informations had separate case numbers: SCD138109 and SCE190351. Citing section 954,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the prosecutor filed a motion to consolidate the two cases for trial. When the trial court referred to the prosecutor\u2019s motion as \u201ca motion to consolidate these cases,\u201d the prosecutor replied: \u201cI filed a motion for joinder of the two cases for trial purposes. I don\u2019t know if consolidation is exactly the right phrase.\u201d The trial court granted the motion. The court noted the two cases \u201ccertainly would have been filed in a joint information, or complaint and then information, but for the fact that one didn\u2019t know about the other until later.\u201d The informations thereafter were not formally consolidated and the jury\u2019s verdicts on the June 22 and July 28, 1998, charged offenses bore separate case numbers. Furthermore, separate probation officer\u2019s reports were prepared. At sentencing the trial court ordered Ferris \u201c[t]o pay a restitution fine pursuant to [section] 1202.4 of the Penal Code in the amount of $10,000 in each of the two cases, to be paid forthwith or as provided in Penal Code section 2085.5. [\u00b6] He\u2019s to pay an additional fine pursuant to [section] 1202.45 of the Penal Code of $10,000 to be suspended and remain so unless the defendant\u2019s parole is revoked. And that is in each case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Ferris asserts that the imposition of restitution fines in both cases constituted an unauthorized sentence because the two cases had been consolidated. Restitution fines under sections 1202.4, subdivision (b) and 1202.45 are limited to an amount of $10,000 each. <em>(People v. Rowland </em>(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1745, 1752 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 351].) Ferris asserts the trial court erred by considering the two cases as separate for purposes of sections 1202.4, subdivision (b) and 1202.45 and improperly imposed restitution fines thereunder of $20,000 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Joinder and consolidation are often used interchangeably because they have the same effect of a joint trial of multiple charges. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442] shows this commonality: \u201cBecause consolidation ordinarily promotes efficiency, the law prefers it. \u2018Joinder of related charges, whether in a single accusatory pleading or by consolidation of several accusatory pleadings, ordinarily avoids needless harassment of the defendant and the waste of public funds which may result if the same general facts were to be tried in two or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>separate trials [citation], and in several respects separate trials would result in the same factual issues being presented in both trials.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brock </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 645, 655 [58 Cal.Rptr. 321, 426 P.2d 889].) Thus \u2018[a] defendant can prevent consolidation of properly joined charges only with a \u201cclear showing of prejudice\u201d . . . .\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason </em>[(1991) 52 Cal.3d 909, 935 [277 Cal.Rptr. 166, 802 P.2d 950]].)\u201d (19 Cal.4th at p. 409, fn. omitted.) Any linguistic distinction between the terms \u201cjoinder\u201d and \u201cconsolidation\u201d is irrelevant in the circumstances of this case because it is clear that Ferris was substantively tried and sentenced in one joint case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In <em>People v. McNeely </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 739 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 582], we addressed a similar situation. McNeely entered guilty pleas to various charged offenses in two cases with separate case numbers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 742-743.) At the same sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced McNeely in both cases and ordered him to pay $93,000 in restitution under former Government Code section 13967, subdivision (c). (28 Cal.App.4th at p. 743.) We stated: \u201cWhile a trial court can separately sentence a defendant on different cases at a single hearing [citation], here the court combined the charges in both cases in imposing the prison term and ordering restitution. We do not believe this creates separate sentencing proceedings on the two cases. When a penal statute is ambiguous, it must be construed in the light most favorable to the defendant. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 743-744.) Accordingly, we concluded the restitution order was limited to $10,000 and modified the judgment to reflect that limitation. (28 Cal.App.4th at p. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We conclude this case is similar to <em>McNeely. </em>The provisions of both section 1202.4, subdivision (b) and section 1202.45 apply \u201c[i]n <em>every case </em>where a person is convicted of a crime.\u201d (Italics added.) Those statutes do not specify whether the phrase \u201cevery case\u201d means every separately charged and numbered case or every jointly tried case. When a penal statute is ambiguous, we adopt the construction that is more favorable to the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNeely, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 744.) Accordingly, in this case we adopt the statutory construction that is favorable to Ferris. We conclude the phrase \u201cevery case\u201d in sections 1202.4, subdivision (b) and 1202.45 includes a jointly tried case although it involves charges in separately filed informations. The trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to join the charges for purposes of trial. Therefore, the charges in the separate informations were effectively joined in one case despite any technical retention of separate case numbers. Accordingly, in this case the trial court erred by imposing restitution fines in \u201cboth cases.\u201d To allow separate restitution fines in a case involving separate informations but joint trials and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>sentencing could lead to prosecutorial abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We modify the judgment to order Ferris to pay one $10,000 fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b) and one $10,000 fine, suspended unless his parole is revoked, under section 1202.45.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">The judgment is modified to provide imposition of a Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (b) restitution fine of $10,000 and a Penal Code section 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fine of $10,000, which is suspended unless parole is revoked. The judgment is affirmed as modified. The superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment to reflect this modification and shall notify the Department of Corrections of the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Huffman, Acting P.
