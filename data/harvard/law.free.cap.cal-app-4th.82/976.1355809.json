J .</author>\n<p id=\"A2aE\">Patrick Chungliang Hsu appeals his conviction by plea of nolo contendere of two counts of attempting to distribute or exhibit lewd matter to a minor by the Internet (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 288.2, subd. (b), 664). He contends his conviction must be reversed because section 288.2, subdivision (b) violates the commerce clause (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3) and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We conclude that section 288.2, subdivision (b) passes constitutional muster, and therefore affirm Hsu\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">As a result of an undercover investigation on the Internet, Detective Steven McEwan of the San Jose Police Department child exploitation unit arrested an individual (not Hsu) carrying two pictures of a naked 14-year-old boy. McEwan located the boy in Walnut Creek, and the boy allowed McEwan to use his Internet service provider and assume his screen name. On consecutive days Hsu initiated two \u201cinstant messages\u201d with the boy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McEwan, pretending to be the boy, responded. During the ensuing electronic conversations, Hsu sent two photographs of himself, one lying on his bed wearing underwear, and one seated, shirtless and wearing unzipped jeans. He also sent a photograph of an unidentified male in his late teens lying on a bed wearing shorts that had been pulled back to display an erect penis. Hsu offered to engage in specific sexual acts, and invited the boy to meet him at his house. Hsu resides and works in Walnut Creek. The parties do not dispute he initiated the messages from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Following Hsu\u2019s plea, imposition of sentence was suspended, and he was placed on three years\u2019 probation. The trial court issued a certification of probable cause for appeal from the conviction. (\u00a7 1237.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Hsu challenges section 288.2, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as facially unconstitutional under the commerce clause and the First Amendment.  \u201cA facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual. [Citation.] '\u201cTo support a determination of facial unconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, [Hsu] cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute. . . . Rather, [Hsu] must demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145] <em>(Tobe), </em>italics omitted.) In short, a facial challenge must be rejected unless no set of circumstances exists in which the statute can be constitutionally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The exception to this rule is a facial challenge based on First Amendment free speech grounds. Courts \u201chave applied to statutes restricting speech a so-called \u2018overbreadth\u2019 doctrine, rendering such a statute invalid in all its applications <em>(i.e., </em>facially invalid) if it is invalid in any of them.\u201d <em>(Ada, Governor of Guam v. Guam Society of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists et al. </em>(1992) 506 U.S. 1011, 1012 [113 S.Ct. 633, 634, 121 L.Ed.2d 564] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J. to order denying cert.); see also <em>Gooding v. Wilson </em>(1971) 405 U.S. 518, 520-521 [92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105-1106, 31 L.Ed.2d 408] [exception applies to claim of vagueness]; <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 157, 167 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 676].) \u201c[T]he defect in the statute is that the means chosen to accomplish the State\u2019s objectives are too imprecise, so that in all its applications the statute creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech. . . .\u201d <em>(Secretary of State of Md. v. J.H. Munson Co. </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 947, 967-968 [104 S.Ct. 2839, 2852-2853, 81 L.Ed.2d 786].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of statutes, and they will be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakenly appears. <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 814 [258 Cal.Rptr. 161, 771 P.2d 1247].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">\n<em>The Commerce Clause Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The United States Constitution grants to Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.) Even if Congress has not specifically regulated an incident of interstate commerce, state laws that unduly burden interstate commerce and thereby impede free private trade in the national marketplace generally violate the so-called dormant commerce clause. <em>(General Motors Corp. v. Tracy </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 278, 287 [117 S.Ct. 811, 818, 136 L.Ed.2d 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The Internet is undeniably an incident of interstate commerce,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the fact that communication thereby can affect interstate commerce does not automatically cause a state statute in which Internet use is an element to burden interstate commerce. Absent conflicting federal legislation, states retain their authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern, even if interstate commerce may be affected. <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>BT Investment Managers, Inc. </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 27, 36 [100 S.Ct. 2009, 2015, 64 L.Ed.2d 702].) The test for determining if a state statute violates the commerce clause is set forth in <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 137 [90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174] <em>(Pike). </em>\u201cWhere the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. [Citation.] If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142 [90 S.Ct. at p. 847].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Under the <em>Pike </em>test, section 288.2, subdivision (b) does not violate the commerce clause. Statutes affecting public safety carry a strong presumption of validity <em>(Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 520, 524 [79 S.Ct. 962, 964, 3 L.Ed.2d 1003]), and the definition and enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>criminal laws lie primarily with states. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 549, 561, fn. 3 [115 S.Ct. 1624, 1630, 131 L.Ed.2d 626].) States have a compelling interest in protecting minors from harm generally and certainly from being seduced to engage in sexual activities. (See <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC </em>(1989) 492 U.S. 115, 126 [109 S.Ct. 2829, 2836, 106 L.Ed.2d 93] (Sable); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 596, 607 [102 S.Ct. 2613, 2620, 73 L.Ed.2d 248].) Conversely, it is difficult to conceive of any legitimate commerce that would be burdened by penalizing the transmission of harmful sexual material to known minors in order to seduce them. To the extent section 288.2, subdivision (b) may affect interstate commerce, its effect is incidental at best and far outweighed by the state\u2019s abiding interest in preventing harm to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Relying primarily on <em>American Libraries Ass\u2019n. v. Pataki </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1997) 969 F.Supp. 160 <em>(Pataki), </em>Hsu argues that section 288.2, subdivision (b) is unconstitutional because it subjects Internet users to inconsistent regulations. At issue in <em>Pataki </em>was a New York statute similar to section 288.2, subdivision (b) but without the multiple knowledge and intent elements of the latter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In what is essentially a preemption analysis, <em>Pataki </em>concluded the New York statute violated the commerce clause because, inter alia, the nature of the Internet, like that of rail and highway traffic, requires a \u201ccohesive national scheme of regulation so that users are reasonably able to determine their obligations\u201d regarding the kind of material that may be permissibly disseminated thereby. (969 F.Supp. at p. 182.) Absent national regulations, according to <em>Pataki, </em>Internet users will be subject to inconsistent local statutes regulating the content of their communications, i.e., the various states may not have a uniform definition of \u201c \u2018harmful to minors.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The knowledge and intent elements missing from the New York statute but present in section 288.2, subdivision (b) significantly distinguish the two statutes. The New York statute broadly banned the communication of harmful material to minors via the Internet. The scope of section 288.2, subdivision (b) is much narrower. Only when the material is disseminated to a <em>known </em>minor with the <em>intent </em>to arouse the prurient interest of the sender and/or minor and with the <em>intent </em>to seduce the minor does the dissemination become a criminal act. The proscription against Internet use for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>specifically defined and limited purposes does not burden interstate commerce by subjecting Internet users to inconsistent regulations. As <em>Pataki </em>itself observed, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Foley </em>(1999) 257 A.D.2d 243 [692 N.Y.S.2d 248, 256] subsequently held, New York could realistically prosecute violations of New York Penal Law section 235.22(2), which, like section 288.2, subdivision (b), prohibits adults from luring minors into sexual contact via Internet communication of harmful material, without violating the commerce clause. <em>(Pataki, supra, </em>969 F.Supp. at p. 179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Again relying primarily on <em>Pataki, </em>Hsu argues section 288.2, subdivision (b) violates the commerce clause by regulating behavior occurring wholly outside California. A statute may burden interstate commerce if its effect is to regulate activities beyond the state\u2019s borders by exporting the state\u2019s domestic policies into other states. <em>(Edgar v. MITE Corp. </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 624, 641-643 [102 S.Ct. 2629, 2640-2641, 73 L.Ed.2d 269].) Because the Internet has no geographical limitations, <em>Pataki </em>concluded that, with the statute at issue, New York had \u201cdeliberately imposed its legislation on the Internet and, by doing so, projected its law into other states whose citizens use the .Net.\u201d <em>(Pataki, supra, </em>969 F.Supp. at pp. 169, 177.) As <em>Pataki </em>hypothesized, a California artist who displayed his work on his Internet Web site to an Oregon purchaser risked prosecution in New York if the work was harmful to minors under New York\u2019s definition, because Web siteholders are unable to close their sites to the separate states. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 169, 174, 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">When section 288.2, subdivision (b) is harmonized with the entire California penal scheme, it does not effectively regulate activities beyond California. California prosecutes only those criminal acts that occur wholly or partially within the state. (\u00a7\u00a7 27, 777, 778, 778a, 778b.) Statutes \u201cmust be construed in the light of the general principle that, ordinarily, a state does not impose punishment for acts done outside its territory. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buffum </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 709, 716 [256 P.2d 317].) Section 288.2, subdivision (b) makes no reference to place of performance, so courts must assume the Legislature did not intend to regulate conduct taking place outside the state. (See <em>Buffum, supra, </em>at p. 715, see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Morante </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 403, 424-425 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 975 P.2d 1071].) Given the historical and statutory limitations on California\u2019s ability to prosecute, section 288.2, subdivision (b) cannot be enforced beyond what is jurisdiction-ally allowed. Consequently, such enforcement would not burden interstate commerce. Accordingly we reject Hsu\u2019s commerce clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">\n<em>The First Amendment Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Hsu contends section 288.2, subdivision (b) violates the First Amendment because it regulates speech on the basis of content in an impermissibly overbroad and vague manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>a. <em>Content-based or content-neutral law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based.\u201d <em>(Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 622, 643 [114 S.Ct. 2445, 2459, 129 L.Ed.2d 497].) A content-based regulation is presumably invalid. <em>(R.A.V. v. St. Paul </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 377, 382 [112 S.Ct. 2538, 2542, 120 L.Ed.2d 305].) It may be upheld only upon a showing that it is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and has been narrowly tailored to serve that end. <em>(Frisby v. Schultz </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 474, 483 [108 S.Ct. 2495, 2501, 101 L.Ed.2d 420] <em>(Frisby).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Conversely, \u201c[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others. [Citation.] Government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is <em>\u2018justified </em>without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ward v. Rock Against Racism </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 781, 791 [109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661] <em>(Ward).) A </em>content-neutral regulation is upheld if it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication. <em>(Frisby, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 481 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2500].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Thus, the principal inquiry in determining whether a law is content-based or content-neutral \u201cis whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys. [Citation.] The government\u2019s purpose is the controlling consideration.\u201d <em>(Ward, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 791 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2754].) For example, in <em>Boos v. Barry </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 312, 322 [108 S.Ct. 1157, 1164, 99 L.Ed.2d 333], the Supreme Court examined the District of Columbia\u2019s purpose in prohibiting the display of signs outside a foreign government\u2019s embassy, if the sign tended to bring the foreign government into public odium or disrepute. The court concluded the regulation was content-based because the justification for the law focused only on the content of the message and its direct impact on the viewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Conversely, <em>Renton </em>v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc. </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 41, 48 [106 S.Ct. 925, 929, 89 L.Ed.2d 29] <em>(Renton) </em>upheld a zoning ordinance that forbade adult movie theaters in residential neighborhoods because the ordinance was not aimed at the content of the movies but at the secondary effects of the theaters, such as crime and deteriorating property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">In <em>Sebago, Inc. v. City of Alameda </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1372 [259 Cal.Rptr. 918] <em>(Sebago) </em>we considered whether an ordinance that restricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>the sites of vending machines selling adult newspapers and periodicals was content-based or content-neutral. We did so by examining its stated aims of restricting the access of minors to adult newspapers and prevention of urban blight. <em>(Id. </em>at pp 1383-1384.) We concluded the restriction-to-minors aim was content-based because it concerned direct listener reaction to speech. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1384.) Given the absence of demonstrable data that the vending machines downgraded neighborhoods, we concluded the urban blight aim did not make the ordinance content-neutral because, \u201c[u]nlike in <em>Renton, </em>Alameda\u2019s concern as to purported secondary effects of [the vending machines] was truly \u2018conclusory and speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1385, quoting <em>Renton, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 50 [106 S.Ct. at p. 930], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Recently, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 803 [120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865] <em>(Playboy) </em>applied the same analytical standard in deciding whether section 505 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 561) (CDA), requiring cable operators to scramble or block sexually oriented programming, is content-based or content-neutral. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he overriding justification for the regulation is concern for the effect of the subject matter on young viewers. Section 505 is not \u2018 \u201cjustified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] It \u2018focuses only on the content of the speech and the direct impact that speech has on its listeners.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (529 U.S. at p. 811 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1885].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Here, we conclude the purpose of section 288.2 cannot be served without referring to the speech it seeks to restrict. The overriding aim of the regulation is to prevent a particular kind of message, i.e., harmful matter, from reaching minors in order to provoke in them a particular reaction, i.e., arousal of sexual desire. The statute cannot be justified without reference to the content of the Internet transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The People attempt to avoid this conclusion by arguing that section 288.2, subdivision (b) regulates conduct and not merely speech. Citing <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1376, 1381-1382 [283 Cal.Rptr. 81], they argue it seeks to deter sexual predators from using the Internet to lure youthful victims in the same way laws prohibiting obscene or annoying telephone calls regulate conduct. However, this argument avoids examining the <em>primary </em>effect or <em>direct </em>impact of the ordinance\u2014deterring the transmittal of statutorily \u201charmful\u201d matter to prevent a statutorily specified response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>in the child-listener or sender. As <em>Boos v. Barry </em>stated, \u201c[t]he emotive impact of speech on its audience is not a \u2018secondary effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Boos v. Barry, supra, </em>485 U.S. at p. 321 [108 S.Ct. at p. 1164].) If the content of the Internet communication is changed to a communication that does not constitute \u201charmful matter,\u201d such as a free copy of the latest Harry Potter novel,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the promise of unlimited purchases at a bakery, or a pair of tickets to a major league baseball game, we see no violation of <em>this </em>statute. In short, this regulation proscribes speech, not merely conduct, and is subject to the highest level of scrutiny.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">b. <em>Overbreadth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Hsu concedes section 288.2, subdivision (b) satisfies the first criterion for a permissible content-based regulation of speech because it serves the compelling interest of protecting children from material harmful to them, even if not obscene by adult standards. (See <em>Sable, supra, </em>492 U.S. at p. 126 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2836]); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1085 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 661].) The next question is whether the statute is tailored narrowly enough to serve this interest without unnecessarily interfering with the First Amendment rights of adults. <em>(Sable, supra, </em>at p. 126 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2836].)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">A statute is narrowly tailored only if the Legislature has chosen the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. <em>(Sable, supra, </em>492 U.S. at p. 126 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2836].) It must target and eliminate no more than the exact source of the evil it seeks to remedy. <em>(Frisby, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 485 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2504]; see also <em>Playboy, supra, </em>529 U.S. at p. 813 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1886].)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Section 288.2, subdivision (b) has been written in a manner that does not impermissibly infringe on the rights of adults to transmit and receive constitutionally protected material via the Internet. The objective of the statute is not simply to protect minors from exposure to the harmful material, but to prevent transmitting the material for the ultimate purpose of seducing them. It is one of many penal statutes by which \u201cthe Legislature has evidenced a long-standing and consistent history of specifically protecting minors from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>sexual exploitation and predation.\u201d <em>(Angie M. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1225 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 197]; see also <em>People v. Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 341-342 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040].) Before it can be violated, the sender must know the recipient is a minor, know the transmitted matter is harmful, intend to arouse the minor\u2019s sexual desires, and, most specifically, intend to seduce the minor. The only chilling effect of the statute is on the conduct of those who would use otherwise protected speech to seduce minors. There is no violation of section 288.2, subdivision (b) when an adult disseminates the matter to another adult or to a minor without the intent of seducing the minor recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Moreover, the statute\u2019s built-in affirmative defenses further limit its reach so that it targets only those who prey on minors to seduce them. It provides that parents or guardians who transmit the statutorily defined \u201charmful material\u201d to aid legitimate sex education, or other adults who transmit the material to aid scientific or educational purposes, shall have a defense against prosecution, and it relieves the Internet providers who transmit the material from prosecution entirely. (\u00a7 288.2, subds. (c), (d), (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">These limitations on section 288.2, subdivision (b) distinguish it from the statutes found unconstitutionally overbroad in <em>Reno I, supra, </em>521 U.S. 844 and <em>Cyberspace, supra, </em>55 F.Supp.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">At issue in <em>Reno I </em>was another section of the CDA (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223 (a)(1)(B), (a)(2), &amp; (d)), which prohibited either (1) the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent communications to recipients known to be under 18, or (2) the knowing use of the Internet to send or display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age, any communication that depicted sexual or excretory activities or organs, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards. (R<em>eno I, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 860 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2338].) At issue in <em>Cyberspace </em>was a Michigan statute that prohibited knowingly disseminating sexually explicit material harmful to minors via the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Unlike section 288.2, subdivision (b), neither the CDA nor the Michigan statute was tailored so that the offense was restricted to the transmittal of the proscribed material with the double intent of arousing the minor\u2019s sexual desire and seducing the minor, thereby ensuring that adult-to-adult communication was undeterred. Section 288.2, subdivision (b) mandates not only that the accused sender have the particularized intent \u201cof arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor,\u201d but also that he or she have the particularized intent \u201cof seducing a minor.\u201d Thus, section 288.2, subdivision (b), withstands this facial challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>because it is a narrowly drawn statute that serves a conceded compelling state interest by use of language that restricts \u201cno more than [is necessary to] eliminate the exact source of the evil it [seeks] to remedy.\u201d <em>(City Council </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 789, 808 [104 S.Ct. 2118, 2130, 80 L.Ed.2d 772].)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Relying on <em>Sable, supra, </em>492 U.S. 115, Hsu argues that section 288.2, subdivision (b) fails to use the least restrictive means to achieve its goal because the government must show that less restrictive means have been tested over time to determine their validity, and there is no evidence of such testing. Hsu\u2019s reliance is misplaced. <em>Sable </em>involved a 1988 amendment to a federal statute that imposed a total ban on both indecent and obscene interstate commercial telephone messages, the so-called dial-a-pom. <em>(Sable, supra, </em>at p. 117 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2832].) The Federal Communications Commission determined that its credit card, access code, and scrambling mies were feasible and effective in preventing the dial-a-pom messages from reaching minors, but the federal government argued that these rules would not be sufficiently effective because enterprising children could evade them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2837].) <em>Sable </em>disagreed. \u201cThere is no evidence in the record before us to that effect, nor could there be since the FCC\u2019s implementation of [the statute] prior to its 1988 amendment <em>has never been tested over time.\u201d (Id. </em>at pp. 128-129 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 2837-2838], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The italicized language portion from <em>Sable </em>addresses its unique fact pattern: the statute\u2019s <em>total ban </em>on protected, i.e., indecent, speech in the face of the FCC\u2019s application of its mies. <em>Sable </em>does not impose a blanket requirement that alternative means must first be tested before restrictions can be placed on protected speech to prevent specific conduct impermissible under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We finally observe that section 288.2, subdivision (b) does not suffer the unconstitutional overbreadth of the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231) (COPA), as the Third Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in <em>American Civil Liberties Union </em>v. <em>Reno </em>(3d Cir. 2000) 217 F.3d 162 <em>(Reno II). </em>COPA, the successor to CD A, prohibits an individual or entity from knowingly transmitting material harmful to minors via the World Wide Web. (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(d).) COPA defines \u201charmful to minors\u201d as, inter alia, material that the average person, \u201capplying contemporary community standards,\u201d would find is designed to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient interest. (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231(e)(6).) <em>Reno II </em>affirmed the granting of a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of COPA because of the likelihood it would be declared unconstitutional, given the overbreadth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d applying a \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d clause in the context of the Web medium. It determined that because of the peculiar geography-free nature of cyberspace and the present technological inability of Web publishers to restrict access to their sites based on the geographical locale of Internet users, a \u201ccommunity standards\u201d test would compel every Web publisher, in order to avoid liability, to abide by the most restrictive and conservative state\u2019s community\u2019s standards, even if that standard were not deemed harmful to minors in all other states. Therefore, <em>Reno II </em>concluded, COPA imposes an impermissible burden on constitutionally protected speech. <em>(Reno II, supra, </em>217 F.3d at pp. 173-180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Section 288.2, subdivision (b) avoids COPA\u2019s unconstitutional over-breadth by gauging whether the published material is harmful to minors on the narrow basis of \u201ccontemporary <em>statewide </em>standards.\u201d (\u00a7 313, subd. (a), italics added.) When <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 15, 24 [93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614, 37 L.Ed.2d 419] <em>(Miller) </em>emphasized that \u201ccommunity standards,\u201d as used to determine whether a work appeals to the prurient interest, are to be construed in a localized geographic context, it implicitly acknowledged that a state constitutes such a \u201ccommunity.\u201d \u201c[Q]ur Nation is simply too big and too diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that such standards [of what is patently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in a single formulation .... To require a State to structure obscenity proceedings around evidence of a <em>national </em>\u2018community standard\u2019 would be an exercise in futility.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 30.) By restricting the measurement of harmful matter to a contemporary <em>California </em>standard, section 288.2, subdivision (b) passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">c. <em>Vagueness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The remaining question is whether the terms in section 288.2, subdivision (b) make the statute impermissibly vague.  The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that \u201cordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>(Kolender v. Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352, 357 [103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 L.Ed.2d 903]; <em>Tobe, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">To satisfy constitutional requirements, a statute must be sufficiently precise to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and to provide sufficiently definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>(Tobe, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1106.) However, reasonable certainty is all that is necessary. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[A]ll that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. . . .\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 491 [77 S.Ct. 1304, 1312, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498].) The challenged terms must be considered in the context of the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>(Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 288, 290-291 [104 S.Ct. 3065, 3067, 82 L.Ed.2d 221]; <em>Communications Assn. v. Douds </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 382, 412 [70 S.Ct. 674, 690, 94 L.Ed. 925].) If a reasonable and practical construction can be given to the language of a statute or its terms made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources, it will not be held void. <em>(People v. Green </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 692, 699 [278 Cal.Rptr. 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Hsu contends the word \u201cseducing\u201d is impermissibly vague because it is not defined, and the phrase \u201charmful matter\u201d is impermissibly vague because \u201csexual conduct,\u201d one of its terms, is not defined. Although \u201cseduce,\u201d as Hsu notes, can mean simply \u201cto lead astray,\u201d it is also defined as \u201cpersuading into partnership in sexual intercourse.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 2054.) In the context of section 288.2, subdivision (b), with its references to gratifying lust, passion, and sexual desire, people of ordinary intelligence (see <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 250, 253 [72 S.Ct. 725, 728, 96 L.Ed. 919]) would readily understand \u201cseducing\u201d as used here to mean the latter definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\u201cHarmful matter,\u201d as used in section 288.2, subdivision (b) incorporates the definition from section 313, subdivision (a): \u201c[M]atter, taken as a whole, which to the average person, applying contemporary statewide standards, appeals to the prurient interest, and is matter which, taken as a whole, depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct and which, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d This definition essentially tracks the three-pronged test for obscenity articulated in <em>Miller, supra, </em>413 U.S. at page 24 [93 S.Ct. at page 2615]: \u201c[1] whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; [2] whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and [3] whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d However, section 313 does not specifically define \u201csexual conduct\u201d (see second prong), and it adds \u201cto minors\u201d at the conclusion of the third prong.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The omission does not result in section 288.2, subdivision (b) being unconstitutionally vague. First, given that the term \u201cprurient interest\u201d in section 313 is used in conjunction with the intent elements of \u201carousing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of [and] seducing\u201d in section 288.2, subdivision (b), the meaning of sexual conduct for purposes of the acts proscribed by section 288.2, subdivision (b) \u201ccan be objectively ascertained by reference to common experiences of mankind.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119, 1129 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Second, the meaning of sexual conduct can easily be made certain by reference to other statutes in companion chapters of the Penal Code dealing with the related subject of obscenity. Section 313 is contained within chapter 7.6, Harmful Matter. Chapter 7.5, entitled Obscene Matter, includes prohibitions against sexual exploitation of a child (\u00a7 311.3) and employment or use of a child to perform prohibited acts (\u00a7 311.4), both of which contain elaborate definitions of \u201csexual conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Insofar as section 288.2, subdivision (b) is among the numerous statutes specifically enacted to protect minors against exploitation and predation <em>(see Angie M., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1225), the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d used in like statutes permits a reasonable and practical construction of \u201csexual conduct\u201d as used in section 313 and, by extension, in section 288.2, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Hsu\u2019s argument that the lack of a definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d makes section 288.2 unconstitutionally vague is based on <em>Reno I, supra, </em>521 U.S. 844. The CDA at issue in <em>Reno I </em>made it illegal, inter alia, to use the Internet to display to persons under 18 years of age any communication that depicted sexual or excretory activities or organs \u201c \u2018in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 860 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2339].) The federal district court concluded that \u201cpatently offensive\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. In rebuttal before the Supreme Court, the government argued that the CDA\u2019s patently offensive standard was one part of the three-pronged <em>Miller </em>test, so could not be unconstitutionally vague. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 862, 872-873 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2339, 2344-2345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>Reno I </em>concluded the government was factually incorrect because <em>Miller\u2019s </em>\u201cpatently offensive\u201d prong (\u201c \u2018whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>state law\u201d) <em>(Reno I, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 872 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2345]) contained the additional \u201ccritical requirement. . . that the proscribed material be \u2018specifically defined by the applicable state law\u2019 [and this] requirement reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term \u2018patently offensive\u2019 as used in the CDA.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 873 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2345].) <em>Reno I </em>also concluded the government\u2019s reasoning was flawed. \u201cJust because a definition including three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of those limitations, standing by itself, is not vague. Each of <em>Miller's </em>additional two prongs\u2014(1) that, taken as a whole, the material appeal to the \u2018prurient\u2019 interest, and (2) that it \u2018lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\u2019\u2014critically limits the uncertain sweep of the obscenity definition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 873 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2345], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The vagueness problems of the CDA\u2019s \u201cpatently offensive\u201d standard are not present in sections 288.2, subdivision (b) and 313. As previously discussed, section 313, unlike the CDA, contains, in essence, all three <em>Miller </em>prongs. Additionally, the terms of the two statutes may be made clear by considering their purpose and by referring to other related state statutes. Hsu\u2019s First Amendment challenge on vagueness grounds likewise fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Stevens, J., and Kramer, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 29, 2000.
