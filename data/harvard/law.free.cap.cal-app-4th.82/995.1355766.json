When the appellant, American Motorists Insurance Co. (AMICO) refused to provide a defense, Peerless Lighting Corporation (Peerless) filed an action for declaratory relief. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Peerless on the ground AMICO had a duty to defend as a matter of law. However, after a bench trial, the court concluded AMICO had no duty to indemnify Peerless for the $195,000 it paid to settle the underlying suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">With respect to \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage, the policy only provided coverage for offenses \u201ccommitted in the course of advertising . . . goods, products, or services.\u201d Because, under the specific facts of this case, there is no evidence the offense (infringement of trade dress) was committed \u201cin the course of advertising\u201d as that phrase is commonly and reasonably understood, we conclude that no potential for coverage existed and thus no duty to defend ever arose. In particular, we hold that the term \u201cadvertising\u201d as used in the policy does not include an effort to sell, through a competitive bidding process, a product that was specifically manufactured for a single customer to meet the needs of a specific project. Consequently, we reverse the order granting summary judgment and affirm the judgment after trial finding no duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In October 1994, AMICO issued a one-year commercial general liability (CGL) policy to Peerless. As pertinent to this appeal, the policy provides coverage for \u201c \u2018Advertising injury\u2019 caused by an offense committed <em>in the course of advertising your goods, products or services </em>. . . .\u201d The policy defines \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as an injury \u201carising out of one or more of the following offenses; flQ a. Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization . . . ; [f] b. Oral or written publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy; [f] c. Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or [^] d. Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">AMICO does not contend that any exclusion in the policy is relevant to the coverage issue. Thus, we are only concerned with the insuring clause quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>\n<em>The Underlying Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The underlying action arose out of a dispute between two lighting fixture manufacturers: Peerless, and its competitor, Columbia Lighting, Inc. (Columbia). Both companies sought to supply overhead lighting fixtures for a General Motors (GM) facility expansion in Michigan. GM had used Columbia\u2019s \u201cindirect luminairs\u201d in an earlier phase of the project, and Columbia submitted a bid to have the indirect luminairs installed in the expansion facility as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Peerless also submitted a bid to have its own Envision brand lighting fixture used in the GM expansion facility. Peerless shipped a sample of its standard Envision fixture to the project site, but GM rejected it because it shined too much light on the ceiling and did not spread the light sufficiently to the sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Because architectural lighting fixtures for large projects are generally not \u201coff-the-shelf\u2019 items, but are manufactured in response to a customer\u2019s specific order, it is not uncommon for manufacturers to modify an existing product to meet the requirements of a particular project. Thus, in response to GM\u2019s rejection of its standard fixture, Peerless modified the Envision fixture by installing a \u201ckicker lens\u201d to modify its optics and light distribution. Peerless sent a sample of the modified Envision fixture to the GM site. GM concluded the modified Envision fixture met its needs, and ultimately awarded Peerless the supply contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">However, after Peerless sent a sample of the modified Envision fixture to GM, but before Peerless was awarded the contract, Columbia\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to Peerless giving notice that the modified Envision fixture infringed on Columbia\u2019s patents and trade dress. The letter stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\u201cPeerless . . . [has] manufactured] a lighting fixture violating United States Patent No. 4,866,584 held by Columbia. Columbia manufactures a fixture known in the industry as TPR\u2019 which has been on the market since the late 1980s. This particular fixture was utilized on a project known as the \u2018General Motors Development Center\u2019 [in] Michigan. That project is currently undergoing an expansion, and Peerless Lighting has attempted to manufacture an imitation of Columbia\u2019s IPR fixture in an effort to utilize the Peerless fixture in the expansion facility, [f] . . . [T]he Peerless fixture appears to have utilized the Peerless Envision body and added a triangular upper reflector to create a dual reflecting system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">\u201cIn addition to infringing Columbia\u2019s patent, Peerless Lighting\u2019s manufacture and sale of its fixture constitutes infringement pursuant to \u00a7 43(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>the Lanham Act [trade dress] . . . . It is obvious that Peerless has manufactured its fixture in the mockup in an effort to duplicate Columbia\u2019s fixture which was utilized in Phase I of the General Motors Development Center. ... It appears the sole purpose of the Peerless fixture is to duplicate Columbia\u2019s fixture and, consequently, utilize it in the General Motors Development Center expansion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Peerless responded to Columbia\u2019s charges in a letter in which its attorney first refuted the patent infringement charges in detail. The letter then goes on to state: \u201cWe are more than puzzled by Columbia Lighting\u2019s trade dress allegations under \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Act. The trade dress of our client\u2019s lighting fixture resides in the shape of its housing.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] And as acknowledged in your letter, the lighting fixture submitted by Peerless on the General Motors project utilizes Peerless\u2019 own well-known Envision\u00ae shape. By using the Envision\u00ae shape on this project, it is, in fact, Columbia Lighting that has copied the trade dress of Peerless, not the other way around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On August 9, 1995, the same day Peerless sent its response, Columbia filed a complaint in federal court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging causes of action for patent infringement and \u201ctrade dress\u201d violations under the Lanham Act (the Columbia suit). With respect to the trade dress violations, the complaint alleged that Columbia\u2019s \u201cindirect luminairs . . . have a unique decorative image that is inherently distinctive and which identifies [Columbia\u2019s] goods and distinguishes them from goods of others. HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [ID Peerless has manufactured an infringing imitation of Columbia\u2019s indirect luminair and offered it for sale and use in the General Motors expansion facility . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In count II (Lanham Act violations) the complaint states: \u201cColumbia has created a unique, non-functional, decorative appearance in its indirect luminair fixture which constitutes protective trade dress. Moreover, this decorative appearance is inherently distinctive or, in the alternative, has acquired secondary meaning. As a result of promotional and marketing efforts, and the quality of [Columbia\u2019s] products, [Columbia\u2019s] trade dress has become widely and favorably known, and constitutes a valuable asset . . . and a symbol of . . . goodwill. Peerless\u2019 manufacture and offer for sale of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>lighting fixtures recently seen in General Motors\u2019 sample room ... infringes [Columbia\u2019s] trade dress and constitutes a violation of the Lanham Trademark Act, \u00a7 43(a) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) in that [Peerless\u2019s] infringing trade dress has and is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception of the public between [Columbia\u2019s] product and [Peerless\u2019s] product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\n<em>Tender of Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">On September 1, 1995, Peerless tendered defense of the Columbia complaint to AMICO. A few weeks later, the claims adjuster for the claim spoke with Peerless\u2019s counsel, who advised the adjuster that the dispute arose when GM permitted Peerless to bid on the expansion project on the basis of the modified Envision fixture. Counsel told the adjuster that Peerless had created the modified fixture solely for the GM project. Counsel noted that Peerless and GM were still negotiating the contract, and that the Columbia claim could \u201cgo away\u201d if Peerless did not get the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Subsequently, the adjuster received copies of Columbia\u2019s demand letter and Peerless\u2019s response, portions of which we have quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Finally, in a conference call between the adjuster, Peerless\u2019s counsel, and the chief engineer (Mr. Ngai) and the president of Peerless (Mr. Herst), both Messrs. Ngai and Herst told the adjuster they had initially offered GM their standard 16-foot lighting fixture, but GM had rejected it. Messrs. Ngai and Herst said Peerless had modified the standard fixture by adding a \u201ckicker\u201d reflector, and that this modification was made for the GM bid alone. Ngai and Herst said it was this modified product that was at issue in the underlying litigation. They represented that Peerless never \u201cadvertised\u201d the modified lighting fixture.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">After learning this additional information, AMICO rejected the tender of defense. In its letter declining coverage, AMICO stated it was denying coverage because \u201cthe allegations in the Complaint do not meet the definition of \u2018Advertising Injury\u2019 and the \u2018Advertising Injury\u2019 alleged did not occur in the course of advertising your goods, products or services as defined in your policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">After AMICO refused to provide a defense, Peerless filed an action for declaratory relief to establish its right to a defense. AMICO responded with a cross-complaint for declaratory relief to establish it had neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify the Columbia suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>Early in the suit, Peerless moved for summary judgment on the duty to defend issue and the trial court granted the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Peerless admitted in its motion for summary judgment that there was \u201cno dispute as to the relevant facts\u201d and the \u201csole issue\u201d was the \u201cmeaning, construction, and application of the language of the policy.\u201d The court found that \u201cas a matter of law . . . at this point and time there is a duty to defend Columbia\u2019s third-party complaint for trade dress/inffingement, and that defendant has failed to show by uncontroverted facts that there is no possibility of coverage.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on <em>Lebas Fashion Imports of USA, Inc. </em>v. <em>ITT Hartford Ins. Group </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 548 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 36] <em>(Lebas).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The summary judgment, which the court filed on February 6, 1997, stated Peerless was entitled to reimbursement for all fees and costs incurred in defending the underlying action. Despite this ruling, AMICO did not provide Peerless with a defense. Peerless continued to retain its own counsel to defend and settled the underlying suit on July 16, 1997. The court ultimately awarded Peerless more than $700,000 to reimburse it for the defense costs it had incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">After Peerless settled the underlying litigation by agreeing to pay Columbia $195,000, the parties tried the duty to indemnify issue in a two day bench trial. The trial court found in favor of AMICO on the indemnification issue. In particular, the court found the pertinent offense (trade dress infringement) was not committed \u201cin the course of advertising goods, products, or services\u201d and thus was not covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The court noted that Columbia had alleged trade dress infringement involving only one product, \u201cthe third mock-up of a lighting fixture manufactured by Peerless for General Motors. . . . Peerless had provided three mock-ups for showing in the mock-up room at General Motors in Michigan, but only the third mock-up was at issue in the Columbia complaint.\u201d The court noted that representatives of Columbia testified that Peerless\u2019s advertising or promotion of the product formed no part of Columbia\u2019s claim against Peerless. Moreover, Peerless\u2019s vice-president for engineering, Mr. Ngai, testified that the third mock-up was designed expressly for GM and that he was not aware of any marketing or promotion of that product beyond the specific transaction with GM. The court said that, under these facts, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>was \u201cnot prepared to say that merely showing a product to one customer amounts to \u2018advertising\u2019 activity. No court in a reported decision has gone that far.\u201d The court therefore entered judgment stating that AMICO had no duty to indemnify Peerless in the Columbia suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">AMICO filed a notice of appeal challenging the court\u2019s decision on the duty to defend issue and Peerless filed a separate notice of appeal challenging the court\u2019s decision on the indemnification issue. Subsequently, the trial court issued a postjudgment order declaring that Peerless was the prevailing party for the purpose of awarding costs. AMICO filed notice of appeal from this order and a subsequent order awarding Peerless $9,156.87 in costs. We consolidated all three appeals (Nos. A082975, A083487, and A084373) for the purposes of briefing, argument and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The primary issue we must decide in this case is whether the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment because it concluded AMICO had a duty to defend the Columbia suit as a matter of law. We conclude the trial court did err in this regard. We therefore reverse the order granting summary judgment, affirm the judgment to the extent it denies indemnification to Peerless, and reverse the court\u2019s order awarding costs to Peerless.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">A trial court may properly grant summary judgment when the evidence in support of the moving party establishes there is no issue of fact to be tried and that party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c; <em>Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].)  If the trial court determines there is no triable issue of fact, it determines the legal issues in the case. An appellate court reviews a grant of a summary judgment de novo by examining the pleadings the parties presented to the trial court in support of, and in opposition to, the motion. <em>(Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 548, 555; <em>AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Because there is no dispute as to the relevant facts we have summarized above, we exercise our independent judgment as to their legal effect. Thus, our sole task in this case is to construe and apply the language of the policy, which presents a pure issue of law. <em>(Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>B. <em>Rules for Insurance Contract Interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The guidelines for determining whether an insurance policy requires the insurer to defend the insured against a third party\u2019s claim are well settled. Our Supreme Court has summarized them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">\u201cWhen determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend, we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. [Citation.] The rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it. [Citations.] . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cThe fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the \u2018mutual intention\u2019 of the parties. . . . \u2018Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. [Citation.] The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u201d [citation], controls judicial interpretation. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] A policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. [Citation.] But language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. [Citation.] Courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">\u201cThese well-established precepts of insurance coverage guide us in our determination of whether a particular policy requires a liability insurer to defend a lawsuit filed by a third party against the insured. It has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement. [Citations.] This duty ... is separate from and broader than the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. [Citation.] However, \u2018 \u201cwhere there is no possibility of coverage, there is no duty to defend ....\u2019\u201d [Citation.] . . . [T]he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">\u201cConversely, where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage, the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>complaint suggest potential liability. [Citations.] This is because the duty to defend, although broad, is not unlimited; it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18-19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619]; quoted in <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Apple Computer, Inc. </em>(1999) 79 Cal.App.4th 817, 826-827 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 528] <em>(Apple).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Moreover, even if policy language appears to be ambiguous, \u201cwe first consider the language in the context of the policy as a whole, and in light of the circumstances of the case. Only if that exercise fails to resolve the uncertainty do we resort to the rule that ambiguities in policy language are resolved against the insurer .... [Citations].</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\u201cFurthermore, while we must resolve in the insured\u2019s favor any doubt as to whether the facts give rise to a duty to defend, this requirement does not apply to doubts regarding the legal interpretation of policy terms. If the policy terms provide no potential for coverage, the insurer may properly deny a defense even if its duty to defend turns on an unresolved legal question that is subsequently answered in its favor by developments in the case law. [Citations.] Courts look at the facts differently in evaluating the duty to defend and the duty of indemnity, because facts disclosing a bare potential for coverage are sufficient to require a defense. [Citation.] However, we do not interpret policy terms differently so as to expand or contract the scope of coverage depending on whether the duty at issue is to defend or to indemnify. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Apple, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">C. <em>The Policy Only Covers Offenses \u201cCommitted in the Course of </em>Advertising\u201d; <em>Since No </em>\u201cAdvertising\u201d <em>of the Alleged Infringing Product Occurred, There Was No Potential for Coverage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Significantly, the policy provides coverage for \u201cadvertising injuries\u201d only if they are \u201ccaused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [the insured\u2019s] goods, products or services . . . .\u201d We may assume, for the purpose of argument, that infringement of trade dress qualifies as one of the \u201coffenses\u201d that may give rise to an \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The real issue, as we see it, is whether Peerless committed the alleged offense (infringement of trade dress) <em>in the course of advertising </em>its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>goods or services. We conclude the undisputed facts establish it did not; consequently, the trial court should have denied Peerless\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Our Supreme Court, in interpreting language very similar to that in this policy, has held there must be a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the insured\u2019s advertising and the resulting \u201cadvertising injury\u201d before there can be coverage. (B<em>ank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1277 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) In <em>Bank of the West, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted a pre-1986 version of the advertising-injury coverage language. That language provided that the insured would be covered for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d \u201c \u2018arising out of an offense . . . occurring in the course of the named insured\u2019s advertising activities ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Supreme Court held this language requires that \u201c \u2018advertising injury\u2019 must have a causal connection with the insured\u2019s \u2018advertising activities\u2019 before there can be coverage.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1276.) In this regard, the court noted that \u201ccourts have disagreed on the question of what constitutes \u2018advertising\u2019 for these purposes. Most of the published opinions hold that \u2018advertising\u2019 means widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large. <em>(International Ins. </em>v. <em>Florists\u2019 Mut.

Minn. 1988)] 696 F.Supp. 434, 440, appear to have held that the term \u2018advertising\u2019 can also encompass personal solicitations.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1276, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Thus, <em>Bank of the West </em>suggests a two-part test for determining whether an offense was committed \u201cin the course of advertising.\u201d First, the promotion of the product or service at issue must constitute \u201cadvertising\u201d within the meaning of the policy language; and second, the \u201cadvertising activities\u201d must have in some sense caused the \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Here, we agree with the trial court\u2019s ultimate posttrial conclusion that merely showing a tailor-made product to one customer in the context of a competitive bidding process cannot amount to \u201cadvertising\u201d as that term is used in the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The policy does not define the term \u201cadvertising.\u201d As indicated, the \u201cmajority rule\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is that \u201cadvertising,\u201d as that term is used in CGL policies, means widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large. The most complete discussion of the majority rule is found in <em>Select Design v. Union Mut. Fire Ins. </em>(1996) 165 Vt. 69 [674 A.2d 798] <em>(Select Design). </em>There, the Vermont Supreme Court construed a coverage clause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> identical to the one in AMICO\u2019s policy. <em>(Select Design, supra, 674 </em>A.2d at p. 800.) The underlying suit alleged that the insured\u2019s employee took a proprietary customer list from a competitor and used that list to solicit the competitor\u2019s customers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799.) The court held mere solicitation of customers from a list did not amount to \u201cadvertising\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The <em>Select Design </em>court reasoned: \u201cAlthough the term \u2018advertising\u2019 is not defined in the policy, it has been defined in case law as \u2018the widespread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>distribution of promotional material to the public at large.\u2019 <em>International Ins. Co. v. Florists\u2019 Mut. Ins. Co., </em>201 Ill.App.3d 428, 147 Ill.Dec. 7, 559 N.E.2d 7, 10[, <em>supra]. </em>Other courts have endorsed substantially the same definition. See, e.g., . . . <em>Monumental Life Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>94 Md.App. 505, 617 A.2d 1163, 1173 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. [(1993)]) (\u2018[T]he plain meaning of the term \u201cadvertising\u201d to a reasonably prudent person is not susceptible of more than one meaning, and encompasses only the \u201cpublic\u201d sense of the word\u2019) . . . <em>Smartfoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Co., </em>35 Mass.App.Ct. 239, 618 N.E.2d 1365, 1368 (1993) (\u2018a public announcement to proclaim the qualities of a product or point of view\u2019) . . . <em>First Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins.

(mere explanation of bank services to couple in private office is not considered advertising).\u201d <em>(Select Design, supra, </em>674 A.2d at p. 801, italics omitted; see also <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vortherms </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1999) 5 S.W.3d 538, 542 [following <em>Select Design].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The <em>Select Design </em>court noted that in <em>Monumental Life v. USF &amp; G, supra, </em>617 A.2d 1163, 1173 the insured was an insurance company accused of pirating employees from a competitor and misusing trade secrets and confidential information from the competitor. (617 A.2d at pp. 1165-1167 &amp; fn. 5.) The plaintiff in <em>Monumental </em>argued that an advertising injury was alleged. The court held that one-to-one sales activity by the plaintiff\u2019s agents, which induced customers to switch coverage to the plaintiff, was not advertising: \u201c[Advertising and solicitation [are] . . . mutually exclusive, the difference being that advertising must be of a public nature.\u201d (617 A.2d at p. 1173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Similarly, in <em>Smartfoods v. Northbrook Property &amp; Cas., supra, </em>618 N.E.2d 1365, 1368 the plaintiff, a producer of snack foods, was sued when it terminated distribution contracts. (618 N.E.2d at p. 1366.) The distributors alleged unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets, among other causes of action. The plaintiff sought insurance coverage by characterizing its letters soliciting distributors as advertising and arguing that the complaint against it alleged injuries from advertising activities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1368.) The <em>Smartfoods </em>court rejected the argument, concluding that \u201ca proposal to a particular company to do business together does not conform to ordinary notions of calling to the attention of the public the merits of a product,\u201d and added \u201c[w]e doubt that every pitch made by one businessman in a letter to another constitutes advertising as the word is understood in American usage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">There are a number of federal district court cases that define \u201cadvertising\u201d more broadly than have the cases discussed above. (See <em>New Hampshire Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number><em>Co. v. Foxfire, Inc., supra, </em>820 F.Supp. 489 <em>(Foxfire); Merchants Co. </em>v. <em>American Motorists Ins. </em>(S.D.Miss. 1992) 794 F.Supp. 611; <em>John Deere Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shamrock Industries, Inc., supra, </em>696 F.Supp. 434.) The most expansive definition is in <em>John Deere Ins. Co. </em>where the court considered a policy defining \u201cadvertising injury\u201d in nearly the same words as those in the policy before us. There, the insured wrote letters to a single buyer attempting to sell a machine the insured allegedly misappropriated from a former employer. The court held \u201c[wjhile activity directed at one customer seems to stretch the meaning of advertising, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of \u2018advertise\u2019 encompasses any form of solicitation, presumably including solicitation of one person.\u201d (696 F.Supp. at p. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The <em>Foxfire </em>court, on the other hand, adopted an approach between the two extremes (i.e. between a definition limited to \u201cthe widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large\u201d and one that encompassed solicitation of a single customer). In <em>Foxfire, </em>the insured had sent out a letter to <em>all </em>of his former employer\u2019s clients soliciting business. <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at p. 491.) The court, construing a pre-1986 policy (see fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>considered whether this amounted to \u201cadvertising.\u201d The court did not embrace either of the extreme views we have described above, but instead held that \u201c [advertising activity must be examined in the context of the overall universe of customers to whom a communication may be addressed. Where the audience may be small, but nonetheless comprises all or a significant number of a competitor\u2019s client base, the advertising activity requirement is met. The holding might be different where the target audience are customers of a large organization that markets to the general public or a significant portion of it. But, where the business is one with a small customer base and that base, or a significant part of it, is the target audience, the reach is extensive enough to constitute advertising injury.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>at p. 494; see also <em>Farmington Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Cyberlogic Technologies, supra, </em>996 F.Supp. 695, 700-702, 705 [in dicta, adopting similar definition and finding advertising where software manufacturer distributed disks to \u201cvirtually every potential customer\u201d in specialized market]; <em>Amway Distributors Benefits Ass\u2019n v. Federal Ins. </em>(W.D.Mich. 1997) 990 F.Supp. 936, 945 [noting advertising \u201ccomes in many forms and may differ in scope from business to business, depending on the product, the size of the company, the company\u2019s marketing system, or the size of the target market\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>The <em>Select Design </em>court gave three reasons for adopting the majority view and rejecting the view that mere \u201csolicitation\u201d could constitute \u201cadvertising.\u201d Primarily, the court did not find the federal court cases persuasive, noting even the <em>John Deere </em>court acknowledged that its interpretation \u201c \u2018seems to stretch the meaning of advertising.\u2019 \u201d In this regard, the <em>Select Design </em>court noted it was required to read the policy provisions \u201caccording to their plain, ordinary meaning\u201d and that the majority position did so. <em>(Select Design, supra, </em>674 A.2d at p. 802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The <em>Select Design </em>court\u2019s reading of the policy is consistent with California law, which requires us to interpret words in a policy \u201c \u2018in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 18-19.) In other words, we must view the relevant policy terms as a layperson would read them, not as an attorney or insurance expert might analyze them. <em>(Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 559; <em>Apple, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In this case, however, we need not determine whether a layperson would read the term \u201cadvertising\u201d as meaning \u201cthe widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large\u201d or would assign that term a meaning consistent with the broader definition the <em>Foxfire </em>court suggested. That is, we need not choose between the \u201cmajority\u201d and \u201cFoxfire\u201d definitions of \u201cadvertising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">This is because we reject the definition Peerless would have us adopt here: that solicitation of a <em>single </em>customer with a tailor-made product in the course of a competitive bidding process (as occurred in this case) amounts to \u201cadvertising.\u201d We reject this extreme view for two reasons. First, a layperson would not read the term \u201cadvertising\u201d as including solicitation of a single customer in the manner that occurred here. <em>(Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 559; <em>Apple, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Second, a definition that would stretch \u201cadvertising\u201d to include solicitation of a single customer as it occurred in this case is not within the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations.  As <em>Bank of the West </em>noted: \u201c[A] court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. In so doing, the court must interpret the language in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Indeed, the Supreme Court has already suggested that Peerless\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d is not within the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>expectations. In <em>Bank of the West </em>the high court stated that \u201cas a matter of common sense, an objectively reasonable insured would not expect \u2018advertising injury\u2019 coverage to extend as far as the <em>Bank </em>argues it should extend. Virtually every business that sells a product or service advertises, if only in the sense of making representations to potential customers. If no causal relationship were required between \u2018advertising activities\u2019 and \u2018advertising injuries,\u2019 then \u2018advertising injury\u2019 coverage, alone, would encompass most claims related to the insured\u2019s business. However, insureds generally expect to obtain such broad coverage, if at all, only by purchasing several forms of insurance, including coverage for \u2018errors and omissions liability,\u2019 \u2018directors and officers liability,\u2019 \u2018completed operations and products liability,\u2019 and/or other coverages available as part of a CGL policy.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1276-1277, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Similarly, \u201cas a matter of common sense\u201d a reasonable insured would not expect \u201cadvertising injury\u201d coverage to extend to solicitation of a <em>single </em>customer with a tailor-made product in the course of a competitive bidding process, as occurred in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We therefore hold that the term \u201cadvertising\u201d as used in the standard CGL policy does not include responding to a single customer in a competitive bidding process with a product tailor-made for that customer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, based on the facts established at summary judgment, it follows that the alleged injury was <em>not </em>\u201ccaused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [the insured\u2019s] goods, products or services . . . .\u201d Consequently, there was no potential for coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">D. Peerless\u2019s <em>\u201cInherency\u201d Theory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Perhaps because Peerless recognizes it defies common sense to argue that solicitation of a single customer with a tailor-made product in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>competitive bidding process amounts to \u201cadvertising,\u201d Peerless next argues it was entitled to a defense because an allegation of \u201cadvertising\u201d was \u201cinherent\u201d in Columbia\u2019s allegation of trade dress infringement under section 43 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125). We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Peerless contends that \u201cadvertising activity\u201d is an inherent element of a Lanham Act trade dress infringement claim, and, consequently, the mere allegation of such a claim is sufficient to show the offense was potentially \u201ccommitted in the course of advertising.\u201d Thus, Peerless contends the allegation of a trade dress infringement claim in the underlying action compelled AMICO to provide a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">We may accept, for the purpose of argument, that a plaintiff must prove that the infringing product was \u201cadvertised\u201d to a substantial number of persons in order to prevail on a trade dress infringement claim under the Lanham Act. (See <em>Dogloo, Inc. v. Northern Ins. Co. of New York </em>(C.D.Cal. 1995) 907 F.Supp. 1383, 1391 [\u201c \u2018[Trademark or tradename infringement . . . necessarily involves advertising, or use of the mark or name to identify the merchant\u2019s goods or services\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Duluth News-Tribune v. Mesabi Pub. Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1996) 84 F.3d 1093, 1096 [to show Lanham Act violation, plaintiff must prove use of dress created likelihood of confusion in an \u201cappreciable number of ordinary buyers\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">However, Peerless\u2019s argument, which is based solely on the complaint, ignores the extrinsic information AMICO had before it when it ultimately declined to provide a defense.  \u201c[E]vidence extrinsic to the underlying complaint can defeat as well as generate a defense duty . . . .\u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 291 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153].) In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 1, the Supreme Court stated: \u201c[W]here the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage, the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability. [Citations.] This is because the duty to defend, although broad, is not unlimited; it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">At the time it declined to provide a defense AMICO knew: (1) the underlying action arose out of a dispute between two lighting fixture manufacturers in a competitive bidding process to provide lighting fixtures to a <em>single </em>client at a single site; (2) the dispute concerned a \u201cmodified\u201d fixture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>that Peerless had created <em>solely </em>for the GM project; and (3) the modified fixture had not been \u201cadvertised\u201d to other customers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">It was only after learning this additional information that AMICO rejected the tender of defense. In its letter declining coverage, AMICO specifically stated it was denying coverage because the \u201c \u2018Advertising Injury\u2019 alleged did not occur in the course of advertising your goods, products or services as defined in your policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Peerless essentially acknowledges that Columbia may have been unable to show Peerless\u2019s alleged trade dress infringement created a likelihood of confusion in an \u201cappreciable number of ordinary buyers\u201d <em>(Duluth News-Tribune </em>v. <em>Mesabi Pub. Co., supra, </em>84 F.3d at p. 1096) because the infringing product was never advertised. Nevertheless, Peerless contends AMICO was required to raise this issue <em>as a defense in the underlying action, </em>not to defeat its duty to provide a defense in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">However, what Peerless fails to acknowledge is that, while some form of \u201cadvertising activity\u201d may be an element of a trade dress infringement claim, it is also a <em>condition </em>of coverage. With respect to \u201cadvertising injuries,\u201d the policy only provides coverage for offenses \u201ccommitted in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>advertising your goods, products, or services.\u201d Thus, once Peerless conclusively established that the allegedly infringing product was not \u201cadvertised\u201d within the meaning of the policy, AMICO had no duty to provide a defense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">As noted, although the duty to defend is broad, it is not unlimited. Ultimately, it is measured \u201cby the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy.\u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 19.) Here, the policy covered the risk of suit from certain offenses \u201ccommitted in the course of advertising . . . goods, products, or services.\u201d Once it became clear that the alleged offense was <em>not </em>\u201ccommitted in the course of advertising,\u201d there was no potential for coverage, and AMICO properly declined a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">E. <em>Peerless\u2019s Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As indicated, Peerless has appealed from the judgment to the extent it holds AMICO had no duty to indemnify it for the money it paid to Columbia to settle the underlying suit. Since we have concluded the papers submitted at the motion for summary judgment establish that AMICO had no duty to defend the suit, much less to indemnify Peerless, the issues Peerless raises regarding indemnification are moot. <em>(See Apple, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at pp. 824-825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">First, Peerless contends AMICO is liable to pay the underlying settlement \u201cas a result of its wrongful failure to defend.\u201d However, we have concluded the trial court erred in finding that AMICO had a duty to defend the suit as a matter of law, and thus the argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Second, Peerless contends AMICO is liable for the amount paid to settle the action because of \u201cits wrongful failure to settle the underlying action.\u201d Again, since AMICO had no duty to defend the underlying action, it had no duty to settle it, and the argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Finally, Peerless raises the same arguments we have already rejected above to argue that the trial court erred in concluding that AMICO had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>duty to indemnify Peerless. The additional evidentiary arguments it raises do not warrant extensive consideration. In arguing that the court \u201cerred in its analysis,\u201d Peerless is essentially arguing that the court misinterpreted and gave insufficient weight to certain evidence. This is an attempt to reargue the evidence and does not warrant detailed analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">F. <em>The Appeal of the Cost Award.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">As indicated, AMICO also filed a notice of appeal from the posttrial orders finding Peerless to be the prevailing party and awarding Peerless $9,156.87 in costs. In light of our decision reversing the summary judgment, we must also reverse the posttrial cost orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">The summary judgment filed February 6, 1997, and the postjudgment orders regarding costs filed on May 20, 1998, and August 18, 1998, are reversed. The judgment after trial filed on March 23, 1998, is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Costs on appeal are awarded to AMICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">McGuiness, P.

Advertising injury is now defined under the relevant portion of the ISO form as an injury arising from, inter alia, (1) \u201cmisappropriation of an advertising idea or style of doing business\u201d or (2) \u201cinfringement of copyright, title or slogan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AjM\">Most importantly for our purposes, both the pre- and post-1986 ISO forms require that the advertising injury occur \u201cin the course of . . . advertising.\u201d (See <em>Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Thus, <em>Bank of the West </em>applies to the post-1986 policy on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\"> Peerless does not argue that advertisement of the unmodified Envision fixture \u201ccaused\u201d the advertising injury in this case. The advertising injury, if any, was caused by the promotion of the modified fixture. Thus, we focus on whether the promotion of the modified product amounted to advertising activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\"> There is some dispute whether this in fact is the rule adopted by a majority of published opinions. (See <em>Farmington Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Cyberlogic Technologies </em>(E.D.Mich. 1998) 996 F.Supp. 695, 700-702.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\"> Peerless notes that several of the cases that have adopted the majority rule have done so in the context of construing exclusionary rather than coverage clauses. Since exclusionary clauses are generally interpreted narrowly, while coverage clauses are generally construed broadly, we take pains in this case to rely only on cases interpreting coverage clauses. (See <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Foxfire, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1993) 820 F.Supp. 489, 494.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\"> We note Peerless would not be entitled to coverage under the <em>Foxfire </em>analysis. Both Peerless and Columbia are large suppliers of architectural lighting fixtures with a national customer base. Thus, Peerless\u2019s solicitation of one of Columbia\u2019s customers\u2014even a large customer such as GM\u2014does not constitute solicitation of \u201call or a significant number of a competitor\u2019s client base.\u201d <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.2d at p. 494.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\"> Division Four of the Second District reached a similar conclusion in <em>Ziman </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1382 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 397]. There the court considered whether the insurer was obligated to defend an insured in a third party action for copyright infringement arising from the display of a copy of a painting in the lobby of a building the insureds owned. Even though the painting was hung in the lobby while the insureds were showing the building to commercial real estate brokers in an effort to lease offices there, the court concluded that these activities did not constitute \u201cadvertising\u201d under the terms of the policy. The court concluded the insured \u201ccould not reasonably have expected that the display of an unauthorized copy of a painting in the lobby of its building would come within advertising activities covered by their\u201d policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1389.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\"> We do not foreclose the possibility that, under some circumstances, solicitation of a single customer might constitute advertising. This might occur, for example, where a supplier prepares and sends fliers to many persons at a single large corporation to solicit business. However, we need not decide that issue in this case. Our holding is limited to the facts before us: offering a product to a single customer in the course of a competitive bidding process with the product specifically designed for that customer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> In its briefs, Peerless does not point to any evidence submitted at the motion for summary judgment that shows the modified fixture was marketed to any customer other than GM. However, in its respondent\u2019s brief, it points to evidence adduced <em>at the subsequent trial concerning indemnity, </em>which it claims shows the modified fixture was advertised more broadly. In particular, Peerless\u2019s CEO testified that, in addition to sending the modified fixture to the GM mock-up room, \u201cwe did have the product hung in Berkeley and people did see it in our mock-up room in Berkeley.\u201d In addition, the CEO claimed he sent out \u201csome catalog sheets\u201d \u201cto a couple of lighting consultants. Other than that, there was no print media advertising of that product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alk\">Obviously, since this evidence was not before the court when it rendered its decision on the summary judgment motion, it could not have created a triable issue of fact on this issue. Moreover, even taken at face value, we think this evidence is insufficient to show that the modified fixture was advertised. We have rejected the notion that showing a modified product to a <em>single </em>customer in the course of a competitive bidding process can amount to \u201cadvertising\" within the meaning of the policy. Even if we were to embrace the middle view\u2014that advertising occurs when an insured solicits all or a significant number of a competitor\u2019s client base\u2014the additional evidence adduced at trial is simply insufficient to show \u201cadvertising\u201d under that definition. <em>(Foxfire, supra, </em>820 F.Supp. at p. 494; <em>Farmington Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Cyberlogic Technologies, supra, </em>996 F.Supp. at pp. 700-702, 705.) Both Columbia and Peerless are very large lighting manufacturers with a national customer base.</p>\n<p id=\"AIy\">At oral argument, Peerless\u2019s counsel suggested there was evidence that the GM mock-up room was itself a forum for \u201cadvertising\" in the industry. Counsel suggests that other customers (not just GM) would come to the mock-up room to view lighting products. We have reviewed the evidence cited on this point (the declaration of Peerless\u2019s CEO) and find no evidence there to support the assertion that the GM mock-up room was an advertising forum for the industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\"> The California case Peerless relies on most heavily to develop its \u201cinherency\u201d theory <em>(Lebas, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 548) acknowledges that a mere allegation of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act is not sufficient to show the offense occurred \u201cin the course of [the insured\u2019s] advertising activities.\u201d <em>(Lebas, </em>at p. 558.) Rather, there the court \u201caccepted] as true\u201d the proposition that the alleged trademark infringement occurred in the course of the insured\u2019s advertising activities. The court noted the complaint expressly alleged that the insured had used the infringing trademark \u201cin advertisements of [its] products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 558, fn. 6.) This discussion would not have been necessary if the court believed the mere allegation of trademark infringement was sufficient to show that the offense occurred \u201cin the course of [the insured\u2019s] advertising activities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b817-14\"> The insurer did not file a cross-motion for summary judgment on the issue of the duty to defend, as it should have. (See <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 301.) Although we believe AMICO would have been entitled to have that motion granted, had it been made, we are without power to direct the trial court to grant a nonexistent motion. <em>(Sierra Craft, Inc. v. Magnum Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1254 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 681]; <em>Miracle Auto Center </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 818, 823 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 587] [\u201c[W]e cannot direct the trial court to grant Pacific\u2019s request for summary judgment, because real party in interest did not comply with the procedures in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c and file its own cross-motion.\u201d].) Consequently, we must remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
