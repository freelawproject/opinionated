He contends the judgment must be reversed due to prosecutorial misconduct. For reasons explained in this opinion, we find this contention well taken. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The evidence, briefly recounted in the light most favorable to the judgment, proved that on March 3, 1999, appellant was arrested for being under the influence of drugs. A search incident to arrest revealed two small rocks containing cocaine, weighing .10 of a gram, in appellant\u2019s right front pants pocket.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As he was being transported to the police station, appellant said, \u201cOfficers, if you squash that rock, I\u2019ll tell you where they\u2019re selling around here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The evidence of the facts of appellant\u2019s crime was presented through the testimony of one witness, Los Angeles Police Officer Scot Williams. The partner with whom he was working at the time of the arrest, Officer Tinsley, did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Appellant\u2019s defense was that Officer Williams was not credible. In opening statement, defense counsel stated: \u201cI expect that Officer Williams will come and testify that he detained Mr. Hall, that he felt that he was under the influence of a controlled substance, namely, cocaine, that his partner searched Mr. Williams and recovered cocaine from his pocket. [^] . . . [H] I am convinced that, at the end of the trial, after you have heard all of the evidence in this case, you will find that Mr. Hall was detained for no reason, that he was not under the influence of cocaine, and that he was arrested for no reason and searched for no reason, and that the only thing that Mr. Hall is guilty of in this case is having a bad attitude with L.A.P.D. officers. And that\u2019s not a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">During closing argument, defense counsel put the issue to the jury as follows: \u201cWe are in no way disputing that the item that the chemist . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>analyzed was in fact cocaine. That\u2019s not in dispute. I\u2019m sure whatever item she retrieved from the evidence locker that was booked by Officer Williams was in fact cocaine. The issue is where did that item come from? We are also not disputing that at some point Mr. Hall exited out of the Danmar Hotel. But everything that happened after that, ... is definitely in dispute.\u201d In the course of the argument defense counsel asked: \u201cWhere is the other witness? Corroboration is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. When you don\u2019t have corroboration and you have the testimony of an officer such as Officer Williams, who has already been deemed to be unreliable and untrustworthy based on his testimony, then you cannot be left with an abiding conviction. [ID \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [HI If [the prosecutor] didn\u2019t call Officer Tinsley, it must be because Officer Tinsley doesn\u2019t help his case. Officer Tinsley doesn\u2019t corroborate what Officer Williams is saying. So the fact he made a conscious decision not to call him should mean something to each of you.\u201d Later in her argument defense counsel reiterated: \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to present you with the weakest case possible when in fact he possibly had other evidence. Where is Officer Tinsley? Does he corroborate, or does he contradict?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor responded: \u201cIf Officer Tinsley had some kind of fantastic light to shed on this case to exonerate this defendant, you know that this attorney would have called Officer Tinsley.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the grounds that appellant had no burden of proof. The court overruled the objection on the grounds that defense counsel \u201copened the door,\u201d but affirmed the statement that the defense had no burden. The prosecutor continued his argument, stating: \u201cCounsel got up here and said where is Officer Tinsley, perhaps suggesting that we are hiding Officer Tinsley because he\u2019s going to reveal something some kind of incredible evidence to exonerate her client. And that\u2019s just not the case. You could have heard repetitive testimony from Officer Tinsley, basically telling you the same thing, that he was there and recovered the rock, and Williams was there and present for it. And if there was anything to his testimony, you would have heard from the defense.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor was arguing facts not in evidence. The court overruled the objection, explaining: \u201cHe\u2019s giving his opinion. ... He is merely responding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Appellant contends the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct in closing argument because he \u201cinvited the jury to speculate about evidence never presented at trial.\u201d He asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cessentially allowed the prosecutor to testify, unfairly supplying facts not in the record, and offering unsworn testimony not subject to cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Respondent counters that any error has been waived by the failure of trial counsel to seek a curative admonition. Respondent does not explain how the court might have been persuaded to give a curative admonition since it found the objection meritless.  The inherent impossibility of obtaining a curative admonition in such a situation has led to the rule that the failure to request the admonition does not forfeit the error. <em>(People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 820-821 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].) Therefore, we turn to the merits of appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Respondent contends the prosecutor\u2019s argument was \u201cproper during his rebuttal in response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.\u201d Respondent asserts that \u201cthe prosecutor was well within permissible bounds in telling the jury that in his opinion, Officer Tinsley\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative[.]\u201d Alternatively, respondent contends that if the argument was improper, there is no reasonable probability that the misconduct prejudiced appellant since the jury was instructed that statements made by attorneys are not evidence. Respondent adds that the statement could not have affected the outcome of the case \u201cgiven the strength of the evidence at trial,\u201d including appellant\u2019s offer to tell the officers who was selling cocaine and where, if they would \u201csquash the rock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">To the extent the prosecutor argued the defense could have called Officer Tinsley as a witness, his argument was proper. But the prosecutor went too far when he told the jury the absent witness\u2019s testimony would have been repetitive. The effect of this argument was to tell the jury that the witness, if called, would have testified exactly as Officer Williams did, in a manner favorable to the prosecution. This was misconduct. <em>(People v. Hill, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 800, 829.) And it was error for the court to overrule the objection to the. improper argument on the ground that the prosecutor was \u201cgiving his opinion.\u201d This was not a situation in which the prosecutor was drawing inferences from testimony heard by the jury. The prosecutor, in the guise of closing argument, told the jury what the testimony of an uncalled witness would have been, thus implying that he decided not to call Officer Tinsley as a witness after determining that his testimony would have been the same as and corroborative of Officer Williams\u2019s testimony. This tactic denied appellant his Sixth Amendment rights to confront and cross-examine an uncalled prosecution witness. Therefore, reversal is required unless we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the misconduct did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1083 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619]; <em>People v. Gaines </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 821, 825 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 188].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Respondent attempts to minimize the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument by arguing that \u201cit is not reasonably likely that the remark would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>or could have been misunderstood by a reasonable juror or construed or applied in an objectionable fashion.\u201d Respondent does not explain this assertion. We can conceive of no manner in which the prosecutor\u2019s representation could have been understood, construed or applied except for an objectionable purpose. This is especially true since the trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s prompt objection to die remark. A statement of supposed fact not in evidence is a highly prejudicial form of misconduct. As such, it is a frequent basis for reversal. The California Supreme Court has explained, in <em>People v. Hill, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 800, that such testimony, \u201c \u2018 \u201calthough worthless as a matter of law, can be \u2018dynamite\u2019 to the jury because of the special regard the jury has for the prosecutor, thereby effectively circumventing the rules of evidence.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We have reviewed the record carefully. But our review is confined to the cold pages of the transcript, denying us the opportunity to observe Officer Williams\u2019s demeanor while testifying. It is impossible to know whether the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument contributed to the jury\u2019s conclusion that the officer was credible. Whether judged under the <em>Chapman </em>harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]) or the <em>Watson </em>reasonable-probability-of-a-more-favorable-result standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243]), we cannot conclude the error was harmless. Therefore, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 15, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\"> A photograph of the cocaine was admitted into evidence. The photo also included \u201ca clear plastic ziplock baggy containing three small hand-rolled cigarettes resembling marijuana cigarettes.\u201d Officer Williams testified, without objection, that he and his partner instructed the chemist to test for \u201cboth cocaine and for marijuana.\u201d The chemist\u2019s report, admitted into evidence, stated that the cigarettes contained marijuana. Appellant was not charged with possession of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
