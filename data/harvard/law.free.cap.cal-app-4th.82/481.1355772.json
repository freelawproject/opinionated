J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">Doreen H. Y. Woo (appellant) appeals from an earnings withholding order for taxes. The underlying tax liability stems from delinquent sales taxes in the amount of $35,504.43 owed by James K. Ho, appellant\u2019s husband, to respondent State Board of Equalization. Appellant contends that a marital agreement she entered into with Ho transmuting the couple\u2019s community property to the separate property of each spouse precludes respondent from garnishing her wages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">In 1992, respondent determined that Ho owed taxes, interest and penalties in the amount of $37,419.90 which represented the unpaid sales taxes of the Monsoon Restaurant. In September 1996, Ho filed a complaint seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>refund of certain payments blade towards that tax liability. The trial court sustained respondent\u2019s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend and entered judgment against Ho. This court affirmed that judgment in an unpublished opinion filed on December <em>2, </em>1997, in <em>Ho v. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>A077815.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In July 1995, respondent notified appellant that it would seek an earnings withholding order against her to pay Ho\u2019s tax debt. On November 5, 1995, appellant and Ho entered into a marital agreement transmuting their future earnings to separate property. Appellant subsequently became employed by Wells Fargo Bank, earning approximately $500,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On July 27, 1999, respondent filed an application for an earnings withholding order for taxes. In support of the order, respondent argued that the marital agreement between appellant and Ho did not bar garnishment of her wages because the agreement was fraudulent and unenforceable under Family Code section 851 and Civil Code section 3439.04. Appellant contended that the marital agreement did not constitute a fraudulent transfer because she was not employed by Wells Fargo Bank at the time the agreement was executed and that her future earnings were a mere expectancy that could not be transferred. Following a hearing, the trial court entered an earnings withholding order for taxes directing Wells Fargo Bank to withhold and pay to respondent the sum of $3,000 per month from appellant\u2019s earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Civil Code section 3439.06, subdivision (d) provides that \u201c[a] transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset transferred.\u201d Relying on Civil Code section 3439.06, subdivision (d), appellant contends that the marital agreement did not constitute a fraudulent transfer of community property because Ho had no property interest in her potential future earnings. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, Ho had a present interest in appellant\u2019s future earnings at the time he executed the marital agreement. It is well settled that earnings of either the husband or the wife acquired during the marriage constitute community property. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 760; <em>Martin v. Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1900) 130 Cal. 285, 286 [62 P. 515]; see also 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Community Property, \u00a7 17, p. 387.) And, a spouse\u2019s respective interests \u201cin community property during continuance of the marriage relation are present, existing, and equal interests.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 751.) Ho\u2019s interest in appellant\u2019s earnings was thus not dependent on whether she was employed at the time she executed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Further, appellant\u2019s attempt to transmute the community property earnings to her separate property constituted a fraudulent transfer. Family Code section 851 provides that \u201c[a] transmutation is subject to the laws governing fraudulent transfers.\u201d Civil Code section 3439.04, subdivision (a) provides that a transfer is fraudulent as to a creditor if it is made \u201c[w]ith actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.\u201d Here, appellant does not dispute that the community estate was liable for Ho\u2019s tax debt. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 910 [\u201ccommunity estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage\u201d].) Nor does she dispute that she entered into the marital agreement after learning that respondent intended to garnish her wages. Given these facts, the trial court did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that there was no fraudulent transfer. Ho had a present interest in appellant\u2019s earnings at the time the agreement was executed. Appellant\u2019s attempt to transmute that interest to avoid Ho\u2019s tax debt constituted a fraudulent transfer in violation of Family Code section 851 and Civil Code section 3439.04, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Poch\u00e9, J., and Reardon, J., concurred</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 7, 2000, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
