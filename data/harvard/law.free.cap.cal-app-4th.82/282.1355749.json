Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u201cBecause we so abhor the involuntary separation of parent and child,\u201d wrote Justice Baxter for the court in <em>In re Kieshia E. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 68, 76 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 775, 859 P.2d 1290], \u201cthe state may disturb an existing parent-child relationship only for strong reasons and subject to careful procedures.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Not surprisingly then, California law requires that there be no lesser alternative before a child may be removed from the home of his or her parent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In this case, a social worker opined that a teenager should not be returned to her mother because both her parents apparently lacked a \u201cfull understanding\u201d of their 15-year-old daughter\u2019s adolescent \u201cissues.\u201d Excuse us\u2014but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>what parent <em>doesn\u2019t </em>that describe? A social worker\u2019s opinion that parents have not sufficiently internalized proper parenting skills is not substantial evidence to justify even a detriment finding (see <em>Blanca P. v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1738, 1751 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 687] [failure to internalize general parenting skills was insufficient evidence to support detriment finding at 18-month review]), much less removal under section 361. Because the trial court had no substantial evidence on which to predicate a finding of substantial danger to the daughter, we reverse the dispositional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">And then there is the incident involving a nose stud\u2014ironically acquired after detention\u2014to which we fear the trial court accorded rather exaggerated significance. That incident is explained in its proper context below (in pt. III.B., <em>post, </em>of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">n. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In late May 1999, then 15-year-old Jasmine was living with her mother, Daphne, in Tustin. Her father, Michael, lived in Fountain Valley. As a social worker\u2019s report would later note, both parents were employed, \u201claw-abiding citizens\u201d with no alcohol or drug dependencies and no prior encounters with the juvenile dependency system. Both parents explicitly shared the responsibility for rearing Jasmine, in terms of such things as curfew hours, when she could go out, and what sort of clothes she could wear.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On May 21, Daphne used a switch to discipline Jasmine for having invited a boy into the home in violation of house rules. Both parents considered the presence of a stranger in the home to be a serious, even \u201clife-threatening\u201d matter. Michael used a thin leather belt to strike Jasmine across the buttocks and on the upper back of the legs for the same incident. Daphne also used a switch two days later to discipline Jasmine for failing to wash the dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">These incidents left marks and prompted the county\u2019s social services agency to file a petition to declare Jasmine a dependent child and detain her at Orangewood Children\u2019s Home. Between the May 1999 detention and the commencement of the dispositional hearing in late August, Jasmine went from Orangewood to an unsatisfactory placement in a foster home, back to Orangewood, and then to two group homes. And she saw a therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">For their part, the parents also saw a therapist\u2014privately paid for\u2014and stipulated to jurisdiction based on a finding that they had \u201cphysically abused\u201d their daughter. They also each completed a parenting course.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The dispositional hearing consisted of the testimony of six witnesses: the parents\u2019 private therapist, Jasmine herself, the social worker, mom, dad, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Jasmine\u2019s therapist. Much of the record is preoccupied with household minutia: Jasmine must \u201cearn\u201d the ability to go out with her friends by getting good grades, but doesn\u2019t have to earn the right to watch television. She is expected to receive no \u201cC\u2019s\u201d on her report card, and no more than one or two \u201cB\u2019s.\u201d Her mother lets her shave her legs. Jasmine\u2019s mother does not allow her to wear red nail polish, and her father does not allow her to wear \u201csparkly\u201d nail polish. He thinks she should stick with pastels. Jasmine spends her weekends doing homework, and in her free time she goes swimming 15 days out of the month; she goes to school dances with her friends, basketball and football games, and she often goes to \u201cthe mall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The important facts are these: Jasmine\u2019s mother, Daphne, and father, Michael, both testified that they had changed their attitudes toward corporal punishment for teenagers and expressed remorse that their physical abuse of their daughter had led to the dependency. Jasmine\u2019s therapist testified that Jasmine had no anger toward, or \u201cfear\u201d of, either parent. Jasmine herself testified that she wanted to go back to either her mother\u2019s or her father\u2019s house. Jasmine believed that her mother had \u201clearned from this whole thing\u201d and didn\u2019t believe her mother would \u201chit [her] again.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also, however, testified that at various times she had been disciplined by Daphne \u201cin anger\u201d and had been \u201cslapped\u201d by her. The parent\u2019s therapist stated that Jasmine was in no \u201cdanger\u201d if she were returned to one of the parents, and noted that the parents had each expressed remorse and had the \u201cmotivation to change their former forms of discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The social worker, however, testified that she did not believe Jasmine should be returned because the \u201cparents seem to lack understanding of their responsibility and their roles in the incident that brought [Jasmine] to social service agency\u2019s attention.\u201d As support for her assertion of lack of understanding, she mentioned the \u201cmother\u2019s own statements\u201d that \u201cany time Jasmine adamantly defiles <em>[sic: </em>probably \u201cdefies\u201d] their rules then she is given corporal punishment,\u201d and the mother\u2019s belief that Jasmine \u201cwas endangering her life by allowing a stranger in their home.\u201d The social worker mentioned the father\u2019s statement that \u201cif he was going to spank her he should have started at an earlier age and not now\u201d as expressive of the view \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t admitting to maybe he had made a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The social worker further complained about the parents\u2019 \u201clack of cooperativeness and the hostility that\u2019s been presented to [her],\u201d and the fact the mother had written a note to Jasmine\u2019s physical education teacher after having used a switch on her to the effect that she had rashes. She followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that with the comment, to which we have alluded above, that the \u201cparent\u2019s don\u2019t have a full understanding of Jasmine\u2019s issues as a 15-year-old child and have really isolated her and protected her in that she is having difficulties dealing with adolescent issues.\u201d The social worker was also opposed to returning Jasmine to her father\u2019s home because of undisclosed \u201cdifficulties\u201d between her father and his wife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Jasmine\u2019s own therapist, having never talked to the parents, was \u201chesitant\u201d about making a recommendation as to whether Jasmine should be returned home. She did, however, say that she \u201cwould like to see some sessions\u201d prior to any return, so that the there would be \u201csome very clear and sane guidelines about what is expected of Jasmine. And also some clear idea about what\u2019s going to happen if she didn\u2019t comply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">During the hearing, the trial court itself asked some questions centering on the parents\u2019 philosophy of child rearing. The court asked the parents\u2019 therapist if she ever discussed their \u201cchild raising philosophy,\u201d to which the therapist replied that they \u201chave a certain amount of rigidity in terms of right and wrong,\u201d having themselves come \u201cfrom families where discipline was pretty rigid.\u201d A few moments later the court followed up with a question as to whether the therapist \u201cever actually suggested to the parents that you think maybe their philosophy is little too rigid.\u201d (The answer was yes, but the therapist also said that both parents were now \u201cmore open.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">At the end of the father\u2019s testimony the court also asked the father whether he \u201cever discussed with Jasmine spare the rod, spoil the child. Have you ever used those words with her?\u201d He replied that he didn\u2019t recall using the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Later, in oral argument at the end of the hearing, the trial court\u2014after first noting that the case was <em>not </em>about the parents being \u201csort of out of step\u201d and was \u201cstrictly a physical discipline case\u201d\u2014asked the county counsel, \u201cBut, how do we really kind of reconcile or fit in the parents\u2019 kind of family values and the way they would like to see their daughter raised even though we\u2019re living in 1999 in Orange County.\u201d To this county counsel replied, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cchild\u2019s more likely to act out\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s desperately wanting to be a teenager, [and] she\u2019s not allowed to be a teenager,\u201d and because \u201cshe may not be able to communicate with her parents she may do drastic things like have boys at the house\u201d and, ergo, because she would \u201cact out,\u201d the parents would become \u201cangry\u201d and that in turn could \u201clead to physical harm directly through her inappropriate behavior or through inappropriate discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The trial court decided to remove Jasmine from her mother\u2019s home, pointing to Jasmine\u2019s testimony that Daphne had disciplined her \u201cin anger,\u201d had on occasion slapped her daughter, and the fact of a discrepancy in testimony concerning the removal of a nose ring that Jasmine had acquired in foster care. The court specifically stated that the case was not about Daphne\u2019s \u201cfamily values\u201d and the values that Daphne was \u201cdetermined to instill in [her] daughter.\u201d The only reason the court gave for not returning Jasmine to her father, despite his counsel\u2019s having requested return to him, was that it \u201cwasn\u2019t convinced [he] was totally ready to put in practice what he learned in parenting.\u201d Daphne then filed this appeal from the dispositional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">A. <em>The Social Worker\u2019s Belief About the Parents\u2019 Internalization of Parenting Skills and the Parents\u2019 Attitudes Toward Social Service Intervention Were Insufficient to Support Removal Under Section 361</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The governing statute, section 361, subdivision (c), is clear and specific: Even though children may be dependents of the juvenile court, they shall not be removed from the home in which they are residing at the time of the petition unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a substantial danger to the child\u2019s physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being <em>and </em>there are no \u201creasonable means\u201d by which the child can be protected without removal. (See <em>In re James T. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 58, 66 [235 Cal.Rptr. 127] [noting clarity and specificity of predecessor version of \u00a7 361].) The statute embodies \u201can effort to shift the emphasis of the child dependency laws to maintaining children in their natural parent\u2019s homes where it was safe to do so.\u201d <em>(In re Jason L. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1216 [272 Cal.Rptr. 316]; see also <em>In re Paul E. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 996, 1005 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The case before us is remarkable for the clear and convincing evidence that it <em>was </em>safe to return Jasmine to either of her parent\u2019s homes. Both parents had forsworn corporal punishment of teenagers. Both expressed remorse for having used corporal punishment on Jasmine. Both had attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>parenting classes, and both had undergone therapy to improve their parenting skills. Jasmine had no fear of either. One therapist opined it was totally safe to return the child and the other simply had \u201cno recommendation\u201d (in a context where it was not at all clear that she her \u201chesitancy\u201d went to Jasmine\u2019s physical safety, as distinct from what was merely optimum). Jasmine herself wanted to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">And so, giving full deference to the trial court\u2019s implied findings under the venerable substantial evidence rule, we must ask ourselves: What was the evidence Jasmine could not be returned safely? Three strains of evidence were put forth by the social worker, each touching on beliefs and ideas. <em>None </em>constitute clear and convincing evidence of <em>substantial danger </em>to Jasmine\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The first is the subjective belief of the social worker that the parents \u201clack[ed] understanding of their responsibility and their roles in the incident that brought [Jasmine] to social service agency\u2019s attention.\u201d Such evidence is insufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a social worker\u2019s belief that parents had not sufficiently \u201cinternalized\u201d parenting skills were enough to constitute clear and convincing evidence of substantial danger, section 361 would be effectively rendered a nullity, as social workers would become the de facto highest power in determining whether parents have their children returned to them. (See <em>Blanca P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1751 [social worker beliefs about lack of parental internalization of parenting skills insufficient for detriment finding at 18-month review].) Such a conclusion flies in the face of the balance between family preservation and child well-being struck by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">As to parenting skills generally, the invasive minutia that fills too much of the record in this case\u2014the evidence about the nail polish, the trips to the mall, the rules about what sort of grades Daphne requires of Jasmine\u2014also cannot support the trial court\u2019s judgment. It is of no legal import whatsoever that two fairly strict, religiously oriented parents trying to rear a teenager in \u201c1999 Orange County\u201d may lack \u201cunderstanding\u201d of teenage \u201cissues.\u201d The inability of the parents to \u201cunderstand\u201d their teenage children is simply part of the human condition. Even the best intentioned parents, secular, religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>or otherwise, will fail to have a complete understanding of the fine nuances of teenage subculture in a postmodern industrial society.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The second strain is the \u201clack of cooperativeness and the hostility\u201d perceived by the social worker. The subtext here, of course, is that objectively measurable things like disavowing corporal punishment under oath can still be trumped by a parent\u2019s having <em>incorrect ideas </em>about social workers, government intervention in family life, and the whole juvenile justice \u201csystem\u201d that do not sit well with social workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Even though the trial court \u201cre-emphasized\u201d that the case was not about Daphne\u2019s family values, preoccupation with the parents\u2019 philosophy of child rearing runs through the record, particularly exemplified in the court\u2019s questioning about \u201cspare the rod, spoil the child,\u201d the references to Daphne and Michael\u2019s philosophical \u201crigidity\u201d in child rearing, and the trial court\u2019s wondering out loud \u201chow do we really kind of reconcile or fit in the parents\u2019 kind of family values and the way they would like to see their daughter raised even though we\u2019re living in 1999 in Orange County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The answer, of course, is that \u201cwe\u201d\u2014presumably meaning the courts applying the juvenile dependency laws enacted by the Legislature\u2014do not <em>need </em>to reconcile one couple\u2019s family values with the predominate mores of 1999 Orange County. Daphne and Michael are entitled to their own philosophical \u201crigidity.\u201d The dependency statutes contain no prohibition against being overprotective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Finally, the social worker also gave as a supporting reason for removal Daphne\u2019s belief in the appropriateness of corporal punishment under certain circumstances (such as defiance of her rules). Again, this was no basis on which to predicate the removal order. A parental belief in the validity of corporal punishment is most assuredly <em>not </em>clear and convincing evidence of substantial danger. There is a right of privacy under the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 1), and the bias of the controlling statute is on family preservation, <em>not </em>removal. (See <em>In re Jason L., supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1216.) From Spock to Dobson, in a free' society there will necessarily be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>wide range of views about corporal punishment and child rearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, hitting with a belt and a switch crossed the line over into abuse. On the other hand the parents here could not be required, on pain of losing their child, to accept the social worker\u2019s view that corporal punishment is <em>never </em>appropriate, even if <em>some </em>forms of corporal punishment never are.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">B. <em>The Nose Ring and Prior Discipline Also Furnish No Support for Jasmine\u2019s Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Jasmine\u2019s detention had an unintended indirect effect. It served, during a brief and uneasy placement in a foster home, as the occasion for Jasmine to have her nose pierced and acquire a nose stud. Prior to the dispositional hearing, during a visit with Jasmine, Daphne removed the stud with Jasmine\u2019s acquiescence, if not at her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We will begin by noting an obvious irony, the details of which, unfortunately, were not developed in the record: What in the world is going on when a 15-year is removed from her family, put into supposedly \u201cprotective\u201d custody, and the first thing that happens is that she gets a nose stud? And who gave the parental consent that should have been obtained before any body piercing was done? (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 652, subd. (a) [\u201cIt shall be an infraction for any person to perform . . . body piercing upon a person under the age of 18 years, unless the body piercing is performed in the presence of, or as directed by a notarized writing by, the person\u2019s parent or guardian.\u201d].) We trust the social services agency had no hand in Jasmine\u2019s initial acquisition of the nose stud.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The trial court was more interested in how the stud got removed. From county counsel\u2019s description of the incident, one would think that Jasmine acquired a nose ring which Daphne \u201cripped\u201d out.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is a distortion of the record. It was a <em>stud, </em>not a <em>ring, </em>and Jasmine testified that Daphne <em>tried </em>to take it out <em>gently, </em>but simply didn\u2019t succeed. It \u201cfelt\u201d like it was being ripped out.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Daphne herself testified that she \u201cgrabbed the prong and this part and pulled it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>While the two versions are not inconsistent (in both, Jasmine and her mother agreed that Jasmine acquiesced to having her mother remove the nose stud), it still must be recognized that Daphne was probably too rough in removing the nose stud. Even so, the discrepancy is not <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence of substantial danger. It is, rather, understandable parental irritation with the fact that the removal of a teenager had resulted in the direct undermining of a family rule. Again, it must be recognized that the dependency statutes are a series of structured procedures and substantive rules intended to balance the protection of children and family preservation, not to impose the values, let alone the aesthetics, of \u201c1999 Orange County\u201d on any particular family. If Daphne and Michael want to take a stand against currently fashionable self-mutilation, there is nothing in the dependency statutes to prevent them. There is no evidence that the removal was against Jasmine\u2019s will\u2014it appears that she was somewhat ashamed herself of having acquired the nose stud and so readily accepted Daphne\u2019s demand that it be removed\u2014only that the removal was done, perhaps, too roughly. That is not clear and convincing evidence of any danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">As to being disciplined at times \u201cin anger,\u201d again, the evidence is not substantial. The mere fact that a parent is angry when he or she disciplines a child is not enough to show substantial danger. Not every parent can affect the mien of Mister Rogers when disciplining a child. Discipline is usually associated with some anger; often the anger itself comes from the parent trying to be protective. And as for the slapping, it is enough that the uncontroverted testimony was that both Daphne and Michael had forsaken corporal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">C. <em>There Was Absolutely No Basis Not to Return Jasmine to Her Father</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Finally, the question of why the trial court did not place Jasmine with Michael cries out to be addressed, even though the matter is, strictly speaking, dicta. Michael has, after all, not filed an appeal of his own. His counsel at trial specifically requested that Jasmine be placed with Michael. Jasmine herself said that while she wanted to go back to either parent, her preference would have been her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The only direct negative evidence in the record bearing on whether Jasmine could be placed with Michael is the social worker\u2019s opinion concerning Michael\u2019s marital troubles, and that opinion appears to have based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>on something wholly unfounded, namely a statement by Michael\u2019s wife to the social worker in which there are some very ugly imputations of racial bias against trial courts generally\u2014namely, that they will rubber-stamp false allegations of domestic violence made by a White female wife against a Black male husband.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Suffice to say, such an opinion could in no way serve as substantial evidence under section 361. And beyond that there is only the trial court\u2019s subjective perception that Michael wasn\u2019t \u201ctotally ready to put into practice what he learned in parenting,\u201d which is in the same legal category as inadequate \u201cinternalization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Section 361 requires that there be \u201cno reasonable means\u201d of preventing removal. The evidence on conjoint therapy alluded to the standards of an ideal world; essentially, things would be <em>better </em>if the conjoint therapy were completed before return. But there was no substantial reason given as to why conjoint therapy was <em>required </em>before return. And that too made the order subject to reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">To confirm our conclusion, we are informed by Jasmine\u2019s counsel on appeal that subsequent to the appealed order, she was indeed placed with Michael for a 60-day \u201cvisit.\u201d The lack of danger under section 361 is thus self-evident. (See <em>In re Damonte A. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 894, 899 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 369].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The dispositional order is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In light of Jasmine\u2019s subsequent (and apparently successful) placement with Michael, our decision here is without prejudice to any party on remand as whether Jasmine should be placed with Daphne <em>or </em>Michael. <em>That </em>question should be considered de novo by the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Rylaarsdam, J., and O\u2019Leary, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\"> Section 361, subdivision (c)(1) of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo dependent child shall be taken from the physical custody of his or her parents . . . with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated unless the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence of any of the following: [\u00b6] (1) There is a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor or would be if the minor were returned home, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor\u2019s physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor\u2019s parents\u2019 or guardians\u2019 physical custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH3\">All statutory references in this opinion are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.
