We conclude that an agreement between the parties to grant appellant paternity rights to a child conceived by artificial insemination is binding, and may be enforced to the extent of an action for unjust enrichment. We therefore reverse the judgment in part and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Statement of Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Following dismissal of his action for declaratory relief to establish his paternity and custody rights to a daughter born to respondent, appellant filed causes of action for breach of contract against respondent and professional negligence against defendant Pacific Fertility Medical Center (hereafter Pacific Fertility) in the present case. Appellant\u2019s first amended complaint alleged that he and respondent \u201ccohabitated\u201d between 1993 and 1998, but \u201cwere never married.\u201d Appellant had suffered from testicular cancer which had left him sterile. In 1995 he and respondent consulted with Pacific Fertility for the purpose of conceiving a child by artificial insemination.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">On July 15, 1995, appellant and respondent entered into a written contract, drafted by Pacific Fertility and entitled \u201cConsent for Artificial Insemination\u201d (hereafter the agreement), to \u201ccreate a child by the use of artificial insemination . . . through the . . . use of the sperm of an anonymous donor.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, which specifies that it is \u201cgoverned by the Laws of the State of California,\u201d appellant and respondent as \u201cmale partner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>female partner\u201d respectively, acknowledged \u201cour obligation to care for and support and educate and otherwise treat and consider any child bom as the result of such artificial insemination in all respects as though it were our natural child.\u201d They further promised to \u201cnever allege in any proceeding that the child or children, is other than legitimate, and the male partner and the female partner acknowledge that the child shall be the lawful child of both the mother and the male partner, and that neither of them shall assert a contrary position in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d According to the first amended complaint, Pacific Fertility advised appellant that \u201che would be treated by the law as the acknowledged and legal parent of the child to be bom through the artificial insemination procedure, and that he need take no further action to have full rights of visitation, custody and other parental rights as to the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">On April 22, 1996, respondent gave birth to a daughter. Appellant was named as the \u201cFather of Child\u201d on the birth certificate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the birth, appellant cared for her on a daily basis and \u201cheld out the child as his natural child,\u201d but he and respondent never married, and appellant did not adopt the child. In March of 1998, respondent \u201cterminated her cohabitation and relationship\u201d with appellant, and moved with the child from California to Wisconsin. Respondent thereafter denied appellant any custody or visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In April of 1998, respondent commenced a declaratory relief action in Wisconsin to terminate any rights of appellant to paternity, custody or visitation. Appellant subsequently filed a complaint in California to establish his paternity and custody rights to the child. The trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s action in California,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based upon a finding that he lacked standing to \u201csue for custody and visitation.\u201d After the instant breach of contract action against respondent by appellant was also dismissed, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by finding that he has no right to enforce the agreement. He claims that the agreement \u201cwith his domestic partner\u201d to \u201ctogether raise\u201d a child is not illegal or otherwise unenforceable. He also maintains that he \u201cshould have been permitted to amend his complaint\u201d to allege causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>distress and unjust enrichment. Respondent contends that appellant\u2019s action is barred by the res judicata effect of the prior judgment, and the agreement is unenforceable for public policy reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Our review is governed by well-settled principles. \u201cWhen reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, this court must treat the demurrer as admitting all properly pleaded facts, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We must read the complaint as a whole and give it a reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>(Koch v. Rodlin Enterprises </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1591, 1595 [273 Cal.Rptr. 438].) \u201cRegardless of the label attached to the cause of action, we must examine the complaint\u2019s factual allegations to determine whether they state a cause of action on any available legal theory. Reversible error is committed if the facts alleged show entitlement to relief under any possible legal theory.\u201d <em>(Shaolian </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 268, 271 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 702].) And, \u201cIf the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action, or if it is reasonably possible that the plaintiffs can cure the complaint by amendment, the trial court should not sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d <em>(Koch v. Rodlin Enterprises, supra, </em>at p. 1595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">I. <em>The Res Judicata Effect of the Judgment in the Declaratory Relief Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Respondent insists that dismissal of appellant\u2019s prior complaint to establish parental relationship precludes the present action under principles of res judicata. Appellant\u2019s prior action was brought in the family court under the Uniform Parentage Act (UPA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7600 et seq.), to determine whether a parent and child relationship exists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant claimed he was the child\u2019s parent, and requested custody and visitation rights. Following a hearing, the trial court found that it lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction over child custody and visitation with respect to [the child],\u201d and appellant \u201clacks standing to sue for custody and visitation of the child who was conceived of artificial insemination . . . with another man\u2019s sperm.\u201d No appeal was taken from the prior judgment, and it became final.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201cparties to a prior proceeding are precluded from relitigating issues determined in the prior proceeding. (See 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Witkin, Cal. Procedure [(3d.ed. 1985)] Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 253-254.)\u201d <em>(Bob Baker Enterprises, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 678, 686 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].) A prior judgment \u201c ' . . \u201coperates as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Lesher </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 874, 880 [299 P.2d 865].)\u201d <em>(Sabek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Engelhard Corp. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 992, 997 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 882].) The doctrine \u201crests upon the ground that the party to be affected, or some other with whom he is in privity, has litigated, or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction, and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent. Public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.\u201d <em>(Panos v. Great Western Packing Co. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 636, 637 [134 P.2d 242]; see also <em>Citizens for Open Access etc. Tide, Inc. v. Seadrift Assn. </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1053, 1065 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u201c \u2018A prior determination by a tribunal will be given collateral estoppel effect when (1) the issue is identical to that decided in a former proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated and (3) necessarily decided; (4) the doctrine is asserted against a party to the former action or one who was in privity with such a party; and (5) the former decision <em>is </em>final and was made on the merits.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McCutchen v. City of Montclair </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 95], italics added; see also <em>Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 128, 151 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 642]; <em>Lyons v. Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1015 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 174].) \u201cThe party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.\u201d <em>(Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223, 2 A.L.R.5th 995]; <em>Townsel v. San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Bd. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 940, 951 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 231].) Even if these threshold requirements are established, res judicata will not be applied \u201cif injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation not be foreclosed.\u201d <em>(Consumers Lobby Against Monopolies v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 891, 902 [160 Cal.Rptr. 124, 603 P.2d 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Having before us a prior final judgment on the merits in an action between the same parties, we focus on the identity-of-issues requirement to resolve respondent\u2019s claim of res judicata. Unless the issue or cause of action in the two actions is identical, the first judgment does not stand as a bar to the second suit. <em>(Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 954 [160 Cal.Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58]; <em>Vary v. Forrest </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1506, 1511 [247 Cal.Rptr. 873]; <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commissioners </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 532, 537 [197 Cal.Rptr. 111].) \u201c \u2018If \u201canything is left to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>conjecture as to what was necessarily involved and decided\u201d there can be no collateral estoppel [citations] .... \u201c[I]t must appear . . . that the precise question was raised and determined in the former suit. . . .\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Southwell v. Mallery, Stern &amp; Warford </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 140, 144 [239 Cal.Rptr. 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">To define a cause of action, California follows the primary right theory, which conceives of a cause of action as \u201c \u2018. . . 1) a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, 2) a corresponding primary duty devolving upon the defendant, and 3) a delict or wrong done by the defendant which consists in a breach of such primary right and duty. [Citation.] Thus, two actions constitute a single cause of action if they both affect the same primary right. . . . [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Acu\u00f1a </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 639, 648 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 388].) \u201c[T]here is only a single cause of action for the invasion of one primary right,\u201d even if multiple theories of recovery are asserted. <em>(Agarwal v. Johnson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 954; see also <em>Zimmerman v. Stotter </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1067, 1073 [207 Cal.Rptr. 108].) We must compare the two actions, looking at the rights which are sought to be vindicated and the harm for which redress is claimed. <em>(Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Stotter, supra, </em>at p. 1073; <em>City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 143, 153 [149 Cal.Rptr. 320].) \u201cReference must be made to the pleadings and proof in each case.\u201d <em>(Wimsatt v. Beverly Hitts Weight etc. Internat., Inc. (1995) </em>32 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1517 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 612].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The present action for breach of written contract does not assert the same primary right as appellant\u2019s prior action in family law court to establish paternity. Appellant previously sought to establish that he was the legal father of the child, with the attendant rights of custody and visitation. The trial court found that he lacked standing to bring the paternity action. Resolution of the enforceability of the contract was unnecessary to the court\u2019s judgment in the family law dispute. <em>(In re Marriage of Rabkin </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1082-1083 [225 Cal.Rptr. 219].) Here, the question of jurisdiction or standing is not before us. Appellant has sued respondent for damages for her failure to abide by the written contract between them, not for any rights to the child. Neither the issue of his standing to request paternity nor his paternity rights must necessarily be adjudicated to resolve appellant\u2019s claim for damages for respondent\u2019s breach of contract. Thus, the prior judgment does not bar the current action. <em>(County of Santa Clara v. Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 873, 879, fn. 7 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 53, 838 P.2d 781]; <em>Townsel v. San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Bd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 951-952; <em>Wimsatt v. Beverly Hills Weight etc. Internat., Inc., supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1524.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">II. <em>The Validity of the Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Proceeding to the merits of the appeal, we must first assess the validity and enforceability of the agreement. Appellant maintains that contracts between domestic partners for custody and support of children are binding between the parties, at least to the extent of an action for damages. Respondent argues that agreements between a parent and a \u201cnon-parent\u201d such as appellant are \u201cillegal and unenforceable because they are in an area entirely preempted by statutory mechanisms for creating or establishing parenthood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Generally courts will not assist in enforcing an agreement when the object of the agreement is either illegal or against public policy. <em>(Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon &amp; Frank v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 119, 138 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 949 P.2d 1].) This rule is applied not to secure justice between the parties but to promote a societal recognition that certain types of transactions should be discouraged. <em>(Moran v. Harris </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 913, 918 [182 Cal.Rptr. 519, 28 A.L.R.4th 655].) \u201cA contract may be illegal or in contravention of public policy either in its apparent substance and purpose [citation] or in the consideration upon which it is based [citations].\u201d <em>(Kallen v. Delug </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 940, 949 [203 Cal.Rptr. 879].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u201c \u2018A promise or other term of an agreement is unenforceable on grounds of public policy if legislation provides that it is unenforceable or the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bovard </em>v. <em>American Horse Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 832, 840 [247 Cal.Rptr. 340], quoting from Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 178(1).) \u201cWhether a contract is illegal or contrary to public policy is a question of law to be determined from the circumstances of each particular case.\u201d <em>(Jackson v. Rogers &amp; Wells </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 336, 349-350 [258 Cal.Rptr. 454].) \u201cBefore labeling a contract as being contrary to public policy, courts must carefully inquire into the nature of the conduct, the extent of public harm which may be involved, and the moral quality of the conduct of the parties in light of the prevailing standards of the community.\u201d <em>(Moran v. Harris, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.3d at p. 920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u201cThe question whether a contract violates public policy necessarily involves a degree of subjectivity. Therefore, \u2018. . . courts have been cautious in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>blithely applying public policy reasons to nullify otherwise enforceable contracts. This concern has been graphically articulated by the California Supreme Court as follows: \u201cIt has been well said that public policy is an unruly horse, astride of which you are carried into unknown and uncertain paths, . . . While contracts opposed to morality or law should not be allowed to show themselves in courts of justice, yet public policy requires and encourages the making of contracts by competent parties upon all valid and lawful considerations, and courts so recognizing have allowed parties the widest latitude in this regard; and, unless it is entirely plain that a contract is violative of sound public policy, a court will never so declare. \u2018The power of the courts to declare a contract void for being in contravention of sound public policy is a very delicate and undefined power, and, like the power to declare a statute unconstitutional, should be exercised only in cases free from doubt.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018No court ought to refuse its aid to enforce a contract on doubtful and uncertain grounds. The burden is on the defendant to show that its enforcement would be in violation of the settled public policy of this state, or injurious to the morals of its people.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d at pp. 838-839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Thus, despite the res judicata effect of the prior judgment, we cannot turn a blind eye to appellant\u2019s status and rights with regard to the child to properly assess the public policy considerations surrounding his agreement with respondent. We commence our inquiry with recognition that appellant does not qualify as either a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d father of the child under the UPA, which governs California law. <em>(Nancy S. v. Michele G. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 831, 836 [279 Cal.Rptr. 212].)  \u201c \u2018The UPA provides a comprehensive scheme for judicial determination of paternity, and was intended to rationalize procedure, to eliminate constitutional infirmities in then existing state law, and to improve state systems of support enforcement.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Adoption of Michael H. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1043, 1050 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 898 P.2d 891, 61 A.L.R.5th 769].) \u201cUnder the UPA, the \u2018parent and child relationship\u2019 is defined as \u2018the legal relationship existing between a child and the child\u2019s <em>natural </em>or adoptive parents .... The term includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Barkaloff v. Woodward </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 393, 399 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 167].) The term \u201cparent\u201d in the UPA was \u201cintended to refer to a person upon whom that status has been legally conferred\u2014that is, a natural or adoptive parent.\u201d <em>(In re Jodi B. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1322, 1328 [278 Cal.Rptr. 242].) The definition of parent encompasses \u201c \u2018. . . the natural mother and father of a child bom of their marriage, an adoptive father or mother, a natural mother of an illegitimate child, and, under some circumstances, a father of an illegitimate child if the status of father has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>been judicially conferred upon him.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Sarah C. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 964, 972 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 414].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u201cIn essence, therefore, our statutory scheme creates three classes of parents: mothers, fathers who are presumed fathers, and fathers who are not presumed fathers.\u201d <em>(Adoption of Michael H., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1051.)  Appellant is not the biological father of the child nor did he adopt her. The concept of \u201c \u2018legally conferred\u2019 status\u201d of a father is set forth in section 7611, \u201cwhich provides when a man will be regarded as a child\u2019s \u2018presumed father.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Sarah C., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 972.) Under section 7611, subdivision (d) \u201ca man who has neither legally married nor attempted to legally marry the mother of his child cannot become a presumed father unless he <em>both </em>\u2018receives the child into his home <em>and </em>openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Adoption of Michael H., supra, </em>at p. 1051; see also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 111, 117 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 797]; <em>In re Tanis H. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1228 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 380]; <em>In re Spencer W. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1647, 1652 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 524].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The law thus \u201cpermits the adoption of illegitimate children by single persons . . . .\u201d <em>(Lavell v. Adoption Institute </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 557, 560-561 [8 Cal.Rptr. 367].) \u201cUnder this statutory provision, the natural father of an illegitimate child may legitimate his offspring by publicly acknowledging the child as his own, receiving it into his family (with the consent of his wife if he is married), and otherwise treating it as if it were legitimate.\u201d <em>(In re Richard M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 783, 792-793 [122 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>531, 537 P.2d 363].) The statute provides \u201cfor the adoption by the father of an otherwise illegitimate child. \u2018The father of an illegitimate child, by publicly acknowledging it as his own, receiving it as such, with the consent of his wife, if he is married, into his family, and otherwise treating it as if it were a legitimate child, thereby adopts it as such; and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth. . . <em>(Rodriguez v. Rodriguez </em>(N.D.Cal. 1971) 329 F.Supp. 597, 599, quoting Civ. Code, former \u00a7 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">While appellant has alleged in his complaint the elements of reception of the child into his home and open acknowledgement of her as his daughter, he nevertheless cannot become a \u201cpresumed father\u201d under section 7611, subdivision (d), absent any \u201cbiological link\u201d to her. <em>(In re Baby Girl M. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 65, 74 [207 Cal.Rptr. 309, 688 P.2d 918].) One of the essential elements of the statute is \u201cpaternity\u201d of the child. <em>(In re Richard M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 793.) Section 7611, subdivision (d) is designed \u201cto serve the function of settling questions of biological parenthood.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Moschetta </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1226 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 893].) Without any biological, natural, or genetic connection with the child, the statutory presumption of paternity is unavailable to appellant. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Where, as in the case before us, the child has been conceived through \u201cheterologous artificial insemination,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the donor is anonymous, indeed the child \u201cdoes not have a \u2018natural father,\u2019 as that term is commonly used.\u201d <em>(People v. Sorensen, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 284.) In that situation, the term \u201cfather\u201d \u201ccannot be limited to the biologic or natural father as those terms are generally understood. The determinative factor is whether the legal relationship of father and child exists.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cSince there is no \u2018natural father,\u2019 we can only look for a <em>lawful father.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Thus, in <em>People v. Sorensen, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 280, our Supreme Court held that a man may be found criminally liable for failing to pay for the support of a child born to his wife during the marriage as a result of artificial insemination using sperm from an anonymous donor. The high court emphasized the role of the husband in causing the birth, even though he had no biological connection to the child: \u201c[A] reasonable man who . . . actively participates and consents to his wife\u2019s artificial insemination in the hope that a child will be produced whom they will treat as their own, knows that such behavior carries with it the legal responsibilities of fatherhood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>criminal responsibility for nonsupport. One who consents to the production of a child cannot create a temporary relation to be assumed and disclaimed at will, but the arrangement must be of such character as to impose an obligation of supporting those for whose existence he is directly responsible.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 285.) The court added that the husband was \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the \u201cexistence\u201d of the child and without his \u201cactive participation and consent the child would not have been procreated.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u201cThe <em>Sorensen </em>definition of \u2018father\u2019 in a criminal proceeding is supported by a multitude of civil cases. In <em>Louis </em>v. <em>Louis </em>[(1970)] 7 Cal.App.3d 851, 853 [86 Cal.Rptr. 834], the court said: \u2018The husband is the <em>legal </em>father even though biologically the fact may be otherwise. [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(People v. Thompson </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 193, 201 [152 Cal.Rptr. 478].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Section 7613 provides specific statutory support for the proposition that a husband may be deemed a father under the UPA in the case of artificial insemination of his wife. <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1417; <em>Sherwyn v. Department of Social Services </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 52, 56 [218 Cal.Rptr. 778].) In the words of the statute: \u201cIf, under the supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon and with the consent of her husband, a wife is inseminated artificially with semen donated by a man not her husband, the husband is treated in law as if he were the natural father of a child thereby conceived.\u201d (\u00a77613, subd. (a).) Under subdivision (b) of section 7613, the donor of the semen is \u201ctreated in law as if he were not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>natural father of a child thereby conceived.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he husband\u2019s written consent is sufficient to establish legal paternity under section 7613, subdivision (a).\u201d <em>(Alexandria S. v. Pacific Fertility Medical Center, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 110, 126 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 23].) \u201cIndeed, the establishment of fatherhood and the consequent duty to support when a husband consents to the artificial insemination of his wife is one of the well-established rules in family law.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>at p. 1418, fn. omitted.) Legal paternity under the statute is established with written consent. <em>(Alexandria S. v. Pacific Fertility Medical Center, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 124, 126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Appellant, however, was not respondent\u2019s husband, and so does not fall precisely within the scope and protections of section 7613. (See <em>Jhordan C. v. Mary K., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 395.) Nevertheless, we are persuaded that his status has <em>the </em>elements of those of a lawful father under the decision in <em>Sorensen </em>by virtue of his written consent to the artificial insemination of respondent and voluntary consequent assumption of fatherhood duties. (See <em>In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1421; <em>Alexandria S. </em>v. <em>Pacific Fertility Medical Center, Inc., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 125, fn. 4.) Indeed, the UPA expresses a legislative preference for the extension of parent and child relationship equally to married and unmarried parties. The UPA was enacted \u201cto eliminate the legal distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Calvert </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 84, 88 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 494, 851 P.2d 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vega, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 710.) It \u201cwas plainly intended to establish and promote the rights of putative fathers, and to remove obstacles to the maintenance of parental relations for the benefit of \u2018illegitimate\u2019 children.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1021, 1025 [199 Cal.Rptr. 231].) According to section 7602: \u201cThe parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent, regardless of the marital status of the parents.\u201d The law \u201ccontemplates the establishment of lawful fatherhood in a situation where an <em>intended father </em>has no biological relationship to a child who is procreated as a result of the father\u2019s (as well as the mother\u2019s) <em>consent </em>to a medical procedure.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>at p. 1421, first italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We are also cognizant of the principle that \u201cParents have a right to contract with each other as to the custody and control of their offspring, and to stipulate away their respective parental rights. Such contracts are binding upon them.\u201d <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 186, 193 [278 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>441]; see also <em>Denham v. Martina </em>(1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 312, 319 [29 Cal.Rptr. 377].) Of course, \u201cinasmuch as the children\u2019s welfare is the factor of paramount concern, the children are not bound by the contract, and the law vests in the court power to provide for the custody and control of minor children. No such contract may, insofar as the children are concerned, abridge the power of the court in appropriate proceedings to provide for the support of the children by their parents or for their custody.\u201d <em>(Puckett v. Puckett </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 833, 839 [136 P.2d 1]; see also <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 942, 947 [126 Cal.Rptr. 805, 544 P.2d 941]; <em>In re Marriage of Goodarzirad </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1020, 1026-1027 [230 Cal.Rptr. 203].) \u201c[S]uch contracts, while not void or illegal, are not binding on a court . . . .\u201d <em>(Adoption of Matthew B. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1239, 1259 [284 Cal.Rptr. 18].) \u201cBut as between the parents, themselves, a promise by one parent that the other may have the custody and control of their child is legal and is a sufficient consideration to support an agreement on the part of the parent in whose favor the promise is made.\u201d <em>(Tiffany &amp; Co. v. Spreckels </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 778, 791 [262 P. 742]; see also <em>Puckett v. Puckett, supra, </em>at pp. 839-840; <em>Potts v.

Millard </em>(1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 249, 253 [227 P.2d 477].) Only those \u201c \u2018[agreements and stipulations compromising the parents\u2019 statutory child support obligation or purporting to divest the family court of jurisdiction over child support orders are <em>void </em>as against public policy. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Lusby </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 459, 469 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 263].)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We discern nothing in the agreement between appellant and respondent that so offends public policy as to require us to find it illegal or invalid. To the contrary, recognizing the validity of appellant\u2019s contractual promise to \u201ccare for and support and educate\u201d the child as though it was his \u201cnatural child\u201d serves rather than contravenes the compelling public policies of family law to legitimate children, provide for their support, foster the best interests of the child, and promote familial responsibility. <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1418; <em>In re Marriage of Ryan </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 841, 848 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 580].) Much like the surrogacy contract at issue in <em>Johnson v. Calvert, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pages 95-97, the agreement between appellant and respondent is not inconsistent with public policy, and serves as a proper expression of the intent of the parties from which to ascertain their rights and obligations, particularly where paternity is not denied or remains ambiguous under the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See also <em>In re Marriage of Moschetta, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 1231; <em>McIntyre v. Crouch </em>(1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>98 Or.App. 462 [780 P.2d 239, 244-245, 83 A.L.R.4th 277]; <em>In Interest of R.C. </em>(Colo. 1989) 775 P.2d 27, 34-35 [in which an artificial insemination agreement between an \u201cunmarried recipient\u201d and a \u201cknown donor\u201d to treat the latter as the father of the conceived child, and the subsequent conduct of the donor, were found \u201crelevant to preserving the donor\u2019s parental rights\u201d despite a statute\u2014similar to \u00a7 7613\u2014precluding the assertion of parental rights and obligations by donors]; <em>C. M. v. C. C. </em>(1977) 152 N.J. Super. 160, 167-168 [377 A.2d 821, 825] [where the court concluded that the semen donor\u2019s \u201cconsent and active participation\u201d in the artificial insemination procedure evinced an intent \u201cto assume the responsibilities of parenthood.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Thus, while the agreement at issue here cannot grant parental rights to appellant that the law otherwise expressly denies to him, infringe upon the authority of the court to provide for the appropriate custody and support of the child, or abridge the rights of the child, as between appellant and respondent it is binding. <em>(In re Ruby T. </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1201, 1204 [227 Cal.Rptr. 8]; <em>Potts v. Superior Court, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.2d at p. 694.) The recognized power of the court to act to protect the best interests of the child does not relieve respondent of the obligations into which she has entered with appellant. <em>(Potts v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 694.) This is particularly so, in our view, where appellant stands in a position at least tantamount to a lawful father in an artificial insemination case, who, although without biological relationship to the child, has given permission along with the mother for procreation of the child, and voluntarily-assumed and exercised the responsibilities of fatherhood. (See <em>People v. Sorensen, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 285; <em>In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1418.) His paternity status under the circumstances is neither directly prohibited by legislation nor, we conclude, does it infringe upon the prevailing standards of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Finally, we consider the nature and effect of respondent\u2019s conduct, in assessing the validity of the agreement. In addition to her express promise to honor appellant\u2019s parental rights and to assert no \u201ccontrary position\u201d in any legal proceeding, respondent had the benefit of appellant\u2019s contractual obligation to care for and support the child. Under principles of equitable estoppel, we cannot now countenance her repudiation of appellant\u2019s rights under the agreement. <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.) We would rule no differently if the roles were reversed and appellant were the party now seeking to renounce his contractual obligations to support the child. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sorensen, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 285; <em>Clevenger v. Clevenger </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 658, 662 [11 Cal.Rptr. 707, 90 A.L.R.2d 569]; <em>Karin T. </em>v. <em>Michael T. </em>(1985) 127 Misc.2d 14 [484 N.Y.S.2d 780, 782-783].<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>) After expressly accepting appellant\u2019s status as lawful father, conceiving the child with the intention that appellant would act as her father, and accepting his financial assistance with the support of the child, respondent must be precluded from \u201cturning around and disclaiming any responsibility\u201d under the agreement. <em>(In re Marriage of Buzzanca, supra, </em>at p. 1420; see also <em>Adoption of Matthew B., supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 1273.) \u201cOne who consents to the production of a child cannot create a temporary relation to be assumed and disclaimed at will . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Sorensen, supra, </em>at p. 285.) As our high court long ago observed when discussing the binding effect of child custody and support agreements: \u201cTo hold that one competent to contract, who, upon a subject matter good in law, and for a sufficient consideration, enters into written stipulations and convenants of the most solemn character with another, should, the next moment, without pretense of fraud, mistake, or undue influence, or other cause than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>mere change of mind, be permitted to absolutely withdraw from, and set at naught, such obligations, without regard to the desire of the other contracting party, would, to say the least, be a strong departure in the law of contracts.\u201d <em>(Sargent </em>v. <em>Sargent </em>(1895) 106 Cal. 541, 545 [39 P. 931].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Respondent seeks to deny enforcement of the agreement by reliance on cases that have denied custody or visitation rights to a \u201clesbian partner who is not a biological or adoptive parent\u201d of a child conceived by artificial insemination. (See <em>Guardianship of Z.C.W. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 524, 527 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 48]; <em>West v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 302, 309 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 160]; <em>Nancy S. v.

The courts have refused to recognize or expand the doctrines of \u201cde facto parenthood,\u201d equitable estoppel, in loco parentis, guardianship, or the contractual right to parenthood, to grant custody rights to a nonparent who was otherwise excluded by law from paternity rights. (See also <em>In re Marriage of Lewis &amp; Goetz </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 514, 519-520 [250 Cal.Rptr. 30], in which the court rejected theories of \u201cequitable parent\u201d or \u201cequitable adoption\u201d to deny a stepparent joint custody on dissolution.) But we are not deciding custody or visitation rights in this appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In contrast to the cases cited by respondent, appellant\u2019s action is for breach of a written agreement, and seeks damages, not custody of the child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the agreement upon which appellant\u2019s breach of contract action for damages is based is not in its entirety illegal or unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">III. <em>The Remedies Available to Appellant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We next focus upon the remedies available to appellant. Respondent maintains that appellant\u2019s allegations of intrusion upon his right to develop \u201can intimate relationship with a child\u201d have been \u201cdisallowed on public policy grounds\u201d in California. Appellant insists that he is entitled to compensation under the contract for deprivation of the \u201ccompanionship\u201d of the child, or at least must be permitted to amend the complaint to allege causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and unjust enrichment. We define the issue as whether, even if the contract is not illegal or invalid, appellant is entitled to the damages he seeks for the loss of his relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Appellant\u2019s claim in his breach of contract action of \u201cenduring mental and emotional suffering and distress from the loss of the relationship, custody, visitation, and parental rights as to the minor child\u201d immediately runs afoul of the rule that \u201cdamage's for mental suffering and emotional distress are generally not compensable in contract actions.\u201d <em>(Applied Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 516 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454]; see also <em>Cates Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Talbot Partners </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 28, 43-44 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 980 P.2d 407].) \u201c \u2018Recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Erlich </em>v. <em>Menezes </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 558-559 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 886, 981 P.2d 978].) An exception is created where the contract \u201c \u2018by its nature put[s] [the defendant] on notice that a breach would result in emotional and mental suffering by [plaintiff]. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Selden v. Dinner </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 166, 172-173 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 153].) \u201cCases permitting recovery for emotional distress typically involve mental anguish stemming from more personal undertakings the traumatic results of which were unavoidable,\u201d or \u201ccontracts in which emotional concerns are the essence of the contract.\u201d <em>(Erlich </em>v. <em>Menezes, supra, </em>at p. 559.)  While emotional harm to appellant from denial of his parental rights may have been entirely foreseeable, we have doubts that it falls within the exception to the rule barring recovery of damages for emotional distress in contract actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In any event, we conclude that recovery of damages by appellant in tort for emotional distress based upon the loss of his relationship with the child is not permitted. \u201c[I]n some instances the courts have concluded that allowing a remedy in tort would be contrary to public policy.\u201d <em>(Dale v. Dale </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1172, 1184 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 513].) We are persuaded that the present case is one of those instances, as in <em>Nagy v. Nagy </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262 [258 Cal.Rptr. 787], where the plaintiff \u201cpled causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraud\u201d based upon misrepresentations by his former wife that a child born to her during the marriage was fathered by him. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1267.) The plaintiff alleged that he \u201c \u2018developed] a very close and intimate relationship with [the child] and did and performed all acts that a father would towards a son,\u2019 \u201d which caused him mental anguish and emotional distress when he subsequently learned that the child was not his. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1266.) The court concluded that providing a remedy for the wrong suffered by the plaintiff \u201cwould be contrary to public policy. [Citation.] In our opinion, allowing a nonbiological parent to recover damages for developing a close relationship with a child misrepresented to be his and performing parental acts is not a \u2018damage\u2019 which should be compensable under the law. Although we do not condone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>respondent\u2019s misrepresentations, they are similar to a \u2018betrayal\u2019 for which the law wisely should not provide a remedy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1269-1270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Similarly, in <em>Richard P. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1089 [249 Cal.Rptr. 246], it was alleged that the defendant Richard falsely represented that the plaintiff Gerald was the father of a child born to Gerald\u2019s wife, with the intent to deceive the plaintiff and induce him to support the child. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1092.) In fact, Richard was the natural father of the child. The court found that \u201cany wrong which has occurred as a result of Richard\u2019s actions is not one which can be redressed in a tort action. We do not doubt that this lawsuit emanated from an unhappy situation in which the real parties in interest suffered grief. We feel, however, that the innocent children here may suffer significant harm from having their family involved in litigation such as this and that this is exactly the type of lawsuit which, if allowed to proceed, might result in more social damage than will occur if the courts decline to intervene. \u2018We do not believe that the law should provide a basis for such interfamilial warfare.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1094.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court was also persuaded to deny tort compensation to the plaintiff by the lack of any physical injuries to him and the \u201cpotential for harm to the innocent children.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1095.) The court did not, however, \u201cforeclose the possibility that a man in Gerald\u2019s position might be able to recover actual out of pocket costs incurred in supporting another man\u2019s children on an equitable theory for reimbursement, such as unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1096, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Here, appellant has alleged breach of a promise to recognize his paternity of the child. \u201cLosses of parental or filial consortium are not actionable. \u2018[T]he inadequacy of monetary damages to make whole the loss suffered, considered in light of the social cost of paying such awards, constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>strong reason for refusing to recognize the asserted claim.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Foy v. Greenblott </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1, 7 [190 Cal.Rptr. 84].) In <em>Borer v. American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 441, 453 [138 Cal.Rptr. 302, 563 P.2d 858], our high court refused to recognize extension of liability to deprivation of the parent-child relationship upon consideration of the strong public policy reasons \u201cwhich bear on this question, including the inadequacy of monetary compensation to alleviate that tragedy, the difficulty of measuring damages, and the danger of imposing extended and disproportionate liability . . . .\u201d (See also <em>Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 644, 664-665 [257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814].) To the extent appellant seeks damages for the loss of his paternity rights, his action implicates an intensely private familial association in which the courts are reluctant to intervene. <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Atkinson, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 19.) The court is also poorly equipped to assess and compensate appellant with damages for the emotional harm he suffered due to the loss of his relationship with the child. As the court declared in <em>Nagy </em>v. <em>Nagy, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at page 1269: \u201c \u2018To attempt to correct such wrongs or give relief from their effects \u201cmay do more social damage than if the law leaves them alone.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d We thus conclude that appellant cannot recover damages under a breach of contract theory for any loss of the bargained-for relationship with the child, and is not entitled to amend his pleading to state a cause of action for infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We nevertheless conclude that appellant is not left entirely without a remedy. The preclusion of his claim for general damages for emotional harm on public policy grounds does not operate to deny him recovery of special damages for readily ascertainable economic loss under an unjust enrichment theory. (See <em>Turpin v.

A contract unenforceable in its entirety for public policy reasons may still be enforced in part under compelling circumstances where the lawful and unlawful portions of the agreement may be separated. <em>(Birbrower, Montalbano, Con-don &amp; Frank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 138; <em>Keene v.

Illegal contracts \u201cwill be enforced under certain circumstances, such as when only a part of the consideration given for the contract involves illegality. In other words, notwithstanding an illegal consideration, courts may sever the illegal portion of the contract from the rest of the agreement. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201c \u2018When the transaction is of such a nature that the good part of the consideration can be separated from that which is bad, the Courts will make the distinction, for the . . . law . . .

[Citations.] If the court is unable to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful parts of the agreement, \u2018the illegality taints the entire contract, and the entire transaction is illegal and unenforceable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon &amp; Frank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">While the courts generally will not enforce an illegal contract or one against public policy, \u201c \u2018the rule is not an inflexible one to be applied in its fullest rigor under any and all circumstances,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[a] wide range of exceptions has been recognized\u2019 \u201d to enforce contracts \u201cto \u2018avoid unjust enrichment to a defendant and a disproportionately harsh penalty upon the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Asdourian v.

In each case, the extent of enforceability and the type of remedy granted depend upon a variety of factors, including the nature of the illegality, the policies to be served by enforcing or denying enforcement of the agreement, and the relative culpability and equities of the parties. <em>(Adoption of Matthew B., supra, </em>at p. 1256; <em>Joe A.

An award of compensation to appellant for his economic loss does not contravene those public policy considerations. The public cannot be protected by refusing limited enforcement of the agreement to the extent of unjust enrichment. Appellant will neither obtain custody of the child in contravention of the law, nor be improperly compensated for the loss of his relationship with her. (Cf. <em>Nagy v. Nagy, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1269-1270.) Further, to grant him reimbursement for any amounts he may have expended in performance of the agreement does not now intrude adversely upon private familial matters, and is easily severable from the emotional harm he must be denied on public policy grounds. Custody of the child is no longer at issue, and the social harm to the family, long since disintegrated, from the litigation confined to an unjust enrichment action will not be so egregious as to outweigh appellant\u2019s right to at least a partial remedy. Nor does an award of unjust enrichment involve the court in compensation that evades proper assessment. An award limited to'unjust enrichment is a relatively mechanical and undemanding calculation. <em>(Turpin v. Sortini, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 238.) \u201c \u2018While the law cannot remove the heartache or undo the harm, it can afford some reasonable measure of compensation towards alleviating the financial burdens.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 239 quoting <em>Gleitman </em>v. <em>Cosgrove </em>(1967) 49 N.J. 22 [227 A.2d 689, 703, 22 A.L.R.3d 1411].)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Although requiring respondent to disgorge any monetary benefit she received at appellant\u2019s expense under the agreement may indirectly compromise the funds presently available to her for support, we think the equities of the case and public policy considerations still fall in appellant\u2019s favor. According to the complaint, it is respondent who entered into a contract which obligated appellant to support and care for the child and then, in breach of her promise, denied his rights under the contract when it suited her to do so. Respondent will be unjustly enriched at appellant\u2019s expense if a remedy is entirely denied to him. In contrast, at least according to the complaint, appellant relied on the agreement and representations by Pacific Fertility that his legal rights were protected. He then performed his obligations pursuant to the agreement until prevented from doing so by respondent. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer since the complaint states facts disclosing some right to relief. <em>(Longshore </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>County of Ventura </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 14, 22 [157 Cal.Rptr. 706, 598 P.2d 866].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We add that the measure of damages to which appellant is entitled for unjust enrichment \u201cis synonymous with restitution.\u201d <em>(Dinosaur Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1314.)  Restitution is defined \u201cas restoration of the status quo by the awarding of an \u2018amount which would put plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been if no contract had been made and restores to plaintiff value of what he parted with in performing the contract.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(People v.

Equitable considerations govern the award of unjust enrichment, however. <em>(First Nationwide Savings v. Perry, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1663.)  Thus, a \u201cparty seeking restitution \u2018must generally return any benefit\u2019 that it has received.
