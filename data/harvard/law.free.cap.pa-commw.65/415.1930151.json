(employer), from December 2, 1974 up until the time of his death on November 22,1977. The claimant filed a fatal claim petition and, following hearings, the referee granted benefits. In doing so, he relied upon the testimony of Dr. J. D. Silverman, the claimant\u2019s medical witness, that \u201cthe most significant cause\u201d of the decedent\u2019s death was silicosis with resulting complications of chronic asthmatic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema, which resulted from the decedent\u2019s employment in the pottery and steel industries. Because of the claimant\u2019s subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>remarriage, the award was limited to 71 weeks. The Board affirmed the referee and this appeal followed..</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Where the party with the burden of proof has prevailed below, our scope of review, and that of the Board, when it takes no additional evidence, is limited to determining whether or not there has been an error of law or a violation of constitutional rights and whether or not the referee\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Custom Concrete Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>52 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. <em>331, </em>415 A.2d 989 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The employer asserts that the Board erred as a matter of law in affirming the referee\u2019s finding that silicosis with accompanying pulmonary complications was \u201cthe most significant cause\u201d of death. It argues (1) that the characterization of silicosis as \u201cthe most significant cause \u2019 \u2019 does not satisfy the requirement of \u201cdeath resulting from\u201d an occupational disease set forth in Section 301(c) (2) of The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <em>as amended, </em>77 P.S. \u00a7411(2), and (2) that the award of benefits was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">To prevail in a fatal claim petition which alleges that death resulted from an occupational disease, the claimant must satisfy Section 301(c) (2) of the Act by demonstrating by competent medical evidence that death <em>resulted from </em>an occupational disease as opposed to a showing that the disease was merely a contributing factor in causing the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Mc-Closkey v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>58 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 29, 427 A.2d 288 (1981); <em>Hauck v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>47 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 554, 408 A.2d 585 (1979). The fact that the decedent had been receiving disability benefits up until the time of his death is not of moment here because the mere presence of an occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>'.disease'-does not, per se, satisfy the causation burden that must be met by a claimant who seeks to successfully -establish that <em>death </em>resulted from an occupa\u2022'ti\u00f3n'\u00e1l disease. <em>Elliott v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>57 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 70, 425 A.2d 885 (1981); <em>Manuel v. N. L. Industries, </em>50 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 279, 412 A.2d 912 (1980). .</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The claimant\u2019s .medical witness testified that silicosis, with resulting pulmonary complications, was \u25a0\u201c'the'most significant cause of his death.\u201d The physician, by his use of the superlative degree in distinguishing' silicosis from other potential causes of death, indicated that' he considered silicosis to be the primary \u2022'cause of death,'' The words, \u201cmoat significant cause\u201d imply direct causality as- opposed to pronouncements \u25a0such as \u201cmajor contributing factor,\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>\u201ccontributed in a substantial or significant manner,\u201d <em>Refosco v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>57 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 74, 425 A.2d 887 (1981), or \u201ccontributed to and accelerated,\u201d <em>Manuel, </em>all of which have \u2022'been:-found to be insufficient to meet the direct causality' requirement of Section 301(c)(2). We belieye that the characterization made by the material witness here, however, did employ language sufficiently strong in import to meet-the standard of .causation set forth in Section 301(c) (2) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The employer\u2019s second argument that the findings were not -supported by substantial evidence must also fail. The employer contends that, the referee disregarded the substantial competent evidence provided by the employer\u2019s medical witness and by the hospital records, and 'relied instead upon the incompetent evidence of the claimant\u2019s medical .witness. Dr. Silver-man\u2019s testimony is alleged to be incompetent because some earlier hospital records and test results had not been available to him for consideration when forrnu-lating his medical'opinion,'but he ba;sed his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>upon his examination of the decedent at an earlier date<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and upon the hospital records from the decedent\u2019s crucial final hospital admittance in November 1977. He did, therefore, review the hospital records relevant to this claim and his failure to review all extant records and test results in arriving at his opinion does not, therefore, render his testimony incompetent but goes only to the weight and credibility to be accorded it, and such determinations are within the province of the referee. <em>Ricciardi v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>34 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 316, 383 A.2d 571 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The employer further asserts that \u201d the referee failed to give proper consideration to the November 1977 hospital records which indicated that death was due to cardiac failure and to the testimony of both parties\u2019 medical witnesses to the same effect. It is the function of the referee to resolve conflicts in medical testimony and in so doing, he may accept or reject the testimony of any witness, including a medical witness, in whole or in part, <em>Bowes v. Inter-Community Action, Inc., </em>49 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 612, 411 A.2d 1279 (1980), and neither the Board nor this Court may disturb a referee\u2019s resolution of conflicting medical testimony which is supported by substantial competent evidence. <em>Katz v. Evening Bulletin, </em>485 Pa. 536, 403 A.2d 518 (1979). Dr. Silverman testified that upon examining the decedent, he had made a diagnosis of occupationally-related chronic asthmatic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema resulting from \u201cpneumoconiosis, namely silicosis.\u201d Upon cross-examination Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Silverman, testified that, based upon his examination of the decedent and upon the November 1977 hospital records, it was his opinion that the decedent\u2019s pulmonary condition was \u201cthe most significant cause\u201d of death. Dr. Silverman did not, as the employer alleges, testify that he considered cardiac failure to be the cause of death, but rather merely stated that the final diagnosis as noted in the hospital records was \u201ccongestive heart failure and enlarged heart with underlying \u2022chronic lung disease.\u2019\u2019' The proper test for the legal sufficiency of expert medical testimony on the issue of causation is that the expert must testify that in his professional opinion the result in question came from the cause alleged. <em>Ricciardi. </em>Dr. Silverman\u2019s testimony, upon which the referee relied, that in his opinion occupationally-related silicosis was \u201cthe most significant cause\u201d of the decedent\u2019s death, was, therefore, sufficient to meet the standard of proof required under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We will affirm the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u2022 And Now, this 24th day of March, 1982, the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board in the above-captioned matter is affirmed;</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">And It Is Further Ordered That judgment be entered in favor of the claimant, Gladys Marie Morris, and against Crucible Steel, Inc., self-insured, at the rate of $106.00 per week beginning on November 22, 1977 and continuing through April 2, 1979, inclusive, a period of 71 weeks in the total amount of $7,526.00 ..with interest at the rate-of.ten percentum per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">All payment of compensation shall cease on April 3,1979, the date of the claimant\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Crucible Steel, Inc., self-insured, is directed to reimburse the claimant for funeral expenses in the amount of $750.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Crucible Steel, Inc., self-insured, is further directed to reimburse the claimant\u2019s counsel for the following reasonable costs incurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Dr. J.

The writer was not a member of the panels which decided <em>Elliott v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>57 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 70, 425 A.2d 885 (1981), <em>Refosco v. Workmen\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Compensation Appeal Board, </em>57 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 74, 425 A.2d 887 (1981); <em>Vargo v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>57 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 77, 425 A.2d 888 (1981) holding that Section 301(c) (2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act must be interpreted as allowing benefits for death resulting from occupational disease only where the disease \u201cin and of itself\u201d could have resulted in the death and that death to which occupational disease is only a contributing cause or death as the result of the aggravation of a preexisting condition by occupational disease are not compensable. Being a member of this panel provides the occasion for the writer to note his disagreement with the holdings just described and for expressing the opinion that Section 301(c)(2), being identical in wording to Section 301(c)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be identically interpreted, that is, as providing compensation where occupational disease has contributed to or, by aggravation of the preexisting conditions, caused disability or death. We also note that the holding in this case is a departure from the rule of the cases cited because the phrase \u201cthe most significant cause\u201d clearly implies the presence of other causes and therefore the decedent\u2019s silicosis was \u2018simply a \u201ccontributing\u201d cause of his death.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-5\">Judge Williams, Jr., joins.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> Section 301(c)(1) says that death \u201cresulting from injury,\u201d is compensable and has been consistently construed to include cases where the injury contributed to death or was the cause of death through aggravation of a preexisting condition; Section 301(c)(2) says that compensation shall be granted for death \u201cresulting from\u201d occupational disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
