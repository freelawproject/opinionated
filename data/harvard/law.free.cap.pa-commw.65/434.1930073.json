Wayne Austin appeals from a Westmoreland County Common Pleas Court order imposing fines for Pennsylvania Vehicle .Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Code) violations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Austin was hauling \u00e1 bulldozer on a tractor-trailer combination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Westmoreland County. The loaded vehicle, weighing 143,450 pounds, exceeded the maximum legal weight limit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Austin had secured and was carrying special hauling permits issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Penn-DOT), he did not comply with certain general permit conditions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contained in the regulations promulgated under the Code. 67 Pa. .Code 51.10(8)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided;that a special permit was <em>automatically invalidated </em>by the violation of any condition specified in the regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Austin was cited for violating Code sections 4901<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (a \u201cnon-weight\u201d violation, <em>i.e., </em>not displaying the required placards and red flags, and operating without pilot cars), and 4941<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (a \u201cweight\u201d violation, <em>i.e., </em>operating a combination whose weight exceeded the authorized maximum), notwithstanding that the vehicle\u2019s weight was within the 145,000-pound limitation allowed by the special permit. The district justice fined Austin $50.00 plus costs for the \u201cnon-weight\u201d violation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and $20,400.00 plus costs for the \u201cweight\u201d violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The common pleas court affirmed, but reduced the \u201cweight\u201d violation fine to $20,250.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Austin claims that the provision, automatically invalidating a special permit for non-compliance with the regulatory conditions, is without PennDOT\u2019s statutory authority. Section 4961(a)(2) of the Code<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> authorizes PennDOT to allow, by special permit, the operation of a combination carrying a nondivisible load <em>(e.g., </em>a bulldozer) which exceeds the legal maximum weight. Section 4962(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> authorizes PennDOT to prescribe conditions of operation\" under the permit as it <em>\u201cshall deem necessary </em>to protect the safety of highway users, to promote the efficient movement of traffic or to protect the highways.\u201d Under this au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>th.ari.ty, PennDOT duly promulgated the automatic invalidation regulation, hence it has the force of law. <em>See Newport Homes, Inc. v. Department of Transportation, </em>17 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 317, 326, 332 A.2d 568, 574 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Austin also contends that, since he posted bond for the special permit,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> any fine imposed for operating the combination in excess of the prescribed weight is duplicative. He argues that the posted security entitled him to drive the overweight vehicle without fear of sanctions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The purpose of the Code\u2019s overweight provisions is to protect the Commonwealth\u2019s highways from damage and to insure the safety of those using the highways. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>409 Pa. 521, 525, 187 A.2d 267, 270 (1963). The bond was required in the event that the permitted vehicle were to cause damage. The security\u2019s posting was not, as Austin claims, a release from criminal liability under the Vehicle Code. Austin was prosecuted for violating Code Sections 4901(a) and 4941(a), neither of which requires r.oad damage to be proved, hence it is irrelevant that security was posted. Austin would have been insulated from this liability if he simply had complied with the special permit conditions. A party seeking the protection of a special permit must bring himself within the terms of the permit, which Austin had failed to do. <em>Commonwealth v. Curley, </em>189 Pa. Superior Ct. 506, 509, 151 A.2d 656, 658 (1959),</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We also cannot agree with Austin\u2019s claim that the lower court was without original jurisdiction to decide this case on the basis that an initial administrative review by PennDOT was required. 67 Pa. Code \u00a71515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>clearly stated that any regulation\u2019s violation would invalidate the permit and constitute grounds for prosecution. Jurisdiction over Austin was initiated under Pa. R. Crim. P. 51(A)(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Original jurisdiction of this matter lies with the District Justice under 42 Pa. C. S. \u00a71515(a)(l).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An appeal to the common pleas court by trial <em>de novo </em>then was conducted pursuant to 42 Pa. C. S. \u00a7932<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Pa. R. Crim. P. 67(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, a court of competent jurisdiction exercised .its power to entertain prosecution under the Yehiele Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The Westmoreland County Common Pleas Court order No. 1270 C \u00cd980, dated December 1, 1980, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-7\">Judge Pauladino did not participate in the decision in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> 75 Pa. c. s. \u00a7101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> 75 Pa.

Section 4961(a)(2) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C. S. \u00a74961 (a) (2). This authority is expressed in the disjunctive and I do not believe that non-weight related violations concerning the use of pilot cars and oversize load signs are sufficient to justify the inordinate fines for exceeding weight restrictions which have been imposed in this ease. Here, the appellant had obtained a valid weight permit and it seems to me to be an abuse of discretion for PennDOT to invalidate that permit on factors related only to the size of the vehicle. I would therefore reverse the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
