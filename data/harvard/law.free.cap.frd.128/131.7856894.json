Defendant United Airlines, Inc. (United) has presented a cross-motion; it seeks to centralize actions in the Northern District of Illinois. Several responding parties also suggest centralization in either the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Northern District of Ohio, Northern District of California or Central District of California. No responding party opposes centralization under Section 1407. The only dispute among the parties concerns selection of the appropriate transferee forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">On the basis of papers filed and the hearing held, the Panel finds that these actions involve common questions of fact and that centralization under Section 1407 in the Northern District of Illinois will best serve the convenience of parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. All actions share numerous questions of fact concerning the cause or causes of the July 19th air disaster. Centralization under Section 1407 is thus necessary in order to eliminate duplicative discovery, prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings, and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">We are persuaded that the Northern District of Illinois is the appropriate transferee forum. We note that this district is conveniently located for many parties and witnesses; that relevant documents can likely be found within this district at United\u2019s headquarters; and that numerous related actions are pending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Illinois state court. Our transfer to the Northern District of Illinois could facilitate coordination among the federal and Illinois state court actions. <em>See Manual for Complex Litigation, Second, </em>\u00a7 31.3 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, the actions listed on the following Schedule A and pending in districts other than the Northern District of Illinois be, and the same hereby are, transferred to the Northern District of Illinois and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Suzanne B. Conlon for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the actions pending in that district and listed on Schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">SCHEDULE A</p>\n<p id=\"AIV\">Central District of California</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\"><em>Deborah McKelvey v.
