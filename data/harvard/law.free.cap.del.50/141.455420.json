The Delaware Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board dismissed her petition and she has appealed to this Court in accordance with the provisions of 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2349.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Defendant employer has moved to dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction by this Court because the accident did not take place in any County of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">While the Delaware Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of this State presumably includes accidents to employees whose duties take them temporarily out of the State, 19 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2349 provides that the award of the Board shall be final unless within 10 days \u201c* * \u201d either party appeals to the Superior Court for the county in which the injury occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\"> It is plain that the Legislature, whether or not by oversight,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has failed to provide an appeal in the case of an accident to a Delaware employee occurring in some other State. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Frank Desiderio Sons, Inc., v. Blunt, </em>1933,167 <em>A. </em>29,11 <em>N. J.

Meantime, there can be no review of such cases except by <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
