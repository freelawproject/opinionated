The verdict of the jury was in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $7,500. In announcing the verdict, the foreman of the jury volunteered the information that the verdict was being awarded as compensatory damages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the criminal conversation count. Upon inquiry by the court regarding the form of the verdict, the foreman stated that the jury found for the defendant on the alienation count. This was all confirmed by a polling of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Analysis of the jury\u2019s verdict, in the light of the extraordinary information tendered by it, indicates that the jury concluded that the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s wife had committed adultery on the one occasion charged but that the defendant was not responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s loss of the affections of his wife. The verdict also indicates the jury\u2019s conclusion that the sum of $7,500 is proper compensation to a husband for an act of adultery with his wife notwithstanding the conclusion that the adulterer did not alienate the wife\u2019s affections.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">At pre-trial conference, I ruled that the jury was not to have knowledge (1) that the Family Court had found the defendant guilty of adultery with the plaintiff\u2019s wife, or (2) that the plaintiff had obtained a divorce decree in this Court on the ground of his wife\u2019s adultery with the defendant. This ruling was based upon the proposition that such evidence would not be admissible because the adultery found in the other proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was the very issue to be decided by the jury under the criminal conversation count in this case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">During the trial, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cMr. Errigo: We haven\u2019t covered the relationship as existed between this man and his wife. We have covered the relationship that existed between this man\u2019s wife and this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cThe Court: Will that be repetitious, Mr. Errigo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">\u201cMr. Errigo: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">\u201cMr. Theisen: It has already been asked. He asked was there any change in their feelings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">\u201cThe Court: I have Mr. Errigo\u2019s representation that it will not be repetitious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u201cMr. Errigo: I don\u2019t recall asking that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">\u201cQ. Did you have the same harmonious relationship with your wife, Mr. Pilot, after August 2 that you had prior to the first week in June of 1955? A. No, we had absolutely no marital relationships whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">\u201cQ. Is there still a marriage between you and your wife at the present time? A. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">\u201cQ. Does that marriage still exist? A. No, the marriage was terminated in divorce on the ground of adultery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-16\">\u201cMr. Theisen: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">\u201cThe Court: Let the reference to the ground of the divorce be stricken and, members of the jury, you are instructed to disregard that part of the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201cMr. Theisen: As a matter of fact, I want the whole thing stricken because it is not true, to my knowledge; the last check that I made was just on Friday, and decree has not yet been entered in that divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cMr. Errigo: He is wrong there, if your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cMr. Theisen: I will prove that later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cMr. Errigo: I think we better meet that now. Do you have a copy of it? There will be a decree nisi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cMr. Theisen: I don\u2019t want any further discussion of this thing before the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cMr. Errigo: I would like to read here that there is \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201cMr. Theisen: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">\u201cMr. Errigo: It is admissible, if your Honor please, to show that there has been a decree in divorce, without mentioning the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">\u201cThe Court: The objection is overruled. The jury now has the fact that these parties are divorced. I see no harm in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">\u201cMr. Errigo: I don\u2019t either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-15\">\u201cMr. Theisen: Of course you do see the harm in the answer that was given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-16\">\u201cThe Court: I have already instructed the jury to disregard the answer as to the ground on which the divorce was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-17\">\u201cMembers of the jury, you have the fact that there was a divorce; other than that, please disregard the last answer * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">I am of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s disclosure of adultery, as the ground of the divorce, was so unfairly and seriously prejudicial to the defendant that refusal to grant a new trial would be inconsistent with substantial justice. See Civil Rule 61. <em>Del. C. Ann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The question of whether a single act of adultery actually took place between the plaintiff\u2019s wife and the defendant was very closely contested. Its determination was crucial to the jury\u2019s conclusion upon the criminal conversation charge. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which had been ruled inadmissible, went to the merits of the case and permitted the inference that this Court had, in the divorce case, made a finding of adultery by the plaintiff\u2019s wife with the defendant. I am convinced that this may have seriously prejudiced the jury against the defendant in its deliberations upon the charge of criminal conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">After a review of the authorities, I am content with the ruling that evidence of the ground of the divorce was improper. While the fact of divorce was admissible in mitigation of damages, the ground of the divorce was not admissible under the circumstances here presented. See <em>Waldron v. Waldron, </em>156 <em>U. S. </em>361, 15 <em>S. Ct. </em>383, 389, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>453; <em>Prettyman v. Williamson, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>224, 39 <em>A. </em>731; <em>Rash v. Pratt, </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>18, 111 <em>A. </em>225; <em>Mead v. Randall, </em>111 <em>Mich. </em>268, 69 <em>N. W. </em>506; <em>Luick v. Arends, </em>21 <em>N. D. </em>614, 132 <em>N. W. </em>353; 20 <em>A. L. R. </em>946, 951; 20 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 1173; compare <em>Annarina v. Boland, </em>136 <em>Md. </em>365, 111 <em>A. </em>84.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard the plaintiff\u2019s improper statement did not cure the evil of the probable inference, raised in the minds of the jurors, that a judge of this court had already made a finding in the divorce case upon the very issue of fact they had before them for decision. Appropriate instructions from the court to the jury often may be deemed adequate, in the discretion of the trial judge, to protect a party against the wrongful effect of improper and prejudicial testimony. See <em>Blatz v. Wilson, </em>5 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>546, 170 <em>A. </em>808; <em>Lord v. Poore, 9 Terry </em>595, 108 <em>A. </em>2d 366. This is not such a case, however. Compare <em>Waldron v. Waldron, </em>156 <em>U. S. </em>361, 15 S. <em>Ct. </em>383, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>453. Here was the classic situation in which the objection of counsel, the exchange between counsel and the court, the ruling and the repeated admonition by the court to the jury only served to re-emphasize the improper statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and to impress it upon the minds of the jurors so as to make it ineradicable as a practical matter. Compare <em>United States v. Grayson, 2 Cir., </em>166 <em>F. </em>2d 863, 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The pre-trial conference preceded the trial in this case by only five days. It was the duty of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to advise the plaintiff as to the court\u2019s ruling on the subject and to caution the plaintiff against testifying as he did. If plaintiff\u2019s attorney did so, the plaintiff was either careless or he intentionally disregarded the advice of counsel and the ruling of the court. If counsel did not caution the plaintiff, he is responsible for this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">There must be a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The foreman\u2019s anno\u00fancement of specific type of damages was understandable, though uninvited, because there was a claim for punitive damages in the case and the jury had been instructed regarding the types of damages it might award to the plaintiff if it found in his favor. See <em>Rash v. Pratt, </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>18. 111 <em>A. </em>225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Because <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel are brought to mind by this situation, it is noted (1) that the Family Court case was a criminal case in which the defendant herein pleaded not guilty and (2) the defendant herein was not a party in the divorce proceedings between the plaintiff and his wife. Compare <em>Luick v. Arends, </em>21 <em>N. D. </em>614, 132 <em>N. W. </em>353.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
