Waters, </em>11 <em>Terry </em>257, 128 <em>A. </em>2d 556, January 7, 1957, I denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal in a similar case upon the authority of <em>State v. Stevens, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>479, 139 <em>A. </em>78, adding by way of a footnote, \u201cIf there is merit in the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the right of appeal in this instance should be limited to a review of the sentence above and not amount to a trial <em>de novo, </em>such contention is not properly before me at this stage of the proceeding.\u201d However, the question is now squarely raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Prior to an examination of the language of the Constitution itself, it is appropriate to notice two things, first, the undesirability from a practical point of view<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of permitting appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>by way of a trial <em>de novo </em>from judgments rendered upon pleas of guilty and, secondly, the fact that, in the absence of a special statute or Constitutional provision, the better reasoned authorities deny the right of a person who pled guilty below to an outright appeal. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Marino, </em>254 <em>Mass. </em>533, 150 <em>N. E. </em>841, where the appeal was limited to a review of the sentence below alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">While the question was not squarely before him, Judge Rodney took occasion to comment on this very situation in <em>State v. Stevens, supra. </em>After examining the debates of the <em>Constitutional Convention of </em>1897, Judge Rodney concluded that the true purpose and meaning of the language above quoted from Article 4, Sec. 28, was that the right of appeal therein provided for was limited to a review of the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cAn inspection of the debates in Volume 7, pp. 4755-5793, is clearly indicative of the fact that the provision allowing an appeal was inserted for the express purpose of allowing a review of the case where any judge or justice had imposed what might be considered as an immoderate sentence or where the offense might not be commensurate with the penalty imposed. The limit of a fine of $100 or imprisonment of 30 days was an arbitrary specification by the <em>Convention, </em>these particular figures being adopted in order to make the various appellate proceedings consistent.\u201d [3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>479, 139 <em>A. </em>79.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">While the quoted language is <em>dictum, </em>I am of the opinion it represents the true interpretation of the Constitutional provision here under consideration. Judge Herrmann in <em>Martin v. State, </em>10 <em>Terry </em>344, 116 <em>A. </em>2d 685, and Judge Carey in <em>Buckingham v. State, No. 52 May Term, </em>1951 (unreported memorandum opinion) have both referred to it with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">State\u2019s motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-13\">It would permit defendants below to enter into a guessing game as to the reasonableness of the sentence in the Court below knowing, that if the sentence were higher than, in defendant\u2019s judgment, was reasonable, he could arbitrarily appeal and obtain a new trial. Moreover, it would tend to encourage perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
