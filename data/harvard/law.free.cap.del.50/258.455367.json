A motion for reargument was filed and granted, and after a thorough reexamination of the rapidly growing list of recent decisions to the contrary, I have decided that the weight of modern authority is in favor of such a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The early decisions, headed by <em>Dietrich v. Inhabitants of Northampton, </em>1884, 138 <em>Mass. </em>14 denied recovery. In the cited case, Justice Holmes then speaking for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>was a part of its mother having no separate existence and was not entitled to sue through an administrator for injuries leading up to its death. A number of jurisdictions later came to the same conclusion. <em>Walker v. Great Northern Railway </em>(1891) 28 <em>L. R. Ireland </em>69; <em>Allaire v. St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, </em>1900, 184 <em>Ill. </em>359, 56 <em>N. E. </em>638, 48 <em>L. R. A. </em>225; <em>Gorman v. Budlong, </em>1901, 23 <em>R. I. </em>169, 49 <em>A. </em>704, 55 <em>L. R. A. </em>118; <em>Buel v. United Railways Co., </em>1913, 248 <em>Mo. </em>126, 154 S. <em>W. </em>71, 48 <em>L. R. A., N. S., </em>625; <em>Stanford v. St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co., </em>1926, 214 <em>Ala. </em>611,108 <em>So. </em>566; <em>Magnolia Coca Cola Bottling Co. v. Jordan, </em>1935, 124 <em>Tex. </em>347, 78 S. <em>W. </em>2d 944, 97 <em>A. L. R. </em>1513; <em>Newman v. City of Detroit, </em>1937, 281 <em>Mich. </em>60, 274 <em>N. W. </em>710; <em>Berlin v. J. C. Penney Co., </em>1940, 339 <em>Pa. </em>547, 16 <em>A. </em>2d 28; <em>Stemmer v. Kline, </em>1942, 128 <em>N. J. L. </em>455, 26 <em>A. </em>2d 489, 684; <em>Drobner v. Peters, </em>1921, 232 <em>N. Y. </em>220, 133 <em>N. E. </em>567, 20 <em>A. L. R. </em>1503. It now appears, however, that the <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hospital </em>case and the <em>Buel </em>and <em>Drobner </em>decisions have been overruled. Thus, there remain but eight jurisdictions which presently deny recovery in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>To the contrary, recent decisions of twelve jurisdictions have served to transform what was, until 1950, the heavy majority into the minority view. The citations of these cases follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Amann v. Faidy, </em>1953, 415 <em>Ill. </em>422, 114 <em>N. E. </em>2d 412; <em>Bonbrest v. Kotz, D. C., </em>1946, 65 <em>F. Supp. </em>138; <em>Verkennes v. Corniea, </em>1949, 229 <em>Minn. </em>365, 38 <em>N. W. </em>2d 838, 10 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 634; <em>Jasinsky v.

All of them hold that a viable foetus injured or killed by the negligence of another is entitled to sue either on its own behalf or through an administrator, depending upon whether it survived the accident. Leading text writers have also condemned the rationale of the <em>Dietrich </em>case. Thus, <em>Prosser, Law of Torts, </em>(2d Ed.) 1955, p. 174, has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201cAll writers who have discussed the problem have joined in condemning the old rule, in maintaining that the unborn child in the path of an automobile is as much a person in the street as the mother, and in urging that recovery should be allowed upon proper proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u201cThis criticism has at last had its effect. Beginning with a decision in the District of Columbia in 1946, a series of cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>many of them overruling former holdings, have held that an infant bom alive may maintain an action for prenatal injuries, and that an action for wrongful death will lie where it dies as a result of such injuries after birth. The reversal is so definite and marked as to leave no doubt that this will be the law of the future in the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">See also <em>Virginia Law Review, </em>P. 611 (1950); 48 <em>Michigan Law Review, </em>P. 539 (1949-1950)', and the case notes from 63 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>173 (1950) and 35 <em>Corn. L. Q. </em>648 (1949-50).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">So numerous and recent have been these authorities that I am convinced that I should rescind the Order entered on November 16. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. By stipulation of counsel, defendant\u2019s motion to strike is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\"><em>Cooper v. Blanch, La. App., </em>39 <em>So. </em>2d 352 and <em>Montreal Tramways v. Leveille, </em>4 <em>D. L. R. </em>337 (Canada) 1933, are frequently cited for this proposition. They do so hold but the construction of special statutes relating to the civil law places them in a separate category.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
