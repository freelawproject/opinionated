Assuming this to be the measure of the defendants\u2019 duty, we think the facts stated fairly show a failure of performance. The exposure of the plaintiff\u2019s gas pipes, and the removal of the supporting earth and soil from under them, and the permitting them to remain without proper support, so that they became broken and disconnected, was a failure to use ordinary care not to injure the plaintiff\u2019s pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The duty which is alleged in the declaration to have rested upon the defendants is not only much broader than that which the defendants admit in their specification of causes of demurrer, but is much broader than that which the law imposes upon the defendants, for it makes them insurers against injury to the plaintiff\u2019s gas pipes. But the allegation of a duty in a declaration may be treated as surplusage, for if the particular facts recited raise the duty the allegation is unnecessary, and if they do not it will be unavailing. <em>Breese </em>v. <em>Trenton Horse Railroad Co., </em>23 <em>Vroom </em>250, 252; <em>Millville Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sweeten, </em>45 <em>Id. </em>24.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
