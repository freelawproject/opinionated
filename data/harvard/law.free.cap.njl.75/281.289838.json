The existence of the regulation Avas proved, and the refusal of the plaintiff to obey it was at least a question for the jury. In submitting the caso to the jury the trial court left it to them to say whether the regulation in question was a reasonable one, instructing them that if they thought \u201cit was an unreasonable one, not necessary, not even apparently beneficial to the company,\u201d then the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crefusal to submit to it was a refusal within his legal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">We think that this was error. The question whether the regulation was void for unreasonableness should have been decided by the court. <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>North Jersey Street Railway Co., 35 Vroom </em>603; 10 <em>Cyc. </em>358; 5 <em>Encycl. L. </em>99.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">In the present case the jury should have been instructed that the regulation Avas not void for unreasonableness, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>that the willful disobedience of it by the plaintiff, if proved, justified the defendant in terminating his contract of agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The defendant is entitled to a <em>venire de novor </em>to which end the rule to show cause will be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
