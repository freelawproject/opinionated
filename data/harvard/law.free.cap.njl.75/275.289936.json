The collision occurred on November 6th, 1901. The suit was instituted March 4th, 1907. The defendants pleaded <em>actio non </em>because the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action did not accrue within two years next before the commencement of the suit. To this plea the plaintiffs demux\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The validity of the plea depends upon whether the supplement to the statute of limitations passed March 24th, 1896 <em>(Pamph. </em>L., <em>p. </em>119'), which provides that \u201call actions hereafter accruing for injuries to persons, caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person or persons, firm or firms, individual or individuals, corporation or corporations, within this state, shall be commenced and instituted within two years next after the cause of such action shall have accrued, and not after,\u201d applies where the injury complained of is inflicted upon property. If it does not, then the plaintiffs have six years next after the cause of action accrued within which to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The question presented is not difficult of solution. Every student- of Blackstone will recall that civil injuries axe divided into two classes \u2014 injuxies to personal rights and injuries to property rights. The statute in terms deals only with the former class of injuries \u2014 that is, personal injuries \u25a0 \u2014 as distinguished from injuries to property rights, for unless the word \u201cpersons\u201d is a word of limitation in this statutory provision it is meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
