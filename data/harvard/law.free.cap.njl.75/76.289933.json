It is merely <em>in transitu </em>through the state to the State of Hew York and elsewhere, being transshipped at the yard of the prosecutor in Jersey City in the manner above stated. It is not subject to tax in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">We are unable to distinguish the tax brought up by the writ in this case from that held to be void in Mr. Justice Depue\u2019s opinions in <em>Detmold </em>v.
