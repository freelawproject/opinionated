The proofs for the respondent tend to show that the relatrix was never admitted to membership in the church. This question of fact may properly and conclusively be determined upon the traverse to a return to an alternative writ of <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">In our opinion, an alternative writ should issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
