The child involved here, whom we shall call Marlene, was the subject of a care and protection petition, and after her attorney petitioned for child support on her behalf, her father voluntarily consented to her adoption under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. A judge in the Juvenile Court granted the child\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>support, and the father appealed from that order, arguing that a \u00a7 2 consent to adoption terminates the entire parent-child relationship, including the parent\u2019s obligation to support the child. We granted the father\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that a parent\u2019s consent to adoption of his or her child under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, does not terminate the parental duty to support the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. On February 6, 2003, the Department of Social Services (department) filed a care and protection petition, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, seeking temporary custody of Marlene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis for the petition was alleged physical abuse of Marlene by her father. One week later, the father waived his right to a hearing to contest the award of temporary custody. Shortly thereafter, a Juvenile Court judge awarded temporary custody of Marlene to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>her stepsister. Marlene was later placed in a \u201cPlanned Permanency Living Arrangement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Adoption was never sought for Marlene, and the department\u2019s original plan was reunification between the father and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The issue of support for the child developed as follows. On March 14, 2003, after Marlene was placed in the temporary custody of her stepsister, the child, by her attorney, moved for an order, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for child support from her father.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On March 18, 2003, the father signed an adoption surrender that complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, which provides that a parent can consent to the adoption of his or her child, and waive all right to further notice of proceedings involving the child\u2019s custody, guardianship, adoption, or other disposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute also contains the wording for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>form by which a parent consents to adoption,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the form the father signed was in the statutory language. In accordance with the statutory mandate \u201c[a] copy of said consent [was] filed with the department.\u201d See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. Although nothing in the statute requires a court filing, on April 8, 2003, the father filed a copy of the adoption surrender with the court. Concerned about a lack of authority to order child support after a voluntary surrender, the judge declined to order support from the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On June 19, 2003, the judge reversed herself and allowed the child\u2019s motion for support, requiring the father \u201cto file a financial statement with probation and to pay [c]hild [s]upport consistent with the Child Support Guidelines.\u201d The judge later issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of her order, holding that a \u00a7 2 consent could not relieve the father of his child support obligations. The father appealed from the order, and child support proceedings were stayed pending resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We have not had occasion to determine whether the filing of a voluntary consent to adoption under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, terminates a parent\u2019s obligation of child support. In interpreting \u00a7 2, we look first to the language of the statute. \u201c[Statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 407, 415 (1984), quoting <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). When the words of a statute are clear, they are to be given their ordinary and natural meanings. <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., supra, </em>citing <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>(1983). If the meanings are unclear, the statute must be interpreted \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). In addition, \u201ca statute should be read as a whole to produce an internal consistency.\u201d <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, supra </em>at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Section 2 does not mention the word \u201csupport,\u201d and makes no reference to any other section that addresses the topic. Hence, any relationship between \u00a7 2 and a parent\u2019s duty to support exists only by inference. The father asks us to infer that the Legislature intended that the language of \u00a7 2 terminate this statutory obligation. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In interpreting \u00a7 2, we start from the proposition that parents have a preexisting obligation to support their children. This duty to support \u201chas existed by statute in some form since as early as 1692.\u201d <em>T.F. </em>v. <em>B.L., </em>442 Mass. 522, 532 (2004), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>385 Mass. 461, 469 (1982), and Province Laws 1692-1693, c. 18, \u00a7 5. Over time, the Legislature has created a comprehensive statutory system governing child support, imposing that obligation on any parent who acknowledges paternity or is adjudicated to be the father. See <em>T.F. </em>v. <em>B.L., supra </em>at 532 (duty to support minor child is statutory and longstanding). This responsibility is imposed by several statutes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28; G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37; G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9. Our cases have acknowledged as much. See <em>T.F. </em>v. <em>B.L., supra', L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 443 (2000). Thus, when a parent consents to adoption of a child under \u00a7 2, such consent must be viewed in terms of the preexisting duty of support toward that child.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Section 2 says nothing and implies nothing concerning the termination of a parent\u2019s support obligations. The statutory consent form is very limited and precise. It states that the parent \u201cvoluntarily and unconditionally surrender[s] (child) to the care and custody of (agency or person receiving custody) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>purpose of adoption or such other disposition as may be made by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d It also provides for a \u201cwaive[r] [of] notice of any legal proceeding affecting the custody, guardianship, adoption or other disposition of (child).\u201d G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. The form has two effects. First, the parent grants to the specified agency or person custody of the child and consent to \u201cadoption or such other disposition\u201d of the child. Second, the parent thereby waives the right to notice of any legal proceeding that affects the \u201ccustody, guardianship, adoption or other disposition\u201d of the child. This consent to custody and adoption and accompanying waiver of notice surrender important parental rights, but only those specific rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">To the extent there is any ambiguity in the effect of \u00a7 2, resolution of that ambiguity is informed by the fact that the Legislature is unlikely to have relieved a biological parent of the existing duty of support by inference. Had the Legislature intended that \u00a7 2 have any impact beyond its stated terms, it could have done so by specifying what consequence signing the form would have on a parent\u2019s obligations. Cf. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 6 (decree of adoption ends all \u201crights, duties and other legal consequences\u201d of natural parents). In the absence of any indication of such legislative intent, we do not read such an effect into this section. \u201cWe will not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Callahan, 440 Mass. 436, 443 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002), and cases cited. See <em>Civitarese </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>412 Mass. 695, 700 (1992) (\u201cWe will not read into the plain words of a statute a legislative intent that is not expressed by those words\u201d). The various support statutes and \u00a7 2 are unrelated, and reading the section more broadly than its explicit terms allow is inappropriate. \u201cThe law of adoption is purely statutory . . . and the governing statute, G. L. c. 210 . . . , is to be strictly followed in all its essential particulars.\u201d <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205, 210 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The father contends that a legislative intent that the \u00a7 2 surrender should end all parental obligations to the child is evidenced by the following language in the \u00a7 2 form, \u201cI UNDERSTAND THAT THIS SURRENDER IS FINAL AND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>CANNOT BE REVOKED.\u201d G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. These words (as well as another statutory reference to the final and irrevocable nature of the consent) mean only that the surrender is final as to the enumerated rights being surrendered. The finality of that surrender does not expand the scope of what is thereby surrendered, nor does it transform the surrender into a document terminating the responsibilities of the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Our interpretation of the statute renders it a consistent part of the statutes concerning adoption. \u201cWe ordinarily construe statutes to be consistent with one another.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 554 (1996). \u201cStatutes addressing the same subject matter clearly are to be construed harmoniously so as to give full effect to all of their provisions and give rise to a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 62 (2002), citing <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra. </em>See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 626 (1992). \u201cA basic tenet of statutory construction requires that a statute \u2018be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, \u201cso that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 6, which provides for decrees of adoption, states: \u201cIf the court is satisfied . . . that the child should be adopted, it shall make a decree, by which, except as regards succession to property, all rights, duties and other legal consequences of the natural relation of child and parent shall thereafter exist between the child and the petitioner and his kindred, and <em>such rights, duties and legal consequences shall, except as regards marriage, incest or cohabitation, terminate between the child so adopted and his natural parents . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added). The termination of \u201cduties and legal consequences\u201d in \u00a7 6 clearly ends a parent\u2019s duty of support on adoption. To read \u00a7 2 as also terminating the parent-child relationship and concomitant duty of support would be to render the highlighted language of \u00a7 6 superfluous in any case where adoption resulted after a parent gave consent pursuant to \u00a7 2. Such a reading would not produce a harmonious result, and would fail to give effect to an important provision of the adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tion statute. We do not read one section of a statute as negating another.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The father\u2019s reading of \u00a7 2 conflicts with deeply entrenched public policy on the subject of child support. The child support scheme in Massachusetts furthers two important goals: \u201c(1) providing for the best interests of children, and (2) ensuring that the taxpayers are secondary to the parents in meeting the financial needs of dependent children.\u201d <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 669 (2003). See <em>Boulter-Hedley </em>v. Boulter, 429 Mass. 808, 812-813 (1999), citing G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13 (c); G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28; Child Support Guidelines. See also G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (c). The father\u2019s interpretation of the statute runs directly counter to the public policy that parents, not the State, should support their children. It is highly unlikely that the Legislature would, by inference, permit such an easy evasion of this responsibility. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Laingor, </em>434 Mass. 64, 65 (2001) (where no judicial determination that its terms advance best interests of child, agreement to exchange parental rights for reduction in child support payments unenforceable).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Juvenile Court granting the child\u2019s motion for support is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 24, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cThe divisions of the juvenile court department, upon the petition under oath of a person alleging on behalf of a child under the age of 18 within the jurisdiction of the court that the child: (a) is without necessary and proper physical or educational care and discipline; <em>(b) </em>is growing up under conditions or circumstances damaging to the child\u2019s sound character development; (c) lacks proper attention of the parent, guardian with care and custody or custodian; or <em>(d) </em>has a parent, guardian or custodian who is unwilling, incompetent or unavailable to provide any such care, discipline or attention, may issue a precept to bring the child before the court, shall issue a notice to the department and summonses to both parents of the child to show cause why the child should not be committed to the custody of the department or that any other appropriate order should not be made. ...

However, the holdings in those cases are often based on details of the State\u2019s statute that differ from ours. Moreover, in every case cited by the father, there has been judicial involvement in the termination, a process that G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, does not afford. See <em>County of Ventura </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>88 Cal. App. 4th 1120, 1122 (2001); <em>In re J.L.W., </em>496 N.W.2d 280, 282 (Iowa Ct. App. 1992); <em>Roelfs </em>v. <em>Sam P.

Indeed, in at least one State, the presence of a court order terminating parental rights extinguishes the duty of support, but a voluntary surrender of those rights, standing alone, does not.
