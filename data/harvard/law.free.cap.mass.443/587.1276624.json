L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, the public records law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that the elected sheriff of Barnstable County permit the Cape Cod Times, a division of Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. (newspaper), to inspect records of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the names and addresses of individuals appointed to serve as \u201creserve deputy sheriffs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sheriff has refused any such inspection, asserting that the records were created in a \u201cpersonal\u201d capacity, and are not \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. The sheriff also contends that the requested records are those of the Barnstable County Deputy Sheriffs Association, a private entity not subject to the public records statute. Alternatively, the sheriff argues that the records are exempt from inspection because their release would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or other provision of law. A judge in the Superior Court determined that the records were those of the association and not public. On cross motions, he granted summary judgment for the sheriff. The newspaper appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We conclude that the records requested were \u201cmade or received\u201d by a public official, the sheriff, as those terms are used in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, and that no exemption to the statutory definition of public records or other provision of law insulates the records from inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The parties do not contest the essential facts. The office of Barnstable County sheriff is a public, elected position. G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The current sheriff, James M. Cummings, first took office in January of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In the past, Barnstable County sheriffs have appointed private individuals to serve as \u201chonorary\u201d deputy sheriffs. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the special sheriff of Barnstable County,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> honorary deputy sheriffs were sworn in as deputy sheriffs, ostensibly engaged in no law enforcement functions, and were not employees of the sheriff\u2019s office.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Shortly after he took office, Sheriff Cummings largely abolished this practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its place he instituted a system of appointing \u201creserve deputy sheriffs.\u201d The sheriff contends that his current practice differentiates more clearly than in the past between deputy sheriffs who are employees of Barnstable County or otherwise have law enforcement powers, and private citizens without law enforcement powers, now designated \u201creserve deputy sheriffs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The sheriff has appointed more than one hundred reserve deputy sheriffs. A letter, printed on the sheriff\u2019s official letterhead and sent as part of an application package, recites the responsibilities of reserve deputy sheriffs: they have \u201call the powers, duties, authority, responsibility and honors of a Deputy Sheriff when called upon by the High Sheriff or the Special Sheriff, as provided for by [G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13, and G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 l].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The appointment of reserve deputy sheriffs is directed by the sheriff and his subordinates. A potential reserve deputy sheriff completes an application, which he or she mails to the sheriff\u2019s secretary, an employee of the sheriff\u2019s office. The application is then forwarded to the special sheriff, an employee of Barnstable County and the sheriff\u2019s highest ranking subordinate. See G. L. c. 37, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, and note 5, <em>supra. </em>Applicants authorize \u201cthe Sheriff of Barnstable County, Massachusetts\u201d to conduct \u201ca background investigation\u201d and the special sheriff directs employees to use the resources of the office to perform such background checks. After the completion of a background check, the special sheriff and two officers of the association review the application before the special sheriff makes a recommendation to the sheriff. The final decision to appoint an applicant is made by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Each successful reserve deputy sheriff candidate is notified by the sheriff in a letter bearing the sheriff\u2019s letterhead. Each is informed that he or she \u201ctakes an oath of public trust.\u201d The successful applicant also is given a photographic identification card, made by the sheriff\u2019s personnel director and paid for by the sheriff\u2019s office, bearing the title \u201creserve deputy sheriff.\u201d The reserve deputy sheriff is informed that he or she may purchase at a police supply store a badge that identifies the holder as a deputy sheriff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sheriff administers an oath to each reserve deputy sheriff at what is characterized as a \u201cceremonial gesture without legal consequence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We discuss briefly some aspects of the Barnstable County Deputy Sheriffs Association. Deputy sheriffs employed by Barn-stable County are members of the association, as were nonemployee \u201chonorary\u201d deputy sheriffs appointed in the past. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>association also admits to membership reserve deputy sheriffs and \u201cresworn\u201d volunteer deputy sheriffs. According to its articles of organization, the association\u2019s purpose is \u201c[t]o support all non-political programs and interests of the Sheriff\u2019s Office of Barnstable County and of the Association of Deputy Sheriffs.\u201d One of the association\u2019s functions is to support the operation of the sheriff\u2019s \u201cyouth ranch.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The sheriff is an ex officio member but not an officer or director of the association. The special sheriff is vice-president of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The newspaper commenced this action when the sheriff refused to permit the inspection of \u201cthose records in [his] possession regarding reserve deputies appointed by [him] or any predecessor in [his] office.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is not disputed that records \u201cmade or received\u201d by the sheriff, an elected officer and employee of Barnstable County, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, are subject to the public records laws. It is not disputed that the records requested by the newspaper are located in the sheriff\u2019s office, in a file maintained by, and under the control of, a public employee, the special sheriff. The sole question is whether the sheriff may nevertheless refuse to allow inspection and examination of these records on his assertion that the records are \u201cprivate.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, that claim is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The public records law, G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, requires that every person permit the inspection and examination of any public records in his or her \u201ccustody.\u201d See note 1, <em>supra. </em>General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, in turn, defines \u201c[p]ublic records\u201d as all materials \u201cmade or received by any officer or employee\u201d of any \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of the Commonwealth unless such materials fall within an exemption specified in that they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201c(a) specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute; . . . (c) . . . relat[ed] to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; <em>...(e) </em>notebooks and other materials prepared by an employee of the commonwealth which are personal to him and not maintained as part of the files of the governmental unit.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Legislature\u2019s definition of public records \u201cmanifests a legislative intent to provide broad public access to government documents subject only to limited exemptions.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envt\u2019l Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 802 (1999). The statute provides the operative standard: in any court proceeding \u201cthere shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(c). </em>Against this presumption of production, we address in turn the sheriff\u2019s assertion that the records were created in his (and the special sheriff\u2019s) \u201cpersonal\u201d capacities, and his claims that the records are the property of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The power to appoint reserve deputy sheriffs inheres in the office of the Barnstable County sheriff. When a public officer\u2019s actions are possible only by virtue of the public office he or she holds, they are official acts, and the evidence here is overwhelming that, when he appoints reserve deputy sheriffs, the sheriff acts as a public official and not as a private individual. Reserve deputy sheriffs \u201cserve at the pleasure of the Sheriff\u201d; they do not serve at the pleasure of private Citizen Cummings. Reserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>deputy sheriffs agree \u201cto obey the lawful commands of the Sheriff,\u201d not the commands of Citizen Cummings. Cummings will have no authority to appoint reserve deputy sheriffs after he leaves office. Rather reserve deputy sheriffs (if any) will serve at the pleasure of his successors. The \u201creal party in interest\u201d here \u201cis the governmental entity\u201d of the Barnstable County sheriff, not Cummings, \u201cthe named official.\u201d See <em>Hafer </em>v. <em>Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The sheriff argues that the resources utilized in the process of appointing reserve deputy sheriffs are largely those of the association, that the special sheriff\u2019s involvement in the appointment process is without compensation, and that the expenditure of resources of the sheriff\u2019s office in the process, such as reviewing the criminal history of applicants, is minimal, and no more than is customarily afforded to other private associations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The argument misses the point. Whatever the scope of his use of public resources, the fact remains that the sheriff appoints reserve deputy sheriffs solely by virtue of the public office he holds. The creation of the records was undertaken, supervised, and implemented by the sheriff acting at all times as a public official. The records were therefore \u201cmade or received,\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, and must be produced for inspection and examination, unless subject to an applicable exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As to the argument that the records sought by the newspaper are those of the Barnstable County Deputy Sheriffs Association, it is noteworthy that the association does not appoint reserve deputy sheriffs. That appointment as a reserve deputy sheriff automatically constitutes membership in an association does not detract from the capacity in which the sheriff acts. The newspaper seeks nothing from the association. It did not request from the association a list of the association\u2019s members. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>requested solely from the sheriff the names and addresses of reserve deputy sheriffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">That reserve deputy sheriffs serve as \u201cvolunteers,\u201d and are not employees of Barnstable County is also of no import. The public records laws allow inspection of records of the names and addresses of private persons with far less connection to a public official than evidenced in this case. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151 (1979) (holding that records of tax delinquents are subject to the public records laws). Records of appointments made by a public official as a consequence of his or her official status cannot be withheld from inspection and examination on an assertion that those appointments are \u201cprivate.\u201d See <em>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>436 Mass. 378, 385 (2002) (\u201cAllowing [an official] to decide unilaterally, without any oversight, what documents are subject to disclosure and what documents are exempt is wholly inconsistent with the purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Our conclusion that the sheriff\u2019s records concerning the appointment of reserve deputy sheriffs are public records does not end our inquiry, for we must resolve whether any exceptions to G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, exclude the names and addresses of reserve deputy sheriffs from the definition of \u201cpublic records,\u201d and whether allowing inspection of such records would otherwise constitute an unconstitutional or other unlawful invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">First, the sheriff argues that the records \u201cdo not serve any public purpose or function\u201d and \u201care personal to him and not maintained as part of the files of the governmental unit,\u201d as exempted under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(e). </em>For substantially the same reasons we discussed earlier, subclause <em>(e) </em>does not apply. Materials pertaining to the appointment and supervision of reserve deputy sheriffs are not \u201cpersonal\u201d to the sheriff or any of his employees, but inhere in the office of sheriff, regardless of which individual holds the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The sheriff further contends that disclosure of the names and addresses of reserve deputy sheriffs would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-Sixth (c). The argument has no merit. We have held that subclause <em>(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>precludes inspection only in cases where \u201cdisclosure would publicize \u2018intimate details\u2019 of \u2018a highly personal nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Comm \u2019r of the Real Prop. Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 623, 625-626 (1980), quoting <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, supra </em>at 157. Names and addresses of adults are not \u201c \u2018intimate details\u2019 of a \u2018highly personal nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Braintree, </em>395 Mass. 861, 865 (1985), quoting <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 818 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The sheriff further argues that, if he discloses the requested records, he may be exposed to liability under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, or G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The concern, not supported by any evidence, is misplaced. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), which exempts from the definition of public records \u201cmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d provides a broader protection against disclosure than does G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B. See <em>Pottle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Braintree, supra </em>at 866-867 n.6.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because subclause (c) does not bar inspection of records containing the names and addresses of individuals who serve as reserve deputy sheriffs, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, provides no alternative legal basis to resist inspection of the requested materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The sheriff\u2019s constitutional claim to the effect that the request for records \u201cpotentially invokes\u201d protected privacy interests of the reserve deputy sheriffs is equally without merit. Any constitutional protection of individual privacy does not insulate the disclosure of the names and addresses of those who have applied to, and been appointed by, a public official, regardless of the scope of their subsequent responsibilities. See <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Comm\u2019r of the Real Prop. Dep\u2019t of Boston, supra </em>at 628 (constitutional privacy rights not implicated by disclosure of names and addresses). See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1235 (1996) (no known case in this court or in United States Supreme Court \u201cwhere the constitutional right to privacy was found to have been violated by a governmental disclosure of information properly in its possession that the individual would rather not have disseminated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The records requested by the newspaper are public records and must be made available for inspection and examination. The judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-15\"> General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person having custody of any public record, as defined in clause Twenty-sixth of section seven of chapter four, shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it. . . to be inspected and examined by any person ....\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Sheriff\u2019s Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, which we recite and discuss below, defines a \u201cpublic record,\u201d exempting certain classes of materials from inspection and examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">General Laws c. 37, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA sheriff shall be elected in each county . . . .\u201d For most of the Commonwealth\u2019s history, sheriffs have been employees of their respective counties.
