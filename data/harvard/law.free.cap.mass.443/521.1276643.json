L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 [2] [a\u00bd] [2]). The jury also convicted the defendant of operating a motor vehicle so as to endanger, as lesser included offenses of two vehicular homicide indictments (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G [b]), and of one indictment charging intimidation of a witness (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B). The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss one indictment charging leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death or for a new trial. The judge sentenced him to two consecutive terms of two and one-half years for leaving the scene of an accident and to probation on the remaining convictions. The defendant appealed, raising a number of errors. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion to determine an issue of first impression \u2014 whether a driver who causes a single accident in which more than one person is killed and leaves the scene is properly charged, under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (aVa) (2), in one indictment charging leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death or with as many indictments as there are victims. We also consider, inter alla, the defendant\u2019s claim that one of his convictions of operating so as to endanger is duplicative. Because we conclude that a driver may be charged only once with leaving the scene of a single accident and operating so as to endanger, we vacate one of the defendant\u2019s convictions of each charge as duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We summarize the relevant facts. In August, 1998, while the defendant was driving on Route 28, he cut off a car driven by one of the victims and then prevented it from passing. The victim driver chased the defendant. The defendant then slammed on his brakes and maneuvered his truck in such a way as to cause the victim driver to veer sharply to avoid a collision. As a result, the victims\u2019 car was in an accident that killed both the driver and his passenger. The defendant failed to stop after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">1. <em>Duplicative convictions and sentences. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s failure to vacate his multiple convictions and sentences for leaving the scene of a single accident resulting in two deaths violated his privilege against double jeopardy. Additionally, the defendant argues ineffective assistance in his counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to dismiss the duplicative indictments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993). We are concerned with the third category of protection, which requires us to determine whether the Legislature intended to authorize the imposition of multiple punishments for leaving the scene of an accident resulting in the death of more than one person. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>430 Mass. 683, 686 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a\u00bd) (2), is silent with respect to whether the Legislature, in enacting the statute, intended to punish the leaving of the scene of an accident resulting in death separately for each victim or intended that a single penalty attach to the unlawful course of conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have held, however, that criminal statutes must be construed strictly against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>366 Mass. 132, 137-138 (1974). It is well established that if we find the statute ambiguous or are unable to ascertain the intent of the Legislature, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of any rational doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>363 Mass. 79, 81 (1973). In light of these principles, and based on the authority in other jurisdictions, the defendant argues, and we agree, that the proper \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d under the statute is the act of leaving the scene of the accident, not the number of accident victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We have previously stated that the prohibited conduct under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, consists of \u201c \u2018knowingly\u2019 going away without giving [the required] information.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 236 (1913). Thus, the proscribed act is scene related, not victim related. Moreover, although not conclusive, the fact that this statute is listed as a motor vehicle offense under G. L. c. 90, rather than a crime against a person under G. L. c. 265, further supports the view that the act is scene related.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Commonwealth argues that we need not consider extrinsic sources of statutory interpretation because the statute is unambiguous and its meaning is clear. We disagree. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a\u00bd) </em>(2), proscribes the act of \u201c[going] away to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension after knowingly colliding with or otherwise causing injury to <em>any </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). The use of the word \u201cany\u201d makes the statute ambiguous. See <em>Castaldi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>783 F.2d 119, 121 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1172 (1986). See also <em>Ladner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958) (holding single discharge of shotgun constituted only single violation of statute penalizing assault on \u201cany\u201d Federal officer even where more than one Federal officer was assaulted); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 84 (1955) (holding simultaneous transportation of two women constituted only one offense of statute prohibiting knowing transportation of \u201cany woman or girl\u201d for purpose of prostitution); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kinsley, </em>518 F.2d 665, 670 (8th Cir. 1975) (holding defendant\u2019s simultaneous possession of four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>firearms constituted only one offense under statute prohibiting previously convicted felon from possessing \u201cany firearm\u201d). Because it is unclear what is meant by the term \u201cany,\u201d the statute is ambiguous at best, and it is well established that \u201c[i]f the statutory language \u2018[could] plausibly be found to be ambiguous,\u2019 the rule of lenity requires the defendant be given \u2018the benefit of the ambiguity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>431 Mass. 44, 45-46 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Despite its contention that the statute is unambiguous, the Commonwealth argues that the legislative history demonstrates that the Legislature contemplated the imposition of multiple punishments. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the legislative history of the statute does not demonstrate that the Legislature authorized multiple punishments for concurrent violations of the statute. The Commonwealth focuses on the title of the law as \u201cAn Act establishing mandatory <em>penalties </em>for motor vehicle operators leaving the scene of an accident\u201d (emphasis added). See St. 1991, c. 460. The Commonwealth construes this to mean multiple punishments for leaving the scene of a single accident where more than one person is injured. However, the use of the word \u201cpenalties\u201d refers to the mandatory jail time <em>and </em>the mandatory fine, not multiple punishments for a single accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Furthermore, other jurisdictions that have considered the issue do not allow multiple punishments for leaving the scene of a single accident. See <em>Dake </em>v. <em>State, </em>675 So. 2d 1365, 1366-1367 (Ala. Crim. App. 1995) (holding double jeopardy prohibits multiple convictions for violations of statute requiring driver of vehicle involved in accident where someone is injured or killed to stop, provide identifying information, and render reasonable assistance to any person injured in accident). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>200 Ariz. 363, 363-364 (2001); <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>State, </em>705 So. 2d 979, 979-980 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998); <em>Hoag </em>v. <em>State, </em>511 So. 2d 401, 401-402 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sleboda, </em>166 Ill. App. 3d 42, 57 (1988); <em>Nield </em>v. <em>State, </em>677 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>79, 81-82 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997); <em>James </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 28, 36-39 (1941).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The object of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a\u00bd) </em>(2), is the failure of an involved driver to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in injury or death. Although this accident caused two deaths, there was but one accident scene and one failure to stop. Accordingly, we conclude that convicting the defendant of two violations, rather than one, and sentencing him to consecutive terms in a house of correction was error and gives rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant also argues that his two convictions of operating so as to endanger are duplicative, violating the double jeopardy clause and creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We agree. Although properly charged with two indictments of motor vehicle homicide, the jury twice chose to convict the defendant of the lesser included offense of operating so as to endanger. Unlike the motor vehicle homicide statute (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G), which proscribes causing death and not the operation of the vehicle, under the lesser included offense of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a), it is the operation of the vehicle itself that is the crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guillemette, </em>243 Mass. 346, 347 (1923). Moreover, a person may operate a vehicle in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>way that would endanger the public although no other person is on the street. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 235 (1913), and cases cited. Thus, the proper unit of prosecution is the single act of operating a vehicle so as to endanger, not the number of victims of any ensuing accident. Here, the defendant was convicted twice of operating so as to endanger arising from a single act. As it is the conduct of operating a vehicle in a negligent manner so as to endanger the public that is proscribed, not the act of harming another, the defendant can be convicted only once of operating so as to endanger although more than one person was killed. Therefore, we conclude that it was error and gives rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice to convict the defendant twice of this offense, rather than once, and to sentence him to concurrent terms of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">2. <em>Other issues. </em>The defendant also claims errors in the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements and the jury instructions regarding causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">a. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks. </em>The defendant cites two instances of allegedly prejudicial closing argument. In both instances the defendant claims that the prosecutor misstated his testimony by telling the jury that \u201cin his own words\u201d the defendant had been racing and argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting. Having reviewed the closing argument and the portions of the transcript relating to this evidence, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was a fair comment on the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As there was no error, it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to fail to object to the statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 509 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">b. <em>Jury instruction on causation. </em>Additionally, the defendant argues that the failure to instruct the jury on proximate and intervening causes on the charge of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and that the failure of trial counsel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>object to the instructions constituted ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. One of the elements the prosecution had to prove was that while the defendant was operating a vehicle, he caused injury in some way to another. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a\u00bd) (2). It is well established that fault is not a determining factor; rather, we look to whether the defendant was in some way an actor, not a mere participant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>414 Mass. 444, 447 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bleakney, </em>278 Mass. 198, 202 (1932). A judge is \u201cnot required to instruct the jury in the precise language requested by the defendant. It is enough if the instructions [are] otherwise adequate . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 822 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, 376 </em>Mass. 201, 208 (1978). Here, the judge\u2019s instruction properly charged the jury with determining whether the defendant was in some way an actor, a partial cause of the accident. Furthermore, the instruction indicated that the defendant was to be acquitted if some other person was the direct or substantial cause of death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury could certainly ascertain that if the victims\u2019 negligence was the sole or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>substantial cause of the their deaths, the defendant should be acquitted. As there was no error in the instructions, it was not ineffective assistance of counsel not to object. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Because we conclude that the object of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a\u00bd) (2), is the failure of a driver to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in injury or death, the proper \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d under the statute is the scene of an accident, not the number of accident victims, and a driver may be charged only once with leaving the scene of a single accident. Additionally, because we conclude that the proscribed act under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a), </em>is the conduct of operating a motor vehicle so as to endanger the public, the proper unit of prosecution under this statute is the conduct, not the number of victims, and a driver may be convicted only once of operating so as to endanger for a single act regardless of the number of victims in any resulting accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Accordingly, we vacate one of the defendant\u2019s convictions of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and the sentence imposed, and one of his convictions of operating so as to endanger and the sentence imposed. The remaining convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Because we conclude, on the merits, that the conviction and sentencing of the defendant on two charges of leaving the scene of a single accident resulting in two deaths gives rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s argument of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) <em>(a\u00bd) </em>(2), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201cWhoever operates a motor vehicle upon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access . . . and without stopping and making known his name, residence and the registration number of his motor vehicle, goes away to avoid prosecution or evade apprehension after knowingly colliding with or otherwise causing injury to any person shall, if the injuries result in the death of a person, be punished ... by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not less than one year nor more than two and one-half years and by a f\u00edne of not less than one thousand dollars . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Although a few States have allowed multiple punishments for leaving the scene of a single accident, they focused on language in the statutes that required the operator to render assistance to any person injured; this is not a requirement under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a\u00bd) (2). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hartnek, </em>146 Wis. 2d 188, 194-197 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding driver\u2019s failure to stop and render aid to injured occupants of car that collided with driver\u2019s car gave rise to multiple violations of statute requiring driver to stop and render aid to all injured persons at scene where receipt of medical attention with least possible delay was \u201cobvious\u201d intent of Legislature).
