Phelan brought an action against May, Michael Geraghty (Filene\u2019s chief financial officer), and Donald Lane (Filene\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>controller) (collectively, the defendants), alleging that their conduct during the investigation had constituted false imprisonment and defamation. A jury found in favor of Phelan on both claims and awarded him damages of $1,500 for false imprisonment and $75,000 for defamation. With respect to Phelan\u2019s defamation claim, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.), contending that Phelan had produced insufficient evidence on which a jury reasonably could have found either (1) the conduct alleged had defamatory significance to those witnessing it; or (2) the defendants had lost their conditional privilege to publish arguably defamatory material about Phelan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants also moved for a new trial with respect to the defamation claim. On December 21, 2001, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion for judgment n.o.v., doubting that Phelan had set forth sufficient evidence of publication and concluding that he had failed to overcome the defendants\u2019 conditional privilege. The judge denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Phelan appealed from the judgment n.o.v., and the Appeals Court reversed, concluding that the motion judge had erred by substituting her judgment for that of the jury. See <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dep\u2019t Stores Co., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 843 (2004). We allowed the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review and now consider whether (1) in the absence of interpretive testimony from witnesses, the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove publication of any particular statement about Phelan; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the defendants had acted recklessly or maliciously, thereby losing their conditional privilege to publish a defamatory statement about Phelan. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Based on the testimony at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. Phelan was employed as assistant director of accounts payable for Filene\u2019s where, among other tasks, he was responsible for managing \u201cvendor violations\u201d and the related budget. Vendor violations occurred when vendors failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>comply with Filene\u2019s shipping or purchase order requirements, and Filene\u2019s imposed a charge on them to cover the additional costs. To challenge an imposed charge, a vendor would submit to Filene\u2019s a \u201cvendor violations package,\u201d addressing why the charge was unjustified and requesting a refund. This package would be processed by Phelan\u2019s department, and if it was determined that the charge had been improperly assessed, the vendor would receive a repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In 1997, Geraghty directed Phelan to pay \u201cprior year invoices\u201d (PYIs) from the vendor violations budget, notwithstanding the fact that severe fiscal problems had arisen in the past from this practice. Phelan and his direct supervisor, Catherine Rooney, warned Geraghty and Lane that this practice was ill advised because it hindered their ability to make timely repayments to deserving vendors and to meet budgetary goals. Nonetheless, Phelan was not instructed to stop this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">During this time, unbeknownst to Phelan, a backlog of vendor violations packages had begun to accumulate in the hands of Phelan\u2019s subordinate, Geoffrey Meade, who was in charge of evaluating these packages. In early July, 1998, Meade finally told Phelan about the backlog, indicating that the amount due to vendors was approximately $200,000. Phelan and Rooney promptly notified their supervisor, Michael Easier, who was Filene\u2019s assistant controller. As it turned out, the problem was significantly greater than Phelan had been led to believe; Meade reported to Easier that the backlogs and unpaid PYIs totaled $491,995. Meade attempted to shred his backlog of vendor violations packages, but the documents were ultimately retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">At this juncture, Geraghty, Lane, and Easier decided to conduct an investigation and audit of the vendor violations program. On the morning of July 10, 1998, Lane interviewed Phelan as to alleged accounting irregularities and then directed him to Easier\u2019s office. Lane instructed a Filene\u2019s security officer, Johnny Guante, to guard Phelan, purportedly so that Phelan would not \u201cinfluence\u201d or \u201cintimidate\u201d his subordinates, who were being questioned as part of the investigation. Phelan was not permitted to use the telephone. Throughout the day, Guante relocated Phelan to various available offices and confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ence rooms, escorted him to the restroom, and accompanied him to the cafeteria. Coworkers did not speak with Phelan as he was moving about the building with Guante. Although Guante did not wear a badge or other insignia that identified him as a security guard, and did not carry a weapon or handcuffs, he did wear dark trousers, a shirt, a tie, and a blazer that Filene\u2019s had issued to him and that was similar to the clothing worn by other security guards in the store. Phelan felt embarrassed and humiliated because of his observation that, everywhere they went, coworkers were staring at him while he was in the company of security personnel. At the end of the day, Phelan was returned to Easier\u2019s office, was informed that he was being suspended, and was escorted out of the building by another Filene\u2019s executive. Phelan\u2019s employment with Filene\u2019s subsequently was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">When considering a motion for judgment n.o.v., \u201cthe judge\u2019s task, \u2018taking into account all the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, [is] to determine whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury reasonably could return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. 482, 494 (1985), quoting <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Hayden, Harding &amp; Buchanan, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 254 (1983). See <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boersner, </em>413 Mass. 432, 438 (1992). The judge will consider whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn\u201d in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). To be reasonable, the inference \u201cmust be based on probabilities rather than possibilities and cannot be the result of mere speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 706-707 n.3 (1990), quoting <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Honeyman, </em>406 Mass. 43, 45-46 (1989). When reviewing a judgment n.o.v., this court applies the same standard as the motion judge. See <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1, 8 n.5 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">To prevail on his defamation claim, Phelan had to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>that the defendants published a false statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> about him to a third party that either caused him economic loss or was of the type that is actionable without proof of economic loss. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>442 Mass. 64, 66 (2004); <em>Eyal </em>v. <em>Helen Broadcasting Corp., </em>411 Mass. 426, 429-430 (1991). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 558 (1977). A false statement that \u201cwould tend to hold the plaintiff up to scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt, in the minds of any considerable and respectable segment in the community,\u201d would be considered defamatory, <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 853 (1975), and the imputation of a crime is defamatory per se, requiring no proof of special damages. See <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>303 Mass. 116, 118-119 (1939). The element of publication is satisfied where the defamatory communication is transmitted to even one person other than the plaintiff. See <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>351 Mass. 53, 56 (1966); Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 577. Contrast <em>Economopoulos </em>v. A. <em>G. Pollard Co., </em>218 Mass. 294, 297 (1914) (no publication where defamatory words, spoken in presence of others, uttered in foreign language and only understood by plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The defendants contend that they were properly entitled to judgment n.o.v. on Phelan\u2019s defamation claim because their conduct did not convey a clear and unambiguous false statement about Phelan and, in the absence of evidence that an observer interpreted the defendants\u2019 conduct as conveying such a meaning, Phelan has failed to establish defamatory publication. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">A threshold issue in a defamation action, whether a communication is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning, is a question of law for the court. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Publ. Co., </em>404 Mass. 9, 11 (1989); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 791-792 (1987). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 614 (court decides whether communication is capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>particular meaning and whether such meaning is defamatory). However, \u201c[w]here the communication is susceptible of both a defamatory and nondefamatory meaning, a question of fact exists for the jury.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, supra </em>at 792. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>(jury decides \u201cwhether a communication, capable of a defamatory meaning, was so understood by its recipient\u201d). In the context of determining whether articles published in a newspaper were defamatory to particular businesses, we stated that \u201can objective test \u2014 i.e., inquiry into a reasonable recipient\u2019s understanding of the words rather than the speaker\u2019s intent \u2014 has been used over the years to prove that words are defamatory\u201d and that they concerned the plaintiff. <em>New England Tractor-Trailer Training of Conn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>395 Mass. 471, 479-480 (1985). Cf. <em>Economopoulos </em>v. <em>A. G. Pollard Co., supra </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When assessing the import of physical acts, which are at issue here, rather than written or spoken words, this objective test is equally applicable. Although not explicitly recognized in prior Massachusetts case law, we conclude that defamatory publication <em>may </em>result from the physical actions of a defendant, in the absence of written or spoken communication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 559 comment a, at 156 (\u201cThe word \u2018communication\u2019 is used to denote the fact that one person has brought an idea to the perception of another\u201d); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 563 comment a, at 162 (meaning of communication, \u201cwhether by written or spoken words or otherwise,\u201d is that which recipient understands it to convey); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 565 comment a, at 170 (particular act may fall within definition of defamatory communication); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 568 comment d, at 180 (publication of defamatory matter may be made by conduct and may be treated as libel, rather than slander). See also <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>905 F.2d 515, 520 (1st Cir. 1990) (defamation requires \u201ca communication, defined as conduct that brings an idea to the perception of others\u201d); <em>Jimenez-Nieves </em>v. <em>United States, </em>682 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1982) (activity counts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201ccommunication\u201d if it conveys idea to third person); <em>Simas </em>v. <em>First Citizens\u2019 Fed. Credit Union, </em>63 F. Supp. 2d 110, 116 (D. Mass. 1999) (\u201can individual\u2019s actions, separate from any written or spoken statements, may be sufficient grounds for a jury to find a cause of action [for defamation]\u201d); <em>Petsch-Schmid </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>914 F. Supp. 697, 705 (D. Mass. 1996), aff\u2019d, 108 F.3d 328 (1st Cir. 1997) (where supervisor raised voice to employee while escorting her from building after suspension, \u201cit is possible that the escort may have been conducted in such a manner as to communicate a defamatory statement to other employees about the plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Phelan, as we must, the defendants\u2019 conduct was ambiguous and open to various interpretations. The actions of Guante in escorting Phelan about the office on July 10, and in relocating him to various conference rooms, did not have a specific, obvious meaning and did not necessarily convey that Phelan had engaged in criminal wrongdoing. There was no chasing, grabbing, restraining, or searching such as would have conveyed a clear and commonly understood meaning. From the mere fact that he was being accompanied by a security guard, observers could have thought, for example, that the defendants were sequestering Phelan so that he could not communicate with others, or so that he could provide confidential assistance with their investigation. Where Guante\u2019s communication, through physical action, was ambiguous, it was for the jury to decide whether such communication was understood by Phelan\u2019s coworkers as having a defamatory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Phelan had the burden of proving that a reasonable third person observing Guante\u2019s conduct would have understood it to be defamatory. See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Allen, supra </em>at 244-245. See also Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 613 comments c and d, at 308 (plaintiff must convince jury that communication was understood as defamatory by third person). Cf. <em>Sharratt </em>v. <em>Housing Innovations, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 141, 144-145 (1974) (statement not defamatory on face may acquire defamatory meaning when audience presented with attendant circumstances). Contrast <em>Economopoulos </em>v. <em>A. G. Pollard Co., supra </em>at 297 (no publication, and thus no cause of action for defamation, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>purported defamatory meaning only understood by plaintiff). Phelan presented no such evidence to satisfy his burden of proof. He testified that he was embarrassed and humiliated by the defendants because other employees stared at him in the company of Guante. However, Phelan\u2019s own belief that others viewed him in a defamatory light, without more, was insufficient to establish defamatory publication. In other words, Phelan was not competent to testify as to his coworkers\u2019 interpretation of Guante\u2019s actions and whether, as a result of what they saw, they viewed Phelan with scorn, hatred, ridicule, or contempt. Publication to Phelan cannot be substituted for publication to a third party. Cf. <em>Economopoulos </em>v. A. <em>G. Pollard Co., supra. </em>To satisfy his burden of proof, Phelan needed to present testimony from at least one coworker who observed Guante\u2019s actions and interpreted such actions as defamatory. Cf. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>11 Cush. 241, 244 (1853) (where purported slander made by expressions and gestures, and not solely by words, it was necessary to inquire of witnesses what they understood defendant to mean both as to person intended and charge made against him). Because he failed to do so, we conclude that he did not establish the essential elements of defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In light of our conclusion, we need not consider whether the defendants\u2019 conduct was protected by an employer\u2019s conditional privilege to publish defamatory material where the publication is reasonably necessary to the protection or furtherance of a legitimate business interest. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 512-513 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The judgment notwithstanding the verdict is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The defendants did not appeal from the jury\u2019s verdict on the false imprisonment claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by Associated Industries of Massachusetts and New England Legal Foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u201cBy statute, Massachusetts permits a plaintiff to recover for a truthful defamatory statement published in writing (or its equivalent) with actual malice, G.
