The defendant, also a psychiatrist, was hired by the board to assist in its investigation of the complaints. After he was exonerated by the board on all charges, the plaintiff sued the defendant for statements made in the form of an affidavit. The defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute), was allowed by a Superior Court judge. The plaintiff appealed from the dismissal of the suit to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The question before us is whether G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, immunizes the defendant physician from liability for statements made in his affidavit. We hold that, in the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s activities fall beyond the scope of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s protections. Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal of the complaint and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Kennard C. Kobrin, is a licensed psychiatrist who owned and operated a psychiatry practice in Fall River and was also a contracted mental health and substance abuse service provider with the Massachusetts Medicaid Assistance Program. The defendant, David R. Gastfriend, is a licensed psychiatrist with a subspecialty certification in addiction psychiatry and has served as a director of addiction services at Massachusetts General Hospital since 1991, where he treats patients for substance abuse and conducts research.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In 1993, the State police began investigating the plaintiff\u2019s prescription practices after several of his patients died in circumstances involving the overuse of various drugs. The State police retained the defendant to assist with the criminal investigation. Meanwhile, in 1994 and 1996, three complaints were filed against the plaintiff with the board concerning his alleged improper prescription of benzodiazepines to his patients.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, the board is granted authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201cinvestigate all complaints relating to the proper practice of medicine by any person holding a certificate of registration\u201d to practice medicine within the Commonwealth. The defendant was retained by the board under contract and was paid to assist in its investigation of these complaints and to render an expert opinion concerning the plaintiff\u2019s medical practices. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5 (\u201cthe board shall hire such attorneys and investigators as are necessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On request of the counsel assigned to the disciplinary case (complaint counsel), the defendant reviewed and evaluated numerous medical records and reports relating to the plaintiffs prescription practices and executed an affidavit. The defendant\u2019s seven-page affidavit set forth his professional opinion that the plaintiff deviated from the proper standard of care and was \u201cengaged pervasively in illegitimate prescribing and . . . widespread misconduct,\u201d and concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccontinued practice of medicine . . . represents a serious and immediate threat to his patients and to the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Relying in part on the defendant\u2019s opinions and findings as set forth in his affidavit, complaint counsel filed with the board a motion for summary suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license pursuant to 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03(11)(a) (1993). A statement of allegations was filed against the plaintiff, see 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (1993); the board summarily suspended his registration to practice medicine and referred the matter to the division of administrative law appeals (DALA). At the DALA hearing, the defendant, who was subpoenaed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, testified concerning the contents of his affidavit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The administrative magistrate concluded that the plaintiff did not illegally prescribe benzodiazepines or otherwise render substandard care to his patients, and the board dismissed the charges against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court asserting claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>against the defendant for \u201cexpert witness malpractice/negligence,\u201d defamation, malicious prosecution, and interference with contractual relations. All counts are based on the defendant\u2019s preparation and submission of the affidavit to the board, \u201cknowing the information contained therein [was] false, misleading and fraudulent and was maliciously included therein with the intention to injure\u201d the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response to the complaint, the defendant filed a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, commonly referred to as the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge allowed the motion and subsequently awarded the defendant attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In his appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the anti-SLAPP statute is not applicable to the defendant because the latter was not petitioning the government, but rather was providing paid assistance to the government in its case. The defendant maintains that dismissal of the suit against him pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute was appropriate because he was engaged in \u201cpetitioning activities\u201d before the board within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant\u2019s activities are governed neither by the letter nor by the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute. Because the defendant was not seeking from the government any form of redress for a grievance of his own or otherwise petitioning on his own behalf, he was not exercising his \u201cright of petition under the constitution\u201d within the meaning of the statute. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. We would alter considerably the Legislature\u2019s intent were we to interpret the statute so as to expand its scope to protect the statements of a disinterested paid witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the Superior Court judge\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>whether there was an abuse of discretion or other error of law. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 550 (2001); <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 348 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">1. <em>Applicability of the anti-SLAPP statute. </em>The anti-SLAPP statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1, was enacted by the Legislature to provide a quick remedy for those citizens targeted by frivolous lawsuits based on their government petitioning activities. See preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520. See also <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161-162 (1998). The statute employs a number of mechanisms to protect the rights of those providing information to the government, including a special motion to dismiss and expedited hearing on the motion, a stay of discovery proceedings pending the motion\u2019s disposition, and the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to successful moving parties. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. It applies to matters of both public and private concern, <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 347; <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 164; and encompasses petitions brought before governmental agencies. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H; <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122-123 (2002) (applying anti-SLAPP statute to one defendant\u2019s communications with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In determining whether the defendant\u2019s statements to the board fall within the scope of the anti-SLAPP statute, we apply the general rule of statutory construction that a statute is to be interpreted \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>439 Mass. 720, 723 (2003), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Accordingly, we turn first to the language of the anti-SLAPP statute to determine the legislative intent. The statute, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cIn any case in which a party asserts that the civil claims, counterclaims, or cross claims against said party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>are based on said party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth, said party may bring a special motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The statute then defines a \u201cparty\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201c[A]ny written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding; any statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration; or any other statement falling within constitutional protection of the right to petition government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Id. </em>We read the phrase \u201cbased on said party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition under the constitution\u201d as restricting the statute\u2019s coverage to those defendants who petition the government on their own behalf. In other words, the statute is designed to protect overtures to the government by parties petitioning in their status as citizens. It is not intended to apply to those performing services for the government as contractors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous, but each is to be given its ordinary meaning without overemphasizing its effect upon the other terms appearing in the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), quoting <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946). The statute explicitly extends protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tion to a party based on \u201csaid <em>party\u2019s </em>exercise of <em>its </em>right of petition\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. Moreover, the right of petition protected in the anti-SLAPP statute is that right enumerated in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people ... to petition the Government for a <em>redress of </em>grievances\u201d [emphasis added]) and in art. 19 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cThe people have a right ... to request of the legislative body . . . by the way of . . . petitions . . . <em>redress </em>of the <em>wrongs done them, </em>and of the grievances <em>they </em>suffer\u201d [emphasis added]). See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (protecting against lawsuits \u201cbased on said party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition <em>under the constitution </em>of the United States or of the commonwealth\u201d [emphasis added]). The right of petition contemplated by the Legislature is thus one in which a party seeks some redress from the government. See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1690 (1993) (defining \u201cpetition\u201d as \u201ca formal written <em>request </em>addressed to an official person or organized body\u201d and as \u201ca formal written request addressed to a magistrate or court <em>praying for . . . relief </em>\u2019 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Here, the defendant was not exercising <em>his </em>right to petition or to seek any redress from the board (a government body), but rather was acting solely on behalf of the board as an expert investigator and witness. The Superior Court judge thus erred in concluding that the defendant\u2019s activities \u201cf[e]ll within the letter and spirit of the petitioning activities enumerated in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The dissent suggests that our interpretation today departs from the literal construction of the statute and states that a broad construction of the statute more accurately reflects the statutory language. See <em>post </em>at 343-345. The dissent maintains that we need not speculate about the meaning of the language nor depart from it unless the language would produce an absurd result. See <em>post </em>at 345-346. Because the language obviously produces no absurd result here, the dissent continues, all we need consider is the statute\u2019s plain language. As the dissent interprets that statutory language, every statement ever made to a government body is protected. Unfortunately, this analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ignores the history that led to adoption of the statute, misconstrues the statutory language, and in doing so, fails to effectuate the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">While the dissent makes much of the fact that the Legislature\u2019s choice of words was deliberate, see <em>post </em>at 344, it overlooks the important fact that the Legislature explicitly used the phrase \u201cright of petition under the constitution\u201d in the statute, thus expressly implicating the term\u2019s constitutional meaning. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The constitutional \u201cright of petition\u201d is a term of art that the Legislature did not adopt casually or accidentally. The Legislature\u2019s decision to refer to the right of petition secured in the Federal and State Constitutions must be accorded significance in order to effectuate the legislative intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Relying on a broad definition of a \u201cparty\u2019s exercise of its right of petition,\u201d the defendant similarly argues that the judge\u2019s determination was correct because he submitted a \u201cwritten . . . statement\u201d to a government \u201cbody\u201d in connection with an issue that was \u201cunder consideration,\u201d see G. L. c. 321, \u00a7 59H, and that nothing in the statute requires a party to commence or initiate a proceeding himself or herself. Like the flawed analysis in the dissent, this argument fails to account for the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cright of petition under the constitution\u201d and the additional language indicating that it is the petitioner\u2019s <em>own </em>interests and statements directed thereto that are the subject of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The defendant attempts to bolster his argument by pointing to cases that acknowledge the breadth of the statute\u2019s wording. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 162 (1998) (\u201cthe Legislature intended to enact very broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>protection for petitioning activities\u201d); <em>Milford Power Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>New England Power Co., </em>918 F. Supp. 471, 489 (D. Mass. 1996) (\u201cthe Court recognizes that the statute\u2019s definition of the \u2018right to petition\u2019 is very broad\u201d). The <em>Milford </em>case is of little help to the defendant, as the court in <em>Milford </em>declined to rule on the scope of the statute and denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice. See <em>id. </em>at 489. Likewise, the <em>Duracraft </em>case does not help the defendant because there we did not construe the meaning of \u201cright to petition,\u201d and we declined to give an expansive reading to the statute. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 167-168. We reasoned that an over-broad construction of the anti-SLAPP statute would compromise the nonmoving party\u2019s right to petition \u2014 the same right the statute was enacted to protect. See <em>id. </em>at 166 (\u201cBy protecting one party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition, unless it can be shown to be sham petitioning, the statute impinges on the adverse party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The legislative history of the anti-SLAPP statute further supports our holding. \u201cStatutes are to be interpreted not based solely on simple, strict meaning of words, but in connection with their development and history, and with the history of the times and prior legislation.\u201d <em>Quincy City Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>406 Mass. 431, 443 (1990) (adopting narrower interpretation of statute based, in large part, on legislative intent as gleaned from legislative history). See <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 267-269 (1991) (determining legislative intent through examination of legislative history in conjunction with plain language of statute). The Legislature passed the anti-SLAPP statute partly in response to a lawsuit initiated by a developer against citizens of Rehoboth who signed a petition challenging proposed development out of a concern about endangering wetlands. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 161. In enacting the statute, the Legislature expressed concern over a \u201cdisturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the <em>constitutional </em>rights of freedom of speech and petition <em>for the redress of grievances\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra; Stubom Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bernstein, </em>245 F. Supp. 2d 312, 314 (D. Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>2003) (noting that anti-SLAPP statute was designed to protect right to petition for redress of grievances). The Legislature intended the statute to encourage \u201cfull participation by persons and organizations and robust discussion of issues before legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies.\u201d Preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra. </em>Based on this legislative history, this court concluded that \u201c[t]he typical mischief that the legislation intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development projects.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 121-122 (2002), quoting <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Although the statute was aimed primarily at protecting citizen protest in the area of land development, we recognize that the application of the anti-SLAPP statute has not been limited to this arena. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 549 (2001) (\u201cour review of the legislative history ... led us to conclude that the Legislature intended to go beyond the \u2018typical\u2019 case\u201d). At the same time, we have recognized that the scope of the statute has its limits. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 162-163 (\u201cWe are dubious that the Legislature intended to create an absolute privilege. We also see no evidence that the statute was intended to reach suits such as this one between two corporate competitors involved in other ongoing litigation . . ,\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The legislative history reveals that the anti-SLAPP statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>had its genesis as a legislative attempt to protect private citizens when exercising their constitutional right to speak out against development projects or other matters of concern to them and their communities and to seek governmental relief. \u201cSLAPP suits [are] \u2018generally meritless suits brought by large private interests to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 161, quoting <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 816-817 (1994).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nothing in the legislative history suggests any intention to protect a government-retained investigator acting on behalf of an administrative agency. The board contracted with the defendant to engage in investigative activities in aid of <em>the board\u2019s </em>case against the plaintiff,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and he was compensated for his services. He had no other connection to, or interest in, the allegations against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The dissent, in its broad interpretation of the statute, totally disregards this legislative history. This statutory context, when combined with the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpetition under the constitution\u201d as discussed above, produces an entirely different construction than that proposed by the dissent. Our opinion today does not distort the language of the statute, but rather gives it its intended meaning by taking account of these two important considerations. As is our obligation, we have given meaning to <em>all </em>of the statute\u2019s words in the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>legislative history in order to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. See <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>439 Mass. 720, 723 (2003); <em>Quincy City Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>406 Mass. 431, 443 (1990).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The defendant argues that his enlistment by government officials to engage in petitioning activities does not disqualify him from protection under the anti-SLAPP statute. Our holding in this case does not suggest that all parties solicited by the government to participate in petitioning activities will necessarily be disqualified from the anti-SLAPP law\u2019s protections. While there is no statutory requirement that petitioning parties directly commence or initiate proceedings, in protecting those petitioning activities guaranteed under the State and Federal Constitutions, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the statute requires that the protected party have more than a mere contractual connection to the proceedings that are the basis of the petitioning activity. The defendant asserts no such connection to the proceedings in the case at hand.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The defendant\u2019s case is distinguishable from the facts in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543 (2001), where we affirmed the dismissal of a SLAPP suit against two defendants whose comments on a proposed development had been solicited by the government. In that case, the plaintiff landowner sought permits from State and Federal regulatory agencies to construct a pier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>on land he owned on an island that was also the nesting habitat for several species of aquatic birds. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 549. In the course of their review, the permitting agencies sought comment on the impact of the proposed development on the island habitat from other environmental agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 545. One of those agencies, in turn, solicited comment from Parsons, a senior scientist for an environmental group (Manomet Bird Observatory), who had studied bird populations on the island for fifteen years. <em>Id. </em>at 544-545. Her comments were based on observations she had personally made while a researcher on the island, to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s development on the island had already \u201cdiminished and perhaps decimated a once robust and viable heronry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. She concluded her comments by calling on the responsible Federal and State regulatory agencies to halt the continued degradation of the site. <em>Id. </em>The second defendant, the Manomet Bird Observatory, was an environmental organization that had once owned the plaintiff\u2019s land, <em>id. </em>at 544-545; had used it for research, <em>id. </em>at 545; and, along with Parsons, even before the permit application was filed, had been seeking to have the area classified as an \u201carea of critical environmental concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, prior to the solicitation of their comments by the government, these defendants had an independent interest in the controversy and in the preservation of the land that was at the center of the dispute. They were never hired by the government, nor did they serve on behalf of the government to further its interests rather than seek redress for their grievances. These factors supported our determination that the suit against Parsons and the Manomet Bird Observatory was a \u201c \u2018typical\u2019 SLAPP suit,\u201d targeting the defendants for \u201cpetitioning] the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549 n.12.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although their petitioning activity was solicited by State and Federal government officials, <em>id. </em>at 549, the defendants in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra, </em>were none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>theless also engaged in constitutional petitioning activity in their own right and seeking some redress from the government based on their grievances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Because we hold that this case is beyond the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s reach, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute whether the defendant\u2019s affidavit contained the requisite factual basis to support dismissal pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 551-552, 553-554.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">2. <em>Applicability of qualified immunity pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5. </em>General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 5, which grants the board authority to investigate and prosecute disciplinary complaints against licensed physicians, also provides qualified immunity for those who participate in board investigations of physician misconduct. The immunity provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cNo person filing a complaint or reporting or providing information pursuant to this section or assisting the board at its request in any manner in discharging its duties and functions shall be liable in any cause of action arising out of the receiving of such information or assistance, provided the person making the complaint or reporting or providing such information or assistance does so in good faith and without malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><em>Id. </em>The defendant claimed qualified immunity pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, in his special motion to dismiss. The judge, having dismissed the case based on the anti-SLAPP statute, did not reach the issue. We address it briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The parties, relying on various canons of statutory interpretation, ask this court to decide whether the anti-SLAPP statute or G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, is \u201ccontrolling.\u201d This question is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the two statutes. Neither statute \u201ccontrols\u201d because there is no relationship between the two. The anti-SLAPP statute and G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, address different situations and thus represent two separate and independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>defenses potentially available in proceedings of this nature. As discussed above, the anti-SLAPP statute applies to parties exercising their \u201cright of petition under the constitution.\u201d Nothing in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, either enlarges or restricts this protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Where, as in the present case, the defendant files a special motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute and also asserts qualified immunity as an alternative basis for dismissal, the judge first should decide, as he did here, whether to grant the special motion to dismiss. See, e.g., <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 168 (1998) (affirming denial of special motion to dismiss and remanding for further proceedings on other potential bases of immunity). This sequence is dictated by the anti-SLAPP statute, which automatically stays discovery (subject to certain exceptions) and directs the judge to consider the merits of the special motion to dismiss on an expedited basis. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (\u201ccourt shall advance any such special motion so that it may be heard and determined as expeditiously as possible\u201d and \u201c[a]ll discovery proceedings shall be stayed upon the filing of the special motion . . . provided, however, that the court, on motion and after a hearing and for good cause shown, may order that specified discovery be conducted\u201d). If the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the case will be dismissed without any consideration of qualified immunity. It is only when the special motion is denied that the judge shall consider the issue of qualified immunity as an independent basis for dismissal. For a judge to proceed otherwise would frustrate the procedural design of the special motion and the intent of the Legislature. See preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520 (statute designed by Legislature to ensure SLAPP suits will be \u201cresolved quickly with minimum cost\u201d). See also <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 521-522 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004) (\u201cprotections afforded by the anti-SLAPP statute ... are in large measure lost if the petitioner is forced to litigate a case to its conclusion before obtaining a definitive judgment through the appellate process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Because the anti-SLAPP motion was improperly allowed here, we consider the application of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, to this case. The plain language of the statute applies to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>statements to the board and neither party directly contends otherwise. The relevant inquiry on remand is, therefore, whether the defendant\u2019s conclusions were made \u201cin good faith and without malice.\u201d G.

That disagreement does not assist us in identifying where the line should be drawn. The Legislature\u2019s rejection of the Governor\u2019s position, to the extent it has meaning at all, does not illuminate the case presently before us.

See <em>post </em>at 349, 354. The dissent misconstrues today\u2019s holding. We care not whether a defendant seeking dismissal under the anti-SLAPP statute is \u201csincere\u201d in his or her statements; rather, our only concern, as required by the statute, is that the person be truly \u201cpetitioning\u201d the government in the constitutional sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The dissent, <em>post </em>at 352, asserts that in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543 (2001), the court relied on the plain language of the statute in finding the anti-SLAPP statute applicable. See <em>id. </em>at 549.

See <em>post </em>at 345-347. That the common law may provide a witness with absolute immunity says nothing at all about whether the Legislature intended to grant a lesser form of immunity to the defendant under the anti-SLAPP statute.

If the Legislature had not provided its own definition of \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition,\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the various limitations on that term imposed by today\u2019s decision might represent a plausible interpretation of the statute. We are not, however, called on to craft our own definition, or to interpret the statute based on our own understanding of what a party\u2019s \u201cexercise of its right of petition\u201d ought to entail, because the Legislature has defined the term for us. The statute provides that \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d means, inter alla, \u201cany written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the claims against Gastfriend are expressly based on Gastfriend\u2019s having submitted a \u201cwritten . . . statement,\u201d in the form of an affidavit, to an \u201cexecutive . . . body,\u201d the Board of Registration in Medicine (board), see G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 10, in connection with a \u201cproceeding,\u201d a disciplinary proceeding against Kobrin. The conduct for which Gastfriend has been sued thus comes within the literal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>meaning of the term \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition,\u201d as that term is defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The court today sidesteps this straightforward application of the statutory definition by emphasizing the words \u201cits right\u201d in the term \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition,\u201d and claims that the protections of \u00a7 59H must be limited in order not to render those words \u201csuperfluous.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 332-333. However, the statute provides us with the Legislature\u2019s definition of the entire term \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition.\u201d We should look to that definition, not our own assessment of what the words \u201cits right\u201d might connote, if we did not have a definition from the Legislature. The definition itself unambiguously applies to the present case, and no component of the definition is rendered \u201csuperfluous\u201d by that application. Apparently discomfited by the broad scope of the definition (for fear that it would protect \u201cevery statement ever made to a government body,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 333), the court ignores the definition and reads its own limitation into the words being defined. The court then seeks to justify that limitation by suggesting, without citation to any authority, that one\u2019s constitutional right of petition is limited to petitioning on one\u2019s \u201cown\u201d behalf in pursuit of one\u2019s \u201cown interests,\u201d and that the additional phrase \u201cunder the constitution\u201d therefore connotes the Legislature\u2019s desire to limit the protections of \u00a7 59H in the same fashion.

However, such departures from the Legislature\u2019s straightforward wording are rare, reserved for those instances where application of the literal meaning would result in \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d consequences, <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996), quoting <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982), or would \u201cdefeat [the] purpose\u201d of the legislation, <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lehan </em>v. <em>North Main St. Garage, </em>212 Mass. 547, 550 (1942). We should be especially leery of narrowing the literal meaning of this particular definition, as the breadth of the definition was repeatedly criticized by the Governor at the time the statute was being enacted, and the Legislature deliberately chose to reject that criticism and to maintain the definition in its extremely broad form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Today\u2019s opinion acknowledges that history, but concludes that it stands for nothing more than the fact that \u201cthe Legislature rejected the Governor\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 337 n.11. What this history signifies is that the Legislature\u2019s attention was drawn to the fact that the statute\u2019s definitions were very broad indeed, and that they went well beyond the prototypical SLAPP suit. The Legislature\u2019s decision to keep the statute\u2019s broad definitions in the face of the Governor\u2019s repeated objections indicates at a minimum that the breadth of those definitions was not the product of inartful draftsmanship or legislative inadvertence. Given the attention that was paid to the definitions at the time of enactment, we should be even more inclined to interpret the definitions consistent with their literal wording \u2014 their breadth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>is not some drafting error that we need to correct to make the statute comport with the Legislature\u2019s ostensible intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Today\u2019s opinion makes no claim that according the protections of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, to this particular defendant would result in \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d consequences, or that doing so would \u201cdefeat the purpose\u201d of \u00a7 59H. <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>Rather, the court takes it upon itself to narrow the protections of \u00a7 59H to a smaller class of persons that the court finds to be more deserving than expert witnesses who are paid by the government, rather than accept the literal statutory mandate that such protections are to be accorded to all persons \u2014 paid or unpaid, expert or lay, private or officially retained \u2014 submitting \u201cwritten or oral statements]\u201d to governmental bodies in connection with pending proceedings. Before tampering with the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition,\u201d we should consider whether it would be \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d to protect all such persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">There is nothing \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d about protecting all witnesses from lawsuits based on the statements they give during the course of agency proceedings. To the contrary, absolute immunity from suit has long been accorded to witnesses in judicial proceedings, even if their testimony is knowingly false. See <em>Correllas </em>v. Viveiros, 410 Mass. 314, 319-320 (1991); <em>Aborn </em>v. <em>Lipson, </em>357 Mass. 71, 72-73 (1970); <em>Mezullo </em>v. <em>Maletz, </em>331 Mass. 233, 236-237 (1954); <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>191 Mass. 591, 592 (1906); <em>Hoar </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>3 Met. 193, 197 (1841). The privilege is grounded in the view that \u201cit is more important that witnesses be free from fear of civil liability for what they say than that a person who has been defamed by their testimony have a remedy.\u201d <em>Aborn </em>v. <em>Lipson, supra </em>at 72. Massachusetts law recognizing such absolute immunity accords with well-established law across the country. See <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 330-334 (1983), and cases cited; <em>Blevins </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>572 F.2d 1336, 1338 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Brawer </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>535 F.2d 830, 836-837 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Sacks </em>v. <em>Stecker, </em>60 F.2d 73, 75 (2d Cir. 1932) (absolute immunity for witnesses \u201cis the practically universal rule in this country\u201d). This immunity is accorded not merely for statements made as part of a witness\u2019s testimony at trial, but for statements made \u201cin the context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>proposed judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Correllas </em>v. <em>Viveiros, supra </em>at 321.

App. 347, 348 (1973) (affidavit); <em>Overman </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>103 Idaho 795, 800 (1982) (immunity applicable to witness who filed affidavit in child custody proceeding, noting that witness immunity extended \u201cas to virtually any statement in documents which have been filed in a judicial proceeding\u201d); <em>Resciniti </em>v. <em>Padilla, </em>72 A.D.2d 557, 558 (N.Y. 1979) (affidavit); <em>Jarman </em>v. <em>Offutt, </em>239 N.C. 468, 472 (1954) (affidavit); <em>Vieira </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>84 R.I. 299, 301 (1956) (statement in pleadings).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Finally, of particular relevance to the distinction that today\u2019s decision reads into \u00a7 59H, common-law immunity from suit extends to witnesses who are employed by or working for the government \u2014 it is not limited to private persons giving evidence in such proceedings. See <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>LaHue, supra </em>at 335-336 &amp; n.15 (common law provided absolute immunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>all witnesses, \u201cgovernmental or otherwise,\u201d and \u201cdrew no distinction between public officials and private citizens\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 did not override witness immunity for police officers who allegedly testified falsely); <em>Overman </em>v. <em>Klein, supra </em>(witness immunity extended to social worker employed by government agency). See also <em>LaLonde </em>v. <em>Eissner, </em>405 Mass. 207, 211-212 (1989) (absolute immunity for court-appointed experts). Indeed, \u201cto the extent that traditional reasons for witness immunity are less applicable to governmental witnesses, other considerations of public policy support absolute immunity more emphatically for such persons than for ordinary witnesses.\u201d <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>LaHue, supra </em>at 342-343.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">From this vast body of precedent supporting absolute immunity for statements made by any kind of witness in connection with judicial proceedings, the anti-SLAPP statute takes the modest step of extending a more limited degree of immunity to all persons submitting statements in connection with other types of governmental proceedings. There is nothing remarkable, let alone \u201cabsurd or unreasonable,\u201d about protecting all persons who provide government agencies with information in the course of agency adjudications, including those who have been sought out and paid by the government. What is being protected is not merely the \u201crights\u201d of the person submitting such information, but the interests of the government agency in acquiring information germane to the proceedings before it. See preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520 (purposes of anti-SLAPP legislation include encouragement of \u201crobust discussion of issues before legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies\u201d). As with immunity from suit for a witness\u2019s participation in judicial proceedings, immunity for witnesses in agency proceedings removes what might otherwise be a powerful disincentive against participation, a disincentive that would operate to rob the agency itself of the benefit of those witnesses\u2019 information, views, and expertise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agencies themselves are best served by having witnesses and participants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of all types protected from lawsuits stemming from their testimony and participation. Indeed, that such agencies are the functional equivalent of courts, requiring comparable protection for those involved, has long been recognized. See <em>Butz </em>v. <em>Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 512-517 (1978) (absolute immunity accorded to administrative law judges and to agency attorneys presenting case, as they are equivalent of court judges and prosecutors); <em>Bettencourt </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>904 F.2d 772, 782-785 (1st Cir. 1990) (absolute immunity for board and staff members in connection with disciplinary proceedings against physician).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Whereas the common law made witnesses in judicial proceedings absolutely immune from suit, the anti-SLAPP statute, protecting persons making statements in connection with government proceedings, extends a form of protection that is slightly less than absolute immunity. Under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the suit against the person who made the statement will be dismissed unless it can be shown that the person\u2019s statement \u201cwas devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\u201d the burden being on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the participant\u2019s statement lacked such support or basis. The statute also establishes a procedural mechanism to enforce this immunity in a pragmatic way at the outset, before the defendant has been subjected to the expense and anxiety of protracted litigation. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 520-522 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004) (allowing interlocutory appeal from denial of motion to dismiss under \u00a7 59H). Extending such protection to persons who submit information to government agencies, whether they do so on their own personal initiative or as witnesses retained by the government, is an extremely modest extension of the law of witness immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is hardly \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d to include all such persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>within the scope of this protection, and I therefore see no reason to depart from the literal language of \u00a7 59H and carve out an exception merely because the witness\u2019s participation was not in pursuit of \u201ca grievance of his own\u201d or \u201con his own behalf.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Beyond the troubling ramifications today\u2019s decision has for government agencies seeking to obtain opinions from private experts, the case introduces a new and somewhat amorphous argument with which to defeat special motions to dismiss under \u00a7 59H, namely, the argument that the defendant who made the statement to a government agency did not have his or her \u201cown interests\u201d at stake, was not acting on his or her \u201cown behalf,\u201d or lacked the requisite \u201cinterest in\u201d the subject of the proceedings. See <em>ante </em>at 330, 332, 334, 337. Even where the suit in question is unabashedly based on a person\u2019s \u201cstatement\u201d to a government agency in connection with a pending matter, the motives and relationships underlying the person\u2019s decision to give such a statement must apparently be examined to make sure they are sufficiently pure to come within the ambit of the narrower version of \u00a7 59H outlined in today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">While the precise contours of this evaluation of what caused the person to submit a statement to the government agency are unclear, it is apparent that affiliation with the government, or the receipt of filthy lucre, or perhaps a combination of the two, may suffice to taint the person making the statement, such that the person is no longer acting in his or her \u201cstatus as citizen[]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>or exercising a \u201cconstitutional\u201d right and should therefore be deprived of the quasi immunity and procedural protections of \u00a7 59H. <em>Ante </em>at 332, 334-335, 338. The court today posits that there may be persons who are \u201csolicited by the government\u201d to participate in proceedings, but who nevertheless could be protected by \u00a7 59H, as long as that solicitation did not result in \u201cperforming services for the government\u201d or \u201ca mere contractual connection to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 332, 338.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court cites no authority for the proposition that either receipt of compensation for one\u2019s time or agreement to provide the government with information or expert advice deprives someone of the \u201cstatus\u201d of \u201ccitizen\u201d or otherwise curtails someone\u2019s \u201cconstitutional\u201d rights. Yet, according to today\u2019s opinion, such persons are not deserving of protection and must therefore somehow be excluded from the unambiguous definition of \u00a7 59H. Recognizing the ambiguity inherent in its own (as opposed to the Legislature\u2019s) definition, the court acknowledges that \u201csome difficult factual situations will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 332 n.8. The court then muses whether \u00a7 59H would be available to \u201ca government \u2018whistle-blower,\u2019 \u201d apparently tom between the fact that a whistleblower may have \u201cpersonal knowledge and concern\u201d about the matter being reported and the fact that such a whistleblower, working for the government, might just be pursuing the government\u2019s interest. <em>Ante </em>at 340 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Today\u2019s decision casts a pall of uncertainty over the status of many persons who make statements to the government. What if an expert is hired by a petitioner \u2014 will the petitioner\u2019s \u201cown interests\u201d in the matter allow us to extend the protections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00a7 59H to the petitioner\u2019s disinterested expert, <em>ante </em>at 334, or does the fact that the individual expert has no \u201cgrievance of his own,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 330, deprive the expert of those protections? What about lobbyists or lawyers? They are customarily making statements to government officials on behalf of their clients, not on their own behalf, and are compensated for doing so. Is their connection to the proceeding also a \u201cmere contractual connection\u201d that deprives them of protection? See <em>ante </em>at 338. What about persons who testify before agencies after being subpoenaed (by either the agency or by any of the parties) \u2014 such persons submit \u201cstatements]\u201d in connection with the agency proceeding, but if they did not want to make statements of their own volition, are they pursuing their \u201cown\u201d grievances, or exercising their \u201cright of petition under the constitution\u201d? See <em>ante </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In my view, such questions are irrelevant, as the straightforward definition provided by the Legislature does not require us to consider who the person making the statement works for, whether the statement was a product of the declarant\u2019s \u201cown interests,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 334, or what other constellation of factors may have influenced the person to submit a statement to the agency. The definition of \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d contains no reference to the motives or affiliations of the person making the \u201cstatement ... to a legislative, executive, or judicial body,\u201d and special motions to dismiss under \u00a7 59H should not be bogged down by such considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The elusive nature of the additional element that the court has inserted into \u00a7 59H is best illustrated by the difficulty the court has in conjuring some distinction between the present case and <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543 (2001). There, as here, a government agency solicited the views of an outside expert in order to assist the agency, and that expert was then sued for the statements she had made in rendering her opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There, as here, the plaintiff argued that the anti-SLAPP statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>was not applicable. Rather than engage in any analysis of the expert\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in the controversy\u201d that predated the government\u2019s solicitation of her input, <em>ante </em>at 339, the court in <em>Baker </em>reasoned that \u201cthe plain language of the statute . . . squarely encompasses the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 549. The case came within that \u201cplain language\u201d because \u201cParsons, a biologist, responded to inquiries from State and Federal environmental officials, in connection with government agency reviews of Baker\u2019s application to develop property by constructing a pier on an island that has historically been a home for many aquatic birds. As a result of her responses, Baker eventually sued Parsons and the nonprofit organization for which she works, thus, according to the defendants, \u2018chilling\u2019 any further participation by the defendants in assisting State and Federal agencies gathering information on the merits of Baker\u2019s application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That same \u201cplain language\u201d analysis can be applied to the present case using the exact same reasoning: Gastfriend, a physician, responded to inquiries from the board, in connection with the board\u2019s review of Kobrin\u2019s fitness to practice medicine. As a result of his responses, Kobrin eventually sued Gastfriend, thus, according to the defendant, \u201cchilling\u201d any further participation by him in assisting the government in any proceeding against Kobrin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In attempting to craft some distinction between Gastfriend\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>status in the present case and Parsons\u2019s status in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra, </em>the court claims that Gastfriend was \u201cserv[ing] on behalf of the government to further its interests,\u201d whereas Parsons was \u201cseek[ing] redress for [her] grievances.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 339. That Parsons was pursuing her \u201cown\u201d grievance was demonstrated by the fact that she had \u201cpersonally\u201d conducted research on the island site at issue, and thereby had an \u201cinterest\u201d in the preservation of the island that was formed \u201cprior to the solicitation of [her] comments by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gastfriend, by comparison, only articulated his views after he was \u201chired by the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">This proffered distinction between Parsons and Gastfriend assumes that an expert who starts out as a neutral, disinterested expert solicited (and paid) by an agency cannot thereafter become a genuine petitioner who, having become familiar with the facts and circumstances, develops his \u201cown\u201d desire to see the government take a particular action. To the extent that it was Parsons\u2019s sincere view about the undesirability of the proposed pier construction that made her a viable candidate for protection under \u00a7 59H, how can we tell that, by the time he submitted his affidavit, Gastfriend was not equally sincere in his view that Kobrin should not be allowed to practice medicine? May not an initially neutral physician, who starts out with no knowledge of the physician being disciplined, review the information made available to him and then become indignant at what he views as dangerously substandard medical practice, and thus intensely desirous that the offending physician\u2019s license be revoked? While Gastfriend did not have such views at the time the board first contacted him, because he at that time knew nothing of Kobrin or the deaths of his patients (that ignorance, in the court\u2019s view, being a feature that makes him distinguishable from Parsons, <em>ante </em>at 338), who is to say that he had not developed an \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of the matter by the time he submitted his affidavit? Having learned about Kobrin\u2019s practice, may not Gastfriend have developed his \u201cown\u201d concern for the image of his profession, or his \u201cown\u201d compassion for patients who were, in his opinion, at risk of dying from Kobrin\u2019s improper practices, and thus have his \u201cown\u201d interest in seeing Kobrin\u2019s license suspended? If he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>developed the requisite desire that the government take action against Kobrin, why would his agreement to review the records and render an opinion diminish his \u201cconstitutional\u201d right as a \u201ccitizen\u201d to express his views to the governmental body that had the power to suspend Kobrin\u2019s license? The court today cynically assumes that Gastfriend, having begun as a \u201chired gun,\u201d would forever be a \u201chired gun\u201d and would not actually care about the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against Kobrin, whereas Parsons, because she had already studied the island habitat in question, subconsciously cared about the outcome of the pier permit proceedings before she even knew about them. There is nothing in this record to suggest that, at the time he submitted his affidavit, Gastfriend actually had no preference as to what the board did with Kobrin\u2019s license. Indeed, it is insulting to suggest that, for money, Gastfriend was simply saying whatever \u201cthe board\u201d or \u201cthe government\u201d wanted him to say, and thus merely acting \u201con behalf of the board\u201d or \u201cthe government.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at 333, 339. If, as today\u2019s decision states, \u00a7 59H will not apply if the person making the statement to the governmental body lacks some \u201cinterest\u201d in the matter, there is no basis on which to conclude that Gastfriend ultimately lacked such an \u201cinterest\u201d in the matter before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I see nothing to be gained, and much to be lost, in requiring such parsing of motives as part of a special motion to dismiss under \u00a7 59H. In my view, nothing in \u00a7 59H suggests that its protections hinge on the manner in which the person making the statement came to know or care about the agency proceedings in question. Only by reading such irrelevant considerations into the statute, and then assuming that Gastfriend cannot satisfy those irrelevant considerations, does the court deny him the protections of \u00a7 59H. Gastfriend, and the many other expert witnesses who assist a wide array of government agencies, are entitled to those protections under the unambiguous wording of the statute\u2019s definition, and it is in the best interests of both the witnesses and the agencies that such witnesses be accorded those protections in the prompt manner that \u00a7 59H envisions. I see no indication that the Legislature intended to deny such witnesses those protections, and therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Specifically, when the first enactment of the bill was sent to the Governor, he vetoed it, explaining that the bill as drafted \u201capplies to a broad group of potential claims, sweeping in cases that are far beyond the types of lawsuits which the bill\u2019s proponents wish to control,\u201d and noting the stringent consequences for any claim \u201cfalling within its broad definition.\u201d Letter from Governor William F.

When the Legislature passed another bill using the same \u201cbroad definition\u201d (see 1994 House J. 1118; 1994 Senate J. 1294), the Governor again articulated his concern about the ostensible overbreadth of the bill and recommended an amendment to narrow its scope. 1994 House Doc. 5570. When the bill passed again without amendment (see 1994 House J. 1247; 1994 Senate J. 1418), the Governor again expressed the view that it was too broad and, for that reason, vetoed it.

L. c. 112, \u00a7 5. That statute precludes imposition of liability as long as the person complaining, reporting, or assisting did so \u201cin good faith and without malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The anti-SLAPP statute substitutes a more stringent qualification of the immunity that is granted, i.e., the immunity is lost only if the person\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ment \u201cwas devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. And, to give teeth to that immunity, the anti-SLAPP statute makes available a procedural vehicle ensuring that the immunity issue will be addressed promptly. Given that the Legislature had already extended some degree of immunity to persons \u201cassisting the board,\u201d it cannot be \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d for the Legislature to tighten that immunity somewhat, create procedures to enforce it, and extend it to all persons who are \u201cassisting\u201d government agencies by giving \u201coral or written statement[s]\u201d to those agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Today\u2019s decision correctly holds that, notwithstanding G.

Under today\u2019s ruling, biased experts who are compensated by agencies can perhaps claim the protection of \u00a7 59H when they are sued for rendering faulty opinions, because they can demonstrate that they had their \u201cown\u201d interest in the outcome of the matter before they were retained.
