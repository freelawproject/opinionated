G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b) (4). Her conviction was affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>415 Mass. 447 (1993). Based on a reference to her case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213 (2002),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), in which she alleged that we \u201cdisapproved\u201d the court\u2019s 1993 decision affirming her conviction and the denial of her motion to suppress, and that we \u201cacknowledge[d] that the [c]curt made a serious error\u201d in deciding her direct appeal. She argued that in the circumstances justice and fundamental fairness require that she be granted a new hearing on her motion to suppress physical evidence seized pursuant to a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. A judge in the Superior Court agreed, allowed her motion, and ordered a new trial. The Commonwealth appeals from the order granting a new trial, arguing primarily that the defendant\u2019s motion is barred by principles of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A_2\">1. <em>Procedural issues. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth has waived the defense of issue preclusion because it was not raised until the Commonwealth filed a motion to reconsider the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief. An issue first raised in a motion for reconsideration may be preserved for appellate review, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casey (No. 1), </em>442 Mass. 1, 2 (2004), provided the motion for reconsideration is filed within the period allotted for taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>an appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 197 (1985). The Commonwealth timely filed its motion for reconsideration, but it did not file a notice of appeal from the denial of its motion. In the circumstances, the denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration is not before us. We look, therefore, to the Commonwealth\u2019s original opposition to the defendant\u2019s rule 30 (b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Although the Commonwealth did not use the term \u201cissue preclusion\u201d in its original opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief, it did assert in its opposition that \u201cthe issues raised in [the defendant\u2019s rule 30 (b)] motion have been decided against her on direct appeal.\u201d There can be no doubt that the Commonwealth was referring there to principles of issue preclusion, even if the Commonwealth did not precisely identify it as such. We are satisfied that the question has been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Commonwealth argues that rule 30 (b) is not the appropriate mechanism for seeking review of a pretrial motion previously decided in the trial court and affirmed on appeal, especially where the defendant had only requested a rehearing on her motion to suppress. We disagree. \u201cRule 30 was adopted in 1979 as the exclusive vehicle for postconviction relief.\u201d <em>Leaster </em>v. Commonwealth, 385 Mass. 547, 549 (1982). A motion for a new trial under rule 30 (b) may include a request to reconsider a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 764 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cacicio, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 945 (1991). A postconviction motion seeking a new hearing on a motion to suppress evidence will be treated as a motion for a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 716 (1997) (postconviction motion to withdraw guilty plea is treated as motion for new trial). The judge properly considered the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">2. <em>Issue preclusion. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the defendant is estopped, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, from relitigating her motion to suppress in her rule 30 (b) motion. Where, as here, the issue actually litigated arises from the same indictment, the principle of issue preclusion is more appropriately referred to as direct estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Collateral estoppel usually involves the application of issue preclusion in a subsequent action of a different claim between the same parties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>431 Mass. 71, 74 n.4 (2000), citing Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 17 comment c, at 149-150 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">For direct estoppel to apply, the Commonwealth must show that the issues raised in the defendant\u2019s rule 30 (b) motion were actually litigated and determined on the defendant\u2019s original motion to suppress, that such determination was essential to the defendant\u2019s conviction, and that the defendant had an opportunity to obtain review of the determination of her motion to suppress. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 74; <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 863 n.4 (1983) (\u201cUnder the doctrine of issue preclusion, \u2018[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 [1982]\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ringuette, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 357, <em>S.C., </em>443 Mass. 1003 (2004), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Levasseur, </em>699 F. Supp. 965, 981 (D. Mass.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 846 F.2d 786 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 894 (1988) (similar analysis under collateral estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The requirements of direct estoppel have been met here. The defendant has consistently taken the position that \u201c[t]he facts and the law are literally the same\u201d today as they were in 1993, when her direct appeal was decided, and that the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, </em>387 Mass. 413 (1982), remains the controlling law in the area of no-knock warrants, as it was in 1993. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 216-217 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>415 Mass. 447, 450-451 (1993). The validity of the no-knock warrant, which was raised in the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, was also addressed in the defendant\u2019s direct appeal. It was an essential issue in her case. <em>Id. </em>at 448-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The defendant raises no new factual or legal issue in her rule 30 (b) motion. She simply seeks to relitigate her motion to suppress based on her assertion that her direct appeal was decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>wrongly. We conclude that principles of direct estoppel operate as a bar to the defendant\u2019s attempt in her rule 30 (b) motion to relitigate issues in her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The defendant contends that because we acknowledged in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra, </em>that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>was decided wrongly, \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair to procedurally bar [her] from collaterally attacking the validity of her conviction.\u201d Rule 30 (b), she argues, is intended to remedy a miscarriage of justice that the court has acknowledged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 690 (2002) (postconviction relief should be granted under rule 30 [b] when \u201cit appears that justice may not have been done\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that rule 30 (b) contemplates relief in the highly unusual circumstances asserted by the defendant, the flaw in her argument is that we did not, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra, </em>say or imply that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>had been decided wrongly. Our reference to the <em>Rodriguez </em>case was limited to the safety aspect described in the affidavit in support of the application for the no-knock warrant. We did not address the aspect of the affidavit in support of the application for the no-knock warrant that spoke of the destruction of contraband. In addition, we did not address the circumstances that existed at the time of the execution of the warrant that justified the entry without knocking and announcing.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">This court concluded in the <em>Rodriguez </em>case that the affidavit \u201cprovided probable cause to believe that the object of the search, the contraband, would be destroyed\u201d unless a no-knock warrant issued. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 450, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, supra </em>at 421. To support this conclusion, we quoted the affidavit that accompanied the application for the no-knock warrant: \u201c[T]he faces of narcotics officers are well known to drug dealers in the area who could warn of our arrival and result in the destruction of evidence or the escape of suspects before we are able to secure them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 449 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The court also concluded in the <em>Rodriguez </em>case that the no-knock entry was justified by circumstances that existed at the time of execution of the warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 450-451, citing <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Scalise, supra. </em>The judge who considered the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress here found that while one officer was at the home of the clerk-magistrate applying for the warrant, other officers were conducting surveillance and saw \u201cthe occupant of the apartment to be searched [repeatedly] coming to the picture window fronting on Main Street, parting the curtains and looking up and down the street.\u201d He further found that after the warrant had issued, the occupant \u201cwas again at the front window and acting nervous.\u201d The search occurred within fifteen minutes of the time the warrant issued. The judge also found that \u201cthe nature of the neighborhood where the apartment was located was unchanged and the raid was being conducted in the early evening. The possibility of warning, escape and destruction of contraband were unchanged\u201d from what had been communicated to the clerk magistrate fifteen minutes earlier. Thus, neighborhood familiarity with the narcotics officers and the look-out activity of the occupant of the apartment at about, the time the warrant was actually executed justified entry without knocking and announcing.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the order granting the defendant a new trial is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of an order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 220 n.5 (2002), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cIn <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>415 Mass. 447, 448-451 (1993), we upheld a no-knock entry on grounds of likely destruction of evidence and danger to the officers conducting the search even though there was no specific information that weapons might be present. This decision was issued before <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385 (1997). To the extent that the <em>Rodriguez </em>decision might be read to hold that an affidavit merely stating that in the affiant\u2019s experience handguns are \u2018a danger to law enforcement agents during drug related searches,\u2019 without specific information regarding the search to be undertaken, is an adequate basis for waiver of the knock and announce rule, <em>id. </em>at 451, it is a reading that is no longer apt in light of <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra. </em>This is not to say that an affidavit specifically detailing police experience in dealing with drug dealers associated with a particular criminal enterprise or in a particular community (of which the suspects might be a part) would not suffice, but such an affidavit would need more than the general averments contained here.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b728-7\">Sosman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATqq\">(concurring). For the reasons stated in my dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 222-237 (2002) (Sosman, J., dissenting), I believe that the present case was correctly decided on the grounds originally stated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>415 Mass. 447, 451 (1993). Specifically, the officer\u2019s experience that \u201chandguns were a danger to law enforcement agents during drug-related searches,\u201d coupled with the fact that the defendant \u201cdealt in large quantities of cocaine and was \u2018fronting\u2019 cocaine to be sold on the street,\u201d sufficed \u2014 by itself \u2014 to justify the inclusion of a no-knock provision in the warrant. <em>Id. </em>To the extent that this court criticized that justification in its later decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>supra </em>at 220 n.5, on the theory that it had been undermined by <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385 (1997), the criticism was unwarranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra </em>at 233-235 (Sosman, J., dissenting). While I agree that additional details supplied in the warrant application in this case, referenced in a footnote <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 449 n.1), would also support the issuance of a warrant with a no-knock provision, the grounds set forth in the text of the court\u2019s earlier opinion were sound and do not need to be bolstered. It is the erroneous analysis in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra </em>at 218-220, that has, unfortunately, made it necessary for the court to resort to the alternative grounds set forth in today\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
