Asserting both negligence and breach of contract claims, the plaintiff alleged that the BHA, with respect to both tenancies, breached its duty to inspect for the presence of immediate lead hazards and failed to enforce proper elimination of the lead hazards and, with respect to the first tenancy, failed to ascertain that all required certifications pertaining to lead paint had been issued and were valid. A judge in the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department allowed the BHA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and judgment entered dismissing all claims against the BHA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion and deem the appeal appropriate for decision, despite other pending claims, because of the important issues involved. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 54, 365 Mass. 820 (1974). We conclude that the judge erred in allowing summary judgment on the plaintiffs contract claims. We vacate the judgment in part and remand the case to the Housing Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The material undisputed facts, for purposes of the motion, are as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff was born on July 16, 1977. Along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>with her mother, the plaintiff resided at 90 Capen Street in the Dorchester section of Boston from 1977 until 1979. Thereafter, from 1979 to 1981, the plaintiff and her mother resided at 9 Warner Street, also in Dorchester. Both residences were privately owned housing units.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The BHA received funds from the Federal government and subsidized the rent of the plaintiff\u2019s family at the Capen Street and Warner Street residences. With respect to the Capen Street tenancy, the BHA subsidized the plaintiff\u2019s family\u2019s rent pursuant to the provisions of the then applicable Section 23 Public Housing Leasing Program of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421 (b) (Section 23 program). Regarding the Warner Street tenancy, the BHA subsidized the plaintiff\u2019s family\u2019s rent pursuant to the provisions of the then applicable Section 8 Housing Assistance Program of the United States Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437 et seq. (Section 8 program). To receive the funds to participate in both the Section 23 and Section 8 programs, the BHA entered into Annual Contributions Contracts (AC contracts) with the United States Department' of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Housing Assistance Payments contracts (HAP contracts) with the owners of the subject housing units. Both the Section 23 and Section 8 programs imposed contractual and regulatory obligations on the BHA to inspect the leased premises for lead-based paint hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">With respect to the Capen Street tenancy, the BHA\u2019s Section 23 AC contract provides that the \u201cLocal Authority,\u201d here the BHA, \u201cshall require as a condition for the making of housing assistance payments, that the Owner at all times maintain the Project in decent, safe, and sanitary condition.\u201d In addition, the AC contract obligated the BHA to inspect the premises \u201cprior to commencement of occupancy,\u201d and thereafter, at least annually \u201cto assure that decent, safe, and sanitary housing accommodations are being provided.\u201d Under the Section 23 HAP contract, the BHA agreed to \u201cinspect, or cause to be inspected, at least annually, the Premises to determine that they are in decent, safe, and sanitary condition.\u201d Regulations in effect at the time imposed the following obligations on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>property owners and local housing authorities in order for the leased premises to satisfy the \u201cdecent, safe, and sanitary\u201d standard. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.102 (a) (1977). The obligations as to owners were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cThe owner shall provide either (i) a certification from the authorized local government official or a qualified laboratory that exposed interior and exterior surfaces are free of lead based paint hazards, or (ii) a certification by the owner that those surfaces have been adequately treated or covered, all in accordance with the applicable HUD regulations issued pursuant to the Lead Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 4801.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 802.102 (a) (2). Local housing authorities were required to proceed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201cBefore approving a lease, the [local housing authority] shall make appropriate inquiries to ascertain that all certifications required by law have been issued and are currently valid. In addition, the [local housing authority] shall inspect the unit, or cause it to be inspected, for compliance with all other requirements of \u00a7 802.102(a). An inspection report shall be maintained by the [local housing authority] for each unit inspected specifying whether required certifications, if any, have been issued and the results of the inspection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 802.205 (g) (3) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">With respect to the Warner Street tenancy, the BHA\u2019s HAP contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">\u201cThe [public housing authority] shall inspect or cause to be inspected the Contract Unit and related facilities at least annually and at such other times (including prior to initial occupancy of the unit) as may be necessary to assure that the Owner is meeting his obligation to maintain the unit in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Under regulations promulgated by HUD, the BHA was required to inspect the premises prior to approving the lease to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>determine that the premises are \u201cmaintained in [d]ecent, [s]afe, and [s]anitary condition,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 882.116 (o) (1979), and was required to inspect the premises at least annually \u201cto assure that the Owner is meeting his obligations to maintain the unit in [d]ecent, [s]afe, and [s]anitary condition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 882.211 (b). The standard for maintaining a \u201cdecent, safe, and sanitary condition\u201d included the requirement that the unit comply with HUD regulations relating to lead-based paint issued pursuant to the Lead Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4801. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 882.102 and 882.109. Those regulations state that \u201c[p]rior to the occupancy of HUD-associated housing, immediate hazards shall be eliminated by the most practicable means. For this purpose, all defective paint conditions shall be assumed to be immediate hazards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 35.24 (a). The regulation defines \u201c[immediate hazard\u201d to include \u201cpaint (which may contain lead) on applicable surfaces which is cracking, scaling, chipping, peeling or loose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 35.3 (i). The HUD lead-based paint regulations made the local housing authority, the BHA, responsible for conducting visual inspections of the premises to determine whether an immediate hazard existed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 35.24 (b) (1) (v).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The plaintiff suffered lead-based paint poisoning as a result of inhalation or ingestion of lead-based paint while she lived at both the Capen Street and Warner Street residences. Chipping and flaking lead paint was present in both residences, in violation of both the Section 23 and Section 8 program requirements, while the plaintiff resided in each residence. The BHA did not obtain certification concerning the absence or treatment of lead-based paint hazards as required by the Section 23 regulations, particularly 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.102 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">At various times before her Capen Street tenancy, the plaintiff\u2019s mother attended meetings or met with BHA employees responsible for administering the Section 23 program. Some of these meetings were part of the Section 23 application and orientation process. At one orientation meeting (a group meeting), the plaintiff\u2019s mother stated that the BHA informed the group that they \u201cwere all entitled to safe, afford<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>able, and decent housing, and the apartment would be inspected to ensure the quality . . . of the living arrangements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">After the plaintiff\u2019s mother had moved into the Capen Street address, she complained to a BHA inspector about some problems with the apartment, including peeling and flaking paint. The inspector assured her that \u201cit would be taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The first time the plaintiff\u2019s mother discussed the issue of lead paint with the BHA was after the plaintiff was found to have elevated blood lead levels. On numerous occasions, she explained her daughter\u2019s condition to the BHA and the need to remove the lead-based paint from the premises. BHA inspectors wrote down what the plaintiff\u2019s mother had said but did not otherwise respond to her statements. The inspectors never told her what, if anything, they planned to do in response to her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">During her first week at the Warner Street apartment, the plaintiff\u2019s mother made numerous telephone calls to the BHA complaining about the condition of the apartment. In complaining to the BHA, she specifically mentioned the existence of chipping, flaking, or peeling paint in the apartment. The plaintiff\u2019s mother did not recall whether anyone from the BHA ever made any statements to her regarding lead or lead paint. However, she was assured by a BHA inspector that \u201cthe apartment would be made sanitary and clean and according to standards for [her] and [her] family.\u201d The BHA inspector assured the plaintiff\u2019s mother that \u201cthey would take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The plaintiff brought suit against the BHA and the owners of the Capen Street and Warner Street apartments in June, 1998. The BHA moved for summary judgment arguing that, as a public employer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the exemptions set forth in \u00a7 10 (f) and (j) of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, which were enacted in 1994 (the 1994 amendments), rendered it immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>from suit on the plaintiff\u2019s claims. See St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 57.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The BHA also argued that there was no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that it made any \u201cexplicit and specific assurances of safety or assistance\u201d as contemplated in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (j) (1), see note 4, <em>supra, </em>the saving provision of the exclusion contained in \u00a7 10 <em>(f). </em>The judge allowed the BHA\u2019s summary judgment motion, rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s claims that retroactive application of the 1994 amendments (specifically, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 [f] and [j]), to her contract-based claims violates the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States (\u201cNo state shall. . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts\u201d), and that genuine issues of material fact existed concerning whether the BHA made \u201cexplicit and specific assurances of safety or assistance\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 10 (j) (1). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>1. The judge erred in concluding that retroactive application of the 1994 amendments to the plaintiff\u2019s contract-based claims against the BHA did not violate the contract clause. The governing principles on the contract clause issue are stated in <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>431 U.S. 1 (1977), and <em>Massachusetts Community College Council </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 126 (1995). The contract clause is \u201cone of the few express limitations on [S]tate power.\u201d <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>at 14. It \u201climits the power of the States to modify their own contracts as well as to regulate those between private parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. The contract clause, however, \u201cdoes not prohibit the States from repealing or amending statutes generally, or from enacting legislation with retroactive effects\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><em>A </em>contract clause violation exists only if several factors are satisfied. \u201cThe first consideration under the Contract Clause is whether subsequent State action has in fact impaired any enforceable contractual obligation.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Community College Council </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 131. The next inquiry is \u201cwhether the impairment is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if a substantial impairment exists, the impairment still may be constitutional if \u201cit is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. The State carries the burden of making this latter showing. <em>Id. </em>at 133. In a case like this, a \u201ccomplete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because the State\u2019s self-interest is at stake.\u201d <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The parties agree that the judge correctly relied on the case of <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>404 Mass. 689 (1989), in finding an enforceable contractual obligation under a third-party beneficiary theory, specifically, that the plaintiff was an intended third-party beneficiary under the Section 23 and Section 8 program HAP contracts with respect to the BHA\u2019s obligation to inspect the premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the <em>Ayala </em>case, two minor children of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>a Section 8 tenant (their mother) brought an action seeking damages for lead-based paint poisoning against the BHA, the Section 8 administrator that had entered into an AC contract with HUD and into an HAP contract with the owner of the apartment in which the children had resided. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 694. We concluded that the plaintiffs were third-party beneficiaries of the AC contracts and HAP contracts to the extent those contracts dealt with lead-based paint hazards. <em>Id. </em>at 699. Because the BHA was a \u201cpublic employer\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1, we also concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims resulting from the BHA\u2019s breach of its contractual obligations under the AC and HAP contracts were subject to the requirements and limitations of G. L. c. 258. <em>Id. </em>at 703-704.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The parties also do not dispute that the judge correctly determined that the 1994 amendments, adopted well after the <em>Ayala </em>decision, in fact impaired an enforceable obligation on the part of the BHA. This is so because the 1994 amendments, except for the one narrow exception contained in \u00a7 10 (j) (1), see note 4, <em>supra, </em>have the effect of barring the plaintiff\u2019s third-party beneficiary contractual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Turning to the second consideration in the applicable legal framework, we reject the BHA\u2019s contention that no \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d could have occurred because, when the contracts at issue were executed, there was no declared third-party beneficiary contractual rights recognized by judicial decision or otherwise. The fact that no one sought, prior to the <em>Ayala </em>decision, to have a court recognize and enforce such rights does not justify a legal conclusion that the rights did not exist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, the BHA\u2019s contention ignores a relevant consideration, namely, that the 1994 amendments postdate the <em>Ayala </em>decision. Certainly, if there had been any ambiguity whether third-party beneficiary rights existed, the <em>Ayala </em>decision put the ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>to rest. The BHA\u2019s contention is better left for consideration in deciding whether the impairment was reasonable. At that stage, we must assess whether the BHA satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the impairment was both reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We agree with the judge that the 1994 amendments substantially impair the plaintiff\u2019s third-party beneficiary claims in this case. With the one limited exception in \u00a7 10 (j) (1), the Legislature insulated public employers from liability resulting from the general failure to conduct health or safety inspections, the inadequate or negligent performance of such inspections, or the failure to take adequate steps to prevent or diminish the harmful consequences resulting from the tortious conduct of a third person (where the original tortious act was not caused by the public employer). G. L. c. 258, \u00a710 <em>(f) </em>and (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We turn now to whether the judge correctly concluded that the BHA satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the impairment was both reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. While the judge extensively examined various factors in determining the reasonableness of the impairment, such as the extent of the impairment and the importance of the public purpose served, see <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>at 27, 29, he entirely omitted any discussion of the required element that the impairment be necessary. Protection of the public treasury is generally unacceptable to support impairment of a contract. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 29. Repudiation of the <em>Ayala </em>decision by the 1994 amendments would also not suffice to make the impairment necessary. See <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>at 30 (examining whether action taken was essential and whether other means existed to achieve public goal in determining whether impairment is necessary). Lowering the maximum amount of liability under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, to an amount less than the statutory cap of $100,000 was one alternative that could have protected public funds. Adding an exclusion in the relevant contracts expressly stating that the BHA could not be held liable to third parties under the contracts, such as had been inserted in the relevant AC and HAP contracts in <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, </em>425 Mass. 79, 82 &amp; n.3 (1997), would have rendered the <em>Ayala </em>decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>irrelevant. The BHA failed to meet its difficult burden of proving the impairment was necessary. The substantial impairment resulting from the retroactive application of the 1994 amendments is not constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In light of the BHA\u2019s and judge\u2019s reliance on the <em>Barnes </em>decision, we must clarify a few points. The facts in the <em>Barnes </em>case are similar to the facts of this case, and the facts in the <em>Ayala </em>case. The plaintiffs, a child and her mother, had been tenants in a federally subsidized rental assistance program administered by a State agency, the Metropolitan Housing Assistance Program (METHAP). <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, supra </em>at 80. The plaintiffs alleged that METHAP breached its obligations under its AC and HAP contracts to inspect for and provide safe housing, and that the breach led to the lead poisoning of the child at the leased premises. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">What distinguishes the <em>Barnes </em>case from this case and the <em>Ayala </em>decision is that the applicable AC and HAP contracts in <em>Barnes </em>contained \u201cclauses explicitly excluding METHAP\u2019s liability to third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82 &amp; n.3. Nevertheless, the Housing Court judge, relying on the <em>Ayala </em>decision, concluded that the exclusionary clauses, even in light of the saving provision appearing in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (j) (1), were unenforceable as contrary to public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83. The judge refused to give G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (f), retroactive effect \u201cbecause he found that METHAP\u2019s contractual duties to the plaintiffs had vested prior to the enactment and the contract clause . . . subjects \u2018a [S]tatecreated impairment of its own obligations . . . to . . . scrutiny,\u2019 which it cannot survive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Based on the existence of the exclusionary clauses in the AC and HAP contracts, we concluded that METHAP owed no contractual duty to the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. Rather than stating that the <em>Ayala </em>decision was grounded in public policy considerations as is suggested by the BHA and the judge, we concluded in the <em>Barnes </em>decision that the Housing Court judge in that case improperly relied on <em>Ayala </em>to void the exclusionary clauses as against public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 85. With respect to the argument made by the plaintiffs in the <em>Barnes </em>case that the retroactive application of \u00a7 10 (f) to the contracts in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>would violate the contract clause, we explained that such a violation could not occur because no contractual obligation existed due to the exclusionary clauses. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86. The <em>Barnes </em>decision did <em>not </em>overrule the <em>Ayala </em>decision in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The BHA argues that the judge correctly concluded that no contract clause violation occurred because, as in the <em>Barnes </em>decision, there is \u201cnot the kind of retroactive varying of a State\u2019s contractual obligation to which the contract clause is addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. The quotation is misconstrued. There was no \u201cretroactive varying\u201d because the AC and HAP contracts in the <em>Barnes </em>case contained exclusions that had the same effect as \u00a7 10 (f). There were no such exclusionary clauses in the contracts in this case so the same conclusion cannot be drawn here. Further, the case of <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Romein, </em>503 U.S. 181, 186-187 (1992), is distinguishable because no contractual obligation was found in that case, and, consequently, the United States Supreme Court never reached \u201cthe questions of impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">2. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s contention that a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning whether the BHA\u2019s various verbal assurances to her mother about the condition of the leased premises were the kind of \u201cexplicit and specific assurances of safety or assistance\u201d contemplated under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (j) (1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the plaintiff\u2019s mother stated her concerns to BHA representatives regarding peeling and flaking paint in both the Capen Street and Warner Street apartments, that concern was one of several concerns or complaints she had lodged. The various responses by BHA inspectors, including that \u201cit would be taken care of,\u201d her apartment would be made \u201csanitary and clean,\u201d she was entitled to \u201csafe, affordable, and decent housing,\u201d and \u201cthey would take care of it,\u201d did not constitute \u201cexplicit and specific assurances\u201d that \u201cthe premises [were] free of lead paint hazards.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, supra </em>at 87. The responses contain no definitiveness, are not fixed, and do not state, with any reasonable measure of assurance, that the BHA was actually going to de-lead the premises or otherwise address the lead-based paint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>issues in a specified manner. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 406, 410 (1996) (explaining that term \u201cexplicit\u201d \u201cmean[s] a spoken or written assurance, not one implied from the conduct of the parties or the situation,\u201d and term \u201cspecific\u201d means \u201cthe terms of the assurance must be definite, fixed, and free from ambiguity\u201d). The plaintiff argues that because the BHA knew of the scope and extent of its own legal duty concerning lead-based paint hazards, the assurances made by the BHA inspectors were in fact specific. Where none of the BHA inspectors ever mentioned lead paint or lead paint hazards in any of their responses, however, the plaintiff\u2019s argument in essence is \u201cthe sort of assurance \u2018implied from the conduct of the parties or the situation,\u2019 \u201d see <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>and amounted only to \u201cgeneral representations\u201d under \u00a7 10 (j) (1). Because no genuine issue of material fact exists concerning whether the BHA\u2019s responses and assurances were sufficiently specific and explicit to satisfy \u00a7 10 (j) (1), the judge correctly allowed summary judgment in favor of the BHA on the plaintiff\u2019s claims of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">3. The order of the judge allowing summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s contract claims, Count IV and Count VIII of the amended complaint, is vacated, and we reverse the judgment as to those counts (Count IV and Count VIII of the amended complaint). The order and judgment with respect to Counts III and VII, asserting negligence claims, are affirmed.
