His motion for a new trial, alleging that he had been incompetent to stand trial and had been denied the effective assistance of counsel, was denied after an evidentiary hearing. His appeal from the denial of that motion was consolidated with his direct appeal. On appeal, the defendant contends that (1) the evidence was insufficient to establish deliberate premeditation (the only theory of murder in the first degree submitted to the jury); (2) the judge\u2019s instructions erroneously defined malice; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument misstated the evidence and improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify; (4) his motion for a new trial should have been allowed, as he had become incompetent to stand trial by the time he had to decide whether to testify; and (5) his attorney rendered ineffective assistance with respect to the defendant\u2019s claimed lack of competency and his decision not to testify, and with respect to his opening statement (during which counsel told the jury that the defendant would testify to a version of the killing that inculpated the Commonwealth\u2019s immunized witness). He also asks that we exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant a new trial. For the following reasons, we affirm the conviction, affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">1. <em>Facts, </em>a. <em>Evidence at trial. </em>We summarize the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The victim, James Pierce, was a regular customer at a bar in Malden known as the R &amp; R Lounge (R &amp; R), owned by the family of Dennis Trodden. Pierce and Trodden had been friends for many years, and Trodden was godfather to Pierce\u2019s daughter. The defendant also frequented the R &amp; R, and spent time there with both Pierce and Trodden. On September 14, 1993, Pierce engaged in a brief \u201cbeer brawl\u201d with another customer, Dennis Alera, resulting in Pierce being cut on the face and Alera being ejected from the bar. Such altercations were not uncommon at the R &amp; R, but had never resulted in any legal trouble for the bar or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the Trodden family. Concerned about medical bills and possible scarring on his face, Pierce filed a criminal complaint against Alera in the wake of the September 14 incident. Alera, who worked as a fire fighter, wanted the charges dropped. Members of the Trodden family, who worked at the bar and knew both men, were encouraging Pierce to settle his dispute with Alera, and Pierce ultimately told Dennis Trodden that he would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">On October 4, 1993, the defendant and Dennis Trodden spent the evening drinking at the R &amp; R, then went across the street to the Kohala Restaurant. Pierce was also at the R &amp; R that night. At around midnight, Pierce went over to the Kohala Restaurant, where he spoke briefly with the defendant outside of Trodden\u2019s hearing, and then returned to the R &amp; R. At closing time, around 1:30 a.m., Pierce left the bar and drove off in his own vehicle heading in the direction of his home in Everett. The Kohala Restaurant was also closing, and the defendant and Trodden came out, got into the defendant\u2019s vehicle, and began driving in the opposite direction, headed toward the defendant\u2019s home to continue drinking. They encountered Pierce\u2019s vehicle, and the defendant honked his horn, stopped, and invited Pierce to join them. Pierce turned his vehicle around and followed them to the defendant\u2019s house a short distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">When the three were inside the defendant\u2019s home, the defendant provided them with beer and requested that they go out on the porch, as they were being too noisy in the house (where the defendant\u2019s wife was trying to sleep). Trodden and Pierce went out, while the defendant went into his bedroom and then joined them outside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, again protesting that they were being too loud, recommended that they cut through a fence in back and walk along the railroad tracks to an all-night gasoline station where they could buy cigarettes. They followed his suggestion, and the three went along the tracks, with Trodden walking slightly ahead of Pierce (who, due to a limp, walked more slowly). The defendant stopped and bent over, as if to tie his shoes, while the other two proceeded on ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Trodden suddenly heard a loud bang, covered his ears, and turned around. He saw Pierce lying face down beside the tracks. The defendant stood over Pierce, gun in hand. He leaned over, put the gun to the back of Pierce\u2019s head, and shot him again. The defendant ordered Trodden to come over and to help him drag Pierce\u2019s body into the bushes along the tracks. Trodden asked the defendant why he had killed Pierce. The defendant replied, \u201cFuck him. I never liked him anyways.\u201d After hiding the body, the two returned to the defendant\u2019s house, where the defendant retrieved a pair of gloves. He explained to Trodden that he did not want to leave the body by the tracks. The defendant and Trodden retrieved Pierce\u2019s car and drove it down the tracks to the point where the body was hidden. They dragged the body out from the bushes, whereupon the defendant ordered Trodden to help him load the body into the back of the car and cover it with blankets. The defendant then drove the car, ordering Trodden (whose hands were bare) to avoid touching the door handle on the passenger side. The defendant drove to a parking lot, dropped the keys on the floor of the car, and abandoned the vehicle. He and Trodden ran back to the defendant\u2019s house. As they entered, the defendant\u2019s wife came out of the bedroom and, seeing their bloodstained and muddy clothes, asked them what was happening. The defendant replied, \u201cI got rid of him. He\u2019s gone.\u201d The defendant fetched clean clothes for both himself and Trodden, whereupon they showered and changed. The defendant placed the bloody clothes in a trash bag. The two spent the rest of the night drinking, and then telephoned a friend for a ride to another bar the next morning. The defendant told Trodden that, if the police questioned him, he was to say that he had last seen Pierce at the restaurant the night before, and that he (Trodden) had gone home with the defendant where the two had spent an uneventful night.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The police discovered Pierce\u2019s body the next day, and inquiries as to where he had last been seen led them to the R &amp; R. They questioned Trodden, who answered as the defendant had instructed him. Periodically thereafter, the defendant would check with Trodden to confirm that he (Trodden) was not giving any information to the police. Trodden assured the defendant that he was sticking to the version that the defendant had outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The police also questioned the defendant, who gave them the same version as Trodden. The defendant, however, elaborated on his answers, telling the police that the victim had had \u201ca problem\u201d some months earlier with a man named Edward Williams, who was known to carry a gun. Professing a desire to help the police, the defendant asked for a pager number for one of the officers so he could notify him immediately if he picked up any further information at the bar. The next day, the defendant contacted the officer, and told him that he suspected that Dennis Alera might have been involved. He also told them that he was bothered by the attitude of members of the Trodden family, who seemed unconcerned about the murder but were instead concerned that the attention drawn by the investigation was hurting their \u201cbookmaking business\u201d at the R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The police looked into the various leads that the defendant provided them, but found that Alera had not been in the area at the time of the murder, and uncovered nothing to implicate the Troddens (or anyone else). As of December, 1993, the investigation was at a standstill. At that time, the police had neither evidence nor suspicion that the defendant or Trodden had been involved, but knew that Trodden, Trodden\u2019s brother, and the defendant were among the last people to see Pierce alive at the bar and restaurant the night before his body was discovered. In order to preserve their testimony, the three were subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. The defendant appeared particularly eager to testify and, on December 22, testified to the same information he had originally given the police. He denied any knowledge of who had committed the murder, and denied any involvement in the killing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trodden\u2019s brother testified next, relating how he had seen the victim at the R &amp; R that night and had seen him depart the area in his own vehicle after the bar closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">When the assistant district attorney emerged from the grand jury room telling Trodden that it was his turn to testify, Trod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>den\u2019s lawyer advised that Trodden would not be testifying. He related that Trodden had helped dispose of the body after the defendant had murdered Pierce, and that Trodden would therefore assert his right against self-incrimination. Trodden was ultimately granted immunity, and testified before the grand jury and at trial under that grant of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Forensic evidence confirmed that Pierce had been shot twice in the back of the head, both shots being fired from the same gun held in close contact with the skin. Other forensic evidence was consistent with Trodden\u2019s account of how the body was dragged, and how the car had been driven in a bushy area along the tracks. Fingerprints in the vehicle matched those of the victim; there were no fingerprints matching those of either Trodden or the defendant. One of the defendant\u2019s neighbors confirmed seeing the defendant and Pierce going into the defendant\u2019s house on the night of the murder, and later seeing two men (who she assumed were again the defendant and Pierce) driving off in Pierce\u2019s car later that night. Yet another neighbor testified that she had been awoken that night and heard two or possibly three shots, followed by silence. She had not notified the police, thinking at the time that the noises might have come from a car backfiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">b. <em>Presentation of the defense at trial. </em>At trial, defense counsel gave an opening statement in which he told the jury that the defendant, an \u201ceyewitness\u201d to the murder, would testify to a very different account of how the victim came to be shot on the railroad tracks behind the defendant\u2019s house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel outlined to the jury that Pierce\u2019s earlier fight with Alera was the event that precipitated the killing. He stated that Pierce\u2019s decision to pursue charges against Alera threatened Alera\u2019s job, and that Pierce also intended to sue the R &amp; R and the Troddens for the injuries he had sustained in the fight. There would be evidence, counsel claimed, that Pierce was coming into the bar demanding money and threatening suit. Pierce\u2019s threats were hurting business, including the bar\u2019s \u201cbookmaking\u201d business. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>result, the Troddens \u201chad to do something.\u201d Counsel stated that, on the evening of October 4, Pierce was at the bar telling everyone there that he was looking for \u201csatisfaction.\u201d Someone told Pierce to go to the defendant\u2019s house, that he would find Dennis Trodden there, and that Trodden wanted \u201cto settle things up that night.\u201d Pierce then went to the defendant\u2019s house, expecting that Trodden would agree to a settlement. When he arrived, however, he began arguing with Trodden, and the defendant told them both to go outside. The defendant would testify, counsel claimed, that it was Trodden who suggested that they walk along the railroad tracks, and that the argument continued as the three walked along. Then, at a \u201cprearranged spot,\u201d Trodden stopped, and three men emerged from the dark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of the men put the defendant on the ground, held a gun to him and told him to be quiet. The other two went up behind Pierce, with Pierce facing toward Trodden. Trodden then told Pierce that he was giving him \u201cone last chance\u201d to drop the idea of suing the bar and drop the charges against Alera. When Pierce refused, \u201cthose men\u201d shot him twice in the head and dragged his body off to the side of the tracks. The man holding a gun on the defendant warned that the defendant would be killed if he said anything, and Trodden repeated the threat. One of the men then showed the defendant a photograph of his (the defendant\u2019s) family, warning that if he talked to anyone (\u201cthe State police,\u201d \u201cthe local police,\u201d \u201cany cops, lawyer, anybody\u201d), he would die. Trodden made it \u201cvery clear that these guys were serious.\u201d Trodden told the defendant to come with him and get Pierce\u2019s car, and the defendant saw Trodden and his three accomplices load the body inside. The defendant and Trodden then went back to the defendant\u2019s house for the rest of the night. The following morning, similar threats were made, warning the defendant that he and his family would be killed if he talked to \u201canybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">When the various Commonwealth witnesses testified, defense counsel cross-examined them, asking them to agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>defense theory that Pierce had been threatening suit and adversely affecting the business at the bar. During the cross-examination of Trodden, defense counsel asked a detailed line of questions premised on the defense theory that Trodden had arranged for a group of accomplices to ambush Pierce along the railroad tracks and murder him if he refused to back down from his threatened lawsuit. When the witnesses (including Trodden) repeatedly answered in the negative to all such questions, the judge inquired of defense counsel what evidentiary basis there would be for the questions he was posing. Defense counsel explained that the defendant would testify and provide evidence of the version counsel was painting by his questions on cross-examination. Based on that representation, counsel was allowed to proceed. On two occasions during such cross-examination, the judge reminded the jury that an attorney\u2019s questions were not evidence, and that, unless and until there was evidence to support the premise of an attorney\u2019s question, a witness\u2019s denial in response to a question meant that there was no evidence of the facts suggested by the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">However, when the defense began presenting its witnesses, defense counsel advised the judge that the defendant had decided not to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge, acknowledging that the defendant still had an absolute right not to testify, expressed concern about the extent to which the jury had been exposed to suggestions of a defense version of events that would ultimately not be supported by any evidence at all (i.e., the theory of three men appearing along the railroad tracks as part of Trodden\u2019s ostensible prearranged plan to murder Pierce), and that the judge had allowed such questioning based on counsel\u2019s repeated representations that the defendant\u2019s testimony would provide an evidentiary basis for the scenario his questions had outlined. Counsel informed the judge that his representations to the court, and his questions to the witnesses, had been made in good faith because he had believed that he \u201chad a witness\u201d to substantiate them, and that he had so believed for the last ten months prior to trial. He advised that it was only that very afternoon that he had learned that he did not have such a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>At that point, the judge inquired of the defendant himself, asking him if he understood that he had the right to testify or not; that, if he testified, the prosecutor would be entitled to cross-examine him; that his final decision whether to testify did not have to be made at that time; and that he could continue to discuss the matter with counsel overnight,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> change his mind, and decide to testify at any time the next day up until the moment that the defense rested. The defendant responded that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The following day, after the testimony of some further defense witnesses, counsel advised the judge that, after further consultation with the defendant, the defendant had again decided that he would not testify. The judge again conducted a colloquy with the defendant, reminding him that he had a right to testify and that he could still change his mind. The defendant acknowledged that he was aware of his rights, and confirmed that he had discussed the matter with counsel. After presenting one additional witness, the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Through witnesses other than the defendant, the defense presented evidence of the earlier altercation between Pierce and Alera and Pierce\u2019s pursuit of a criminal complaint against Alera stemming from that incident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the defense presented no evidence that the friction between Alera and Pierce had resulted in any animosity between Pierce and the Troddens, or that Pierce had made any threat to sue the R &amp; R \u2014 the various witnesses called by the defendant denied that there was any such animosity or threat. And, in the absence of any testimony from the defendant, there was no evidence to support the theory that Trodden and a group of accomplices had killed Pierce.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant contends that his motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed because there was insufficient evidence of deliberate premeditation. Viewed in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the evidence permitted the inference that the defendant had planned the killing of Pierce, and had orchestrated the trip along the railroad tracks for that purpose. He had then shot Pierce in the head twice, both shots being fired at point-blank range. These facts suffice to establish deliberate premeditation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>441 Mass. 96, 102 (2004), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">b. <em>Instruction on malice. </em>Without objection, the judge\u2019s instructions defined \u201cmalice\u201d with reference to all three prongs of malice. This was error, as only first prong malice (a specific intent to kill) suffices for murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 441-442 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the error does not raise a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Notwithstanding the erroneous definition of malice, the instruction on deliberate premeditation explained that the sequence of events began with \u201cdeliberation and premeditation, then the decision to kill, and lastly, the killing in furtherance of the decision.\u201d As we have often held, a correct instruction on deliberate premeditation, which requires that the jury find a \u201cdecision to kill,\u201d effectively requires the jury to find first prong malice, and thus the error in defining the other two prongs of malice does not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 498-499 (2004), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reaves, </em>434 Mass. 383, 393-394 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">c. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly commented on the fact that the defendant did not testify.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The context and purpose of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was to point out that the witnesses the defendant had called had not provided any evidence to support the version of events that had been sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>gested by defense counsel\u2019s questioning of witnesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The specific remarks that the defendant claims were improper (\u201cWhat witnesses did the defense call to help you answer the question of who shot James Pierce?\u201d and \u201cDid the defense produce any evidence through their witnesses in this trial . . . ?\u201d) would, standing alone, erroneously suggest that the defendant had some obligation to put on evidence and explain who committed the murder. Although we are satisfied that the context of these problematic statements by the prosecutor, combined with the judge\u2019s instructions on the burden of proof and the defendant\u2019s election not to testify,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> rendered the statements harmless, prosecutors should scrupulously avoid any statement that suggests that the defendant has any burden to produce evidence. Here, the point that the prosecutor was legitimately seeking to make could have been articulated using slightly different phraseology that would have avoided any such suggestion. The context, however, ultimately made clear that counsel was pointing out that the witnesses who <em>were </em>called by the defense (each of whom he proceeded to identify by name immediately after his question about \u201c[w]hat witnesses did the defense call\u201d) knew nothing about the murder, and that their testimony provided no support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>for the defense theory that had been articulated in counsel\u2019s questions. He was not commenting on any failure to call witnesses (a comment that would improperly shift the burden of proof), but rather on the fact that the witnesses presented had not supplied any useful information on the critical issue in the case. That the defense theory of the case was based on a \u201cfairy tale\u201d and not on any evidence was a point that the prosecutor could properly argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Nor did these remarks constitute improper comment on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify (the specific error now raised on appeal, see note 9, <em>supra). </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 570-571 (1976). The observation that the witnesses called by the defendant had not been \u201cup on the railroad tracks\u201d that night was intended to contrast those witnesses with Dennis Trodden, whose testimony had been discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph of the prosecutor\u2019s closing. And, as discussed above, the question, \u201cWhat witnesses did the defense call?,\u201d was an introduction to a discussion about the various witnesses who had in fact testified, not a criticism of the defendant for not taking the stand. We are satisfied that the context of the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks was proper, and that, to whatever extent (if any) the jury might have initially misinterpreted them, that proper context was thereafter made clear and the judge\u2019s instructions sufficed to correct any remaining misinterpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 572 (\u201creliance on curative instructions may be proper, in the judge\u2019s discretion, even in a case of clearly improper argument by a prosecutor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The defendant also contends that the prosecutor misstated the evidence when he suggested to the jury that Pierce \u201cdrove around the block\u201d prior to his encounter with the defendant and Trodden. There was no misstatement of the evidence. The defendant had sought to undermine Trodden\u2019s credibility by arguing that Pierce had already left the area prior to the time that Trodden claimed that he and the defendant had seen him and invited him back to the defendant\u2019s house. In that same vein, he had suggested that Pierce\u2019s direction of travel made it impossible for him to have been seen heading in the opposite direction from the defendant\u2019s vehicle in the manner that Trodden had described. The prosecutor introduced evidence that it was in fact possible for Pierce to have driven \u201caround the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>block\u201d and to have thereby returned to the area and be driving in the direction Trodden identified. Based on that possibility and Trodden\u2019s testimony as to when and where they encountered Pierce, the jury could have inferred that a trip \u201caround the block\u201d (or, for that matter, any other means of simply turning his vehicle around) was how Pierce had returned to the area of the restaurant at the time that Trodden and the defendant were leaving. The prosecutor\u2019s point in closing argument was not to assert categorically that Pierce had gone \u201caround the block,\u201d but to point out that the ostensible discrepancy being urged by defense counsel was readily explainable and therefore did not make Trodden a \u201cliar.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We see no impropriety in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">3. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>In his motion for a new trial, the defendant contended that, as of the time he made his decision not to testify, he had become incompetent to stand trial. He also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with counsel\u2019s failure to take steps prior to trial to address the issue of competency, and his failure to take appropriate steps to raise the issue when it emerged during trial. Finally, he asserted that his counsel was ineffective in that he should not have based his opening statement on the premise that the defendant would testify. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge (who had also presided at trial) denied the motion. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">a. <em>Competence to stand trial. </em>The judge heard testimony from the lawyers who had represented the defendant at trial, an expert witness for the defendant (who had examined the defendant approximately three years after trial), and an expert witness for the Commonwealth. The judge found that, immediately following indictment, the defendant had been treated at the jail for anxiety and depression. Within two months of his arrest, the defendant was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital. There, he was diagnosed with mild to moderate depressed mood and anxiety, not requiring hospitalization. He was returned to the county jail that same month. The trial began approximately seven months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The defendant\u2019s appointed counsel was assisted on the case by the.defendant\u2019s cousin, who was also a lawyer. They met with the defendant on a number of occasions, and the defendant gave them his version of how the murder took place. Although initially expressing fear that his family would be harmed if he were to testify, and still exhibiting some anxiety, the defendant ultimately became \u201cadamant\u201d that he would testify to his version of events. At no time did either attorney question the defendant\u2019s competency, and the defense expert testified that the defendant was in fact competent to stand trial up until the day that he changed his mind and decided not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Both counsel testified that on the first day that they began to present defense witnesses, they met with the defendant in the lockup during a recess and indicated that the time had come for him to testify. To their great surprise, the defendant, sobbing uncontrollably and expressing fear for his family\u2019s safety, indicated that he could not testify. This scene lasted approximately fifteen minutes. Counsel advised the defendant that he had to compose himself to return to court, which the defendant did. At that point, the judge was informed that the defendant would not be testifying, but was not told anything about the defendant\u2019s emotional outburst in the lockup. The judge conducted a colloquy with the defendant. During the colloquy, the judge observed that the defendant appeared calm, composed, and coherent, and the defendant expressed an understanding of what the judge was telling him. The following day, the defendant again appeared calm and rational to the judge, and again exhibited an understanding of that day\u2019s colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">At the evidentiary hearing, the defense expert opined that the defendant was incompetent at the time he informed his lawyers that he would not testify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That opinion was premised on the assessment that the defendant was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (brought on by the traumatic events he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ostensibly witnessed on the night of the murder) and major depression. The judge did not credit that opinion, as it was contrary to the Bridgewater State Hospital diagnosis of the defendant and to his own observations of the defendant during trial and during the two colloquies on the subject of his testifying. The judge credited the opinion of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, who opined that the defendant\u2019s emotional displays were the result of anxiety and depression precipitated by his legal predicament. That opinion comported with the judge\u2019s own observations, and was consistent with the observations of the defendant in the Bridgewater State Hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">We give substantial deference to a trial judge\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 469 (1998), recognizing that the judge has had the \u201copportunity to observe the defendant\u2019s demeanor during the trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russin, 420 </em>Mass. 309, 317 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L\u2019Abbe, </em>421 Mass. 262, 266-267 (1995). Here, the judge heard evidence from two experts, and determined that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert was the more credible. The defendant points to no error in the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, but effectively asks us to substitute our assessment of the expert testimony for that of the judge, who both heard the testimony and observed the defendant over the course of seven days of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The judge did credit the attorneys\u2019 testimony with respect to their observations of the defendant\u2019s \u201cbreakdown\u201d at the time he told them he would not testify. However, the fact that the defendant had an emotional outburst outside of the court room on one day during trial does not compel the judge to find that he had become incompetent. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laurore, </em>437 Mass. 65, 78-79 (2002) (suicidal defendant \u201cscreaming\u201d and \u201ccrying uncontrollably\u201d in cell; no error where, after colloquy, judge proceeded with trial next day without conducting competency hearing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMinico, </em>408 Mass. 230, 234-235 (1990) (defendant competent despite expert opinion that he suffered psychotic episode during trial). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hung Tan Vo, </em>427 Mass. 464, 466-468 (1998). However extreme the defendant\u2019s emotional outburst at the time he told his lawyers that he would not testify, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>defendant regained his composure within minutes thereafter, and participated calmly in the first colloquy with the judge on the subject of his right to testify. As the judge made clear to the defendant during that colloquy, the final decision whether to testify did not need to be made until the defense rested (which happened after some additional witnesses were presented the following day). There was no evidence to suggest that the defendant relapsed into uncontrollable emotional outbursts or that he had any arguably irrational interactions with his lawyers at any time after that initial colloquy. Nor was there any emotional episode on the day that the defendant actually made the final decision not to testify and participated in the second colloquy. There was no error in the judge\u2019s assessment that, despite his single outburst, the defendant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">b. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the defendant\u2019s competency. </em>Our ruling that there was no error in the judge\u2019s findings on the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency effectively disposes of the defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to that same issue. The defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the issue of competency with the judge prior to trial. However, as the defendant\u2019s own expert opined, the defendant <em>was </em>competent at that time. Thus, there was no issue to bring before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The defendant further claims that counsel should have raised the issue of competency after the defendant exhibited severe emotional distress and indicated that he would not testify. In light of the later finding that the defendant was competent at that time, despite his outburst, there has been no showing that raising the issue earlier would have made any difference to the defense. It is mere speculation to suggest that a more prompt inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency would have resulted in a different finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The defendant also suggests that, in the wake of his decision not to testify, counsel should have asked for a mistrial. He offers no authority in support of the proposition that a competent defendant\u2019s decision about how to proceed during trial justifies declaring a mistrial. A defendant\u2019s poor strategic decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>contrary to counsel\u2019s advice \u2014 here, a midtrial about-face that severely undermined the defense position outlined in the opening statement \u2014 would not be ground for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">c. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel during opening statement. </em>The defendant also contends that his counsel was ineffective when he premised the \u201cdramatic\u201d opening statement on the assumption that the defendant would testify. Suggesting that counsel should have foreseen the possibility that the defendant would change his mind and not testify, he argues that counsel\u2019s announcement to the jury that the defendant would testify was \u201csimply foolish\u201d and caused \u201cextraordinary prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We recognize that failure to present critical evidence that has been announced in an opening statement can have drastic ramifications. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>435 Mass. 97, 109 (2001). See also <em>Ouber </em>v. <em>Guarino, </em>293 F.3d 19, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2002); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>858 F.2d 16, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1988). However, failure to produce evidence that counsel has predicted in an opening does not automatically amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, supra. </em>Rather, we must look to whether the opening statement \u201creflected inadequate preparation, incompetency, or inattention,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123, 127 (1989), and whether the subsequent failure to produce the evidence was \u201ca decision forced upon [counsel] by events over which he had no control,\u201d <em>id., </em>or otherwise was supported by \u201cstrategic justifications,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, supra </em>at 110. There is, in any opening statement, a risk that promised evidence will not materialize. The decision whether to make an opening statement, and, if so, what details to include in that statement, are purely strategic, and the strategic benefit of announcing specific anticipated testimony in the opening statement may outweigh the risk that the testimony will not be available. \u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">At the hearing on the motion for a new trial, trial counsel testified that he thoroughly expected the defendant to testify at trial, describing him as \u201cadamant\u201d that he wanted to testify, and that \u201cnobody was going to keep him off the stand, absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>nobody.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorneys had spent \u201cmany hours\u201d preparing him to testify, including mock exercises to simulate direct and cross-examination, going through his proposed testimony \u201cin minute detail.\u201d Given the information that counsel had, there was nothing manifestly unreasonable in structuring the defense around the defendant\u2019s planned testimony, and nothing manifestly unreasonable about the decision to give the jury the defendant\u2019s version as part of the defense opening. That the opening statement was \u201cdramatic\u201d is not a sign of ineffectiveness \u2014 if the defense is going to present an opening statement, valid strategic reasons support making it a \u201cdramatic\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Both counsel were \u201cshocked\u201d when the defendant later decided that he would not testify. When the defendant told counsel that he would not testify, they attempted to persuade him to adhere to the original strategy, pointing out to him that the jury had already been told he would present his own version of events. When the defendant insisted that he would not take the stand, counsel was presented with \u201ca decision forced upon him by events over which he had no control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 122 (1998) (without consultation with defendant, counsel\u2019s opening predicted that defendant would testify; counsel later decided not to call defendant as witness). The record amply supports the judge\u2019s determination that the defense opening was a strategic decision that had failed through no fault of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">4. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and order a new trial. We decline to do so. The grounds for the defendant\u2019s request for relief largely track the same issues addressed above. He also suggests that, apart from those alleged errors, we can have \u201cno confidence in the accuracy\u201d of the verdict, because it was Trodden who arranged for the murder of Pierce and then intimidated the defendant to the point that he was too emotionally distressed to testify.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Our power to grant G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, relief does not allow us to sit as a second jury. Ostensible discrepancies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Trodden\u2019s testimony, and the ramifications of Trodden\u2019s grant of immunity, were amply presented to the jury below. Notwithstanding what turned out to be an unfortunate strategic decision to base the opening statement on the anticipated testimony of the defendant, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of witnesses was thorough, highlighting their biases and prior inconsistent statements, and his presentation of defense witnesses contested various details of Trodden\u2019s testimony. We see no basis for setting aside the jury\u2019s decision to credit Trodden\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed; the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed; and the defendant\u2019s request for relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Although the defendant was known to carry a weapon on his person, he had not been seen with any gun earlier that night. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that he retrieved a gun from the bedroom before going outside.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The defendant moved to suppress his grand jury testimony on various grounds. After an evidentiary hearing, that motion was denied, and the defendant claims no error on appeal with respect to the denial of that motion. Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the evidence offered on the suppression, motion, and we see no error in the denial of the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The opening statement also predicted that there would be various weaknesses in the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence: the lack of any motive for the defendant to kill Pierce; the lack of any fingerprint evidence, bloody clothes, or murder weapon; and the suspect nature of Trodden\u2019s immunized testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At no point during the opening statement did counsel say who \u201cthose men\u201d were, or what their relation to Trodden was, other than to say that Trodden had arranged their presence and that they were somehow affiliated with Trodden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify were the subject of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">This colloquy took place shortly before 2 p.m., and court was then adjourned for the day because no other defense witnesses were available until the next morning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The defendant also called an expert witness to opine that, although the shots were fired at close range, the gun had not literally been in contact with Pierce\u2019s skin at the time the fatal shots were fired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial was conducted prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">At trial, defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument on the ground that it had improperly shifted the burden of proof by suggesting that the defense had failed to put forth evidence to prove that someone else had killed the victim. On appeal, the defendant reframes his claim as one of improper commentary on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u201cWhat was the defense? What witnesses did the defense call to help you answer the question of who shot James Pierce? Did Robert Moulaison help you answer that question? No. Did Robert Trodden? No. Did Dennis Alera? No. Did Dr. Sussman? No. Were any of those people up on the railroad tracks on October the fifth? No. Can they help you decide this case? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cYou see, from day one in this case, ladies and gentlemen, the defense in its strategy in this case is to throw a lot of things before you. Do you remember those questions? Isn\u2019t it true Dennis Trodden X, Y and Z? Isn\u2019t it true this happened? Isn\u2019t it true, isn\u2019t it true, isn\u2019t it true? And you know what? What was every single answer to these grandiose questions throwing out facts before you. What was the answer to every question? No. Did the defense produce any evidence through their witnesses in this trial to back up those questions? No. Dennis Trodden answered one of those questions with, that\u2019s just a fairy tale. The Commonwealth suggests that\u2019s all the questions were were fairy tales.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The judge gave a forceful instruction about the defendant\u2019s right not to testify, advising the jury that they could draw no inference from the fact that he had not testified, and reminded them that \u201cthe law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u201cAnd he went around the block and came back, and they bumped into each other. Isn\u2019t that what happened based on the evidence? What is the big deal? . . . [Defense counsel] wants you to get hung up on where they met on Broadway or whether they went around the block or not.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The defense expert agreed that the defendant still had a rational understanding of the proceedings, but opined that the defendant then lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Russin, 420 Mass. 309, 317 (1995), quoting <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Ironically, the defendant himself stated to the experts who examined him that, if he were granted a new trial, he would still not testify. As such, there is no reason to believe that the evidence on any retrial would include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>defendant\u2019s version of events. We also note that the defendant\u2019s conduct after the shooting \u2014 voluntarily contacting the police, suggesting various other suspects (including members of the Trodden family), and expressing eagerness to testify before the grand jury \u2014 is wholly inconsistent with his claim that Trodden and his accomplices threatened to kill him and his family if he spoke to the police, to a lawyer, or to \u201canybody.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
