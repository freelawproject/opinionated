Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 85S (1984), protect the placement of \u2018site specific\u2019 art?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The term \u201csite-specific\u201d art does not appear in any applicable Massachusetts statute. It is a term that has been defined in the art world as art \u201c[that] is conceived and created in relation to the particular conditions of a specific site.\u201d <em>Serra </em>v. <em>United States Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>847 F.2d 1045, 1047 (2d Cir. 1988) (quoting sculptor Richard Serra). It has also been described as \u201ca combination of readymade work and a crafted work: the site is the readymade work, from which the artist draws her inspiration, and upon which the artist adds a crafted material. Together, the readymade and the crafted material exist as the artwork.\u201d Garson, Before That Artist Came Along, It Was Just a Bridge: The Visual Artists Rights Act and the Removal of Site-Specific Artwork, 11 Cornell J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 203, 230 (2001). The term \u201csite-specific\u201d is also admittedly a \u201csort of catchall phrase for a variety of artworks that elevate, in varying degrees, the importance of the relationship between context and object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233. In some works of site-specific art, the landscape provides the context necessary to give full meaning to otherwise freestanding crafted objects. In other works, such as \u201cearthworks,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the artwork is \u201ccompletely inextricable from [its] site[] because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>[it is] literally made from and imbedded in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234. The facts of this case present the former and not the latter type of site-specific art.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">After considering all the language used in the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S (MAPA), construed as a whole, consistent with what we can glean of the Legislature\u2019s intentions in its enactment, we answer the question as follows: MAPA does not protect the placement of the type of site-specific art at issue here. Although it prohibits the physical destruction of the crafted components of such art, MAPA does not protect it against the conceptual destruction or decontextualization that may result from the removal of those components from the physical environment in which they have been placed. If the crafted components of site-specific art can be extracted from their surroundings without physical damage to them, the statute is not violated by their removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The relevant background is contained in the memorandum and order of the District Court judge. See S.J.C. Rule 1:03, \u00a7 3 (2); <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., </em>288 F. Supp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2003). We summarize only those facts that inform our resolution of the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">David Phillips is a sculptor who has gained national recognition for his site-specific artwork. In 1999, Pembroke Real Estate, Inc. (Pembroke), commissioned Phillips to work on Eastport Park (park), a public green space in the South Boston waterfront section of Boston.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commission resulted in two contracts between the parties: the \u201cEastport Park Artwork Agreement\u201d (agreement I) and the \u201cEastport Park Stonework Agreement\u201d (agreement II). Pursuant to agreement I, Phillips created ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>proximately twenty-seven sculptures for the park, including abstract bronze and granite works and a dozen realistic bronze sculptures of hermit crabs, shrimp, and frogs. Under agreement II, Phillips was responsible for the design and installation of rough stone walls, split granite paving stones, and other landscape design elements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most of Phillips\u2019s sculpture and landscape elements are organized along a diagonal sight line, or axis, passing through the park, and are unified by a theme of spiral and circular forms. At the center of the axis is a large spherical sculpture entitled \u201cChords.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Soon after the park was completed in the spring of 2000, Pembroke determined that it was in need of alteration. A redesign scheme was prepared by British landscape architect Elizabeth Banks. It called for the removal and relocation of Phillips\u2019s sculptures. Phillips protested and, in January, 2003, Pembroke agreed to retain all but one of Phillips\u2019s sculptures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Phillips objected to Pembroke\u2019s revised plan and subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking injunctive relief under the Federal Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106A (2000) (VARA), and MAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On August 21, 2003, at the conclusion of a nonevidentiary hearing, the United States District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Pembroke from altering the park. Subsequently, Pembroke announced its intention to return to the original redesign scheme, which called for the removal of all of Phillips\u2019s sculptures. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the United States District Court judge issued a memorandum and order in which she found \u201cthat the environment of Phillips\u2019 integrated sculpture along the axis of the Park is a critical element of those works, and changing the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>of the sculpture constitutes an alteration\u201d under MAPA. Accordingly, she ordered that Pembroke \u201cnot alter, destroy, move or remove any of the sculptures along the northeast-southwest axis of the Park until the conclusion of this litigation or further order of the Court. With respect to the other sculptures, Defendant may move the sculptures but shall not destroy or alter them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Both parties filed interlocutory appeals with the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (2000). In the interim, the District Court judge certified the present question, and the appeals have been stayed pending its resolution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The question before us is one of statutory construction. \u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In a previous consideration of MAPA, we discussed its purpose and its relation to existing law. <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Eastwick, </em>423 Mass. 52 (1996). MAPA followed the lead of similar legislation in California and New York \u201cin attempting to graft onto a generally inhospitable common law tradition the civil law concept of <em>droit moral, </em>whereby a creative artist retains certain inalienable rights with respect to his or her creation before and after publication, display or sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, quoting Koven, Observations on the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, 71 Mass. L. Rev. 101, 101 (1986). To accomplish its ends, MAPA protects both an artist\u2019s \u201cright of integrity\u201d (an artist\u2019s right not to have his or her creations altered), and an artist\u2019s \u201cright of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>paternity\u201d (an artist\u2019s right to claim or disclaim authorship of a work of art). <em>Id. </em>at 56. The rights of integrity and paternity continue for fifty years after the artist\u2019s death and are enforceable by the artist or by his duly authorized representative by an action in the Superior Court. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S <em>(g).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In its preamble, MAPA contains the following legislative findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201c[T]he physical alteration or destruction of fine art, which is an expression of the artist\u2019s personality, is detrimental to the artist\u2019s reputation, and artists therefore have an interest in protecting their works of fine art against such alteration or destruction; and that there is also a public interest in preserving the integrity of cultural and artistic creations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S <em>(a). </em>The statute goes on to define \u201c[f]inc art\u201d as \u201cany original work of visual or graphic art of any media which shall include, but not limited to, any painting, print, drawing, sculpture, craft object, photograph, audio or video tape, film, hologram, or any combination thereof, of recognized quality.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 85S <em>(b). </em>It then provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201cNo person, except an artist who owns or possesses a work of fine art which the artist has created, shall intentionally commit, or authorize the intentional commission of any physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of a work of fine art.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 85S (c). MAPA deals separately with \u201cfine art\u201d that has been attached to buildings, the significance of which is discussed later in this opinion. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S <em>(h).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">In answering the certified question, we consider whether the Legislature intended to include the type of site-specific art at issue here within the statutory definition of \u201cfine art,\u201d and whether MAPA\u2019s prohibitions against \u201cany physical deface<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of a work of fine art\u201d extend to the type of \u201cconceptual destruction\u201d that might result from the removal of the crafted components of such art from the site on which they have been placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">There is a \u201ccommunity of respected American artists and art authorities [that] regard the crafted work and the site of site-specific artworks as an indivisible whole.\u201d Garson, <em>supra </em>at 239. In the proceedings before the United States District Court, there was credible expert testimony to the effect that site specificity has become the \u201crallying cry\u201d of public artists and public art administrators. There was also testimony that this \u201cradical redefinition\u201d of sculpture is a relatively recent trend in the history of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Our responsibility in this case is not to decide whether the environment or physical setting of site-specific art is an integral element of it, but to determine what the Legislature intended in 1984 when it enacted MAPA, St. 1984, c. 488, \u00a7 1, with no clear reference to such art. In making this determination, we write on a clean slate. No State or Federal appellate court has had occasion to decide whether removing such a work from its site constitutes a violation of the artist\u2019s right of integrity as protected under statutes similar to MAPA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In looking to the words of the statute, it is apparent that whether site-specific art comes within MAPA\u2019s protection depends on whether the Legislature intended the words \u201cof any media\u201d (used in the definition of \u201c[fjine art\u201d) to mean not only physical materials and techniques used by the artist to craft an object (such as bronze or granite, sculpture or painting), but also the \u201creadymade\u201d physical setting or environment that may have inspired the crafting of the object, and where it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>placed. Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cmedium\u201d in the context of visual and graphic art as \u201cthe material or technical means for artistic expression (as paint and canvas, lithographic or sculptural stone, or literary or musical form).\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1403 (1993). The American Heritage Dictionary defines it as a \u201cspecific type of artistic technique or means of expression as determined by the materials used or the creative methods involved.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 815 (1981). Phillips\u2019s contention that the site can be the \u201cmedium\u201d of such art would require an expansive reading of the term. Where the dictionary definitions are not conclusive on the issue of legislative intent we look to other provisions of the statute for indicia of such intent, and for the purpose of interpreting the statute as a consistent whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">It is apparent that in drafting the statute, the Legislature was concerned not only with creating new rights for artists, but also with protecting the rights of property owners who commission artworks that become attached to real property. This concern manifests itself in the way \u00a7 85S <em>(h) </em>of MAPA addresses \u201cfine art\u201d attached to buildings. If the art can be removed from the building without causing \u201csubstantial harm\u201d to the art, the building owner may remove the art after giving the artist notice and ninety days to reclaim and remove it himself (at his own expense). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S <em>(h) </em>(2). If the artwork cannot be removed from the building without causing the \u201csubstantial physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction\u201d of the art, the owner may proceed to remove it unless the artist has expressly reserved his rights under the statute \u201cby an instrument in writing signed by the owner of such building and properly recorded, <em>prior </em>to the installation of such art\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85S <em>(h) </em>(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">This provision serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the owner of a building will be able to remove unwanted art from his property even if the removal would cause physical damage to the art in ways otherwise prohibited by MAPA (unless the property owner has signed a written instrument reserving the artist\u2019s rights). Thus, it \u201cprevents] the artist from holding the building hostage to the artworks.\u201d Ginsburg, Copyright in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>101 st Congress: Commentary on the Visual Artists Rights Act and the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act of 1990, 14 Colum.-VLA J.L. &amp; Arts 477, 486 (1990) (commenting on \u00a7 113[d] of VARA). Second, by requiring that any enforceable reservation of rights be \u201cproperly recorded,\u201d the statute protects the integrity of the real property conveyancing system and guards against the establishment of unnoticed, undetectable, and indeterminate encumbrances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">If the Legislature intended to include the type of site-specific art at issue here within MAPA\u2019s protections, it would entail a radical consequence for owners of land, that the Legislature directly averted for owners of buildings. Specifically, rights afforded artists would encumber private and public land with restrictions lasting for the life of the artist plus fifty years, without the need for such restrictions to be recorded in a registry of deeds. We do not lightly read such an intent into a legislative act given the recognized legislative policy of discouraging land restrictions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (especially unrecorded ones), the common-law doctrine disapproving the long-term burdening of property, and the corollary judicial practice of construing statutory provisions regarding land restrictions \u201cin favor of freedom of alienation.\u201d <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. </em>v. <em>Urstadt Biddle Props., Inc., </em>433 Mass. 285, 290 (2001), quoting <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>299 Mass. 559, 565 (1938). See <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>344 Mass. 24, 26 (1962), quoting Restatement of Property \u00a7 418 (\u201cif upon \u2018one of two or more possible constructions there is no restraint, such construction is preferred\u2019 \u201d). We construe the statute consistent with these principles unless there is evidence of unambiguous legislative intent to place restrictions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>physical environment in which the crafted components of site-specific art have been situated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We do not infer such legislative intent from the absence of language extending the protections afforded building owners under \u00a7 85S <em>(h) </em>of MAPA to property owners who might otherwise be unable to remove site-specific art from their land. The reasons why the Legislature might treat buildings differently from other real property with respect to the potential encumbering effect of the statute are not apparent, and we perceive none. The failure of the statute to address specifically the removal of fine art from land suggests that the Legislature either did not intend the statute\u2019s protection to extend to the land upon which works of art have been placed, or did not perceive the removal of free-standing works of art from their sites as causing their \u201cphysical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction.\u201d Either way, there was no need for it to consider the possibility that land might be also \u201cheld hostage\u201d to attached artworks. Given the Legislature\u2019s evident concern that works of fine art not burden buildings, and that restrictions encumbering buildings be properly recorded, it is apparent to us that if the Legislature had understood that MAPA would have that same encumbering effect on the sites of site-specific art, it would have addressed the subject directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In light of these provisions, we think it more likely that the Legislature intended the word \u201cmedia\u201d to refer to the various materials (e.g., paint, charcoal, and film) and techniques (e.g., painting, drawing, and photography) that an artist manipulates to create a work of fine art, rather than the materials (in this case, the site) and techniques (in this case, site specificity) that inspire an artist. This is consistent with the list of examples enumerated by the Legislature in MARA itself (\u201cpainting, print, drawing, sculpture, craft object, photograph, audio or video tape, film, hologram, or any combination thereof\u201d). While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Legislature\u2019s inclusion in MAPA of the words \u201cshall include, but not [be] limited to\u201d indicates that the specific examples of \u201cvisual or graphic art of any media\u201d do not represent an exhaustive list of protected works, we may look to them for guidance in determining the Legislature\u2019s intent, particularly where there is ambiguity in the meaning of the operative word \u2014 \u201cmedia.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 68 (1975) (\u201cIn the absence of specific precedent on the meaning of a word or phrase in a statute, we are guided by accepted principles of construction. One such principle leads us to relate the words in question to the associated words and phrases in the statutory context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">This interpretation is also consistent with our view that the statutory protection afforded fine art is protection from physical rather than conceptual harm. Section 85S (c) prohibits \u201cany physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction\u201d of fine art. Phillips maintains that the word \u201cphysical\u201d only modifies the word \u201cdefacement\u201d and urges this court to adopt broad, metaphysical definitions of the terms \u201calteration\u201d and \u201cdestruction.\u201d However, such an interpretation is belied if subsection (c) is read in conjunction with subsection (a), which articulates the purpose of the act and declares that \u201cthe physical alteration or destruction of fine art ... is detrimental to the artist\u2019s reputation.\u201d See <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 617 (1982) (instructing that words used in one part of statute in definite sense should be given same meaning in another part of statute). The use of the term \u201cphysical\u201d in this section compels the' construction of the term \u201cphysical\u201d in subsection <em>(c) </em>to modify all of the words that follow it, including \u201cdefacement, mutilation, alteration, [and] destruction.\u201d In application, moving Phillips\u2019s sculptures will not result in their physical destruction, nor will it cause a physical alteration to the actual sculptures. The harm presented is decontextualization. That this harm is significant to Phillips (and possibly to the public) is not to be understated, but it is not the same harm as the actual physical alteration or physical destruction of the artworks crafted by the artist. The balance struck by the Legislature in 1984 deals only with the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Finally, we are not persuaded that the differing language in VARA and the California Art Preservation Act (CAPA), Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 987 (West 1982 &amp; Supp. 2000), on which MAPA is based, requires a different result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The certification was made pursuant to S.J.C.

Under \u00a7 106A(a)(3)(A) of VARA, \u201cthe author of a work of visual art\u201d has the right \u201cto prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work.\u201d One Federal trial court has interpreted VARA to exclude from its protection site-specific art, stating that the purpose of the statute \u201cis not ... to preserve a work of visual art <em>where </em>it is, but rather the preserve the work <em>as </em>it is.\u201d Managers of Soho Int\u2019l Arts Condominium vs. City of N.Y., U.S. Dist. Ct. No. 01 Civ. 1226 DAB (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2003). No State appellate court has rendered a decision on this subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">When the Legislature required the reservations of rights to be \u201cproperly recorded\u201d and anticipated that, when recorded, they \u201cshall be binding on subsequent owners,\u201d the lawmakers were contemplating that these instruments would be recorded in the registries of deeds. See Koven, Observations on the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, 71 Mass. L. Rev. 101, 108 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">See, e.g., G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 21 (creating duty of grantor to inform grantee of encumbrances), \u00a7 23 (creating term limitation on conditions affecting use of real property), and \u00a7\u00a7 26-30 (creating term limitations on land use restrictions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Moreover, statutes like MAPA that alter common-law property rights and impose new obligations totally unknown at common law are ordinarily construed strictly, <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>S.S. Kresge Co., </em>313 Mass. 299, 303 (1943), unless-the obvious legislative purpose behind the statute would be defeated by doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The District Court judge noted that VARA, unlike MAPA, contains a \u201cpublic presentation\u201d exception, which provides that \u201c[t]he modification of a work of visual art which is the result of. . . the public presentation, including lighting and placement, of the work is not a destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification\u201d under \u00a7 106A. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106A(c)(2). In light of the fact that MAPA was passed some six years prior to the enactment of VARA, we are not persuaded that the omission of similar language in MAPA indicates that the Legislature intended to protect the placement and presentation of works of fine art. See 2B NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.06, at 266-267 (6th ed. rev. 2000) (\u201ca state legislature cannot be presumed to know what legislation Congress will pass and the intent of Congress affords no basis for determining the intent of the state legislature\u201d). Nor are we persuaded that the Legislature\u2019s failure to provide a provision similar to Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 989(e) (West 1982 &amp; Supp. 2000), which states that \u201c[i]f a work of fine art cannot be removed from real property without substantial physical defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction of such work, no action to preserve the integrity of the work of fine art may be brought,\u201d indicates that the Legislature intended to protect the rights of artists whose work cannot be removed from land without physical alteration. Section 989 of the California Civil Code confers rights to certain public interest organizations. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 989(b)(2), (c) (defining \u201c[ojrganization\u201d as a \u201cpublic or private not-for-profit entity or association, in existence at least three years at the time an action is filed ... a major purpose of which is to stage, display, or otherwise present works of art to the public or to promote the interests of the arts or artists\u201d). It was enacted after CAPA, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 987 (West 1982 &amp; Supp. 2000), and has been interpreted as a reaction to the limits of CAPA, which did not acknowledge \u201ca public interest in preserving cultural and artistic works independent of the interest of the artist.\u201d Note, The \u201cRecognized Stature\u201d Standard in the Visual Artists Rights Act, 68 Fordham L. Rev. 1935, 1943-1944 (2000). There is no evidence that in passing \u00a7 989, however, the California Legislature intended to alter the scope of the rights conferred to artists and public interest organizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
