Stephen B. Kuketz, a paraplegic since 1991, was by 1995 a nationally ranked wheelchair racquetball player. In the fall of 1994, Kuketz joined the Brockton Athletic Club (club), a fitness club then owned and operated by MDC Fitness Corporation (MDC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The club sponsored a racquetball league in which men and women competed in divisions organized by gender and ability. The men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league was the most competitive division. In January, 1995, Kuketz paid a nominal league fee and requested placement on the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league roster.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of his disability, Kuketz is not competitive at any level of racquetball unless permitted to return the ball after its second bounce. He presumed that in the club\u2019s league play he would be granted this accommodation, while his footed opponents would be required to return the ball after no more than one bounce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The official rules of racquetball (rules), which govern league play, provide that the \u201cobjective\u201d of the game is \u201cto win each rally\u201d and that a player loses a rally when he is \u201cunable to hit the ball before it touches the floor twice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The rules further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>provide for a modification to the \u201cstandard rules\u201d for wheelchair competition, and establish five different levels or \u201cdivisions\u201d for such competition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Wheelchair players competing within these divisions must return the ball before the third bounce (i.e., \u201c[t]he ball may hit the floor twice before being returned\u201d), except in the \u201cMulti-Bounce Division,\u201d where the \u201cball may bounce as many times as the receiver wants though the player may swing only once to return the ball to the front wall.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These modified rules also provide that a player \u201ccan neither intentionally jump out of his chair to hit a ball nor stand up in his chair to serve the ball.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rules have no provision governing competitive play between a wheelchair player and a footed player.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In February, 1995, the general manager of the club, Roslyn Petronelli, after consulting with other players in the league, informed Kuketz that he would not be allowed to play in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Petronelli cited safety concerns as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>primary reason<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and offered Kuketz two alternative options: he could play in a lower-level league under the one-bounce rule or he could play in a wheelchair league that she would assist him in organizing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Kuketz declined both offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Kuketz subsequently filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission) against the club, charging that it violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq. (2000); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5; and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, by refusing to allow him to participate in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In defense of their actions, the club contended that Kuketz was denied the accommodation he requested for safety reasons and because to grant it would fundamentally change the nature of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Before the commission completed its investigation, the club ceased operations. Kuketz then moved to amend his complaint by substituting MDC and Charles M. Mirrione, MDC\u2019s president, as respondents, and by adding Petronelli as a respondent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Prior to a ruling by the commission on that motion, Kuketz removed his charges from the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, and filed a complaint in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The claims in Kuketz\u2019s Superior Court complaint relevant to this appeal alleged discrimination on the basis of physical disability in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, and G. L. c. 151B, and in violation of Title III of the ADA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge granted judgment for the defendants on all of Kuketz\u2019s claims. Specifically, the judge ruled that the defendants were not required under Title III of the ADA to permit Kuketz two bounces in league-sponsored racquetball games against footed players because such a modification would \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the racquetball competition,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that Kuketz\u2019s State law dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ability claim failed because the interpretation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, proceeds \u201chand in hand\u201d with the interpretation of the ADA. Kuketz appealed, asserting that the judge erred in finding that his requested modification constituted a fundamental alteration of the game of racquetball, and that the absence of an individualized assessment of his abilities and the reasonableness of the requested modification precluded summary judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The ADA was enacted in 1990 for the express purpose of providing \u201ca clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). Title HI of the ADA confers rights to disabled patrons of places of public accommodation, \u201cthus enabling individuals with disabilities to participate more fully in the mainstream of society with improved access to hotels, convention centers, entertainment and sporting events, and commercial establishments.\u201d 1 H.H. Penitt, Jr., Americans with Disabilities Act Handbook \u00a7 6.01, at 389 (2003). Section 12182 of Title III of the ADA sets out the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cNo individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The statute then defines discrimination to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201c[A] failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">It is undisputed that Kuketz is an individual with a disability as defined in the ADA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is also no dispute that the club was a place of public accommodation covered under Title HI of the ADA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The issue we must decide is whether the club unlawfully discriminated against Kuketz when it refused to modify its policies and practices to allow Kuketz to play in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league under a two-bounce rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The United States Supreme Court has noted that Title HI of the ADA \u201ccontemplates three inquiries: whether the requested modification is \u2018reasonable,\u2019 whether it is \u2018necessary\u2019 for the disabled individual, and whether it would \u2018fundamentally alter the nature of\u2019 the competition. . . . Whether one question should be decided before the others likely will vary from case to case, for in logic there seems to be no necessary priority among the three.\u201d (Citation omitted.) PGA <em>TOUR, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>532 U.S. 661, 683 n.38 (2001) <em>(Martin).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The defendants do not contest that Kuketz\u2019s requested modifications \u2014 to play in a wheelchair and to be given two bounces \u2014 are \u201cnecessary\u201d for Kuketz to play in the men\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cA\u201d league.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is significant dispute, however, as to the reasonableness of the modifications sought in light of the safety concerns raised by the defendants. There is also disagreement on whether the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the game. Because we conclude that affording Kuketz two bounces against footed players in league play would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition, we need not otherwise address the reasonableness of Kuketz\u2019s requested modifications.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>School Bd. of Nassau County </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17 (1987) (finding accommodation for employee unreasonable if it requires fundamental alteration in nature of program). See Ganden <em>vs. </em>National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, No. 96C 6953 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 21, 1996) (\u201cmodification is unreasonable if it . . . requires a \u2018fundamental alteration\u2019 in the nature of the privilege or program\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The \u201cfundamental alteration\u201d inquiry was the central issue before the United States Supreme Court in <em>Martin. </em>Casey Martin, a professional golfer afflicted with a degenerative circulatory disorder that made walking an eighteen-hole golf course a physical impossibility, requested permission to use a golf cart during the final stage of a professional tour qualifying tournament. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 668-669. PGA TOUR, Inc., the sponsor of the tournament, refused to waive its walking rule.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 669. At trial and subsequently on appeal, the PGA TOUR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>argued that walking constituted a substantive rule of golf and that waiving this rule in any circumstances would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition. <em>Id. </em>at 670. The Supreme Court disagreed, deciding, inter alia, that permitting Martin to use a golf cart would not work a fundamental alteration of the game of golf. <em>Id. </em>at 683. According to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201c[A] modification of [the PGA TOUR\u2019s] golf tournaments might constitute a fundamental alteration in two different ways. It might alter such an essential aspect of the game of golf that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally; changing the diameter of the hole from three to six inches might be such a modification. Alternatively, a less significant change that has only a peripheral impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabled player, in addition to access to the competition as required by Title III, an advantage over others and, for that reason, fundamentally alter the character of the competition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 682-683. The Court concluded that the PGA TOUR\u2019s walking rule, which was \u201cbased on an optional condition buried in an appendix to the Rules of Golf,\u201d was neither an essential element of the game nor \u201can indispensable feature of tournament golf.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 683, 685 (\u201cessence of the game has been shot-making\u201d). The Court also rejected the PGA TOUR\u2019s contention that Martin would gain an unfair advantage over his competitors if permitted to use a golf cart.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 686-688.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Applying these principles to the present matter, we find that summary judgment was properly granted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992) (\u201corder granting . . . summary judgment will be upheld if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law\u201d). Unlike the use of carts in golf, the allowance for more than one bounce in racquetball is \u201cinconsistent with the fundamental character of the game.\u201d <em>Martin, supra </em>at 683. The essence of the game of racquetball, as expressly articulated in the rules, is the hitting of a moving ball with a racquet before the second bounce.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Giving a wheelchair player two bounces and a footed player one bounce in head-to-head competition is a variation of the official rules that would \u201calter such an essential aspect of the game . . . that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 682. The modifications sought by Kuketz create a new game, with new strategies and new rules.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The club is certainly free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>establish or enter into a league that plays this variation of racquetball, but it is not required by the ADA to do so.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Kuketz argues that the \u201cfundamental alteration\u201d inquiry requires the defendants to evaluate his particular circumstances before rejecting his specific modification requests. His argument, however, is based on a misreading of <em>Martin. </em>While the Court held that an individualized inquiry was required by the ADA to determine whether a rule peripheral to the nature of an athletic event \u201cmight be waived in individual cases without working a fundamental alteration,\u201d it also concluded that, \u201c[t]o be sure, the waiver of an <em>essential </em>rule of competition <em>for anyone </em>would fundamentally alter the nature of\u201d the event (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 689. Because the record demonstrates that Kuketz\u2019s requested modifications require the \u201cwaiver of an essential rule of competition,\u201d the defendants need not make an individualized inquiry to determine the reasonableness of those modifications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Finally, Kuketz contends that the defendants\u2019 refusal to accommodate his needs is unjustified when the defendants previously have accommodated the needs of less skilled players through the practice of \u201cspotting\u201d points.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> That practice, however (just as a handicap in golf), does not change an essential aspect of how the game is played. Fitness and athletic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>clubs open to the public may choose to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d in any number of ways, and such practices are not to be discouraged, but the law does not require modifications that change the fundamental rules of the sport.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Kuketz previously had been a member of the club for a few months in 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Kuketz wanted to join the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league so that he could play racquetball against the best footed players available to help prepare himself for competing in upcoming international wheelchair events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The defendants contend that Kuketz demanded that he (and not his footed opponents) be allowed two bounces during league play when he signed up for the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league. Kuketz contends that he made no such demand at that time, but rather he assumed that this would be the case based on his experience playing elsewhere. Regardless, Kuketz\u2019s request to play in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league was premised on the league permitting him to return the ball after no more than two bounces, something it declined to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In 1995, the official rules of racquetball (rules) were those promulgated by the American Amateur Racquetball Association (AARA).

Kuketz disputes this fact. The dispute is immaterial, however, as Kuketz testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>fled in his deposition that league play is \u201cgoverned by the general rules of the USRA.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Modified rules for wheelchair competition can be found in part 8 of the rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">See rule 8.4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">See rule 8.3(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">There is some dispute whether in league play it is customary to afford wheelchair players a second bounce when playing against footed players who are afforded a single bounce. In his deposition, Kuketz testified that he had played in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league at the Raynham Athletic Club, where he was afforded two bounces against footed players, and that this practice was customary. When asked how he knew about the custom, he answered, \u201c[f]rom other players\u2019 experiences.\u201d One affiant, Geno Bonetti, the cofounder of the National Wheelchair Racquetball Association, stated that the practice of allowing a wheelchair player two bounces and an able-bodied player one bounce when competing against each other \u201cwas the custom known for the entire time [he] was actively involved in wheelchair racquetball, and from what [he could] gather, has been the custom since in non-tournament, club and/or recreational play.\u201d Another affiant, Otto Dietrich, the president of USRA and the national rules commissioner in 1995, stated that he was \u201cnot aware of any standardized custom or practice which governs play between a wheelchaired player and a footed player, during league play at clubs or in tournament play,\u201d and that he had \u201cnever been involved in, refereed or witnessed a league or tournament in which a footed player played [against] a wheelchaired player.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Petronelli is also an accomplished racquetball player, having been the women\u2019s national champion in 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Petronelli testified that her concerns over safety were based on the presence of a wheelchair on the court during a fast-paced game with \u201cA\u201d league footed players, compounded by a lack of familiarity those players would have with the differing nature of a game in which one player was permitted two bounces. She further testified that these concerns were based on her own expertise in the game and on discussion with the other players in the men\u2019s \u201cA\u201d league.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Kuketz does not contend that he was not permitted to play at the club, or that he was not permitted to play against footed players outside of league play.

It is undisputed that Petronelli was an employee of the club at the time of the alleged discrimination. The courts that have addressed the question whether an employee of a place of public accommodation is an \u201coperator\u201d for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a) are divided.

Here, because Petronelli does not argue that she was improperly named as a defendant and because we affirm the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on other grounds, we need not decide whether she is an \u201coperator\u201d for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">A claim for interference with a protected right in violation of G.

Given our decision that the granting of summary judgment is supported on other grounds, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether it is also supported on this ground.
