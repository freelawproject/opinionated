On appeal, he contends that the judge erred in ruling that he had no discretion to admit impeachment evidence that the complaining witness had been convicted as a common nightwalker. The defendant thus asks us to revisit whether the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, precludes introduction of convictions of the complaining witness under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, if the convictions are for sex-related offenses, a question addressed but left unresolved by an equally divided court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>430 Mass. 616 (2000) <em>(Houston). </em>We conclude that it is within the judge\u2019s discretion to admit evidence of such convictions pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, but that the exercise of that discretion must take into consideration the objectives of the rape-shield statute. As such, the judge below erred in failing to exercise discretion when ruling on the defendant\u2019s request to introduce the complainant\u2019s conviction as a common nightwalker.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The defendant also alleges error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Knowing that the rape-shield statute had precluded the defendant from introducing any evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s history of prostitution, the prosecutor attacked the defendant\u2019s theory of consensual sexual intercourse with a prostitute by arguing that there was no evidence that the complaining witness was a prostitute. We agree with the defendant that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper and that it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We therefore vacate the convictions of aggravated rape, kidnapping, intimidation of a witness, and assault and battery, and remand those indictments for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The evidence at trial was as follows. At ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>proximately 11 p.m. on January 22, 2002, the complainant\u2019s boy friend left her by herself at a bar in Lowell. The complainant was a regular customer at that establishment. The defendant, whom she did not know, was already in the bar when she arrived. The defendant approached the complainant and spoke to her briefly, but she ignored him. At approximately 12:30 a,m., the complainant called her boy friend to pick her up, waited inside the bar for a few minutes, and then went outside to wait for her ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The defendant followed her out of the bar, grabbed her by the arm, and pulled her across the street. He made a remark that he was \u201cloaded,\u201d which she took to mean that he had a gun. Once across the street, the defendant forced her down a stairwell, grabbed the back of her head, and pushed her against the wall. He proceeded to rape her twice, penetrating her both vaginally and anally. At some point during the encounter, he forced her to her knees. The defendant warned her not to \u201crat\u201d on him and threatened to kill her if she did. Some noise distracted the defendant momentarily, and the complainant was able to break free. Crying, she ran up the stairs and back toward the bar, with the defendant in pursuit. A witness nearby telephoned the police, reporting that a woman was screaming and running down the street, with a man chasing and trying to strike her.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The complainant entered the bar, in a distraught state, followed by the defendant, who acted \u201cnonchalant[].\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>complainant told the bartender that she had been raped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Overhearing the complainant\u2019s accusation of rape, the defendant said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d He then went over to the pool tables and resumed apparently normal conversation with other patrons. The police arrived in response to the 911 call.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complainant told one of the officers that the defendant had raped her, and pointed the defendant out to him. When the officer asked the defendant to come outside, the defendant replied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do nothing wrong\u201d and refused to accompany the officer. While being placed under arrest, the defendant struggled, biting one of the officers. He was eventually subdued with some form of pepper spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The complainant was taken to a hospital. She showed the nurse bruises on her knees and a clump of hair (which she said the defendant had pulled from her head). Subsequent testing of the rape kit evidence yielded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples consistent with the defendant\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The defendant\u2019s version of events was that the complainant was a prostitute who had falsely accused him of rape when he had been unable to pay her the agreed price for consensual intercourse. He testified that he had arrived at the bar around 9:30 p.m. At some point, he had gone over to the complainant and offered to buy her a drink. She declined, as she already had a beer, but asked him if he \u201cwanted a date,\u201d which he understood to be an offer of sex in exchange for money. She told him that she would be leaving after she finished her beer and that they would meet outside. Later on, when the complainant headed to the door to leave, she turned and winked at him, which he understood as the signal to follow her. After a brief discussion about where they could go, they proceeded across the street and down the stairwell. He inquired about price, and the complainant told him that her price depended on \u201cwhat [he] wanted.\u201d He indicated that he wanted oral sex, and she got down on her knees and began to perform oral sex on him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>However, when he changed his mind and wanted intercourse, she told him that the price would be higher. He agreed, and they proceeded to engage in vaginal and anal intercourse, with the complainant on her hands and knees. Afterward, when the complainant demanded payment, the defendant gave her the small amount of money he had left in his pocket and told her that he would have to owe her the rest. A loud argument ensued, and the complainant headed back toward the bar, with the defendant following her, both of them yelling and screaming. Back in the bar, when he heard the complainant saying that she had been raped, he told the bartender that he had not raped her and that she was just angry because she had not been paid. He admitted struggling with the officers (and that he bit one of them) when they later arrested him. He also claimed that when the arresting officer told him he was being arrested for rape, he explained again that the complainant was just angry because she had not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Impeachment of the complainant by prior conviction as a common nightwalker. </em>Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine based on the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, seeking to exclude the complainant\u2019s \u201csexual history,\u201d including the fact that she had \u201cbeen convicted of prostitution in the past.\u201d The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that he should be allowed to introduce the complainant\u2019s prior convictions for the purpose of impeaching her. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. On May 24, 2002, the complainant had been convicted of being a common nightwalker, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, for which a fine of one hundred dollars had been imposed. She also had two earlier convictions of common night-walking in 1999 and 2001, and had been placed on probation for both of those offenses. The judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine with respect to the common nightwalker convictions, on the ground that they were precluded by the rape-shield statute. He also noted that, irrespective of the rape-shield statute, only one of the common nightwalking convictions (the 2002 conviction that resulted in a fine) would satisfy the prerequisites for introduction under G. L. c. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\u00a7 21, First.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He later articulated the view that in light of the rape-shield statute and <em>Houston, supra, </em>he was required to exclude that conviction, and that he had exercised no discretion in deciding to exclude it. He did allow the defendant to impeach the complainant with a prior conviction of a nonsexual offense, specifically, a 1997 conviction of larceny of property over $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">On appeal, the defendant contends that a judge should have discretion to admit evidence of a complaining witness\u2019s conviction of a prior sexual offense for purposes of impeaching that witness, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, notwithstanding the rape-shield statute\u2019s prohibition against admitting evidence of a sexual assault victim\u2019s \u201csexual conduct,\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. The court identified the potential conflict between these two statutes in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 231 n.8 (1981), but declined to decide the question. The court confronted the issue directly in <em>Houston, supra, </em>but were equally divided as to how the competing requirements of the two statutes should be resolved. Compare <em>id. </em>at 623-626 (Marshall, C.J., concurring) (\u00a721 does not allow impeachment by conviction of sexual offense committed by witness entitled to protection of rape-shield statute), with <em>id. </em>at 626-629 (Lynch, J., concurring) (judges have discretion to admit evidence of such convictions under \u00a7 21, but should consider policies underlying rape-shield statute when exercising that discretion), and <em>id. </em>at 629-632 (Cowin, J., concurring) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The parties have briefed extensively their respective interpretations of <em>Houston, </em>with varying views as to how the procedural history and status of that case should have caused the judge to follow one or the other of the concurring opinions. We need not resolve the arguments about how <em>Houston </em>itself should have been applied, as we are prepared to decide the issue that divided the court in <em>Houston. </em>We agree with the reasoning of the concurring opinions of Justice Lynch, <em>id. </em>at 626-629, and Justice Cowin, <em>id. </em>at 629-632, and hold that a judge has discretion to allow impeachment of a sexual assault complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ant by prior convictions of sexual offenses, but that in exercising that discretion, the purposes of the rape-shield statute should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">We begin with a brief overview of the two statutes involved. Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, a witness\u2019s prior criminal conviction \u201cmay be shown to affect [the witness\u2019s] credibility.\u201d The theory underlying \u00a7 21 is that a witness\u2019s \u201cearlier disregard for the law may suggest to the fact finder similar disregard for the courtroom oath.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>400 Mass. 296, 302-303 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 608 (1986). \u201cOne who has been convicted of crime is presumed to be less worthy of belief than one who has not been so convicted.\u201d <em>Brillante </em>v. <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 542, 545 (2002), quoting <em>Labrie </em>v. <em>Midwood, </em>273 Mass. 578, 582 (1931). Thus, while we do not allow a witness to be impeached by evidence of prior bad acts, if those bad acts have resulted in a conviction, the conviction itself may be admissible under \u00a7 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bregoli, </em>431 Mass. 265, 275 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. 593, 600 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>374 Mass. 293, 305 (1978); P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.10.3, at 329-330 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In order to be admissible for impeachment purposes, the convictions in question must meet specific requirements based on the degree of the offense (felony or misdemeanor), the nature of the disposition, and the timing and sequence of the convictions. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. Even where a particular conviction meets those requirements, a judge has discretion to exclude evidence of the conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 469-470 (1984). In the exercise of that discretion, the judge is to consider whether the \u201cdanger of unfair prejudice outweigh[s] the probative value of the evidence of a prior conviction for the purposes of impeachment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192, 194 (1984); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 (1977). Where the judge decides to allow introduction of a prior conviction under \u00a7 21, the potential prejudice may be ameliorated by an appropriate limiting instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, </em>438 Mass. 1, 12 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 250 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, is applicable to proceedings involving certain sexual offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute precludes admission of evidence of a victim\u2019s \u201creputation\u201d with respect to \u201csexual conduct,\u201d as well as \u201c[e]vidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute creates two exceptions to that prohibition, allowing \u201cevidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order for a defendant to introduce such evidence pursuant to either of those exceptions, the judge must first hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion and offer of proof, and make a finding that \u201cthe weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition to the exceptions set forth in the statute, we have ruled that a defendant may introduce evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s sexual conduct where that conduct is relevant to the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 227-229. However, even when offered to show bias or motive to lie, the judge should exercise discretion with respect to the introduction of such evidence, bearing in mind \u201cthe important policies underlying the [r]ape-[s]hield statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231. See <em>id. </em>at 232-233 (Braucher, J., concurring) (consistent with rape-shield statute, judge should hold hearing on evidence of sexual conduct offered to show motive for false accusation, and determine whether weight and relevance of evidence outweighs prejudicial effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The rape-shield statute comports with the common-law rule that a complainant\u2019s sexual intercourse with persons other than the defendant is inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 569 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 226 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>105 Mass. 593 (1870). The innovation in the rape-shield statute was not its prohibition of evidence pertaining to \u201cspecific instances\u201d of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct, as that evidence was already precluded at common law. Rather, what the statute added was the prohibition of evidence of the complainant\u2019s \u201creputation\u201d in such matters. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 227-228. A complainant\u2019s \u201creputation for unchastity\u201d had been admissible at common law and had been viewed as probative of the complainant\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>367 Mass. 605, 610 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 668 (1966); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>131 Mass. 336 (1881); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>113 Mass. 210 (1873). The common-law rule, which prohibits evidence of specific instances of sexual conduct while allowing \u201creputation\u201d evidence on the same subject, was the product of a strong common-law tradition that allowed proof of character to be introduced solely by means of \u201creputation\u201d evidence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>119 Mass. 342, 344-347 (1876). Under that approach, a rape complainant\u2019s \u201cunchaste character\u201d was relevant and could be shown by evidence of her reputation <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendall, supra), </em>but that character could not be shown by introducing evidence of, for example, a specific adulterous affair <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, supra). </em>The rape-shield statute operates to exclude all such evidence, whether in the form of \u201cspecific instances\u201d of sexual conduct or in the form of \u201creputation\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The common-law rule excluding evidence of the complainant\u2019s specific sexual conduct with others, and the rape-shield statute that later codified that aspect of the common-law rule, was premised on the fact that \u201csuch evidence has little probative value on the issue of consent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 227. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, supra </em>at 227 (\u201cvictim\u2019s consent to intercourse with one man does not imply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>her consent in the case of another\u201d). The rape-shield statute also prevents an array of adverse effects on the complaining witness and the process of the trial. Introduction of evidence concerning the complainant\u2019s sexual past \u201cwould prolong the trial and divert the attention of the trier of fact from the alleged criminal acts of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra. </em>In addition, \u201cinquiries into the sexual history of the rape complainant chills her willingness to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228. \u201cRape-shield statutes are \u2018aimed at eliminating a common defense strategy of trying the complaining witness rather than the defendant. The result of this strategy was harassment and further humiliation of the victim as well as discouraging victims of rape from reporting the crimes to law enforcement authorities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>224 Kan. 468, 470 (1978). See <em>Houston, supra </em>at 621 (Marshall, C.J., concurring) (rationale underlying rape-shield statute \u201cis that evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct might divert attention from the alleged criminal acts of the defendant, inappropriately putting the victim on trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We now confront the issue of how to harmonize these two statutes when the prior conviction that the defendant seeks to introduce for impeachment purposes under \u00a7 21 is for a sexual offense, and thus overlaps with the \u00a7 21B prohibition against introduction of the complaining witness\u2019s \u201csexual conduct.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that \u00a7 21B, being the more recent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the more specific of the two statutes, controls. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215-216 (1997); 2B N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02, at 193, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>194 (6th ed. 2000). The canon of statutory construction has been correctly identified, but its application to these two statutes is problematic. While the rape-shield statute was not enacted until 1977 (St. 1977, c. 110), the prohibition against introduction of \u201cspecific instances\u201d of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct was not new. As discussed above, that aspect of the statute simply restated a rule at common law. It was not a \u201crecent\u201d innovation when \u00a7 21B was enacted, but rather a common-law rule that had coexisted with \u00a7 21 for over a century.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Moreover, it is difficult to define which of the two statutes is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the more \u201cspecific\u201d and which is the more \u201cgeneral.\u201d Section 21 is \u201cgeneral\u201d in the sense that it applies to all criminal trials, whereas \u00a7 21B is more \u201cspecific\u201d in applying only to prosecutions for particular offenses. However, \u00a7 21 is far more \u201cspecific\u201d with respect to what it covers (the use of certain convictions meeting particular requirements for the single purpose of impeachment, and only if the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion allows it), whereas \u00a7 21B addresses the admissibility for any purpose of anything that would come within the ambit of \u201csexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Rather than mechanically applying the concept that the more \u201crecent\u201d or more \u201cspecific\u201d statute (whichever one that is) trumps the other, we should endeavor to harmonize the two statutes so that the policies underlying both may be honored. Implied repeal of a statute is disfavored, and we should not impliedly repeal a portion of \u00a7 21 unless it \u201cis so repugnant to, and inconsistent with, the later enactment [\u00a7 21B] that both cannot stand.\u201d <em>LaBranche </em>v. <em>A.J. Lane &amp; Co., </em>404 Mass. 725, 728 (1989), quoting <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>392 Mass. 788, 792 (1984). See <em>Houston, supra </em>at 628 (Lynch, J., concurring), and cases cited. Given that the common-law rule excluding evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct had long operated in tandem with impeachment by way of convictions under \u00a7 21, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>we do not believe that the mere codification of that common-law rule in \u00a7 21B suddenly makes it impossible for it to stand alongside \u00a7 21. Moreover, \u201c[a] statute is not to be deemed to repeal or supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 512 (1977), quoting <em>Colt </em>v. <em>Fradkin, </em>361 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1972). Here, we encounter legislative silence on how these two statutes should relate to each other, not \u201cexpress words\u201d or \u201cclear implication\u201d that \u00a7 21B is to be given priority over \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">As we attempt to harmonize these statutes, it is not for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>determine which of them is more weighty or worthwhile and to allow that statute to dominate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, we must seek to apply them in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, serves the policies underlying both. Resort to the sound exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion, which is already a prerequisite to any introduction of prior convictions as impeachment evidence under \u00a7 21, allows for consideration of the purposes of both statutes. This approach reconciles the competing interests of the two statutes by carving out an extremely narrow exception to \u00a7 21B, an exception that will be allowed only where the sexual conduct in question has led to a criminal conviction, the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tion in turn meets all the technical requirements of \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the judge is satisfied that the probative value of the conviction for purposes of impeaching the complainant outweighs the prejudice to the Commonwealth and the complainant. See <em>Houston, supra </em>at 631 (Cowin, J., concurring). The alternative, a complete prohibition on the impeachment use of convictions of <em>any </em>sex-related offense (a prohibition that would not be limited to convictions involving prostitution), would constitute a much larger and totally inflexible exception to \u00a7 21. We have neither \u201cexpress words\u201d nor a \u201cclear implication\u201d suggesting that \u00a7 21B was intended to supersede \u00a7 21 in that complete fashion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">When the prior conviction is of a sexual offense and is being offered to impeach the complaining witness in a sexual assault case, the judge\u2019s consideration of the \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d of introducing the conviction should take into account the important policies underlying the rape-shield statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Houston, supra </em>at 629 (Lynch, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 632 (Cowin, J., concurring). The judge should thus consider the potential that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the jury may misuse the conviction of a sexual offense as indicative of the complaining witness\u2019s consent, and the risk that the complaining witness may be subjected to needless humiliation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under today\u2019s ruling, the rape-shield statute remains as an important protection for rape victims, including those who happen to be prostitutes \u2014 neither the facts surrounding their sexual conduct nor their reputation in such matters is admissible, and even if a complainant\u2019s prior conviction of prostitution satisfies all the technical prerequisites of \u00a7 21 (see note 11, <em>supra), </em>the judge must consider the policies to be promoted by the rape-shield statute and may exclude the conviction due to those policy considerations. We see no reason to fear that trial judges will be insensitive to these concerns, that they will exercise their discretion in ways that will \u201ceviscerate[]\u201d the rape-shield statute, or that they will be heedless of the particular prejudice at issue where the complainant\u2019s prior conviction is related to prostitution. <em>Post </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The judge below thus erred in declining to exercise any discretion when ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>limine. That the exercise of discretion could, had it been undertaken, permissibly have resulted in the same decision to exclude the conviction does not necessarily insulate the error from reversal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 948 (1983) (reversal where judge erroneously believed he had no discretion but to admit defendant\u2019s prior convictions, rejecting speculative argument that exercise of discretion would have led to their admission); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 301-305 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 214 (1987). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coviello, </em>378 Mass. 530, 533-534 &amp; n.8 (1979) (harmless error in judge\u2019s failure to exercise discretion with respect to whether conviction could be introduced on direct as opposed to cross-examination). The Commonwealth argues, with considerable force, that the error here was harmless, as the defendant was allowed to introduce the complainant\u2019s conviction of a nonsexual offense (her 1997 conviction of larceny of property over $250), thereby permitting him this method of impeachment without trenching on the concerns underlying the rape-shield statute. While a jury\u2019s improper use of the complainant\u2019s common nightwalker conviction might have been beneficial to the defendant, there is little if any reason to believe that its proper impeachment value alone would have had any effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendant argues, however, that the common nightwalker conviction from 2002 was recent, whereas the 1997 larceny conviction was six years old by the time of trial, and that the impeachment power of two convictions combined would be greater than the power of a single, and somewhat old, offense. We need not resolve the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to whether this error alone would require reversal, as, for the reasons discussed below, there was also error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument raising a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and necessitating a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">b. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>During closing argument, the prosecutor refuted the defense theory of the case by pointing out that there was no evidence that the complaining witness was a prostitute. She further suggested that the complainant was not a prostitute because a prostitute would have known enough to insist on payment in advance and would have had more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>a single customer on the night in question. Leading into this argument, the prosecutor also suggested that the complainant\u2019s demeanor on the stand (which had been alluded to during the defense closing) was the product of being falsely accused of being a prostitute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no objection. On appeal, the defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s improper exploitation of the exclusion of evidence under the rape-shield statute gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Under the rape-shield statute, the defendant was precluded from introducing any evidence of the complainant\u2019s history of prostitution. The Commonwealth erroneously suggests that the only evidence that had been excluded under the rape-shield statute was the 2002 common nightwalker conviction that the defendant sought to introduce as impeachment evidence. While that was the sole evidence the defendant sought to introduce, it was not the entirety of the evidence that would have been available to the defendant, but for the prohibition codified in the rape-shield statute. At a minimum, the three Lowell District Court convictions of common nightwalking (the most recent of which stemmed from an arrest just two weeks after the alleged rape) would have given defense counsel a good faith basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ask the complainant about her experience as a prostitute in the area. Fully cognizant of the limitations imposed by the rape-shield statute (as indicated by the prior proceedings on the motion in limine), defense counsel had appropriately refrained from introducing evidence of or alluding to the complainant\u2019s history of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">It was improper for the prosecutor to suggest to the jury that the absence of any evidence that the complainant engaged in prostitution meant that she was not a prostitute. The Commonwealth contends that all the prosecutor was referring to was the absence of any evidence that the complainant was engaged in prostitution \u201con the night in question.\u201d While some of the argument did include references to the complainant\u2019s behavior \u201cthis night,\u201d the context, as reasonably understood by the jury, went beyond the confines of that specific night. At the outset, the prosecutor sought to explain the complainant\u2019s demeanor on the stand by invoking a sense of righteous indignation that she would be called a prostitute, suggesting to the jury that what they had seen was an emotional reaction to the ostensible falsity of that offensive label. At the time she made that argument, the prosecutor knew that the label was in fact accurate, and that prosecutors in her own office had proved its accuracy on three separate occasions. Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked the jury \u201cwhat evidence\u201d they had before them that would indicate that the complainant was a prostitute, thereby offering an open invitation to consider the absence of evidence on the entire subject. The prosecutor\u2019s next line of argument, the implausibility that a prostitute would fail to ask for payment in advance, was legitimately linked to the specific events of that night, but was phrased in a way that, following on the heels of the previous improper argument, suggested to the jury that the complainant could not have been a prostitute because no experienced prostitute would conduct business that way. Similarly, the references to the complainant\u2019s remaining at the bar (without having been seen going in and out) would properly relate to the night in question, but that proper argument would take on further meaning from the prior improper argument \u2014 it was but one example of the lack of any evidence to show that the complainant engaged in prostitution at all. The over-all mes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>sage to the jury from this entire line of argument was that the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the incident was the only evidence they had of the complainant\u2019s prostitution and that, in the absence of any other evidence to corroborate his claim that she was a prostitute, the defense theory was not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Counsel may not, in closing, \u201cexploit[] the absence of evidence that had been excluded at his request.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>439 Mass. 547, 555 (2003). Such exploitation of absent, excluded evidence is \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and \u201creprehensible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1983). \u201c[A] party\u2019s success in excluding evidence from the consideration of the jury does not later give that party license to invite inferences (whether true or, as in this case, false) regarding the excluded evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (1980). As illustrated by the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine, the Commonwealth objected to introduction of any evidence that would link the complainant to prior acts of prostitution. Having succeeded in excluding all such evidence, the prosecutor could not then ask the jury to infer that the absence of such evidence meant that the complainant could not be a prostitute. The argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In determining whether an error in closing argument requires reversal, we consider whether defense counsel made a timely objection; whether the judge\u2019s instructions mitigated the error; whether the error was central to the issues at trial or concerned only collateral matters; whether the jury would be able to sort out any excessive claims or hyperbole; and whether the Commonwealth\u2019s case was so strong that the error would cause no prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997), <em>S.C., 421 </em>Mass. 298, and 428 Mass. 39, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1003 (1998), and cases cited. Here, there was no objection, but that is the only factor that favors the Commonwealth. All of the remaining factors support the defendant\u2019s claim for a new trial. The judge\u2019s standard instructions to the effect that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury\u2019s verdict had to be based solely on the evidence would not ameliorate the prosecutor\u2019s improper reference to the absence of evidence concerning the victim\u2019s experience as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>prostitute. The error went to the entire crux of the defense, and indeed was directed at the principal disputed issue at trial. The nature of the error was not something that the jury could, on their own, put in perspective and ignore \u2014 the jury were presumably ignorant of the fact that the defendant had been precluded from introducing any evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct or reputation. Finally, although the Commonwealth\u2019s case was strong,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it was not \u201cso overwhelming that the error[] did not prejudice the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 591 (1983). On balance, we conclude that this erroneous argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and we therefore order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the convictions of assault and battery on a public employee and resisting arrest are affirmed (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>The remaining convictions are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the matter is remanded for a new trial. On retrial, if the defendant seeks to impeach the complainant with evidence of a prior conviction of a sex-related offense, the judge should exercise discretion with respect to the admission or exclusion of that impeachment evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, and that exercise of discretion should include consideration of the purposes underlying the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The conviction of kidnapping was placed on file, and is therefore technically not before us.

However, where error requiring a new trial on the other convictions would also necessitate a new trial on the kidnapping charge, we order a new trial on that indictment as well. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 28 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prashaw, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 27 (2003), and cases cited. Moreover, the alleged kidnapping was the sole aggravating factor offered in support of the aggravated rape charges. If, on retrial, the defendant is again convicted of aggravated rape based on the aggravating factor of kidnapping, the kidnapping conviction would be duplicative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>430 Mass. 616, 617 n.1 (2000) (Marshall, C.J., concurring) <em>(Houston), </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>46 Mass.

See Rev. St. (1836) c. 94, \u00a7 56; St. 1851, c. 233, \u00a7 97. At common law, a witness was not permitted to testify if he had been convicted of an \u201cinfamous\u201d crime, the theory being that such a conviction made him \u201cunworthy of credit for truth.\u201d <em>Utley </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>11 Met. 302, 302 (1846). The 1836 statute codified that common-law rule, but provided an exception permitting a witness who had been convicted in another State to testify, subject, however, to impeachment with evidence of that out-of-State conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Statute 1851, c. 233, \u00a7 97, eliminated the 1836 statute\u2019s witness exclusion rule. It amended what had been the common law, permitting (for the first time) a witness to testify even if the witness previously had been convicted of an \u201cinfamous\u201d crime in Massachusetts. <em>Utley </em>v. <em>Merrick, supra. </em>The 1851 statute simultaneously adopted the approach of the 1836 statute, permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the credibility of such a witness to be impeached by his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Later amendments each carried forward the substance of the 1851 statute, but made certain classes of convictions inadmissible for impeachment purposes. See, e.g., St. 1913, c. 81 (making certain misdemeanor convictions inadmissible); St. 1914, c. 406 (making certain felony convictions inadmissible); St. 1974, c. 502 (making certain traffic violations inadmissible).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\">As a legislative enactment making certain evidence admissible, \u00a7 21 and its predecessor statutes superseded any prior common-law evidentiary rule excluding such evidence. Thus, a statement in 1846 to the effect that evidence of a witness\u2019s prostitution was inadmissible to impeach her, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>11 Met. 538, 539 (1846) (see <em>post </em>at 739 n.1 (see <em>post </em>at 734 n. 1), would not take precedence over a statute enacted five years later that made \u201cany\u201d criminal conviction admissible to impeach a witness. St. 1851, c. 233, \u00a7 97. After that statute\u2019s enactment, this court repeatedly stressed that it made \u201cany\u201d conviction admissible for impeachment, without regard to whether the particular conviction would have been admissible at common law, and without regard to the court\u2019s view as to whether a specific conviction was particularly germane to credibility. \u201cThe statute puts all convictions of crime on the same footing, \u2014 those which would formerly have excluded a witness, those which have heretofore gone to credibility, <em>and those which formerly would not have been admissible at all\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>150 Mass. 108, 109 (1889). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, 4 </em>Allen 305, 306-307 (1862) (statute allowed impeachment by conviction of \u201ckeeping a house of ill fame,\u201d rejecting argument that conviction could only be introduced if it would previously have rendered witness incompetent to testify). Thus, while the court still expressed its own view that evidence of a witness\u2019s sexual conduct would not be admissible to impeach her, the court simultaneously acknowledged that, under the statute, a <em>conviction </em>would nevertheless be admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vandenhecke, </em>248 Mass. 403, 404-405 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">It was only when the rape-shield statute was enacted in 1977, prohibiting the introduction of all such evidence under any rubric, that the prior common-law rule barring introduction of specific incidents of sexual conduct was placed on a par with the statute allowing convictions to be used for impeachment, and thus gave rise to the interpretive dilemma this court recognized in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 231 n.8 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The scant legislative history available does not provide any such clear signal on the subject. From the fact that \u00a7 21B was ultimately modeled on the Senate version of the bill (which had no reference to the use of convictions, see 1977 Senate Doc.

To illustrate the perceived \u201charm\u201d in the proposed rape-shield bills, the Chairman asked, \u201cWhat are we going to do about the person who\u2019s screwing all over town?,\u201d and noted that \u201csome prostitutes would be able to use the law to claim they were raped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It has long been observed that critics and opponents of legislation are a particularly poor source for insight into the meaning and scope of a statute, as \u201cthey understandably tend to overstate its reach.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Fruit &amp; Vegetable Packers &amp; Warehousemen, Local 760, </em>377 U.S. 58, 66 (1964). See <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst </em>v. <em>Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 203-204 n.24 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calamaro, </em>354 U.S. 351, 357-358 n.9 (1957); <em>Schwegmann Bros. </em>v. <em>Calvert Distillers Corp., </em>341 U.S. 384, 394-395 (1951); <em>United States </em>v. <em>International Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 701, </em>638 F.2d 1161, 1168 (9th Cir. 1979). To the extent that the Chairman \u201cultimately supported\u201d the particular rape-shield legislation that was enacted (see <em>post </em>at 736 n.5), that may signify that he was later convinced that that version of the bill was not as far reaching as he had feared. Whatever weight we should give to the chairman\u2019s apparent dismay that a rape-shield statute would enable prostitutes to claim they were raped, nothing in his statement \u2014 or anywhere else in the press release \u2014 addresses the specific issue of the use of convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">That is the approach adopted by the dissent, which views a conviction of prostitution to have \u201clittle \u2014 or nonexistent \u2014 probative value,\u201d whereas the rape-shield statute combats \u201cprejudice against. . . rape victims.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 737.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Many convictions for prostitution-related offenses will not satisfy those requirements.

When a conviction is introduced under \u00a7 21, all that is introduced is the fact of the conviction \u2014 neither side may seek to introduce the particulars of how the offense was committed or the circumstances surrounding it.

Instead, the evidence of prior convictions is extremely brief and is introduced in almost clinical fashion, usually just a single question asking the witness to acknowledge the date, the court, and the technical term for the offense committed. Allowing defense counsel to introduce a complainant\u2019s prior conviction of a sex-related offense does not create an effective opportunity to divert the jury\u2019s attention or to make the complainant run an embarrassing gauntlet of questions about her sex life.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Nor does the introduction of a witness\u2019s conviction of a sexual offense constitute an \u201cinvasion[] of privacy.\u201d <em>Houston, supra </em>at 626 n.13 (Marshall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>C.J., concurring). Ordinarily, delving into \u201cspecific instances\u201d of a witness\u2019s sexual conduct would unquestionably intrude on intimate aspects of the witness\u2019s private life, but if that sexual conduct is itself a violation of the criminal laws and has resulted in a criminal conviction, it is no longer a \u201cprivate\u201d matter. The conviction, resting on an accusation that has been made publicly and either proved or admitted in open court, is instead a matter of public record. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 435 (2001); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>819 F. Supp. 89, 100-101 (D.

We have long held that a testifying defendant may be impeached with prior convictions, including convictions of offenses similar to the offense being tried, and we rely on limiting instructions to cure the otherwise obvious prejudice in such situations.

If we rely on limiting instructions to guarantee a defendant a fair- trial despite the jury\u2019s awareness of the defendant\u2019s criminal past, we can rely on them to guarantee the Commonwealth and the complainant a fair trial despite the jury\u2019s awareness of the complainant\u2019s criminal past.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s closing included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201cNow, you saw [the complainant] get upset on the stand.

If someone is a prostitute and that\u2019s their business and that\u2019s how they make their money, do you think they\u2019re going to get their money up front? Do you think they\u2019re just going to believe some guy that they meet in the bar that he\u2019s going to pay them later; or, do you think they\u2019re going to ask for their money up front?</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\u201cIf someone\u2019s a prostitute, do you think they\u2019re going to be sitting at a bar all night, or they\u2019re only going to have one customer?</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">\u201cDo you think she\u2019s actually going to be observed by maybe the bartender, maybe some other people in the bar to be getting up, going outside for a short period of time, coming back, getting up, going outside for a short period of time, coming back?

However, as the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument acknowledged, the quality of the tape recording of that 911 call was \u201cpretty poor\u201d and would require repeated listening to decipher. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument also asked the jury to listen to the tape recording, contending that the tape contained evidence of \u201cargument back and forth\u201d between the defendant and the complainant, consistent with the defendant\u2019s version.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b749-7\">Marshall, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9y\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part, with whom Greaney, J., joins).

I respectfully dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>sent from so much of the court\u2019s opinion as gives a trial judge discretion to admit in evidence a rape complainant\u2019s past conviction of a crime involving sexual conduct solely for the purpose of impeaching her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>430 Mass. 616 (2000), I noted that \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting rape victims sets an important limit on a judge\u2019s discretionary authority to admit prior convictions submitted generally to impeach a complainant witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 (Marshall, C.J., concurring). It has always done so, both before and after the enactment of the general impeachment statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, and its predecessor statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Today, the court concludes that juries will be permitted to infer that an alleged rape victim is more likely to be fabricating an accusation of rape because she has been convicted of a crime involving sexual conduct, such as being a \u201ccommon nightwalker.\u201d The court reasons that the Legislature, in enacting the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, inserted by St. 1977, c. 110, gave no \u201cclear implication\u201d that it intended to prohibit such use of an alleged rape victim\u2019s past conviction. <em>Ante </em>at 725. I disagree. The legislative intent to that effect could not be more clear. Moreover, the rape-shield statute is a specific statute, adopted later in time than the impeachment statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, and with a clear purpose. To the extent that any provision of the 1977 rape-shield statute conflicts with the Nineteenth Century general impeachment statute, well-settled principles of statutory construction require that the more recent statute be given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">As to legislative history, when the rape-shield statute was under consideration in 1977, the Legislature affirmatively chose <em>not </em>to permit impeachment of alleged rape victims by evidence of sexual conduct convictions. For more than one century it had been the established law of this Commonwealth that the credibility of an alleged rape victim may not be challenged simply because she had previously engaged in specific acts of sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The explanation for our rule was straightforward: \u201cthe victim\u2019s consent to [sexual] intercourse with one man does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>not imply her consent in the case of another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>363 Mass. 220, 227 (1973). The common law had been reaffirmed by this court just four months before enactment of the rape-shield statute, so there was no question as to its continued vitality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 569 (1976) (prohibiting introduction of \u201cevidence of instances of prior [sexual] intercourse of the victim\u201d). When the common-law evidentiary rule prohibiting the introduction of \u201cevidence of instances of prior [sexual] intercourse with other persons,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 668 (1966), was codified by the Legislature in the 1977 rape-shield statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Legislature included within that prohibition <em>all </em>\u201cspecific instances\u201d of sexual conduct. It did not create any exception for those \u201cinstances\u201d of sexual conduct evidenced by a rape victim\u2019s conviction. To the contrary, the Legislature considered, but rejected, several bills that would have permitted a rape complainant to be impeached by a conviction of prostitution or other criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Specifically, in early 1977, the Senate referred to its Committee on the Judiciary four \u201crape-shield\u201d bills. Three of the bills had originated in the House; all three contained an exception to the rape-shield provisions that would have <em>permitted </em>impeachment of a rape complainant by her prior convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fourth bill, which had originated in the Senate, contained no such exception. See 1977 Senate Doc. No. 752. The subsequently enacted statute did not include the exceptions contained in each of the three House bills that would have permitted rape complainants to be impeached by their prior convictions. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B; St. 1977, c. 110; 1977 Senate Doc. No. 1433.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Legislature\u2019s decision not to enact the proposed House bills is convincing, if not conclusive, evidence of legislative intent. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 556 (1996) (declining to read into statute a provision contained in predecessor bills but omitted from enacted statute). See also 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 48.04, at 431-433 (6th ed. 2000) (\u201c[W]here the language under question was rejected by the legislature and thus not contained in the statute it provides an indication that the legislature did not want the issue considered\u201d); <em>Transportation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maksyn, </em>580 S.W.2d 334, 338 (Tex. 1979) (\u201cThe deletion of a provision in a pending bill discloses the legislative intent to reject the proposal. Courts should be slow to put back that which the legislature has rejected\u201d). Contrary to the court\u2019s reasoning, <em>ante </em>at 725 n.9, the \u201csignal on the subject\u201d from the Legislature is indeed clear: it had before it three bills that would permit impeachment of a complaining witness with a prior conviction of sexual conduct. It rejected all three in favor of a statute that does not permit impeachment by a criminal sexual conduct conviction. The court disregards this clear legislative choice. It creates an exception to the scope of rape-shield statute that the Legislature rejected, substituting its judgment for that of the Legislature on an important matter of social policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This it may not do. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>430 Mass. 616, 631 (2000) (Cowin, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Legislature is the body for enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ing social policy change\u201d). The rape-shield statute should be enforced to exclude the evidence, as the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The Legislature\u2019s 1977 decision not to permit impeachment of an alleged rape victim by a prostitution conviction, for example, was entirely reasonable. In the years leading up to the enactment of the rape-shield statute, reports had described the difficulty of obtaining convictions in rape cases because of court room prejudice against alleged rape victims. See, e.g., H. Kalven, Jr. &amp; H. Zeisel, The American Jury 249-254 (1966) (reporting study finding that juries acquit rape defendants because of the victims\u2019 \u201ccontributory fault\u201d); Berger, Man\u2019s Trial, Woman\u2019s Tribulation: Rape Cases in the Courtroom, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 71 (1977) (\u201cStudies have shown that judges \u2014 although less so than jurors \u2014 tend to distrust the complaining witness\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prejudice or disbelief occurs with particular intensity when the complainant is a prostitute, and courts have long sought means to minimize jury bias against prostitutes. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>11 Met. 538, 539 (1846) (evidence of prostitution inadmissible to impeach credibility of female witness). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vandenhecke, </em>248 Mass. 403, 404 (1924) (\u201cThe rule is well established that the fact that a female witness is a prostitute or keeps a house of ill fame is not admissible to impeach her\u201d). Prostitutes are frequent victims of rape. See, e.g., Anderson, From Chastity Requirement to Sexuality License: Sexual Consent and a New Rape Shield Law, 70 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 51, 113 &amp; n.367 (2002) (citing studies substantiating that more than seventy per cent of prostitutes are victims of rape). Yet societal beliefs persist that prostitutes cannot be raped, or that they are not harmed by rape, or that they somehow deserve to be raped. <em>Id. </em>at 113-117. In enacting the rape-shield statute, the Legislature could well have recognized that these prejudices outweighed the little \u2014 or nonexistent \u2014 probative value of a sexual conduct conviction in determining a rape complainant\u2019s credibility. The likelihood of a jury impermissibly using such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>evidence would outweigh almost inevitably any modicum of impeachment value such a conviction might have. The Legislature considered but decided <em>not </em>to reject the \u201clong held view\u201d that prostitution (or evidence of other sexual conduct) simply is not relevant to credibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 231 (1981), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vandenhecke, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 21, permits the use of a prior conviction solely \u201cto affect [the witness\u2019s] credibility.\u201d In a case such as this, where the witness is a rape complainant who claims lack of consent, the issue of her credibility mirrors precisely the issue of her consent. The law is settled that a rape complainant\u2019s prior instances of sexual conduct are not admissible to prove consent to sexual intercourse. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 668 (1966). But if a judge may now permit evidence of an alleged rape victim\u2019s prior conviction of criminal sexual conduct to be introduced to impeach her credibility, i.e., to show that she is fabricating her testimony to the effect that she did <em>not </em>consent to sexual intercourse, that evidentiary rule is vitiated. And, while in any particular case the evidence of a prior conviction of prostitution or some other sexual offense may be \u201cextremely brief,\u201d I cannot regard introduction of that evidence as \u201calmost clinical.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 727 n.12. Courts have long recognized the difficulty in persuading juries that prostitutes are the victims of rape. Any evidence that reinforces juror prejudice may be decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Established canons of statutory construction reinforce this conclusion. Application of those principles here is not \u201cproblematic,\u201d as the court suggests, <em>ante </em>at 724, nor would application be merely \u201cmechanical[].\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 725. \u201cWhen a new provision conflicts with a prior statute, the new provision, as the last expression of the Legislature, controls.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215 (1997). See 2B N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (6th ed. 2000) (\u201cWhere two statutes are involved each of which by its terms applies to the facts before the court, the statute which is the more recent of the two irreconcilably conflicting statutes prevails or one of the statutes can be deemed an exception to the general rule enunciated in the other statute\u201d). The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>at issue in this case \u2014 conviction of being a common night-walker \u2014 is an \u201cinstance[] of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct\u201d inadmissible under the precise terms of the rape-shield statute. But the general impeachment statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, would permit a judge to admit the conviction in evidence to impeach the complainant. The rape-shield statute, as the more recent expression of the Legislature\u2019s intent, must control so as to exclude the evidence. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra. </em>Moreover, when the provisions of two statutes are in conflict, \u201cthe more specific provision, particularly where it has been enacted subsequent to a more general rule, applies over the general rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See 2B N.J. Singer, <em>supra </em>(\u201cWhere a conflict exists the more specific statute controls over the more general one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">There is no need to create artificial constraints \u2014 discussing the need to harmonize and alluding to possible implied repeal, <em>ante </em>at 725 \u2014 to arrive at the result. The rape-shield statute requires that the evidence be excluded. The court\u2019s contrary conclusion eviscerates the statute, subverts the Legislature\u2019s intent to protect rape victims, and leaves the most vulnerable of victims, almost always women, subject to being put on trial themselves for conduct the Legislature and this court has deemed irrelevant to a jury\u2019s consideration. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">In 1846, Chief Justice Shaw repudiated the then prevailing doctrine that \u201cevidence is admissible to impeach the credibility of a female witness, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>tends to show that she is, and for some time has been, a common prostitute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>11 Met. 538, 539 (1846).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The reference in the rape-shield statute, G.
