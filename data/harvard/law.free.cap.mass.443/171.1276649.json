Whether the defendants, either acting as a Massachusetts surety posting bail for a principal or acting as agents for that surety, may raise as an affirmative defense that they possess the lawful authority to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house?</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">2. If the surety and his agents have the authority to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house, what are the standards for determining whether they acted within the bounds of that authority?</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">For the reasons discussed below, the answer to Question 1 is \u201cYes.\u201d As to Question 2, a surety<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his agents may use only such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house, which shall in any event not exceed the force a police officer would be justified in using to execute an arrest warrant in analogous circumstances. Moreover, any use of force must be preceded by sufficient notice to the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aod\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Commonwealth has charged the defendants, a surety and his alleged agents, with kidnapping, G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 26; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 7; assault by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B; and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. In addition, two defendants are charged with assault and three with assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (a). The charges stem from the defendants\u2019 apprehension, detention, and delivery to Superior Court of a principal to exonerate bail after the principal did not appear at a court hearing. The primary facts of record, which were the only facts before the judge as he ruled on the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, are the grand jury minutes, which we summarize.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AID\">On June 29, 2001, the defendant Phillipe Lima, and on November 9, 2001, Michael Correia, not a defendant in this case, posted $10,000 cash bail each as sureties for charges then pending against the principal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 28, 2002, the principal failed to appear at a court hearing in his case. He claims he was not present because his lawyer had told him he need not appear on that date. The record does not indicate whether the principal\u2019s absence resulted in a default.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">On the evening of March 6, 2002, after playing basketball, the principal left a recreation center with a friend and one of the defendants, Sharik Mendes. They stopped at the house where Mendes\u2019s brother lived. As the principal entered the kitchen, the defendant Brandin Gonsalves lunged at him, pointed a gun at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>his chest, and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to run on my bail? [Expletive] that.\u201d Several other people grabbed the principal, slammed him face down to the ground, and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back. Several of the defendants, including Ryan Cabral, John Ferreira, Robert Feliciano, and Mendes, were present during, or participated in, this encounter. Various of the defendants later participated in moving the principal to two other locations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> detaining him overnight. During this time, the defendants kept the principal handcuffed, at all times in the presence of at least one person armed with a gun. The following day the defendants surrendered the principal at the court house.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">2. <em>A surety\u2019s lawful authority. </em>To answer Question 1, we must resolve two related questions. First, do a surety and his agents have the lawful authority to apprehend, detain, and deliver the principal to the court house? As to that, the Commonwealth argues that no such authority exists because the Legislature has statutorily abrogated the common law that recognized such authority. Second, assuming such lawful authority exists, implicit in the judge\u2019s use of the phrase \u201caffirmative defense\u201d is a second question: how should a court allocate between the parties the burden of proving whether a defendant is or is not a surety or surety\u2019s agent? We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(a) <em>Existence of lawful authority. </em>We commence our discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>sion with a brief overview of the common law concerning the authority of a bail bondsman or surety to surrender his principal. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>At common law, a surety had \u201cthe custody of the principal, and may take him at any time, and in any place.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, </em>8 Pick. 138, 140 (1829). He was permitted to seize the principal himself or to engage an agent to do so, without resort to the legal system. <em>Id. </em>Accord <em>Tailor </em>v. <em>Trainor, </em>83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 366, 371 (1872). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>415 Mass. 402, 404 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The surety could use such force as might otherwise result in civil or criminal liability: \u201cIf the door [to the principal\u2019s dwelling] should not be opened on demand at midnight, the bail may break it down, and take the principal from his bed, if that measure should be necessary to enable the bail to take the principal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, supra. </em>The principal was presumed to consent to, and the State presumed to authorize, the surety\u2019s use of such force. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., </em>366 Mass. 611, 614-616 (1975) (explaining that \u201cthe surety legally obtains sufficient control over the principal to . . . surrender the principal in discharge of the surety\u2019s obligation to the Commonwealth\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is an implied term in the contract that the Commonwealth will not interfere with the surety\u2019s custody of the principal\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, supra </em>at 140-142. See also note 12, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Commonwealth argues that two statutes originally enacted in 1863 have supplanted the common law just described. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 68<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (concerning surety\u2019s right to surrender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>principal before default); G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 69<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (concerning surety\u2019s right to surrender principal after default). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, supra, </em>\u201cis no longer good law in Massachusetts\u201d and, while a surety is \u201centitled\u201d to return of any money posted as bail when he surrenders the principal to an appropriate official, \u201cthis entitlement does not give to a surety the right to arrest,\u201d which, according to the Commonwealth, \u201cexcept in the rarest of cases, the Commonwealth reserves for itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We do not agree for several reasons. Neither statute expressly codifies, modifies, or abrogates the scope of the common-law right of a surety to apprehend and detain the principal in order to exonerate bail. Nor does either statute place any limits on a surety\u2019s actions while effecting a surrender. Stated differently, the statutes leave unexplained how the surety is to \u201cobtain[] sufficient control over the principal\u201d so as to complete the surrender. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., supra </em>at 615. Rather, the statutes describe the administrative protocol that the surety must follow to recover his deposits. The statutes address aspects of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the surety; they do not address the relationship between the principal and the surety or purport to govern how the surety may exercise custody over his principal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Our conclusion is consistent with the settled rule of statutory construction that \u201c[a] statute is not to be interpreted as effecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>a material change in or a repeal of the common law unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>416 Mass. 194, 200 (1993), quoting <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980). We see no clear expression of legislative intent to abrogate the common law concerning the surety\u2019s right to exercise custody over his principal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the contrary, as recently as 1999, members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives implicitly recognized that a surety has a broad right to capture and detain his principal, and proposed legislation to limit it. See An Act Relative to Bounty Hunters, So-Called, 1999 House Doc. No. 1481 (providing that individuais \u201cengaged in the business of recapturing prisoners released on bail who have defaulted shall register with the Department of Public Safety prior to undertaking any such activity,\u201d requiring such individuals to \u201cnotify the local police department and request its assistance prior to such undertaking,\u201d and affording such prisoner \u201call the constitutional and statutory rights he would be entitled to if arrested by a police officer\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALy\">It is therefore to the common law that we look to answer the reported questions. It is beyond dispute that the common law provides that the surety may raise as a defense to a charge of criminal conduct his right to apprehend his principal and deliver him to the court house. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 408. Of course, a surety\u2019s right to use force in exercising custody over a principal is not unfettered, an issue we address in our answer to Question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">We recognize that there are compelling public policy reasons why the Legislature may seek to curtail further the common-law authority of a surety to apprehend and detain his principal in order to exonerate bail. The Legislature has already made such a determination with respect to the apprehension and deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tion of individuals in response to a request that they be surrendered to another State. See Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 11-20R. The Legislature also has had before it proposed legislation to curtail the authority of a surety to apprehend his principal unless he acts in concert with a local police department. In our response to Question 2 we explicate limits imposed by the common law on the surety\u2019s authority, limits designed to minimize harm both to the principal and to the public. But we have no authority, for example, to order sureties to register with the Department of Public Safety or to order local police to assist sureties in the exoneration of their bail. Cf. 1999 House Doc. No. 1481; note 20, <em>infra. </em>Further limitations to that effect must be imposed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">(b) <em>Allocation of burdens. </em>The reporting judge asks whether the defendants may raise their lawful authority as surety or agents as an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d to the charged offenses. This necessarily requires resolution of whether a claim of \u201clawful authority\u201d is an <em>affirmative </em>defense and, if so, the proper allocation of burdens that such a defense may raise in these criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have not previously been asked to consider the question in the context of bail exoneration and take this occasion to address the allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The phrase \u201caffirmative defense\u201d is a term of art. The Model Penal Code (code), which we on occasion have used to guide our interpretations of Massachusetts law, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Klein, 372 Mass. 823, 830 (1977), defines an af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>firmative defense as one that \u201cinvolves a matter of. . . justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.12(3)(c) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"Aa4\">Because the absence of lawful authority or justification is an element of each of the crimes charged, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant acted without lawful authority or justification.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 687-689 (1976) (in murder cases, Commonwealth has burden of proving that killing was \u201cunlawful\u201d). However, where a defendant asserts an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d he takes on a burden of production, because the Commonwealth has no burden of disproving an affirmative defense \u201cunless and until there is evidence supporting such defense.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.12(1), (2). If the defense is \u201caffirmative,\u201d once a defendant raises the defense to a charge and the defense is supported by sufficient evidence, the defendant is entitled to have a jury instruction on the defense, and the Commonwealth has the burden of disproving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>defense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>440 Mass. 731, 740 (2004) (self-defense in murder case); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 257 (1987) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Klein, supra at 831 (deadly force during citizen arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We cannot say that the \u201clawful authority\u201d of the surety himself (as opposed to his agents) to apprehend, detain, and deliver his principal is an <em>affirmative </em>defense to kidnapping. When a defendant in a criminal case is released on bail, the person authorized to take bail \u2014 a clerk, magistrate, or bail commissioner \u2014 retains a copy of the recognizance form signed by the surety and the principal, and by signing the form he attests that he has furnished the principal with a copy. Because a recognizance is a matter of record, the prosecution reasonably can be expected to produce a copy of the form indicating who posted a principal\u2019s bail. See, e.g., G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 61 (providing, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]f bail is taken out of court, the person authorized to admit to bail in criminal cases\u201d must return \u201ca proper recognizance to the proper court\u201d); <em>Modem Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>311 Mass. 509, 510 (1945) (\u201cA recognizance is an obligation of record . . .\u201d). The existence of a surety relationship therefore is not \u201cpeculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.12(3)(c). A defendant claiming lawful authority as a surety, such as the defendant Lima in this case, therefore bears only the burden of raising the defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Once the surety raises the defense, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not a surety.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In contrast, a defendant claiming lawful authority as a surety\u2019s agent does raise an affirmative defense because it \u201cinvolves a matter of. . . justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It would be peculiarly difficult for the Commonwealth to prove that a defendant was not an agent of a surety, particularly if neither the defendant nor the surety testifies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is therefore entirely appropriate to require a defendant claiming to act as the agent of a surety to produce evidence of the agency relationship, including the scope of the agency relationship. See <em>id., </em>comment 3 (where basis for defense \u201cis so specially within the cognizance of the defendant,... it is fair to call on him to offer evidence if the defense is claimed\u201d). In short, a defendant claiming to have the lawful authority to apprehend, detain, and deliver a surety\u2019s principal because he is acting as an agent of the surety is entitled to a jury instruction on this defense only if there is evidence sufficient for a rational jury to find that he was a surety\u2019s agent. Cf., e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, supra </em>(\u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on the use of nondeadly force if any view of the evidence . . . would support a finding that non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>deadly force was, in fact, used in self-defense\u201d). With respect to a defendant who claims to be an agent, if he satisfies this burden of production, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the agency relationship did not exist or that the defendant acted outside the scope of the agency relationship. Here, as with a surety, the Commonwealth may prove that the agent acted beyond his \u201clawful\u201d authority, which we next address.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">3. <em>Scope of lawful authority. </em>The common law places limits on the extent of the force a surety may use to apprehend, detain, and surrender his principal. As we have previously noted, a surety may not \u201cshackle[], confine[], or impede[] [the principal] in his daily movements,\u201d even though the Commonwealth may so restrict defendants in its custody. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., </em>366 Mass. 611, 615 (1975). Rather, the bail arrangement \u201cimplies only that the surety obtains sufficient control over the principal to assure his appearances, to prevent disappearances, and to surrender the principal in discharge of the surety\u2019s obligation to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our cases therefore have authorized only those measures \u201cnecessary\u201d to obtain \u201csufficient control over the principal\u201d to enable the surety to conduct the surrender. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, </em>8 Pick. 138, 141 (1829). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., supra. </em>Because the extent of a surety\u2019s use of force was not an issue in those cases, we did not explicate the standard for determining the bounds of a surety\u2019s lawful authority for the use of force in apprehending and delivering a principal. To do so now, we may look to analogous situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">One such analogous situation concerns the arrest of a person by a private citizen.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Two years after our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., supra, </em>this court incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>into law Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.07 governing the use of force by private citizens in law enforcement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>372 Mass. 823, 830 (1977) (citizen\u2019s use of deadly force in making arrest).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Among other things, the code restricts the use of force to what the actor \u201cbelieves ... is immediately necessary to effect a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We adopted that section of the code to guard \u201cagainst the dangers of uncontrolled vigilantism and anarchistic actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The same standard is applicable in the context of a surety\u2019s apprehension and detention of a principal. Although the code\u2019s test for whether the use of force is justified appears on its face to be subjective, in practice it is applied objectively. The comments to the code explain that beliefs arrived at through negligence or recklessness do not justify the use of force.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The comments also state that the unreasonableness of an actor\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>sorted belief is evidence that it was not actually held. We have cast the test objectively, as have other courts. See <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 396 &amp; n.1 (1980) (implicitly applying code to police officers and concluding trial judge properly instructed jury that \u201c[a] law enforcement officer authorized to make an arrest. . . may use such force as is reasonably necessary to effect the arrest. . .\u201d); <em>Landrum </em>v. <em>Moats, </em>576 F.2d 1320, 1329-1331 (8th Cir. 1978) (implicitly approving of jury instruction that explained code language by stating, \u201c[i]n making an arrest, a police officer may use whatever force is reasonably necessary. Reasonable force is generally that amount of force which an ordinary, prudent and intelligent person with the knowledge and in the situation of the police officer would have deemed necessary under the circumstances . . .\u201d); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Omaha, 236 </em>Neb. 843, 847-848 (1991) (construing identical language to mean that \u201ca police officer in making an arrest must use only reasonable force, which is that amount of force which an ordinary, prudent, and intelligent person with the knowledge and in the situation of the arresting police officer would have deemed necessary under the circumstances\u201d). Furthermore, as noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klein, supra </em>at 831 n.7, the American Law Institute adopted an objective \u201creasonably necessary\u201d test in the Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 120.7 that \u201ccarries forward. . . Section 3.07 of the Model Penal Code,\u201d although \u201cthe wording of the Model Penal Code provision has been changed slightly to adapt it to the present context.\u201d Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 120.7 (1975).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Accordingly, in apprehending, detaining, and delivering a principal to a court or jailer, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 69, a surety and his agents may use only such force as an ordinary, prudent, and intelligent person with the actor\u2019s knowledge would have believed necessary in the circumstances, which may in any event never exceed the force a police officer would be justified in using in executing an arrest.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For the same reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that this general rule concerning the use of force in law enforcement applies to the capture of a principal by a surety and his agents, so should the specific rule that requires the actor to explain his actions before resorting to the use of force. See Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.07(2)(a)(1).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This rule mitigates the danger of self-defense reactions that could result in injury to the surety, his agents, the principal, or even innocent third-party bystanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In summary, assuming that any defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on \u201clawful authority,\u201d to prove as to each defendant that he did not act within the bounds of his lawful authority as a surety or surety\u2019s agent, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used more force than an ordinary, prudent, and intelligent person with the defendant\u2019s knowledge would have believed necessary in the circumstances to capture and surrender the principal. Alternatively, the Commonwealth may prove that a defendant did not make known the purpose of the capture, did not believe that the purpose was otherwise known by the principal, and could have reasonably made the purpose known to the principal.

Hence, a defendant\u2019s friend or family member need not register prior to posting bail. The principal apparently was not a close acquaintance of Lima\u2019s: the principal met Lima in 1998 or 1999 when the principal was friendly with one of Lima\u2019s cousins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The principal was first taken to a car and driven, along with the defendants Cabral and Feliciano, to the house where Ferreira lived. There the principal, still handcuffed, was taken upstairs and placed on a couch. The defendants Gonsalves and Ferreira soon arrived, as did the defendants Nathan Martin and Brian Rosonina. Mendes was also present. One and one-half hours later, after learning that the principal\u2019s mother was looking for him, Gonsalves, Cabral, and one other person walked the principal to a house where Gonsalves\u2019s cousin lived. The principal was kept handcuffed to a radiator at that location overnight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Lima, along with the other defendants, drove the principal to Superior Court. They removed the handcuffs outside the court house and escorted him into the building by grabbing his arm and surrounding him so that he could not escape. They delivered him into custody and exonerated the bail. The principal complained to the officer who took him into custody that the defendants\u2019 handcuffs had injured his wrists; he did not complain of any other injury. Photographs of the principal\u2019s wrists showed injuries consistent with the use of handcuffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">For a more extended discussion of the subject, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brickett, </em>8 Pick. 138, 140-142 (1829).

L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 11-20R. A more complete statement of our holding is that the \u201cright to seize a principal <em>within the Commonwealth for surrender in another State\u201d </em>was abrogated (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 405, 407. Here, the seizure and surrender took place within Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AEG\">The House sent the bill to the Committee on House Rules and took no further action on the bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">At common law, the defendants bore the burden of proving affirmative defenses in all cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 526 (2000) (Spina, J., concurring), quoting <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 202 (1977). This remains the general Massachusetts rule in civil cases. See, e.g., <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 548-549 (1997), and cases cited. In criminal cases, however, we generally have required the prosecution to prove the absence of properly raised affirmative defenses. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra </em>at 526-530 (Spina, J., concurring) (reviewing history of this shift with regard to insanity defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 687-688 (1976) (Commonwealth must prove absence of self-defense in murder case once defendant raises reasonable doubt on issue). But see note 18, <em>infra </em>(discussing statute placing burden on defendant of proving license or authority as justification).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"AC1\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 26, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever, <em>without lawful authority, </em>forcibly or secretly confines or imprisons another person within this [C]ommonwealth against his will... or forcibly seizes and confines or inveigles or kidnaps another person, with intent either to cause him to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this [C]ommonwealth against his will. . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the [S]tate prison for not more than ten years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars and imprisonment in jail for not more than two years\u201d (emphasis added). See Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.13(9) (1985) (providing, in pertinent part, that \u201c \u2018element of an offense\u2019 means . . . such attendant circumstances ... as (a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or . . . (c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"AFd\">With respect to the crimes of assault, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the Commonwealth must prove as to each that the defendant acted without justification. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 306 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931). If a defendant successfully establishes lawful authority as a defense against a kidnapping charge, the exercise of such authority would provide a justification defense to these other charges, so long as he acted within the scope of that authority, as we describe below. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>372 Mass. 823, 834 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"ACH\">As to the conspiracy charges, the Commonwealth must prove that two or more persons agreed to capture and detain the principal without lawful authority, or that they agreed to use \u201cunlawful\u201d means to do so. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>351 Mass. 148, 152-155 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The burdens fall differently here than they do, for example, in criminal cases concerning controlled substances and firearms. In those cases, the defendant has the burden of proving lawful authority to possess or distribute. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>377 Mass. 716, 717-719 (1979) (controlled substances); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977) (firearms). A statutory presumption of lack of authority applies in those cases. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7 (\u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution, relying for his justification upon a license... or authority, shall prove the same; and, until so proved, the presumption shall be that he is not so authorized\u201d). To overcome this presumption, a defendant must prove, through evidence such as a license or prescription, that he comes under a provision in the relevant statutes setting forth certain exemptions or exceptions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 718. Here, the kidnapping statute\u2019s \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d element, and the element of \u201cwithout justification\u201d in assault and battery, do not permit placing the burden of proof on the defendant. See notes 16-17, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On the record before us, although the defendant Gonsalves claimed that the principal had \u201crun out on <em>my </em>bail,\u201d he appears not to be a surety because his name does not appear on either of the principal\u2019s recognizance forms contained in the record. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Although we express no view whether Gonsalves acted as an agent, it appears that neither of the principal\u2019s sureties was involved personally in the principal\u2019s capture and overnight detention. The defendant Lima\u2019s personal involvement apparently began only when he transported the principal to the court house the morning after his capture. See notes 7-8, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Many States require sureties who use \u201cbail recovery agents\u201d to establish the agency relationship in writing, and limit the class of individuals who may act as agents. See, e.g., N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 530.80 (McKinney 1995) (permitting surety \u201cby a written authority indorsed on a certified copy of the bail bond,\u201d to \u201cempower any person over twenty years of age\u201d to surrender principal); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2713.22 (West 1994) (permitting surety \u201cby a written authority indorsed on a certified copy of the bond,\u201d to \u201cempower any person of suitable age and discretion\u201d to surrender principal). States also have required anyone acting as a bail recovery agent to be so licensed. See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 29-152e (2003); Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 83-39-3 (1999 &amp; 2004 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">A surety\u2019s apprehension of a principal may occur after arraignment. It is therefore not an \u201carrest.\u201d Both arrest and apprehension of a principal, however, play a key role in the criminal justice system: they ensure that a defendant is in the custody of the State to face criminal charges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co., </em>366 Mass. 611, 614 (1975); Drimmer, When Man Hunts Man: The Rights and Duties of Bounty Hunters in the American Criminal Justice System, 33 Hous. L.
