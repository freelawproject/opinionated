Otis, III, has appealed from a decision of the Superior Court, which granted summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ment in favor of all defendants on the ground that Otis\u2019s claims against them were barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. The facts and theories on which Otis\u2019s present claims are based are the precise opposite of the facts and theories that Otis successfully asserted in prior litigation. Despite taking inconsistent positions in sequential lawsuits, Otis contends that the doctrine of judicial estoppel should not have been interposed to prevent him from pursuing his present suit. We granted the applications of both parties for direct appellate review. For the following reasons, we conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s determination that judicial estoppel should operate to bar Otis\u2019s present claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 1992, Otis sued one Todd Cusick to recover for injuries he sustained in an automobile accident. That suit was predicated on the following facts. At approximately 1 a.m. on October 5, 1991, Otis and a companion, Shannon O\u2019Malley, were crossing Route 18 in Weymouth when they were struck by a vehicle driven by Cusick. Cusick fled the scene, but was later apprehended and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor (causing serious bodily injury), and leaving the scene of an accident. Cusick, whose level of intoxication was such that he claimed to have no memory of these events, pleaded guilty to both offenses pursuant to <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Cusick was insured by Arbella Mutual Insurance Company, and Arbella retained the law firm of Eckert, Seamans, Cherin &amp; Mellott (ESCM) to represent Cusick in connection with Otis\u2019s personal injury claims. ESCM assigned the case to attorney Anthony Moccia, a partner at ESCM. In December, 1993, Arbella tendered a check in the amount of the policy limit ($50,000), without obtaining a release in favor of Cusick.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case was ultimately tried in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Moccia\u2019s defense of Cusick was predicated in large measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>on a theory of Otis\u2019s comparative negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otis had been intoxicated at the time of the accident, with a blood alcohol level in excess of 0.14 per cent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because he was not in a crosswalk, Otis had a duty to yield the right of way to an oncoming vehicle. See 720 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.09(5) (1996). Moccia argued to the jury that, instead of proceeding to a nearby crosswalk, an intoxicated Otis and O\u2019Malley had instead walked out into the middle of a State highway \u201cand then didn\u2019t heed a vehicle coming.\u201d It was negligent, he argued, for Otis \u201cto walk into the middle of a [S]tate highway at one o\u2019clock in the morning and take [his] chances.\u201d By contrast, the driver of the vehicle (see note 3, supra) had suddenly and unexpectedly come on two pedestrians crossing the highway late at night, and had understandably slammed on the brakes, causing the vehicle to swerve and hit Otis and O\u2019Malley. Moccia thus argued that Otis\u2019s failure to use reasonable care was a proximate cause of the accident, and that Otis\u2019s negligence outweighed that of the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Counsel for Otis countered these theories of comparative negligence by reference to the location on the roadway where the impact occurred. An eyewitness to the accident, one Gregory Gomes, testified that Otis and O\u2019Malley began crossing from the west side of Route 18 to the east side, but then stopped one or two feet shy of the yellow line; the vehicle, traveling in the northbound lane, swerved across the center line into the southbound lane and hit Otis and O\u2019Malley. Based on Gomes\u2019s testimony, counsel for Otis argued that Otis had yielded the right of way by stopping in the southbound lane, leaving Cusick free to continue unobstructed in the northbound lane. He also argued, again based on Gomes\u2019s testimony, that the issue of Otis\u2019s intoxication was irrelevant \u2014 having stopped in the southbound lane, Otis\u2019s intoxication had nothing to do with Cu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>sick\u2019s vehicle swerving from the northbound lane into that southbound lane and striking him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">During their deliberations, the jury asked the judge two questions concerning Cusick\u2019s contention that Otis had failed to yield the right of way: \u201cWhat constitutes pedestrian yielding right of way? Does standing in opposite lane meet the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ment of yielding right of way?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 23, 1998, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Otis, and assessed damages in the amount of $4 million. The jury rejected Cusick\u2019s contention that Otis had also been negligent, finding no comparative negligence on Otis\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Cusick filed a motion for a new trial, claiming, inter alla, that the judge had erroneously allowed Otis to introduce evidence that, while fleeing the scene, the driver of the vehicle had run over O\u2019Malley\u2019s head.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He contended that that evidence was irrelevant to Cusick\u2019s alleged liability for striking Otis, and that, even if it were relevant, that minimal relevance was outweighed by the prejudicial nature of the evidence. Otis\u2019s opposition to that motion for a new trial argued that the evidence had been admitted properly, as the two victims had been struck essentially simultaneously as part of the same incident, making it appropriate for the witness to describe the entire scene. He also argued that the evidence pertaining to O\u2019Malley\u2019s being struck and then run over had not been prejudicial \u2014 given the seriousness of the accident and resulting injuries, that one additional detail would not operate to inflame the jury. The motion for a new trial was denied. No appeal was taken, and on November 17, 1998, execution issued in the amount of $6,585,195.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">One month later, recognizing that Cusick\u2019s assets would be insufficient to satisfy the judgment, Otis released Cusick from all liability on that judgment in exchange for an assignment of any claims that Cusick might have against Attorney Moccia, ESCM, or Arbella arising from their defense of Cusick in the underlying action. Based on that assignment, Otis\u2019s counsel sent Moccia, ESCM, and Arbella a demand letter under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, contending that they had breached their respective duties to Cusick by failing to investigate the claims against him, failing to provide him a competent defense, and failing to pursue an appeal. Specifically, Otis contended that the defendants had overlooked (and therefore failed to introduce at trial) \u201cunassail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>able physical and forensic evidence\u201d establishing that Otis and O\u2019Malley had been across the middle line and into the northbound lane at the moment of impact, and that Cusick had not swerved into the southbound lane until <em>after </em>the impact with the two pedestrians. Otis now contended, based on that physical and forensic evidence, that he had in fact been \u201cseveral feet beyond the center line of Route 18 and entirely within Cusick\u2019s northbound lane of travel,\u201d and that he had \u201cseen Cusick\u2019s car approaching, and yet had stood still in Cusick\u2019s lane of travel making no effort to get out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d Otis\u2019s demand letter went on to allege that, if the jury had been aware of these facts, \u201c[t]here can be no doubt\u201d that the jury would have found Otis more than fifty per cent at fault for the accident, with a resulting verdict in favor of Cusick. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In his demand letter, Otis also alleged that Moccia had purposefully failed to communicate Arbella\u2019s and Cusick\u2019s respective positions on whether to take an appeal, resulting in a failure to file what allegedly would have been a meritorious appeal. Contrary to the position he had taken in opposing Cu-sick\u2019s motion for a new trial, Otis now claimed that the judge had erred in admitting evidence that Cusick\u2019s vehicle had run over O\u2019Malley\u2019s head, that the evidence had had \u201cno probative value,\u201d and that its introduction had been \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d to Cusick. That error, according to Otis\u2019s demand letter, \u201cclearly presented a valid and winnable appellate issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In his second amended complaint, Otis alleged that these failures with respect to the defense and representation of Cusick \u201ccaused\u201d the judgment against Cusick to enter, and that the judgment he (Otis) had obtained was \u201ca result of\u201d the defendants\u2019 negligence, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional and negligent misrepresentations, and violations of G. L. c. 93A. The defendants each moved for summary judgment on the ground that Otis\u2019s present assertions were diametrically opposed to those he had made in his original, successful suit against Cu-sick, and that his present claims should therefore be barred by judicial estoppel. The judge agreed, and entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cJudicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>precludes a party from asserting a position in one legal proceeding that is contrary to a position it had previously asserted in another proceeding.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, </em>427 Mass. 176, 184 (1998). See <em>East Cambridge Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>422 Mass. 621, 623-624 (1996); <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, </em>419 Mass. 782, 787-788 (1995). \u201cThe purpose of the doctrine is to prevent the manipulation of the judicial process by litigants.\u201d <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 308 (2000). As an equitable doctrine, judicial estoppel is not to be defined with reference to \u201cinflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining [its] applicability.\u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 751 (2001). Rather, the doctrine is properly invoked whenever a \u201cparty is seeking to use the judicial process in an inconsistent way that courts should not tolerate.\u201d <em>East Cambridge Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Application of the equitable principle of judicial estoppel to a particular case is a matter of discretion. <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 750, quoting <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Rolfs, </em>893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 1990). On appeal from a judge\u2019s decision to bar a litigant\u2019s claim on grounds of judicial estoppel, we therefore review for abuse of discretion. See <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2004), and cases cited; <em>Whitacre Partnership </em>v. <em>Biosignia, Inc., </em>358 N.C. 1, 38 (2004). Where, as here, application of judicial estoppel has resulted in the entry of summary judgment, abuse of discretion remains the appropriate standard \u2014 if the judge has not abused his or her discretion in invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the doctrine bars the claim in question, making summary judgment appropriate. See <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., supra </em>at 31-32, and cases cited; <em>Whitacre Partnership </em>v. <em>Biosignia, Inc., supra </em>at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Because of its equitable nature, the \u201ccircumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle.\u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 750, quoting <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., </em>667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (4th Cir. 1982). However, two fundamental elements are widely recognized as comprising the core of a claim of judicial estoppel. First, the position being asserted in the litigation must be \u201cdirectly inconsistent,\u201d meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u201cmutually exclusive\u201d of, the position asserted in a prior proceeding. <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., supra </em>at 33, and cases cited. See <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 750 (current position must be \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with prior position). We have rejected claims of judicial estoppel where the position being asserted is not directly contrary to the position previously asserted. See <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 308-309; <em>Paixao </em>v. <em>Paixao, </em>429 Mass. 307, 311 (1999); <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, supra </em>at 184-185. Second, the party must have succeeded in convincing the court to accept its prior position. <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., supra, </em>and cases cited. Where the court has found in favor of that party\u2019s position in the prior proceeding, \u201cjudicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create \u2018the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 750, quoting <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>690 F.2d 595, 599 (6th Cir. 1982). See <em>East Cambridge Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra </em>at 623 (judicial estoppel not applicable where party did not achieve success in prior proceeding). See also <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Some courts have also recognized a third factor, namely, \u201cwhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 751, and cases cited. However, as a practical matter, where the first two components have been satisfied, this third factor is virtually certain to be present, as judicial acceptance of a party\u2019s position will ordinarily redound to the benefit of that party. \u201c[A]fter all, it is unlikely that a party will advance a particular position unless that position benefits its cause.\u201d <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., supra </em>at 33. Without the need to give separate consideration to whether a party has obtained some unfair benefit or imposed an unfair detriment on another party, judicial estoppel will normally be appropriate whenever \u201ca party has adopted one position, secured a favorable decision, and then taken a contradictory position in search of legal advantage.\u201d <em>InterGen N.V. </em>v. <em>Grina, </em>344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Notwithstanding that general articulation of the doctrine, there may arise certain instances where the party\u2019s prior position was asserted in good faith, and where the circumstances provide a legitimate reason \u2014 other than sheer tactical gain \u2014 for the subsequent change in that party\u2019s position. For example, \u201cit may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel \u2018when a party\u2019s prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake,\u2019 \u201d <em>New Hampshire </em>v. Maine, <em>supra </em>at 753, quoting <em>John S. Clark Co. </em>v. <em>Faggert &amp; Frieden, P.C., </em>65 F.3d 26, 29 (4th Cir. 1995), or where \u201cthe position adopted in the first suit was clearly wrong yet had been advanced in good faith by the party now sought to be estopped,\u201d <em>Chaveriat </em>v. <em>Williams Pipe Line Co., </em>11 F.3d 1420, 1428 (7th Cir. 1993). Strict application of the doctrine might not be called for if \u201cthe new, inconsistent position is the product of information neither known nor readily available to [the party] at the time the initial position was taken.\u201d <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., supra </em>at 35. Again, judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, calling for the exercise of discretion in its application to particular facts. Like other courts that have grappled with the \u201chazy\u201d contours of the doctrine, <em>id. </em>at 33, we decline to construct a categorical list of requirements or to delineate each and every possible exception. Rather, judges should use their discretion, and their weighing of the equities, and apply judicial estoppel where appropriate to serve its over-all purpose. That purpose is \u201cto safeguard the integrity of the courts by preventing parties from improperly manipulating the machinery of the judicial system,\u201d and judicial estoppel may therefore be applied \u201cwhen a litigant is \u2018playing fast and loose with the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Cinema Corp., </em>834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The present case fits squarely within the doctrine of judicial estoppel as customarily applied. Central to Otis\u2019s present claims is an assertion that is diametrically contrary to the position he took in his original suit against Cusick. In that earlier suit, Otis took the position that he was not negligent, based on the factual assertion that he had yielded the right of way when he and O\u2019Malley stopped a few feet shy of the dividing center fine of the highway. That position was successful, as the jury found no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>comparative negligence on Otis\u2019s part, and thus awarded him the full amount of damages for his injuries. In the present suit, however, he contends not only that he was negligent, but that his negligence was even greater than Cusick\u2019s, such that it should have operated to deny him any recovery against Cusick. The factual premise now advanced in support of that comparative negligence theory is directly contrary to the facts Otis put forward in the prior suit \u2014 Otis now contends that he and O\u2019Malley had crossed several feet over the dividing center line and stopped in the direct path of an oncoming vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Otis has also changed position on an evidentiary argument raised in the first case. In the prior proceeding, he argued successfully in opposition to Cusick\u2019s motion for a new trial that the judge had committed no error in allowing a witness to testify about Cusick\u2019s running over O\u2019Malley as he fled the scene. Now, in connection with claims stemming from the defendants\u2019 failure to pursue an appeal on behalf of Cusick, Otis claims not only that it was error to have admitted such testimony, but that the prejudicial nature of that testimony was such that its admission amounted to reversible error. He thus claims that an appeal from the judgment that had entered in his favor would have resulted in a reversal and a new trial, and that a competently conducted defense would have resulted in a verdict in favor of Cusick.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In short, Otis\u2019s position in the present suit is that he should not have recovered anything in the first suit. This is the classic posture in which courts invoke judicial estoppel: allowing the present case to proceed would \u201ccreate[] the appearance that either the first court has been misled or the second court will be misled, thus raising the specter of inconsistent determinations and endangering the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2004). This case does not involve any of the factors that might, on equitable grounds, relieve Otis from the application of judicial estoppel. In the earlier trial, Otis\u2019s evidence and jury arguments with respect to the issue of his comparative negligence were not the product of some inadvertent mistake. Nor is his present change in position attributable to some newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>discovered evidence \u2014 his present theory of malpractice rests on the assertion that the ostensibly correct version of where the impact occurred was apparent from police reports made available to both counsel prior to trial. Thus, at the time of trial, Otis presented a version of events based on an eyewitness account of the accident, but, now that it suits his purposes to present a different version, he contends that police investigation of the scene substantiates a scenario contrary to that of the eyewitness. Where Otis now seeks to present a version of events different from the version he successfully presented and argued to the jury at the original trial, and where no equitable factors militate against the imposition of judicial estoppel, the judge did not abuse his discretion in applying judicial estoppel to bar Otis\u2019s present claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Notwithstanding that Otis\u2019s present suit fits squarely within the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Otis raises a series of arguments to try to evade the doctrine\u2019s reach. Those arguments are unpersuasive. First, Otis contends that the doctrine should not be applied to him because he is bringing the present suit as an assignee of Cusick, and therefore presenting Cusick\u2019s claims, not his own. The assignment of Cusick\u2019s claims to Otis does not change the fact that the present suit is being brought by Otis himself in his own name. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 336 (4) and comment h (1981) (\u201cconduct of the assignee or his agents may, like that of any obligee, give rise to defenses and claims which may be asserted against him by the obligor\u201d). The equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel, based on the need to preserve the integrity and appearance of the judicial system itself, is not affected by how a party came to possess the claims now being brought. The issue is whether Otis is asserting a position inconsistent with a position previously and successfully asserted. That it is an assignment that now makes it beneficial for him to change position does not ameliorate the harm to the judicial system posed by such conduct. See <em>Alcman Servs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Samuel H. Bullock, P.C., </em>925 F. Supp. 252, 257-258 (D.N.J. 1996), aff\u2019d, 124 F.3d 185 (3d Cir. 1997) (judicial estoppel barred previously prevailing plaintiff from pursuing malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>claim as assignee against former defendant\u2019s attorney).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Assuming (without deciding) that a party\u2019s status as assignee might properly be considered as an equitable factor in assessing whether to apply judicial estoppel, a party\u2019s status as assignee does not automatically make it an abuse of discretion for a judge to apply the doctrine. In light of the purpose of judicial estoppel, \u201cwe are not prepared to say that an assignee is always free to take in that capacity positions that he would be estopped from taking in his personal capacity.\u201d <em>Franco </em>v. <em>Selective Ins. Co., </em>184 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Otis next contends that judicial estoppel should not be applied to him because he made no inconsistent statement under oath concerning where he was in the roadway at the moment of impact. Arguments about where he had been in relation to the center line of the highway were made by his counsel, based solely on another witness\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Some courts have identified protection of the oath itself as one of the purposes of judicial estoppel. See, e.g., <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Long Island R.R., </em>997 F.2d 1028, 1037-1038 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 992 (1993); <em>Konstantinidis </em>v. <em>Chen, </em>626 F.2d 933, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1980). See also <em>Paixao </em>v. <em>Paixao, </em>429 Mass. 307, 309, 311 (1999). Others list prerequisites for the application of judicial estoppel, requiring that the inconsistent position have been articulated under oath in the prior proceeding. See, e.g., <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Wendy\u2019s Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir. 2004), quoting <em>Burnes </em>v. <em>Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>291 F3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002). Cf. <em>Valentine-Johnson </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>386 F.3d 800, 811, 812 (6th Cir. 2004) (while normally requiring that contrary position be taken \u201cunder oath,\u201d position taken in written motion and oral argument \u201cmay be fairly analogized to taking a position \u2018under oath\u2019 for the purposes of judicial estoppel\u201d). In our view, protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tion of the oath is not the sole purpose of the doctrine of judicial estoppel, which applies more generally to the pursuit of an inconsistent \u201cposition,\u201d including an inconsistent \u201cposition\u201d taken by that party\u2019s attorney without the party\u2019s adopting that \u201cposition\u201d in sworn testimony. See, e.g., <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 751-755 (2001) (where New Hampshire had proposed and agreed to consent judgment interpreting Colonial decree establishing boundary, judicial estoppel precluded State from asserting contrary interpretation of same Colonial decree in later litigation); <em>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir. 2004) (judicial estoppel applied to inconsistent characterization of claim for purposes of avoiding Statute of Frauds defense). See also <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Jenny Craig, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 567, 574-575 (1998) (judicial estoppel based on counsel\u2019s representations about amount in controversy made in support of motion to remand case to State court). While a party\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d in a case will often be supported by that party\u2019s testimony under oath, a renunciation of testimony given under oath is not the sine qua non of judicial estoppel. Again, the broader purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial system, and parties who play \u201cfast and loose\u201d with that system by means of any device, be it testimony under oath or arguments asserted by their counsel, may be subject to judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Otis next argues that we have rejected the concept of judicial estoppel as it applies to the assignment of malpractice claims. See <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>429 Mass. 202, 209-211 (1999). In that case, this court was asked to declare all assignments of legal malpractice claims void as against public policy. We declined to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 209. Recognizing that public policy might be implicated in certain circumstances, we opted to treat the enforceability of such assignments on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 209-210. The public policy impediments to such assignments (including judicial estoppel) would not be applicable in all cases, and did not justify a total prohibition against the assignment of legal malpractice claims. <em>Id. </em>at 211. In that case, for example, the assigned malpractice claim involved alleged mishandling of settlement documentation \u2014 the merits of the underlying controversy in the prior litigation were \u201cirrelevant\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>to that claim of malpractice, and thus did not involve any \u201cdistasteful role reversal which would demean and reduce the public\u2019s confidence in the legal process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather than declare all assignments of malpractice claims unenforceable, we concluded that such claims could be assigned \u201cunless some clear rule of law or professional responsibility, or some matter of public policy, necessitates that the assignment should not be enforced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209-210. Nothing in <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCann, supra, </em>precludes a judge from determining that, on the specific facts presented, enforcement of that particular assigned malpractice claim would run afoul of the doctrine of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Otis similarly contends that <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>429 Mass. 410, 420 (1999), precludes the application of judicial estoppel to claims of legal malpractice. In that case, the plaintiff sued her own attorney, contending that he had committed malpractice in representing her in her divorce proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 411. This court held that judicial estoppel did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim, where the essence of her claim was that the positions taken during the divorce proceedings were themselves the product of her attorney\u2019s malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 420. Applied to the present case, this means merely that judicial estoppel would not bar Cusick from suing his attorney for malpractice in connection with his defense. As to Otis, however, <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Wagner, supra, </em>has no bearing on whether judicial estoppel should operate to bar his claims. Otis has made no claim that the positions he took in the prior litigation were the product of his attorney\u2019s malpractice. To the contrary, the positions taken by Otis\u2019s attorney succeeded in obtaining a multi-million dollar verdict in Otis\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Finally, Otis asserts that the imposition of judicial estoppel on these facts elevates form over substance as, he contends, he could lawfully obtain the benefit of Cusick\u2019s claims by means of a slight variation in his agreement with Cusick. For example, an agreement could have been structured whereby Cusick would pursue his own claims against the defendants and assign the proceeds to Otis. Otis contends that the present arrangement (by which he brings the claims himself as Cusick\u2019s assignee) merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>accomplishes the same permissible result by a different method. The defendants contend that other agreements by which Otis would benefit from the pursuit of Cusick\u2019s claims would also implicate judicial estoppel, which, they argue, should be analyzed with regard to the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We need not consider whether or how judicial estoppel might apply to other litigation undertaken pursuant to other hypothetical agreements. We are concerned solely with the litigation presently before us. By that litigation, Otis seeks to recover a verdict in his favor \u2014 and in his name \u2014 that is mutually inconsistent with the judgment he already has obtained. Judicial estoppel is designed to apply to such an unseemly scenario, without regard to whether an equivalent recovery could be achieved by some other tactic. To Otis\u2019s argument that we should be more concerned with substance than with form, we respond with the observation that judicial estoppel is meant to preserve the appearance of the judicial system in the public eye. In that sense, appearances do matter, and judicial estoppel is a doctrine that expressly cares about \u201cform.\u201d It may be, as Otis now contends, that he is completely undeserving of the verdict that the jury awarded him in the prior litigation. Yet, in various circumstances (e.g., if Cusick were solvent, or had far greater insurance coverage), the judicial system would still allow Otis to recover on that undeserved judgment. What the judicial system cannot tolerate, however, is Otis himself being the one to claim in court that he is completely undeserving of that judgment, and, by succeeding on such a claim, to collect on the undeserved judgment. Allowing Otis to pursue such a claim in his own name would tarnish the court\u2019s reputation. Judicial estoppel is properly invoked to bar such a claim, even if Otis could collect on the judgment through other lawful means.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">At the time, insistence on such a release would have been treated as an unfair settlement practice in violation of G.

I entreat you, ladies and gentlemen, not to buy the defense of blame the victim. The testimony was, unrebutted testimony by anybody was that Mr. Otis stopped and looked left and right and saw nothing the first time. Started out into the roadway and when he got close to the center line, looked again and all three of them saw a car coming which they thought was coming fast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">\u201cMr. Gomes testified that O\u2019Malley and Otis stopped to let the car go by. Now they were in the southbound lane. And Mr. Cusick is driving sixty-five miles an hour in the northbound lane. Might it have been prudent to turn around arid boogie back to the sidewalk? I\u2019ll bet you Mr. Otis wishes he had done so, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\u201cBut that\u2019s not the issue before you. The issue is, is he [responsible] for this accident when he stayed in the southbound lane and stopped short of the yellow line? Remember the testimony wasn\u2019t one foot, it was a minimum of one foot to a maximum of two and a half feet back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">\u201cWell two and a half feet\u2019s almost a yard, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m about this far back from there and that\u2019s the yellow line and I see the car coming. It\u2019s coming faster than I thought it was and I stop. And at the very last second it swerves into my lane and wipes out those two young men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">\u201cNow what\u2019s the argument? The argument is we are point, whatever it is, one four or something. What are we supposed to do then, jump up in the air? What are we supposed to do, dive out of the way? The guy is going sixty-five miles an hour in the northbound lane and like that, it\u2019s in the southbound lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">\u201cSo that\u2019s the argument. The argument is comparatively negligent? I entreat you, don\u2019t buy the blame the victim defense. And on that question where it says fifty-fifty, added up to a hundred, who was responsible? I entreat you to put down zero for Mr. Otis. No comparative negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The record provided does not include the judge\u2019s instructions in response to those questions, but Otis claims that the judge responded to the first question and declined to answer the second question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">O\u2019Malley\u2019s own claims against Cusick had been settled, and were not before the jury at Otis\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Otis contends that this court has disapproved of <em>Alcman Servs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Samuel H.
