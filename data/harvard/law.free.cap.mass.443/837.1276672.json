(Locator Services), disputes the amount of interest or earnings on 103 eminent domain awards paid to it by the Treasurer and Receiver General on behalf of fifty-five claimants whose property had been taken by eminent domain. Because the eminent domain awards were not initially claimed, the money was paid to the Treasurer and placed under his control pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D. When Locator Services ultimately attempted to collect the awards and any accrued interest, the Treasurer paid Locator Services the principal amounts of the eminent domain awards plus simple interest. Locator Services brought this action in the nature of mandamus ordering the Treasurer to pay additional interest on the invested awards pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A. A Superior Court judge denied the Treasurer\u2019s summary judgment motion and motion to strike an affidavit submitted by Locator Services. We affirm in part and vacate in part the judge\u2019s denial of the summary judgment motion and affirm in part and reverse in part his decision on the motion to strike Locator Services\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We hold that G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D, which governs the Treasurer\u2019s obligation to invest unclaimed eminent domain awards for the benefit of unknown claimants, requires the Treasurer to invest the awards in one or more of the investment vehicles specified in the statute and to remit to those entitled all interest actually earned on those investments. The statute imposes no fiduciary or quasi fiduciary duty on the Treasurer. To the extent the Treasurer may not have paid Locator Services all interest earned on his investment of the claimants\u2019 103 eminent domain awards after 1993, the Treasurer has breached his statutory duty. Locator Services is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of the Treasurer\u2019s liability for all interest actually earned. The case is remanded to determine what interest, if any, is owed Locator Services. The question whether, prior to 1993, the Treasurer breached his statutory duty to invest the awards under \u00a7 7D is one of fact to be tried on remand. We determine that a three-year statute of limitations is applicable to Locator Services\u2019 claims for additional interest, and that the limitations period runs from the date that the claimants received their allegedly insufficient interest payments. On remand, Locator Services will have the opportunity to establish, and the Treasurer the chance to disprove, the existence of a limitations tolling agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">\n<em>Statutory scheme.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We begin with a summary of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7\u00a7 7D, 7E, and 10A. Chapter 79 governs eminent domain takings by the Commonwealth and its municipalities. Section 7E requires that when any eminent domain award goes unclaimed for a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>of sixty days after proper notice, \u201csuch check shall be withdrawn and a new check . . . shall be made payable to the treasurer and shall be deposited, held and disposed of in accordance with section seven D.\u201d Section 7D then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">\u201c[The awards] shall be made payable to the [Commonwealth\u2019s] treasurer . . . and deposited with him for the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto. . . . The treasurer shall deposit any such check [for the unclaimed eminent domain awards] in a savings bank or other like institution, or in savings accounts in a trust company, or invest the same in share accounts in a federal savings and loan association or a savings and loan association located in the commonwealth, or in investments described in [G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 38,] to accumulate for the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Such deposit or investment shall be made in the name of the treasurer. When the person entitled to [the] amount [deposited] or any portion thereof satisfies said board of officers [on whom authority to take the property had been conferred by law] of his right to receive it, said board of officers shall, after such notice as it may order, order such amount or portion thereof, or the proceeds of its investment, to be transferred to him by the treasurer. Amounts deposited or invested . . . shall be subject to the provisions of [G. L. c. 200A], relating to abandoned property, and the treasurer shall, insofar as practicable, make such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>reports and give such notice concerning the same as are required respectively by [G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">General Laws c. 200A governs property that, after the requisite passage of time and procedural requirements, is deemed \u201cabandoned\u201d and ultimately vests in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Violations of \u00a7 7D are enforceable pursuant to \u00a7 10A of c. 79. Section 10A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">\u201cCompliance with the provisions of section[] . . . seven D . . . may be enforced against any person having a duty of compliance therewith by writ of mandamus issued upon the petition of any person adversely affected by noncompliance therewith. The body politic or corporate on behalf of which the taking was made shall be joined in any such petition, and the petitioner may recover therefrom in the same proceeding damages sustained by reason of such noncompliance, with costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">\n<em>Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the undisputed material facts. Locator Services is a Massachusetts corporation with a principal place of business in Boston. It is in the business of finding and recovering unclaimed assets, including eminent domain awards, for individuals, companies, and other entities that may not be aware of the existence of such funds. In exchange for Locator Services\u2019s work on their behalf, these individuals and entities agree to pay Locator Services a percentage of all funds recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In the present action, Locator Services represents fifty-five individuals and entities (claimants) on whose behalf it collected 103 unclaimed eminent domain awards. Each of the claimants has had real property, or its interests therein, taken by the right of way bureau of the Massachusetts Highway Department (bureau) or the Department of Environmental Management (department) between the years 1956 and 1995, pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>provisions of c. 79. With respect to each of the takings at issue, the bureau or the department calculated an award of damages and issued a check for the award pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because none of the claimants collected these eminent domain award checks within the sixty days specified in G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7E, the bureau and the department placed the awards under the custody and control of the Treasurer to be invested pursuant to \u00a7 7D. The Treasurer then placed the awards in an \u201cEminent Domain Trust Fund\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (trust fund) during at least some of the time the awards were under his control. Because the eminent domain awards at issue here were held by the Treasurer in the trust fund for a considerable period of time, the amount of interest earned on the older awards may exceed the principal amount of those awards. Having discovered the unclaimed eminent domain awards, Locator Services filed claims with the bureau and the department for the unpaid awards plus interest. After verifying Locator Services\u2019s authority to collect the takings awards on behalf of the claimants, the bureau and the department requested that the Treasurer calculate the amount of interest to be paid on each of the awards as a result of their investment in the trust fund. For each of the 103 takings at issue, the Treasurer calculated an interest amount, utilizing simple interest, and issued checks to the claimants for the amounts of their respective eminent domain awards plus simple interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The controversy here arises because Locator Services claims that \u00a7 7D requires the Treasurer to pay a greater amount of interest on the invested awards than the simple interest paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>On October 17, 2002, Locator Services</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>filed this action against the Treasurer on behalf of the claimants described above, contending that the Commonwealth failed to pay the claimants proper interest due on their various eminent domain awards pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth was joined as a party to this action pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Locator Services alleges three counts in its complaint: count I seeks a writ of mandamus pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A, ordering the Treasurer to pay to Locator Services the difference between the amounts paid to the claimants on their claims (principal plus simple interest) and the amount that they allege should have been paid to the claimants (principal plus the interest actually earned on the awards, which was, according to the complaint, at least in part, compound interest); count II alleges that the Treasurer failed to satisfy his fiduciary duty to invest the proceeds of the unclaimed eminent domain awards with reasonable prudence, and seeks a writ of mandamus pursuant to G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A, ordering the Treasurer to pay Locator Services damages representing the difference between the amounts paid to the claimants and the amounts that should have been paid had the Treasurer fulfilled his fiduciary or quasi fiduciary duty to invest the proceeds with reasonable prudence; count III asserts that the claimants, as beneficiaries of the trust fund, are entitled to an accounting of the Treasurer\u2019s management and maintenance of the trust fund or other funds or accounts in which the unclaimed funds or proceeds thereof were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In May, 2003, the Treasurer moved for summary judgment on Locator Services\u2019s first amended complaint. The Treasurer claimed that Locator Services failed to prove it has standing to bring the suit; the claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, as well as loches or unreasonable delay; mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>relief is unavailable here; and \u00a7 7D does not impose a prudent investor standard on the Treasurer. Included within these arguments was the Treasurer\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity from suit. The Treasurer supported his motion for summary judgment with a statement of undisputed material facts and the affidavit of Gerald A. McDonough, the deputy treasurer and general counsel from March, 1999, to January, 2003. Locator Services filed an opposition to the Treasurer\u2019s summary judgment motion supported by an affidavit of its president, Kim Sherrie Sawyer. The Treasurer moved to strike Sawyer\u2019s affidavit. In August, 2003, after a hearing, the judge denied the Treasurer\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to strike the affidavit. In denying the motion for summary judgment, the judge found genuine issues of material fact as to standing and the method for calculating interest. The judge relied in part on Infolink Partners Ltd. Partnership vs. Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., Suffolk Superior Court No. 96-777A (May 9, 2002) (Infolink).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the judge noted that the Treasurer\u2019s \u201cundisputed facts\u201d were derived from an unverified answer to the complaint and were of \u201cnegligible value.\u201d The judge also ruled that, \u201c[i]n as much as this is not a tort action, but rather a statutorily created action under G. L. c. 79 prov[id]ing a mandamus action to seek money damages, there is no violation of the statute of limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge denied without comment the Treasurer\u2019s motion to strike Sawyer\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Invoking the doctrine of present execution, the Treasurer appealed from the ruling denying the summary judgment motion and the \u201cclosely related\u201d motion to strike the Sawyer affidavit. That doctrine grants the Commonwealth the right to appeal im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>mediately from the denial of a motion for summary judgment that is based (at least in part) on a claim of sovereign immunity. See <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 312, 315-316 (2002), citing <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 688 (1999) (order denying motion to dismiss based on immunity from suit enjoys benefit of present execution rule). To ensure appellate review of all the Treasurer\u2019s defenses, including those unrelated to his claim of sovereign immunity, the Treasurer also filed a motion pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), requesting that the judge report the correctness of his rulings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge allowed the rule 64 motion, reporting to the Appeals Court \u201cthe correctness of [his] orders of October 3, 2003: (1) denying the Treasurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment; and (2) denying the Treasurer\u2019s closely related motion to strike the April 30, 2003 summary judgment opposition affidavit.\u201d The judge also granted the Treasurer\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings pending this appeal. The Appeals Court consolidated the Treasurer\u2019s interlocutory appeal with the Superior Court\u2019s rule 64 report. We transferred the consolidated appeals to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We first consider whether the judge\u2019s denial of summary judgment was appropriate for each of the three counts of Locator Services\u2019s complaint. We then review the denial of the motion to strike the Sawyer affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\u201c \u2018The standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 . . . \u2018An order granting or denying summary judgment will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greater Lawrence Sanitary Dist. </em>v. <em>North Andover, </em>439 Mass. 16, 20-21 (2003), quoting <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992). \u201cA court must deny a motion for summary judgment if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there exist genuine issues of material fact . . . .\u201d <em>Golub </em>v. <em>Milpo, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 397, 400 (1988). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">1. <em>Count I: Violation of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D. </em>In count I, Locator Services argues that the Treasurer violated his statutory duty under \u00a7 7D by failing to pay the full amount of interest actually earned on each of the claimant\u2019s eminent domain awards. In determining if a triable issue exists concerning the Treasurer\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 7D, we must first examine the nature and extent of the Treasurer\u2019s duties under that provision. We construe G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D, for the first time and apply the well-settled rule that \u201c[w]here the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). See <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984), citing <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">We therefore look first to the text of the statute. By its plain terms, the statute establishes the Treasurer\u2019s duty to invest any unclaimed eminent domain awards in his custody in one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>more of several investment vehicles. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D (\u201cThe treasurer <em>shall </em>deposit any such check in a savings bank <em>or </em>other like institution, <em>or </em>in savings accounts in a trust company . . .\u201d [emphasis supplied]). The statutory list, while extraordinarily broad, is exclusive. Moreover, while the Legislature indicated no preference or directive to guide the Treasurer in his choice among the several named investment vehicles, the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d in the statute indicates that the duty to invest the funds in one or more of the vehicles is mandatory. Although the Treasurer has discretion to choose among the several named investment vehicles, he is obliged to invest the awards in one or more of these named vehicles. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7E (where an award check remains unclaimed for sixty days, \u201c[a] new check shall be made payable to the treasurer and <em>shall </em>be deposited, held and disposed of in accordance with section seven D\u201d). On this point, both parties are in agreement. By requiring the Treasurer to invest the awards in one or more of the permissible vehicles, the statute grants no authority to the Treasurer to utilize the awards in any other manner or for the Commonwealth\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The unambiguous language of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D, further directs the Treasurer to pay all interest actually earned on his investment of the claimants\u2019 eminent domain awards. The statute expressly requires that once the claimant establishes his or her right to the award, the taking agency <em>\u201cshall . </em>. . <em>order </em>such amount or portion thereof, or the <em>proceeds of its investment, </em>to be transferred to [the claimant] by the treasurer.\u201d G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D (emphasis added). Section 7D commands the Treasurer to invest unclaimed awards in specified investment vehicles \u201cto accumulate for the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We would contravene this stated purpose were we to interpret the statute to permit the Treasurer to retain any portion of the interest actually accumulated from the investment of the claimants\u2019 awards. The Legislature did not intend the Commonwealth to profit, at least in the first instance, from the Treasurer\u2019s investment of the eminent domain awards. Instead, before the Commonwealth can retain any portion of the awards or the interest they generate, the Commonwealth must comply with the procedural safeguards of the abandoned property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>statute. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D (\u201cAmounts deposited or invested . . . shall be subject to the provisions of [G. L. c. 200A], relating to abandoned property, and the treasurer shall, insofar as practicable, make such reports and give such notice concerning the same as are required respectively by [G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8]).\u201d See discussion of G. L. c. 200A, <em>infra. '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Although the Treasurer agreed at oral argument that \u00a7 7D imposes a duty to invest the claimants\u2019 awards in the specified vehicles and pay the claimants all interest actually accrued, in his brief, he argued that his own calculation of simple interest payments was sufficient.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The basis of the Treasurer\u2019s argument is that compound interest \u201cwill not be authorized absent express statutory authority.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Coupounas </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>401 Mass. 125, 131-132 (1987); <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Bailen, </em>293 Mass. 121, 123-124 (1936). Because the Legislature declined expressly to instruct the Treasurer to pay compound interest under \u00a7 7D, the argument goes, we should not impose such a requirement. But we do not impose compound interest payments here. Instead, we hold that the Treasurer has a duty to invest the awards in the vehicles expressly enumerated in the statute and to remit the interest actually accrued, whatever that amount is and whether it accrued as simple or compound. That many of the permissible investment vehicles expressly listed in \u00a7 7D earn compound interest suggests that payments will at least sometimes include compound interest. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D (permitting investment in several vehicles that can yield compound interest, such as a \u201csavings bank\u201d or a \u201csavings and loan association\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The Treasurer also argues that G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, relating to the interest to be calculated on an eminent domain taking for the period between the date of taking and the date of an award, provides only for simple interest, suggesting that simple interest is likewise appropriate under \u00a7 7D. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 2004, c. 352, \u00a7 36 (prejudgment and post-judgment interest on damage awards \u201ccalculated at an annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>rate equal to the weekly average one-year constant maturity treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u201d). However, the simple interest rate established in \u00a7 37 is not controlling in this action for a violation of \u00a7 7D. Chapter 79 clearly distinguishes between the interest owed on unpaid awards under \u00a7 37 and the interest on investments to be paid claimants under \u00a7 7D. Compare G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 2004, c. 352, \u00a7 35 (applicable to interest paid on \u201c[d]amages under this chapter . . . from the date on which the right to damages . . . vested until paid . . .\u201d), with G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D (governing Treasurer\u2019s \u201cdeposit or investment\u201d of unclaimed damages \u201cfor the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto\u201d). Unlike the post-award interest on the Treasurer\u2019s investments pursuant to \u00a7 7D at issue in the present case, \u00a7 37 involves \u201cjust compensation\u201d that must be paid to a property owner on an unpaid eminent domain award for the period between the taking and the ascertainment and payment of an award. See <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>441 Mass. 596, 599-600 (2004) (\u201cthe issue of interest [under \u00a7 37] is simply part of the claim for \u2018just compensation\u2019 \u201d). Here, we deal with an entirely different payment issue: what interest is owed a claimant on an eminent domain award <em>after </em>that award has been paid to the Treasurer by the taking authority, and as a direct result of the Treasurer\u2019s investment of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Similarly, the Treasurer argues that \u00a7 7D should be construed as requiring simple interest because G. L. c. 200A, which concerns \u201cabandoned\u201d property, and to which \u00a7 7D expressly refers, requires only simple interest. See G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 10 <em>(e) </em>(\u201cthe treasurer shall pay over to the claimant only that amount which the treasurer actually received together with interest at the rate of one-twelfth of one per cent per month\u201d). While \u00a7 7D expressly refers to the abandoned property statute, unclaimed awards subject to \u00a7 7D do not automatically become \u201cabandoned property\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 200A unless and until the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 200A are met. See, e.g., G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 7 <em>(b) </em>(persons holding property presumed abandoned must file report with treasurer containing all known owners and holders of property and property descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>tion); G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 7A (holder of property presumed abandoned must send notice to apparent owner\u2019s last known address); G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 8 (a) (\u201ctreasurer shall cause a notice to be published ... at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper\u201d); G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 8 <em>(e) </em>(treasurer shall mail notice to apparent owner). See also <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 410, 412-413 (1983) (property deemed abandoned after statutory \u201cdormancy\u201d period, and report and remittance to Treasurer, and compliance with \u201cprocedures to reunite missing owners with the surrendered property\u201d). In fact, \u00a7 7D expressly directs the Treasurer to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of G. L. c. 200A \u201cinsofar as practicable.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Treasurer does not claim, the record does not suggest, and the judge did not find that the money at issue here was ever deposited in the abandoned property fund in conformity with the procedures of G. L. c. 200A. Accordingly, the simple interest to be paid under G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 10 (&lt;?), has no application to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Locator Services, on the other hand, argues that the Treasurer must pay claimants compound interest on the invested awards, even if compound interest was not actually earned by the Treasurer on those investments. We decline to adopt the position of either party, that the Treasurer may pay claimants strictly simple interest or must pay exclusively compound interest, regardless of the type and amount of interest actually earned on the investments. Locator Services\u2019s compound interest argument is based in part on its claim that \u201c[a]ll of the investment options permitted by law earn compound interest.\u201d We need not address whether all of the statutorily permissible investment vehicles would yield compound interest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statute is clear in its directive: the Treasurer must choose among the range of investment options set forth in \u00a7 7D, and then turn over to the claimants all interest actually earned as a result of those invest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ment choices, regardless whether that interest was simple or compound.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Having so construed the statute, we now consider whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact regarding the Treasurer\u2019s alleged breach of these statutory obligations. On the record before the judge, it remains unclear how much interest was actually earned by the Treasurer on his investment of the eminent domain awards after 1993. The Treasurer paid the claimants only simple interest based on his calculation of an \u201caverage annual yield\u201d of the trust fund. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>To the extent the Treasurer may have invested the awards in vehicles earning compound interest post-1993, the simple interest paid to each of the claimants was inadequate as a matter of law under \u00a7 7D and the claimants are entitled to damages in the amount of the full interest actually earned by the Treasurer on those invested awards. Consequently, there exists no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved at trial concerning the Treasurer\u2019s liability for all interest actually earned on his investments pursuant to \u00a7 7D, and Locator Services is entitled to partial summary judgment on that issue. Pursuant to rule 56 (c), \u201c[s]ummary judgment, when appropriate, may be rendered against the moving party.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Perseus of N.E., MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 163, 168 (1999). Additionally, rule 56 (c) provides that summary judgment \u201cmay be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.\u201d The amount of interest actually earned by the Treasurer on his investment of the unclaimed awards after 1993, and whether that interest was greater than the amount paid to the claimants, are questions of fact to be resolved at trial on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">How or if the Treasurer invested the claimants\u2019 awards prior to 1993 also remains an open question to be tried on remand. In its brief, Locator Services alleges that, prior to 1993, the Treasurer failed to comply with the requirement of \u00a7 7D to invest the claimants\u2019 awards in one of the specified vehicles. At oral argument, the Treasurer conceded that he is unaware how (or even whether) the claimants\u2019 eminent domain awards were invested prior to 1993, and that, consequently, he may have violated his statutory duty to invest the awards. In its amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>complaint, Locator Services did not allege specifically the Treasurer\u2019s pre-1993 failure to invest the awards. Nevertheless, \u00a7 7D of the statute, as construed above, requires the Treasurer to invest the unclaimed awards. Therefore, reading the complaint as a whole, and recognizing that much discovery still remains to be conducted, we conclude that the allegation of the Treasurer\u2019s pre-1993 failure to invest the funds was subsumed within Locator Services\u2019s broader claim that the Treasurer breached his statutory duty under \u00a7 7D. On remand, Locator Services should have the opportunity to prove this allegation as part of count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Because the issue of damages for such a breach is likely to arise at trial, we very briefly address it here, although we leave it to the trial court to resolve the specifics. Should Locator Services prove the Treasurer failed to invest the funds in one or more of the statutorily mandated investment vehicles for any portion of the relevant time period, or that the Treasurer\u2019s actual investment decisions cannot be determined, Locator Services will be entitled to the interest that would have been earned during that period had the Treasurer invested in the lowest-yielding investment vehicle permissible under \u00a7 7D. These amounts represent the minimum amount of return the claimants would have received had the Treasurer placed the money in the lowest-yielding investment, thereby complying with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">2. <em>Count II: Breach of fiduciary duty. </em>In count II of its amended complaint, Locator Services alleges a breach of fiduciary duty by the Treasurer for failing properly to invest the claimants\u2019 eminent domain awards and seeks the interest that \u201cwould have accumulated for the benefit of the [claimants . . . if the awards were invested prudently by the Treasurer.\u201d At the foundation of this allegation is Locator Services\u2019s argument that \u00a7 7D imposes a \u201cprudent investor\u201d fiduciary duty on the Treasurer. This fiduciary duty, Locator Services asserts, requires the Treasurer to invest the awards only in vehicles that earn compound interest over time. Contrary to Locator Services\u2019s assertions, we hold that \u00a7 7D imposes no such \u201cprudent investor\u201d fiduciary duty. Accordingly, the Treasurer is entitled to a grant of summary judgment on count II of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Significantly, \u00a7 7D does not expressly confer on the Treasurer any \u201cfiduciary,\u201d \u201cquasi fiduciary,\u201d or \u201cprudent investor\u201d standard. The legislative omission is particularly striking because the Legislature has elsewhere explicitly expressed its intent to confer fiduciary duties on parties. See, e.g., G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 10 (\u201cIt shall be the fiduciary duty of all officers of a county government who control the investment of [monies held in the name of a county] to invest them prudently . . .\u201d); G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 5C, inserted by St. 2004, c. 177, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[cemetery and crematory] corporation[s] and [their] officers shall owe a fiduciary duty to a contributor to the trust fund [established for the care and preservation of a burial lot], his heirs and legal representatives\u201d); G. L. c. 202, \u00a7 38 (\u201cexecutor, administrator, guardian, conservator, or trustee\u201d authorized to sell real estate has a \u201cfiduciary duty to obtain the highest possible price for such real estate\u201d). In fact, contrary to requiring that the Treasurer choose \u201cprudently\u201d the highest yielding among the investment vehicles listed in the statute, \u00a7 7D only mandates investment in one or more of the permissible vehicles and suggests no limit to the Treasurer\u2019s discretion in choosing among them. Contrast G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 10 (county officers with fiduciary duty must invest money \u201cin such a manner as to require the payment of interest on the money at the highest possible rate reasonably available\u201d); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A) (2000) (defining fiduciary duty of manager of employee retirement plan under employee retirement income security plan). Elsewhere in G. L. c. 79, the Legislature enumerated more fully the nature of the duty imposed, but it chose not to do so here. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 26 (trustees for persons with \u201clegal disability\u201d must \u201cfaithful[ly] perform[]\u201d trustee duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">This court has recognized fiduciary relationships in limited circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Berish </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>437 Mass. 252, 269 n.29 (2002) (trustee of condominium association owed fiduciary duty to association but not individual unit owners); <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 333-334 (2001) (stockbroker is fiduciary of customer in certain circumstances, as where entrusted with discretion); <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>424 Mass. 501, 504-505 (1997) (sole voting trustee to family business breached fiduciary duty to shareholders by exploiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>control over assets); <em>Merola </em>v. <em>Exergen Corp., </em>423 Mass. 461, 464 (1996) (stockholders in close corporation owe one another fiduciary duty); <em>Matter of Pressman, </em>421 Mass. 514, 518 (1995) (attorneys owe fiduciary duty to clients); <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Bogoff, </em>402 Mass. 650, 660 (1988) (joint venturers owe one another fiduciary duties); <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gaffney, </em>389 Mass. 1, 11 (1983) (trusted executives owed fiduciary duty to employer). The \u201cprudent investor\u201d fiduciary duty is commonly applicable to trustees, who owe a special responsibility to beneficiaries of a trust when investing trust assets. See, e.g., <em>Berish </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra; Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 362-364 (1981) (trustee of testamentary trust owed \u201cprudent man\u201d fiduciary duty to beneficiaries). Here, in contrast to these above-cited examples, the Treasurer\u2019s duties are expressly delineated by statute, and there exists no other special relationship between the claimants and the Treasurer that might warrant the imposition of a fiduciary duty. The eminent domain statute creates a comprehensive scheme that defines the rights and obligations of parties involved in property takings. Cf. <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 642 (2002), quoting <em>Mullen Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>404 Mass. 750, 752 (1989) (mechanic\u2019s lien statute provides \u201ca comprehensive scheme which compels strict compliance in order to obtain relief\u201d). It sets forth a variety of responsibilities to be fulfilled by governmental agencies and officers and creates complex procedures to safeguard landowners\u2019 rights. Had the Legislature intended to impose a fiduciary duty on the Treasurer or qualify further the Treasurer\u2019s responsibilities, it would have expressly done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Locator Services points to the statutory language in \u00a7 7D that the Treasurer must invest the funds \u201cfor the benefit\u201d of the claimants as evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to impose a fiduciary duty on the Treasurer to invest in the highest-yielding investment vehicles. This language is insufficient to establish a fiduciary duty, nor does it mandate the manner in which the Treasurer must prioritize the investments in choosing among the statutory alternatives. Locator Services would also have this court find a fiduciary duty from the fact that some or all of the investment vehicles identified in \u00a7 7D earn interest or dividends that are either compounded on a regular basis or, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>reinvestment, result in a compounding effect. Merely because some (or even all) of the vehicles enumerated yield compound interest does not imply a fiduciary obligation on the Treasurer\u2019s part. Finally, relying on <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>292 Mass. 148, 150 (1935), Locator Services argues that fiduciary relationships are well established where one person is entrusted with investing funds for another. However, in <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra, </em>the fiduciary duty attached to the vice-president, director, and treasurer of a corporation engaged in the business of soliciting the handling and investment of the money of others. While the duty to invest funds for another is indeed common among fiduciaries, the existence of such a responsibility is not sufficient, without more, to create a fiduciary duty. See <em>United Feature Syndicate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller Features Syndicate, Inc., </em>216 F. Supp. 2d 198, 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), quoting <em>Penato </em>v. <em>George, </em>52 A.D.2d 939, 942 (N.Y. 1976) (\u201cBroadly stated, a fiduciary relationship is one founded upon trust or confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another\u201d). Here, the Treasurer\u2019s responsibility to invest and hold funds for unknown claimants does not arise from any common-law fiduciary obligation, nor any special relationship of trust, confidence, or reliance. Rather, it is expressly created, and limited, by statute. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D. It would be inconsistent with this statutorily prescribed duty to read into it any additional fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Because we hold today that \u00a7 7D does not impose any fiduciary duty on the Treasurer, and Locator Services\u2019s count II is dependent on such a fiduciary duty, summary judgment should be entered on behalf of the Treasurer on this count.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Treasurer argues, however, that all three counts of Locator Services\u2019s complaint are based on a breach of fiduciary duty and that therefore summary judgment must enter on all three counts. While count I of the amended complaint does incorporate allegations that presume a fiduciary duty, count I is not dependent on such a duty for its validity. Even absent any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>fiduciary duty on the part of the Treasurer, Locator Services may demonstrate at trial that the Treasurer failed to pay the interest actually earned on his investment of the awards, and that he failed to invest properly the awards prior to 1993, either of which would constitute a violation of \u00a7 7D. Similarly, while Locator Services also incorporates breach of fiduciary duty allegations in count m of its complaint (for an accounting), Locator Services\u2019s entitlement to an accounting is not dependent on the Treasurer\u2019s fiduciary duty. We address count III directly below.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">3. <em>Count III. </em>In count III, Locator Services requests an accounting of all interest earned by the Treasurer on the investment of the awards and an accounting of what was done with the money earned as a result of that investment but not distributed to the claimants. Despite the fact that the Treasurer does not owe the claimants any fiduciary duty, an accounting may be necessary in order to determine what, if any, additional interest is owed Locator Services should it prevail on its violation of \u00a7 7D claim. We therefore treat count IH as a request for an assessment of any damages owed Locator Services under count I. Additional discovery likely will resolve much of the present uncertainty regarding what was done by the Treasurer with the awards during the period in question and how much additional interest, if any, is owed Locator Services. To the extent additional questions remain, the trial court should order any additional accounting by the Treasurer necessary to resolve the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Having determined that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Locator Services may pursue its claim alleging the Treasurer violated \u00a7 7D, we next consider several arguments raised by the Treasurer, which he asserts warrant summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">4. <em>Availability of mandamus relief. </em>First, the Treasurer argues that even if he breached his statutory duty here, mandamus relief is inappropriate. The Treasurer asserts that because \u00a7 7D grants him discretion to choose among the several investment vehicles permitted under \u00a7 7D when carrying out his duty to invest, mandamus relief is inappropriate. The Treasurer emphasizes that mandamus relief is generally not available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>where an official has discretion in performing duties, see <em>Channel Fish Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Fish Mkt. Corp., </em>359 Mass. 185, 187 (1971), but instead is appropriate only where there is but one way an obligation may be fulfilled. <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 792 (1990). The Treasurer is only partially correct. His rationale is inapplicable to the \u00a7 7D claim we remand today. In count I, Locator Services does not seek mandamus in order to impose a particular investment choice on the Treasurer; rather, it seeks to enforce the Treasurer\u2019s statutory obligation to invest the awards in one of the vehicles specified in \u00a7 7D and then remit all profits actually earned (or those that should have been earned) from that statutorily required investment. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Treasurer has no discretion whether to invest the funds or whether to remit all interest earned. Therefore, mandamus relief is appropriate here \u2014 this is precisely the cause of action the Legislature had in mind when it created the right to seek mandamus relief and damages under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A, for violations of \u00a7 7D.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Alternatively, the Treasurer argues that Locator Services\u2019s claim is actually a contract claim governed by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 41, and that, accordingly, mandamus is not available where another remedy exists. The Treasurer relies on <em>Eldredge </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Brewster, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (1984), for this proposition. This argument fails because \u00a7 41 is not controlling in this case, as it applies to actions seeking to recover underlying eminent domain awards that have not yet been paid by the taking authority or have not been claimed by claimants. Section 41 applies, by its terms, where \u201cno petition <em>under section fourteen </em>[has been] filed within the time limited,\u201d and allows recovery for an underlying \u201caward of damages.\u201d Section 14, in turn, provides a cause of action to \u201c[a] person entitled to an award of his <em>damages </em>under this chapter . . . [pursuant to] section <em>six, seven, nine or ten . . . </em>.\u201d Nothing in <em>Eldredge </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Brewster, supra, </em>suggests the contrary. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 action under \u00a7 41 sought to recover unclaimed eminent domain awards. Here, Locator Services is not suing for the payment of underlying eminent domain awards, or claiming any violation of \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 9, or 10. Rather, this action alleging a violation of \u00a7 7D concerns postaward investment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>funds. This cause of action is expressly governed by \u00a7 10A, not \u00a7 41. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 10A (governing compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 7D, among others).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">5. <em>Sovereign immunity. </em>The Treasurer argues further that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars Locator Services\u2019s claims. We disagree. According to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Commonwealth cannot be sued in its own courts \u201cabsent consent by the Legislature or abrogation of sovereignty by Congress acting under its Fourteenth Amendment powers .... \u2018Consent to suit must be expressed by the terms of a statute, or appear by necessary implication from them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>442 Mass. 170, 175-176 (2004), quoting <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981). See <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 762-764 (1997). Applying this standard, the Commonwealth has clearly abrogated its immunity in \u00a7 10A by expressly authorizing an action for mandamus relief and damages. The Treasurer asserts that \u00a7 10A does not expressly authorize suit against the Commonwealth because \u00a7 7D does not require the Treasurer to pay compound interest. This argument confuses the issue whether the Treasurer violated the statute by paying the claimants only simple interest with the issue whether the Treasurer is immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The allegations to be tried on remand \u2014 that the Treasurer failed to invest the funds as required under \u00a7 7D and did not remit the full interest yielded on the investments made \u2014 if proved, would constitute violations of \u00a7 7D regardless of whether the statute requires compound interest in all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">6. <em>Statute of limitations and tolling. </em>We next address the Treasurer\u2019s argument that summary judgment is proper because Locator Services failed to file the action within the applicable limitations period. On remand, Locator Services will seek mandamus relief pursuant to \u00a7 10A to compel the Treasurer to fulfil his duties under \u00a7 7D. Because neither \u00a7 7D nor \u00a7 10A includes any reference to a limitations period for filing an action alleging a Treasurer\u2019s breach of \u00a7 7D, we must first determine whether to read a limitations period into those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We do not believe the Legislature intended to permit actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>seeking additional interest payments under \u00a7 7D, and brought under \u00a7 10A, to be filed indefinitely after an alleged breach. \u201cWe find nothing in the legislative history of [the statute], which would suggest that the Legislature, by not specifically prescribing a period of time within which an action . . . must be brought, intended that actions not be time-limited. If such a result had been intended, it would have been natural for the Legislature to express such an intention.\u201d <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 348 (1979). The inclusion of a three-year limitations period elsewhere in the statute, see G. L. c. 79, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 41, does not necessarily indicate that the Legislature intended that there be no limitations period for claims alleging additional interest owed under \u00a7 7D. To the contrary, to construe \u00a7 7D as imposing no limitations period at all on these claims, where the remainder of the statute contains limitations periods, would violate the well-settled canon of statutory interpretation that, where possible, we construe the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another. See <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983) (\u201cstatutes should be interpreted as a whole to constitute a consistent and harmonious provision\u201d). Moreover, it would be illogical to apply a strict three-year statute of limitations period to bar a claimant from seeking her underlying award for a taking under \u00a7 16 (where such a claimant may have received no compensation for the taking), while allowing that same claimant an indefinite period of time in which to file an action for additional interest on the Treasurer\u2019s investment of that award under \u00a7 10A.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Having determined that some limitations period was intended to apply to the present action, we must discern the proper duration of such a period. The Treasurer posits that Locator Services\u2019s claims are time barred by the limitations period applicable to contractual claims asserted under \u00a7 41 of the eminent domain statute. As discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41 is not controlling in this case, as it applies to actions seeking to recover underlying eminent domain awards. Alternatively, the Treasurer urges this court to establish a \u201creasonable\u201d limitations period, seeking guidance from other closely related, though not controlling, sections of G. L. c. 79. Where no limitations period is statutorily provided, it is instructive to consider reasonable periods set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>forth in similar statutes. See <em>Trust Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 625 (2000). A three-year limitations period is expressly set forth in G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 16, for suits seeking damages pursuant to \u00a7 14 (for the principal award for the taking). The finality of that three-year limitations period is underscored in \u00a7 41, which provides that \u201c[i]f no petition under section fourteen is filed within the time limited [i.e., three years], the award of damages shall be final and the amount thereof shall be paid upon demand, and if not so paid may be recovered in an action of contract.\u201d Also enlightening, contract actions against the Commonwealth are subject to a three-year statute of limitations, see <em>Wong </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>438 Mass. 29, 35 &amp; n.15 (2002), as are tort claims against the Commonwealth brought under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A. We thus conclude that three years is a reasonable limitations period for actions brought under \u00a7 10A to enforce the Treasurer\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 7D to pay the proper interest owed on his investment of unclaimed eminent domain awards. By importing this three-year limitations period into \u00a7 10A and \u00a7 7D, we also read G. L. c. 79 as a harmonious whole. See <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Locator Services argues that, rather than imposing a three-year limitations period on all actions brought under \u00a7 10A for interest payments pursuant to \u00a7 7D, this court should adopt a case-by-case approach, employing a \u201creasonable\u201d period determined \u201cfrom the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>321 Mass. 46, 51 (1947). We decline to embrace such a fluid and ad hoc approach. Such a \u201ccase by case\u201d approach would undermine the statute\u2019s goal of finality. See <em>Eldredge </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Brewster, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 504 (1984) (eminent domain statute intended to \u201cafford[] public agencies predictability and finality concerning their obligations when they take private property\u201d). Moreover, it would leave the Treasurer open to suits for additional interest payments under \u00a7 7D for an indefinite period of time and almost certainly lead to inconsistent application and frequent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We now consider from what point the three-year limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>period will ran. The Treasurer argues that the limitations period should begin to ran from the date when the claimants or their heirs received actual notice of the property taking, or from the date \u201cwhen the claimants first learned, or should have learned, of the award.\u201d We hold that the three-year limitations period should ran from the time the claimants were paid the allegedly insufficient interest on their awards. The cause of action for insufficient interest accrued, not when the claimants\u2019 land was taken by the MHD and DEM, but rather when the claimants received their allegedly insufficient interest payments. It is only at the point the claimants received their interest payments that they had any reason to claim a breach of \u00a7 7D. This is consistent with our general role that statutes of limitations ran from the date the cause of action accrues. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>424 Mass. 501, 517 (1997) (three-year limitations period on tort actions under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, generally runs from date cause of action accrues); <em>Berkshire Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>422 Mass. 659, 661 (1996) (limitations periods on contract actions, prescribed by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, accrue from time of breach). We see no harm to the Commonwealth in permitting the claimants to file suit three years from the date of the payment, rather than three years from the date of the taking. Any delay in filing suit associated with this later running of the statute of limitations will not harm the Commonwealth. Pursuant to his obligations under \u00a7 7D, the Treasurer should have invested the awards on behalf of the claimants with the expectation of either remitting the earnings to the claimant or depositing them, after the proper procedures, in the abandoned property fund pursuant to G. L. c. 200A.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Having determined that a three-year statute of limitations period is applicable to Locator Services\u2019s claim that the Treasurer violated \u00a7 7D, and that such limitations period runs from the date that the claimants received their allegedly insufficient payments, we must determine whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact whether Locator Services timely filed this action. The Treasurer claims that application of the three-year statute of limitations period will require dismissal of ninety-eight of Locator Services\u2019s 103 claims. In fact, the record does reveal that, if the three-year limitations period were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>applied to Locator Services\u2019s claims, without any tolling, the majority of the claims would be subject to dismissal. It is undisputed that the Treasurer made initial payments to the vast majority of the claimants more than three years prior to the time Locator Services filed suit in October, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Nonetheless, Locator Services claims that its delay in filing suit was in reliance on an agreement it made with the Treasurer to toll any applicable statute of limitations, and that, when the tolling agreement is applied, its claims were filed within the three-year limitations period. In particular, Locator Services claims that it reached an agreement with the Treasurer to defer initiating its suit to recover unpaid interest until the Infolink case was decided. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>In support of its tolling agreement argument, Locator Services filed the Sawyer affidavit. Locator Services also filed, with the Sawyer affidavit, a letter by Sawyer to the judge presiding over the Infolink litigation, expressing Locator Services\u2019s interest in the matter. The Sawyer affidavit avers that, in 1998, Sawyer had discussions with Jennifer C. Borden, deputy general counsel for the Treasurer, during which the two agreed that if Locator Services would not file suit on behalf of the claimants until the Infolink action had been resolved, Locator Services would get the benefit of any decision favorable to the plaintiff on the interest issue. If, on the other hand, the Commonwealth prevailed on its standing argument in the Infolink suit and therefore the interest issue was not addressed by the Superior Court, the affidavit asserts that Locator Services would still have the right to file suit on behalf of the claimants. Sawyer claims in her affidavit that Borden informed her that Assistant Attorney General Salvatore M. Giorlandino, who was handling the Infolink action, also agreed to this tolling agreement. Approximately five months after the summary judgment findings and rulings were issued in the Infolink suit in May, 2002, Locator Services filed its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The Treasurer argues that no valid tolling agreement was reached and that the Sawyer affidavit is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to its existence. In his brief, the Treasurer asserts that an affidavit executed by Gerald A. McDonough, the deputy treasurer and general counsel, filed three months after the Sawyer affidavit, presented \u201cundisputed\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>testimonial and documentary evidence that Locator Services never executed a valid statute of limitations tolling agreement. In his affidavit, McDonough, who was Borden\u2019s superior for a brief period, averred that he was \u201cthoroughly briefed\u201d by her on the Infolink suit but that he had \u201cno recollection\u201d of Borden\u2019s informing him of a tolling agreement with Locator Services. McDonough further alleged that Locator Services never \u201cmentioned the existence of any . . . tolling agreement . . . during the course of my dealings with them.\u201d The issue whether a valid tolling agreement was executed, the primary topic addressed by the Sawyer and McDonough affidavits, cannot be labeled \u201cundisputed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The Treasurer also points to correspondence by Locator Services to the Treasurer\u2019s Office in March and April, 1999, three years prior to the summary judgment decision in the Infolink suit, which he claims refutes any assertion by Locator Services of a tolling agreement. While these letters may undercut Locator Services\u2019s claim of a tolling agreement, they do not remove the genuine dispute over its existence. Finally, the Treasurer argues that even if a valid tolling agreement were made between the parties, it was revoked by Locator Services\u2019s March and April, 1999, correspondence, which demanded that the Treasurer pay interest due, threatened suit, and made no reference to any tolling agreements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This correspondence is ambiguous at best as to any revocation of a pre-existing tolling agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Given the conflicting testimonial and documentary evidence before the Superior Court as described above, there existed at least a genuine issue of material fact whether a verbal tolling agreement was made, and, if so, whether it was revoked. In fact, at oral argument, the Treasurer conceded that the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff would lead to the view that in 1998 an oral tolling agreement was made. On remand, Locator Services should have the opportunity to prove the existence of this tolling agreement, and the Treasurer the chance to prove its revocation. We leave it to the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>apply the applicable statute of limitations and any enforceable tolling agreement and determine which, if any, of the 103 claims are ultimately barred by the running of the limitations period.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">7. <em>Motion to strike Sawyer affidavit. </em>We turn now to the judge\u2019s denial of the Treasurer\u2019s motion to strike the Sawyer affidavit. As discussed above, Locator Services filed the Sawyer affidavit along with its opposition to the Treasurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Treasurer filed a motion to strike the affidavit. That motion was denied. The Treasurer argues that the judge erred, and had the affidavit been stricken, summary judgment would have been entered in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Treasurer argues that paragraphs 14-29 of Sawyer\u2019s affidavit contain evidence that went beyond limited testimony provided in Locator Services\u2019s answers to interrogatories, especially interrogatory no. 13, which asked Locator Services to elaborate on its statute of limitations tolling agreement claim. Our case law establishes that a party, purely in the hopes of defeating summary judgment, may not submit at the eleventh hour an affidavit that contradicts the party\u2019s earlier statements and discovery responses. Such an affidavit is not enough to create a triable issue. See, e.g., <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 647-648 (2002); <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>436 Mass. 244, 249 (2002). But Locator Services has done no such thing here in filing the Sawyer affidavit. Since its initial complaint, Locator Services has alleged a tolling agreement and has claimed that it has standing. Sawyer\u2019s affidavit testimony concerning the specifics of that tolling agreement and Locator Services\u2019s standing, while more detailed than the information provided by Locator Services in its pleadings and interrogatory answers, did not contradict earlier claims by Locator Services, nor does it appear intended to invent a defense for the purpose of defeating summary judgment. The Treasurer would have us strike any affidavit testimony that \u201cwent well beyond\u201d previously sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>statements. We decline to do so. Our case law contains no blanket prohibition on affidavits that merely elaborate on previously sworn statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The Treasurer next argues that paragraphs 14-24 of the Sawyer affidavit contain inadmissible hearsay evidence, in the form of testimony concerning an April, 2003, conversation with Borden, the former deputy general counsel for the Treasurer, regarding the alleged tolling agreement. We recognize that \u201c[h]earsay in an affidavit is unacceptable to defeat summary judgment.\u201d <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 721 (1985). See <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, </em>432 Mass. 390, 402 (2000) (judge properly rejected affidavits based on inadmissable hearsay offered to create factual issue). However, Sawyer\u2019s affidavit primarily refers to discussions between Sawyer and Borden that occurred during 1998, rather than during April, 2003. The timing of these conversations is critical because, after April, 1999, Borden left her employment at the Treasurer\u2019s office. Thus, it appears from the face of the affidavit that the conversations referenced occurred mainly during Borden\u2019s tenure as deputy general counsel for the Treasurer, and are admissible at least as party-opponent admissions. See, e.g., <em>Zucco </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>439 Mass. 503, 507-508 (2003); <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, </em>424 Mass. 867, 873 (1997), <em>S.C. </em>434 Mass. 301 (2001).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The affidavit also refers to conversations between Sawyer and McDonough, which are likewise admissible as party-opponent admissions. To the extent the conversations referenced in the affidavit are offered to prove the existence of an oral tolling agreement, they would not be hearsay at all, but rather admissible as verbal conduct giving rise to legal rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 246 (2000) (testimony concerning oral agreement not hearsay because \u201cnot offered for the truth of the matters as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>serted, but as proof of an \u2018operative\u2019 statement\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s denial of the Treasurer\u2019s motion to strike Sawyer\u2019s affidavit was therefore proper, with the exception that the Treasurer\u2019s motion to strike should be allowed as to paragraph 19. See note 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court judge denying the Treasurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to count I is affirmed. Partial summary judgment is to be entered on behalf of Locator Services on the issue of the Treasurer\u2019s liability for the actual interest earned on his investment of the claimants\u2019 awards. The issue of damages on count I is remanded for trial. The order of the Superior Court judge denying the Treasurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment is vacated with respect to count II, and summary judgment shall enter in favor of the Treasurer on that count. Count HI is remanded only for purposes of an assessment of damages under count I. The judge\u2019s order denying the Treasurer\u2019s motion to strike the affidavit of Kim Sherrie Sawyer is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-6\">General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 38, provides that, with certain exceptions, \u201call funds over which the commonwealth has exclusive control shall be invested by the state treasurer with the approval of the governor and council as follows: <em>(a) </em>In the public funds of the United States ... or of this commonwealth ... or of any other state of the United States ....

The Treasurer added the \u201caverage annual yield\u201d interest amounts to the unclaimed principal award amount for each respective year the award was held in the trust fund. The base principal for computation of the respective interest earned amounts remained at all times the original amount of the unclaimed award. The Treasurer does not appear to dispute that he utilized this calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In its original complaint, Locator Services sought to recover interest payments on behalf of ninety-five claimants for 134 claims. The Treasurer filed a request for dismissal of Locator Services\u2019s complaint due to its failure to pay court filing fees for all ninety-five claimants. This motion was allowed \u201cas to any claimant who does not file or causes to be filed on his [or] her or its behalf a filing fee . . . within 30 days of the filing of this decision.\u201d As a result, Locator Services paid filing fees for, and now represents, only fifty-five claimants seeking recovery of interest on 103 takings. The correctness of this ruling is not before this court and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Infolink Partners Ltd. Partnership vs. Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., Suffolk Superior Court No. 96-777A (May 9, 2002) (Infolink), involved one of Locator Services\u2019s business competitors that had previously filed suit against the Treasurer and had asserted compound interest claims against the Treasurer pursuant to \u00a7 7D. In May, 2002, a Superior Court judge (who was not the judge in this case) ruled in that case that \u00a7 7D \u201cimposefs] on the Treasurer a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary duty to invest the proceeds of unclaimed eminent domain awards with reasonable prudence for the benefit of unknown owners.\u201d The case was settled and dismissed with prejudice in April, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The judge issued a second order on October 3, 2003, apparently treating Locator Services\u2019s opposition papers as a cross motion for summary judgment and denying that \u201cmotion\u201d on the same grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">In pertinent part, Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), provides: \u201cIf the trial court is of opinion that an interlocutory finding or order made by it so affects the merits of the controversy that the matter ought to be determined by the appeals court before any further proceedings in the trial court, it may report such matter, and may stay all further proceedings except such as are necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.\u201d See <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>415 Mass. 258, 261 n.4 (1993), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">As this appeal comes before this court both under the doctrine of present execution and pursuant to a rule 64 report, we treat the case as presenting the issue whether the denial of summary judgment and the motion to strike were proper, and consider all relevant arguments properly raised by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">As a threshold matter, we briefly address the issue of standing. In his motion for summary judgment, the Treasurer argued that Locator Services lacked standing to bring the action under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 7D. The Treasurer no longer disputes Locator Services\u2019s standing. We address it here because the judge based his denial of summary judgment in part on the standing issue, and because standing is a jurisdictional issue that cannot be waived. <em>Litton Business Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981). By virtue of its contingent fee agreements with the claimants, Locator Services has demonstrated an economic interest in this litigation. Locator Services has further established authority to bring suit on behalf of the claimants as evidenced by the original powers of attorney executed by the claimants submitted to and accepted by the bureau and the department as a precondition to the payment of the underlying awards to Locator Services. The Superior Court judge was thus correct in concluding that Locator Services has standing to pursue these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">In his brief, the Treasurer frames this argument as one of the bases for his sovereign immunity claim. We consider this argument here as it relates to the duty owed by the Treasurer pursuant to \u00a7 7D. We deal with the issue of sovereign immunity <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Locator Services has not alleged, as part of its breach of \u00a7 7D claim, that the Treasurer failed to comply with the notice and reporting requirements of G. L. c. 200A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Locator Services\u2019s compound interest argument is also grounded in its claim that \u00a7 7D imposes a \u201cprudent investor\u201d fiduciary or quasi fiduciary duty on the Treasurer. We address and reject the existence of such a duty <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Having rejected any \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d on the part of the Treasurer, we need not address the Treasurer\u2019s arguments that Locator Services\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claims are in fact negligence tort claims, and therefore barred under various provisions of G. L. c. 258 (the Massachusetts Torts Claims Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The Treasurer also argues that even if an oral tolling agreement was made, such tolling agreements are not enforceable. The Treasurer has provided no case law in support of this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In his motion for summary judgment, the Treasurer argued that Locator Services\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of loches or unreasonable delay. The Treasurer did not brief or argue this point before this court. On the record before us, and given the genuine issue concerning the existence of a tolling agreement, we cannot determine that the Treasurer is entitled to summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Paragraph 19 of the affidavit does reference an April, 2003, conversation with Borden: \u201cIn connection with preparing this affidavit [in April, 2003], I contacted Jennifer Borden, who confirmed that my general recollection of the events in paragraphs 16 and 17 above was correct.\u201d That statement, made well after Borden\u2019s employment at the Treasurer\u2019s office, is not a party-opponent admission and should be struck as hearsay. We note, however, that this paragraph adds little to the record and thus would not affect the judge\u2019s decision on summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">In his motion to strike, the Treasurer claims the Sawyer affidavit contains opinion and speculative evidence in violation of Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We do not consider the affidavit testimony to be inadmissible opinion or speculative evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
