In this appeal, Adjutant argues that evidence of Whiting\u2019s violent reputation and past conduct, even though unknown to her at the time of the killing, should have been admitted at her trial because it was relevant to her claim that Whiting was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201cfirst aggressor\u201d in the altercation that resulted in his death, and that she acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">After surveying the state of the law in jurisdictions throughout the country, we are persuaded that evidence of a victim\u2019s prior violent conduct may be probative of whether the victim was the first aggressor where a claim of self-defense has been asserted and the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, when such circumstances are present, we hold, as a matter of common-law principle, that trial judges have the discretion to admit in evidence specific incidents of violence that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated. While there is potential for confusion and prejudice inherent in the admission of this type of evidence, trial judges are well equipped to decide whether the probative value of the evidence proffered outweighs its prejudicial effect in the context of the facts and issues presented in specific cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In the present case, relying on language in past decisions of this court, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 291 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dilone, </em>385 Mass. 281, 285-286 (1982), the judge ruled that she lacked the discretion to admit evidence of prior violent acts committed by Whiting but unknown to Adjutant. Because we conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling, while understandable, was prejudicial to Adjutant\u2019s claim that she acted in self-defense, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence at trial was as follows. Adjutant worked as an escort for Newbury Cosmopolitan International Escort Service (Newbury). In the early morning of September 25, 1999, Whiting telephoned Newbury and requested an escort. The Newbury dispatcher told Whiting that he could receive a full body massage and one hour of an escort\u2019s company for $175. Whiting agreed to these terms, and arrangements were made for Adjutant to visit Whiting\u2019s home in Revere. Shortly thereafter, Adjutant was dropped off there by a driver and the dispatcher\u2019s boy friend (drivers). Whiting met her outside his building and accompanied her to his basement apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Once inside, Whiting paid Adjutant, who then telephoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Newbury to report that she had received payment. Adjutant testified that during and after the call Whiting snorted two lines of cocaine. Adjutant then offered to begin a massage. Whiting replied that he wanted intercourse and believed that he had paid for it. Adjutant denied that she was sent to have intercourse with him, and telephoned the Newbury dispatcher on her cellular telephone to inform her that Whiting wanted more than a massage. Adjutant then handed the phone to Whiting, and the dispatcher reminded him of the original terms. Whiting demanded a total refund, which neither the dispatcher nor Adjutant offered. When Whiting returned the telephone to Adjutant, the dispatcher told her to leave and agreed to stay on the line until Adjutant was out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">There was conflicting testimony as to when the defendant and the victim armed themselves for their fatal confrontation. Adjutant testified that when she attempted to leave, Whiting pushed her onto his bed and retrieved a crowbar from the kitchen, at which point Adjutant picked up a knife that was lying on the bedside table, next to a plate of cocaine. The dispatcher, on the other hand, testified that while she was talking to Whiting, he said that Adjutant had a knife, and that when Adjutant then got back on the telephone with her, Adjutant said that Whiting was picking up a crowbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In any event, after arming himself, Whiting first slammed the crowbar on a counter and then swung it at Adjutant, striking her in the leg. She responded by nicking him in the face with the knife, drawing blood. Adjutant testified that she next tried to avert further confrontation by offering to begin again with a massage, but Whiting refused. Meanwhile, at Adjutant\u2019s urging, the dispatcher alerted Adjutant\u2019s drivers to return to Whiting\u2019s apartment. At this point, Adjutant testified that she attempted to run toward the door, but Whiting tackled her. During the struggle, Adjutant stabbed Whiting in the shoulder with the knife and moved away. Whiting, however, continued to block Adjutant\u2019s exit, while Adjutant screamed at him to stay back and threatened to cut him again if he came any closer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Within minutes, Adjutant\u2019s drivers returned to the scene, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>heard her screams, and kicked in the door to the apartment. According to Adjutant, the moment one of the drivers kicked in the door, Whiting advanced on her with the crowbar raised, at which point she stabbed him in the neck, inflicting the fatal wound. Whiting did not immediately drop the crowbar or move away from the door. When he eventually did, Adjutant fled the apartment with the drivers, throwing down the knife and her telephone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the drivers provided a different account of the fatal stabbing. He testified that after the door was kicked open, Whiting turned to face the drivers, at which point he saw Adjutant move toward Whiting and stab him in the neck in a straightforward thrusting motion. The medical examiner\u2019s testimony concerning the likely manner in which the fatal knife wound was inflicted was not entirely consistent with the driver\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Adjutant maintained at trial that all her actions were defensive and intended to help her escape the apartment. The jury\u2019s main task was determining whether Adjutant acted in self-defense. That inquiry required the jury to weigh Adjutant\u2019s credibility, as well as that of the dispatcher and the driver, and decide who moved first to attack the other during the last moments of the standoff. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 210-212 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In her defense, Adjutant focused on Whiting\u2019s intoxication and drug use that evening. The medical examiner testified at trial that Whiting had cocaine in his bloodstream, and that his blood alcohol level reflected his consumption of the equivalent of sixty ounces of beer or five ounces of whiskey. Two of Whiting\u2019s neighbors testified that, earlier that evening, Whiting appeared intoxicated and had made unsuccessful sexual advances toward women near the apartment building. Adjutant testified that she became terrified when her initial blows to Whiting did not seem to faze him, apparently because of his drugged condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">During the trial, Adjutant\u2019s counsel sought to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Whiting\u2019s neighbors about his previous violent behavior and reputation for violence. The judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objections to these questions and also barred testimony about Whiting\u2019s behavior while intoxicated, ruling that Whiting\u2019s violent past or reputation for violence was only relevant if Adjutant had been aware of them at the time of the stabbing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the prosecution subsequently elicited testimony that Whiting was \u201ccalm,\u201d \u201ctalked . . . very softly,\u201d and \u201csounded like a nice person\u201d on the night of the incident, defense counsel moved for permission to \u201cimpeach\u201d this testimony by evidence of Whiting\u2019s prior acts of aggression. The judge denied the motion, except insofar as to permit Adjutant to introduce percipient witness testimony to Whiting\u2019s previous use of a crowbar. No such witnesses were called.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Adjutant of voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She appealed and the Appeals Court affirmed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (2003). We granted her application for further appellate review limited to whether the trial judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>concluding that she had no discretion to admit Adjutant\u2019s proffered evidence and consequently excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In almost every American jurisdiction, evidence of a victim\u2019s violent character may be admitted to support an accused\u2019s claim of self-defense under two distinct theories. First, it may be admitted to prove that at the time of the assault the defendant was reasonably apprehensive for his safety, and used a degree of force that was reasonable in light of the victim\u2019s violent tendencies. Because such evidence is relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind (the subjective reasonableness of his apprehension and actions), a predicate to its admissibility is the defendant\u2019s prior knowledge of it. Second, it may be admitted as tending to prove that the victim and not the defendant was likely to have been the \u201cfirst aggressor,\u201d where there is a dispute as to who initiated the attack. Under the first theory, the evidence is not admitted for the purpose of showing that the victim acted in conformance with his character for violence; under the second theory, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Massachusetts has long followed the evidentiary rule that permits the introduction of evidence of the victim\u2019s violent character, if known to the defendant, as it bears on the defendant\u2019s state of mind and the reasonableness of his actions in claiming to have acted in self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496, 502 (1974) (victim\u2019s reputation as violent person admissible). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735-736 (1986) (instances of victim\u2019s prior acts of violence admissible). This court has not, however, had occasion to rule on the second theory, raised in this case, regarding the use of such evidence to prove who was the first aggressor. <em>Id. </em>at 736 n.1 (\u201cIt should be recognized that we are not considering here the admission of evidence of general reputation or of specific incidents of violence to show that the victim was, or was likely to have been, the aggressor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Under Rules 404 and 405 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, all Federal courts now permit the introduction of evidence of the victim\u2019s violent character to support a defendant\u2019s self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>defense claim that the victim was the first aggressor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, appellate courts in forty-five of the forty-eight State jurisdictions that have considered the issue have decided that some form of such evidence is properly admissible on the first aggressor issue, regardless whether the victim\u2019s violent character was known to the defendant at the time of the assault.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>States that have not considered the matter have both adopted versions of Federal Rules of Evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that would appear to permit the introduction of such evidence. Of the three State appellate courts that have declined to follow the modern trend, two did so over vigorous dissents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The basis of the overwhelming trend toward admitting some form of this evidence can be found in the view that evidence reflecting the victim\u2019s propensity for violence has substantial probative value and will help the jury identify the first aggressor when the circumstances of the altercation are in dispute. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>104 Ill. 2d 194, 200 (1984). See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burks, </em>470 F.2d 432, 434-435 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (evidence of deceased\u2019s violent character relevant and admissible where evidence \u201cinconsistent\u201d on identity of aggressor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201c[i]n order to corroborate\u201d defendant\u2019s account); <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>99 Ariz. 43, 46-47 (1965), quoting <em>Mendez </em>v. <em>State, </em>27 Ariz. 82, 84 (1924), (\u201cIt is the rule that where it is questionable as to which was the aggressor . . . the general reputation of the deceased as a dangerous, turbulent, and violent man may always be shown\u201d). \u201cEvidence probative of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence is highly relevant and admissible to show . . . that the victim was the aggressor in a case in which self-defense is raised.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Soto, 477 </em>A.2d 945, 949 (R.I. 1984). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greschner, </em>647 F.2d 740, 741 (7th Cir. 1981) (\u201c \u2018violent character\u2019 line of proof is relevant to the defendant\u2019s theory of self-defense in that it makes his version that the victim attacked him \u2018more probable\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Dellay, </em>687 A.2d 435, 438 n.1 (R.I. 1996) (noting scientific evidence for and against \u201cpremise for character evidence is that personality may be defined in terms of traits that produce consistent forms of behavior\u201d); <em>Lolley </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Ga. 605, 609-610 (1989) (Weltner, J., concurring), quoting <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>State, </em>234 Ga. 827, 830 (1975) (\u201cIt is more probable that a person will act in accordance with his character [disposition] than that he will act contrary to it\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>57 F.3d 847, 853 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1029 (1995) (whether victim was man with history and reputation for violence makes it \u201cmore likely that his behavior on the night of the [incident] was violent \u2014 which supports the defendant\u2019s defense. . . \u2014 than it would be if [the victim] were peaceable\u201d). In the words of Professor Wigmore, \u201cWhen the issue of self-defense is made in a trial for homicide, and thus a controversy arises <em>whether the deceased was the aggressor, </em>one\u2019s persuasion will be more or less affected by the character of the deceased; it may throw much light on the probabilities of the deceased\u2019s action.\u201d 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 63, at 467 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">There can be no doubt that at least some of the proffered evidence in this case was relevant to Adjutant\u2019s self-defense claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whether Whiting was a violent man, prone to aggression when intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, \u201cthrows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>light\u201d on the crucial question at the heart of Adjutant\u2019s self-defense claim \u2014 who attacked first in the final moments before the fatal stabbing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>414 Mass. 343, 356, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 815 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palladino, </em>346 Mass. 720, 726 (1964). The evidence, if admitted, would have supported the inference that Whiting, with a history of violent and aggressive behavior while intoxicated, probably acted in conformity with that history by attacking Adjutant, and that the defendant\u2019s story of self-defense was truthful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 113-114 (1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The Commonwealth argues that juries invariably will be distracted by information about the victim\u2019s unrelated prior violence. We disagree. This court has previously approved the admission of evidence of a victim\u2019s history of violence, when known to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 736 n.1 (1986). If juries are capable of receiving such evidence for the limited purpose of evaluating the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s apprehension, they are capable of weighing similar evidence relevant to the first aggressor issue. While we acknowledge that there is a possibility that juries may misunderstand the purpose for which the evidence is offered, and agree that they should be specifically instructed on that point, the greater danger here is prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case. We share the preference of the Supreme Court of Illinois that the jury should have as complete a picture of the (often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fatal) altercation as possible before deciding on the defendant\u2019s guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201c[T]he evidence of what happened here, as is often the case where self-defense is raised, is both incomplete and conflicting. Everything happened in an instant .... The witnesses could hardly analyze the scene in any great detail, or remember and describe it with precision. They could only form quick impressions. To decide what really occurred the jury needed all the available facts, including evidence of [the victim\u2019s prior violence]. We hold that when the theory of self-defense is raised, the victim\u2019s aggressive and violent character is relevant to show who was the aggressor, and the defendant may show it by appropriate evidence, regardless of when he learned of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>104 Ill. 2d 194, 200 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Moreover, admission of evidence showing the victim\u2019s prior violent acts on the first aggressor issue reflects the principle that \u201cin criminal cases there is to be greater latitude in admitting exculpatory evidence than in determining whether prejudicial potentialities in proof offered to show guilt should result in its exclusion.\u201d <em>Matter of Robert S., 52 </em>N.Y.2d 1046, 1053 (1981) (Fuchsberg, J., dissenting), citing 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 194 (3d ed. 1940) (criticizing New York rule excluding victim\u2019s specific acts of violence to show propensity).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the victim\u2019s propensity for violence is in question . . . the danger of prejudice to the defendant lies in refusing to admit such evidence.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch, supra </em>at 201. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>236 Iowa 429, 443 (1945) (\u201cThe admission of this testimony was especially important to the [defendant], and for that reason its rejection was especially prejudicial to him. For if the homicide was justifiable because [the defendant] struck in self-defense, no crime was committed\u201d). In this case, the judge\u2019s exclusion of evidence of Whiting\u2019s prior acts of violence kept from the jury relevant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>potentially exculpatory information about the probability that Whiting attacked Adjutant first in their final altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Notwithstanding our usual hesitation to allow the admission of character evidence to prove conduct, see P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Evidence \u00a7 4.4.1, at 130 (7th ed. 1999),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we are persuaded that some form of evidence tending to show the victim\u2019s violent character should be admissible for the limited purpose of supporting the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim that the victim was the first aggressor. We now turn to the separate question of the permissible form of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The defendant urges the court to allow the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>evidence both of the victim\u2019s violent reputation and of his specific violent acts. The Commonwealth argues that if the court permits character evidence to be admitted, it should be limited to specific acts of violence committed by the victim. All other State jurisdictions that admit character evidence in these circumstances admit reputation evidence. Some of these States also admit evidence of specific violent acts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The arguments against admitting specific violent acts include (1) the danger of ascribing character traits to a victim with proof of isolated incidents, (2) the worry that jurors will be invited to acquit the defendant on the improper ground that the victim deserved to die, (3) the potential for wasting time trying collateral questions surrounding the victim\u2019s past conduct, (4) the unfair difficulty of rebuttal by the prosecution, and (5) the strategic imbalance that flows from the inability of prosecutors to introduce similar evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts. See <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Ga. 402, 409 (1991) (Benham, J., concurring specially); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>State, </em>234 Ga. 827, 829 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacoby, </em>260 N.W.2d 828, 838 (Iowa 1977); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>565 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tenn. 1978). See also Note, A New Understanding of Specific Act Evidence in Homicide Cases Where the Accused Claims Self-Defense: Striking the Proper Balance Between Competing Policy Goals, 32 Ind. L. Rev. 1437, 1447-1448 (1999). Many courts that follow the Federal Rules of Evidence rely on the Federal Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>advisory committee\u2019s note\u2019s succinct rationale for exclusion: \u201cOf the three methods of proving character [reputation, opinion, and specific instances of conduct,] evidence of specific instances of conduct is the most convincing. At the same time it possesses the greatest capacity to arouse prejudice, to confuse, to surprise, and to consume time.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, Fed. R. Evid. 405, 56 F.R.D. 183, 222 (1972). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>230 F.3d 300, 308 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1176 (2001); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>57 F.3d 847, 855 n.16 (9th Cir. 1995); <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>State, </em>78 P.3d 890, 901 (Nev. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">While we acknowledge the validity of these concerns, we disagree that they require an unbending rule excluding all of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence when relevant to the identity of the first aggressor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This court rejected similar arguments in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 736-737 (1986), and approved the admission of such evidence when relevant to the defendant\u2019s reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Testimony about the victim\u2019s prior acts of violence can be convincing and reliable evidence of the victim\u2019s propensity for violence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 113-114 (1978); <em>Lolley </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Ga. 605, 608-610 (1989) (Weltner, J., concurring); <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>104 Ill. 2d 194, 201-202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>(1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>485 Pa. 475, 478-479 (1979). Such evidence becomes relevant to the first aggressor issue when the prior acts of violence demonstrate a propensity for initiating violence. \u201cSuch instances may be very significant; their number can be controlled by the trial court\u2019s discretion; and the prohibitory considerations applicable to an accused\u2019s character . . . have here little or no force.\u201d 1A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 63.1, at 1382 (Tillers rev. ed. 1983). See Annot., 1 A.L.R.3d 571, 601 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In general, \u201c[Relevant evidence is admissible unless unduly prejudicial, and, \u2018[i]n weighing the probative value of evidence against any prejudicial effect it might have on a jury, we afford trial judges great latitude and discretion ....\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>442 Mass. 135, 144 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sicari, </em>434 Mass. 732, 752 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1142 (2002). When the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts to show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive, the trial judge must weigh the acts\u2019 probative value and the potential for prejudice to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, <em>777, </em>cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999). Similarly, when the prosecution seeks to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony with his prior convictions, the trial judge has discretion to admit those convictions, so long as they are noncumulative and probative of the defendant\u2019s truthfulness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 869 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We are persuaded that the sound discretion of trial judges to exclude marginally relevant or grossly prejudicial evidence can prevent the undue exploration of collateral issues. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 114; <em>State </em>v. <em>Baca, </em>114 N.M. 668, 673 (1992). It is for the trial judge to evaluate the proffered evidence\u2019s probative value and admit so much of that evidence as is noncumulative and relevant to the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>39 Cal. 3d 576, 587 (1985) (upholding judge\u2019s discretionary exclusion of specific acts when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cof little if any probative value\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Basque, </em>66 Haw. 510, 515 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baca, supra </em>(notwithstanding rule allowing admission of victim\u2019s specific acts of violence, \u201ctrial court could very well have excluded the evidence based on its relative lack of probative value\u201d). In addition, through their instructions, trial judges should mitigate the dangers of prejudice and confusion inherent in introducing evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence by delineating the precise purpose for which the evidence is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">For these reasons, where the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute and the victim has a history of violence, we hold that the trial judge has the discretion to admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">With respect to the usefulness of reputation evidence in the context of establishing who was the first aggressor, we are presently of a different view. While such evidence may be quite probative in evaluating a defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind, and the reasonableness of the actions thereby taken to defend himself, it is far less reliable in the present context. Reputation evidence is often \u201copinion in disguise.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, Fed. R. Evid. 405, 56 F.R.D. 183, 222 (1972). We do not allow the admission of the private opinions of individual witnesses as character evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 626, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 843 (1970). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>352 Mass. 263, 269, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 872 (1967) (defendant prohibited from introducing character evidence of his peacefulness in form of private opinions). Reputations or opinions are often formed based on rumor or other unreliable hearsay sources, without any personal knowledge on the part of the person holding that opinion. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, Fed. R. Evid. 405, <em>supra, </em>quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>7 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1986 (describing reputation evidence as \u201csecondhand, irresponsible product of multiplied guesses and gossip\u201d). In this case, had Adjutant offered the testimony of Whiting\u2019s neighbors that Whiting was known to be a violent man, without the corroborating details of the victim\u2019s specific acts, such evidence would have been little more than a few neighbors\u2019 accumulated opinions. Juries should have the ability to draw their own inferences in assessing the bearing of the victim\u2019s prior violent conduct on the probability that he was the first aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Jurisdictions that exclude the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence and admit reputation evidence make that choice because reputation evidence is filtered, general in nature, with less potential to inflame or sidetrack the proceedings than evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts \u2014 in essence, because such evidence is less \u201cconvincing\u201d and thus less controversial. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, Fed. R. Evid. 405, <em>supra </em>(\u201cWhen character is used circumstantially and hence occupies a lesser status in the case, proof may be only by reputation and opinion\u201d); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 186, at 650 (5th ed. 1999) (\u201cAs one moves from the specific to the general in this fashion, the pungency and persuasiveness of the evidence declines ... .\u201d). Given our rationale for allowing the admission of prior acts of violent conduct initiated by the victim, we favor the admission of concrete and relevant evidence of specific acts over more general evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence. Evidence of specific acts also lends itself more readily to the necessary weighing of probative value against prejudicial effect in the factual context of particular cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">While constrained by the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion, the defendant\u2019s ability to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior history as a violent aggressor should also be matched with safeguards for prosecutors. See, e.g., 1A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 63, at 1369-1373 (Tillers rev. ed. 1983); <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Ga. 402, 407-408 (1991). A defendant who intends to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence to support a claim that the victim was the first aggressor must provide notice to the court and the Commonwealth of such intent and of the specific evidence he intends to offer. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>notice must come sufficiently prior to trial to permit the Commonwealth to investigate and prepare a rebuttal. The prosecutor, in turn, must provide notice to the court and the defendant of whatever rebuttal evidence he or she intends to offer at trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Applying these rules to the proceedings in this case could have led to the introduction of some of the proffered evidence of Whiting\u2019s prior acts of violence. \u201cNonconstitutional errors, preserved or resurrected below, are reviewed according to a nonprejudicial error standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998). We cannot say that the judge\u2019s exclusion of the evidence was nonprejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Flebotte, 417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). \u201cThe essential question is whether the [erroneously admitted evidence] had, or might have had, an effect on the jury and whether [it] contributed to or might have contributed to the verdicts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 549 (1990). Here, the proffered evidence went directly to the heart of the case\u2019s central dispute \u2014 whether Whiting was the initial aggressor in his final altercation with Adjutant. Given the probative value of the excluded evidence, it may have been enough to create reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Although the judge might properly have excluded the evidence within her discretion after weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect, we do not speculate as to what the judge would have done had she recognized her discretion. \u201cWhere the record shows that the judge has failed to exercise discretion, there exists an error of law requiring reversal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass. 52, 57 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>This opinion adopts a new common-law rule of evidence.

In one of the instances, Whiting, while on cocaine, allegedly chased after his neighbor \u201clike a raging bull\u201d when confronted about vandalizing the common yard. In another, he allegedly threatened two neighbors with a butcher knife. And in the third, he allegedly threw boiling water on a friend with whom he was arguing.

The dealer returned later with another mom, both wearing masks and carrying a baseball bat and a pipe. They entered Whiting\u2019s apartment and assaulted him, demanding his money. Whiting responded by attacking them with a crowbar, refusing to back down despite being completely outmatched. The assailants seized the money and left Whiting near death. Whiting eventually filed a police report and gave grand jury testimony, detailing the combat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Adjutant was indicted for murder in the second degree.

For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose. . . .

Despite the applicability of this principle to evidence reflecting the character of defendants, it does not apply with the same force to evidence of a victim\u2019s character, as the victim is not on trial.

Other States with versions of the Federal Rules of Evidence have crafted a compromise rule allowing evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts only in the form of convictions.

The court today holds that a \u201cvictim\u2019s prior violent conduct may be probative in determining whether the victim was the first aggressor where a claim of self-defense has been asserted and the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 650. In particular, the court creates a new rule of evidence in which prior acts of violence \u201creasonably alleged to have [been] initiated\u201d by a victim, and unknown to a defendant, may be admitted to establish a victim\u2019s tendency toward violence. <em>Id. </em>Because I believe that past acts of violence by a victim, unknown to a defendant, do little to help a jury resolve the issue whether a <em>defendant </em>was the first aggressor and have no place in our consideration of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">It has long been the rule in the Commonwealth that \u201cevidence of a person\u2019s character is not admissible to prove that [that person] acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion.\u201d P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.1, at 130 (7th ed. 1999) (Liacos). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 529-530 (2003). Consistent with this guiding principle, we allow juries to consider evidence of a victim\u2019s prior acts of violence or reputation for violence, provided that the defendant knew about such acts or reputation at the time of the altercation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 733-734 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Mass. 496, 502 (1974). This \u201cknown\u201d evidence bears directly on the controversy being tried \u2014 it is nonpropensity evidence that speaks to a defendant\u2019s reasonable belief at the time of the alleged crime. Today\u2019s decision represents a fundamental break from this limitation on character evidence by allowing a defendant to present evidence that has <em>no direct connection to the case at hand </em>and is relevant to nothing but a victim\u2019s general tendency toward violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the court largely avoids the use of the term \u201ccharacter evidence,\u201d the evidence to be admitted after today is precisely that: evidence of a person\u2019s prior acts used to show his or her propensity to commit such acts. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986) (character evidence is \u201cevidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, [introduced] for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">As an initial matter, I am troubled by the premise underlying the court\u2019s decision: that a victim\u2019s violent character (as evidenced through prior violent acts) is sufficiently probative of his or her action on a particular occasion to justify its admission. See <em>ante </em>at 658-660. Although authorities have acknowledged that character evidence may be probative of a person\u2019s behavior, see, e.g., Liacos, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.4.1, at 131; 1A J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 57, at 1180-1181, 1211, 1366-1367 (Tillers rev. ed. 1983), I believe we should be hesitant to admit such evidence in the manner proposed by the court today. That \u201c[t]he relevance threshold for the admission of evidence is low,\u201d see <em>ante </em>at 657 n.11, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>442 Mass. 135, 144 (2004), does not satisfy our doctrine regarding the admissibility of character evidence. Our traditional rule prohibiting the admission of prior act evidence to prove a person\u2019s character, while primarily motivated by our concern regarding prejudice, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>also been rooted in our belief that prior acts may not be adequately probative of a person\u2019s action on any particular occasion. See Liacos, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.4.1, at 131, 1A J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 54.1, at 1150; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 473 (1947). And the widely acknowledged concern over the risk of prejudice attendant to the admission of character evidence necessarily arises from, and is connected to, its questionable value. How many fights must a person initiate before being considered a \u201cviolent\u201d person? One? Ten? Does the person who tends to pick fights as a young adult necessarily grow to be a fifty year old initial aggressor?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A guiding principle of our legal system is that we try cases and controversies, not people or their characters. Because we understand that good people sometimes do bad things, that bad people do not always do bad things, and that circumstances greatly influence behavior, it follows that, with certain well-defined exceptions, a person\u2019s prior actions, no matter how vile, should not be considered in judging their action at any other particular time. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, supra </em>(\u201cIt does not follow that, because the defendant committed a similar offence on another occasion, he committed the crime for which he is being tried. . . . [I]t is not fair that a defendant in the course of a trial should be called upon to defend himself against accusations not set forth in the indictment\u201d). See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 188 (1990) (evidence that plaintiff had once consumed \u201ca beer\u201d while at work irrelevant to prove plaintiff consumed beer on day of accident). See also <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>State, </em>234 Ga. 827, 829 (1975) (\u201cA single act may have been exceptional, unusual, and not characteristic and thus a specific act does not necessarily establish one\u2019s general character . . .\u201d). Precisely because a person\u2019s prior actions can be misleading and inaccurate predictors of future behavior, we have long held that it is unfair to judge a person based on past transgressions. See 1A J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 55.1, at 1160 (\u201cit cannot be argued, \u2018Because A did an act X last year, therefore he probably did the act X as now charged.\u2019 Human action being infinitely varied, there is no adequate probative connection between the two. A may do the act once and may never do it again: and not only may he not do it again, but it is in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>degree probable that he will do it again. The conceivable contingencies that may intervene are too numerous\u201d). For these reasons, I have considerable misgivings about adopting the view that character evidence is adequately relevant where such a view seems inconsistent with our long-held judicial philosophy against condemning people on the basis of past behavior. I believe we should adhere faithfully to this basic philosophy and remain committed to considering the crime charged and the facts of the case at hand, not the character or prior acts of the victim or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Putting aside my doubts about the relevancy of the prior act evidence, I reject the idea that, in weighing the dubious probative value of such evidence against the risk of prejudice, we ought to adopt such evidence against one party and not the other. Although some scholars take the position that character evidence about victims, as opposed to defendants, poses few risks, see 1A J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 63.1, at 1382, I believe our well-settled rejection of character evidence should be applied with equal force to both defendants and victims. Prior acts of violence, possibly occurring years earlier and involving different parties, are no more probative or less damaging because they are committed by a victim rather than a defendant. If we accept, as we have historically, that a defendant\u2019s prior behavior is insufficiently predictive of her actions years later to outweigh the potential for prejudice, it follows that a victim\u2019s prior acts are also inappropriate for consideration. Conversely, if character evidence is, as the court proclaims today, highly relevant as to victims, it must be similarly so for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The court limits this newly admissible type of character evidence to prior violent acts <em>initiated </em>by a victim. See <em>ante </em>at 650. This does little to resolve the underlying deficiency of this type of character evidence. I do not believe that a single past act in which a victim was the aggressor is probative on the first aggressor issue. If the act must have been initiated by the victim to be relevant, why must it not involve similar circumstances to be meaningful? Why not the use of the same weapon, for example? Even accepting, arguendo, the court\u2019s premise that prior acts of violence are sufficiently relevant to outweigh any risk of prejudice, a victim would have had to engage in a pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tern or series of unprovoked attacks for the evidence to be adequately probative. I also disagree with the premise that prior bad act evidence in this context is somehow appropriate because it is being used to prove the \u201cidentity\u201d of the first aggressor. See <em>id. </em>Evidence that is probative of identity is generally that evidence that distinguishes a person\u2019s behavior from others because of its uniqueness or distinctiveness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 530-531 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>417 Mass. 830, 836 (1994). In contrast, the evidence to be admitted today need not indicate any modus operandi or reveal any signature style of behavior by the victim. It is not suggestive of identity, but rather allegedly indicates that one of the two parties \u2014 the victim \u2014 is the violent \u201ctype.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Even if we assume that such prior acts are sufficiently probative of future behavior, today\u2019s rule would be fair only if victims were equally able to explore defendants\u2019 violent histories. Instead of creating an even-handed approach, the court today constructs a one-sided rule that is prejudicial to victims. In cases involving two parties with violent pasts (not uncommon in murders and assaults), defendants may now introduce evidence of the victims\u2019 violent histories, while the Commonwealth will remain powerless to introduce similar evidence concerning defendants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). The court asserts that today\u2019s ruling will provide juries with \u201cas complete a picture of the (often fatal) altercation as possible.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 658-659. But by constructing a lopsided rule that permits consideration of only one side of the story, the decision does little to paint a \u201ccomplete\u201d picture for the jury and much to promote a biased view of the parties. And what of a victim\u2019s propensity toward peacefulness? Will prosecutors be able to rebut damaging character evidence with more favorable character evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Hoping to neutralize this imbalance, the court notes (one would presume favorably) that Fed. R. Evid. 404(a)(1) now allows the Commonwealth to respond to victim character evidence with evidence of a defendant\u2019s violent character. See <em>ante </em>at 666 n.19. Admittedly, the Federal approach, if adopted by the Commonwealth, would resolve the imbalance cited above. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>However, the court today does not adopt this more equitable Federal approach. Even if the court or the Legislature were eventually to adopt the Federal approach, this \u201csolution\u201d to the unfairness problem would be more troublesome than the court\u2019s decision today. The Federal approach, while equitable, would greatly diminish our traditional evidentiary protections that prevent defendants from being \u201creconvicted\u201d of their prior acts. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>406 Mass. 501, 505 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 562-564 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, supra. </em>I believe today\u2019s decision, by creating a gross imbalance and necessitating some sort of \u201cfix,\u201d sets us on precisely this dangerous course toward the erosion of long-held evidentiary safeguards for defendants. Given this court\u2019s valid concern for defendants\u2019 rights, see <em>ante </em>at 662, I would reject the court\u2019s new rule in favor of our well-balanced traditional approach of excluding most character evidence concerning both victims and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Today\u2019s decision will have other undesirable consequences. First, the admission of character evidence against victims will unduly prejudice juries against victims with violent pasts. See Liacos, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.4.1, at 131 (rule against use of character evidence for propensity purposes premised on \u201chigh risk that such evidence will have a prejudicial impact on the jury and will result in a decision motivated by something other than the particular facts of the incident before the court\u201d). Our new rule unreasonably invites the fact finder to evaluate the relative worth of a deceased victim without logical basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the court acknowledges, \u201c[t]he deep tendency of human nature to punish not because [the defendant] is guilty this time but because he is a bad man and may as well be condemned now that he is caught is a tendency that cannot fail to operate with any jury, in or out of court.\u201d 1A J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 57, at 1185. While such prejudice raises due process concerns when applied to a defendant, we should be no more willing to allow its applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion to a victim. If we find it unacceptable to imprison people for their prior bad acts, how is it any more acceptable to punish people for their prior bad acts by sanctioning their deaths?</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Second, today\u2019s ruling will result in jury distraction and confusion, contribute to judicial delay, and increase litigation costs for the Commonwealth and the defense. Fact finders considering this newly permitted character evidence will be asked to wade through multiple incidents of violence (perhaps having to weigh conflicting evidence concerning several such incidents) before turning to the basis of the prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 736 (1986) (\u201cNegative information about the victim may divert the jury from focusing on their basic task by causing them ... to consider the victim\u2019s character and worth . . .\u201d); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>996 F.2d 1481, 1483-1484 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1120 (1994), quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, 39 </em>N.Y.2d 543, 551 (1976) (New York\u2019s rule against allowing evidence of victim\u2019s prior violent actions serves legitimate interest of \u201cpreventing \u2018undue diversion to collateral matters\u2019 \u201d by jury); <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 552 (\u201cprogress of a criminal trial may become stalled by evidentiary conflicts over matters of tangential relevance, thereby impeding the expeditious administration of justice\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is sometimes difficult for juries to develop a complete and accurate picture of the circumstances before them. It will no doubt be even more difficult for juries to assess comprehensively the circumstances attending myriad prior incidents of violence involving victims, about which they will have far less information.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The court acknowledges some of these concerns in passing but concludes they do not \u201crequire an unbending rule excluding all of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence when relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>identity of the first aggressor.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 662. The court\u2019s contention that we currently employ an \u201cunbending rule\u201d is erroneous. Prior to today\u2019s ruling, defendants could introduce a range of evidence of a victim\u2019s past conduct in support of a self-defense claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>418 Mass. 1, 5-7 (1994) (evidence of specific recent violent acts by victim directed at defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, supra </em>at 735-737 (victim\u2019s violent acts directed at third parties but known to defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496, 502 (1974) (victim\u2019s reputation for violence known to defendant). Defendants have even been permitted, in limited circumstances, to introduce some evidence of victims\u2019 prior acts even though they were unknown to these defendants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 589 (1945) (evidence of threats against defendant, \u201ceven though the threat was unknown to the defendant\u201d). Moreover, it is generally recognized that prior acts, regardless whether defendant knew them, may be introduced not as evidence of bad character, but to show common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, supra </em>at 562-563. I believe these existing evidentiary rules provide a defendant with ample opportunity to examine a victim\u2019s past, particularly given the questionable value of character evidence and the unfairness of today\u2019s new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The primary reason of the court for adopting this new rule of evidence is that it wishes to follow the \u201coverwhelming trend\u201d of other jurisdictions toward admitting character evidence of the victim. See <em>ante </em>at 654-657. Yet while purporting to adopt the modem \u201ctrend\u201d and its rationale, the court adopts an approach that differs significantly from that trend, rendering its primary rationale unpersuasive. The trend in other jurisdictions, with which obviously I disagree, is to admit testimony of the victim\u2019s <em>reputation </em>as proof relevant to who may have been the first aggressor, regardless of whether that reputation was known to the defendant at the time of the incident in question. See <em>ante </em>at 654-655 &amp; n.8, and cases cited. However, the court does not follow this trend. Rather, it adopts a novel approach of excluding reputation evidence offered for the purpose of proving the first aggressor, but allowing the admission of evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>specific acts of violence initiated by the victim, unknown to the defendant, to demonstrate the victim\u2019s propensity for violence. See <em>ante </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The court cites forty-five jurisdictions that have held <em>\u201csome form </em>of [victim character] evidence is properly admissible on the first aggressor issue (emphasis added).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 655. However, of these forty-five jurisdictions, none has taken the approach crafted by the court today (admission of specific act evidence, unknown to the defendant, to prove first aggression by the victim). To the contrary, the majority of jurisdictions cited by the court that have considered the issue of victim character evidence do <em>not </em>permit the use of specific act evidence unknown to the defendant to prove who was the first aggressor, but instead permit only reputation or opinion evidence to show a victim\u2019s violent character.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, many of those States that do allow some form of specific act evidence to demonstrate a victim\u2019s propensity for violence expressly exclude direct evidence of specific acts and only permit inquiry into specific acts on cross-examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Several other jurisdictions cited by the court as embracing victim character evidence limit specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>act evidence to prior convictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even the few jurisdictions that allow a broader range of specific act evidence to be admitted for propensity purposes tend also to permit reputation or opinion evidence concerning the victim that was unknown to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> None takes the novel approach adopted by the court today of limiting such victim character evidence to those specific acts of violence initiated by the victim and unknown to the defendant. See <em>ante </em>at 664-665.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The court thus cites no authority for adopting its approach of admitting \u201cconcrete and relevant evidence of specific acts [of violence initiated by a victim but not] more general evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ante at 665. The court in fact acknowledges that the \u201cdominant interpretation\u201d in other jurisdictions is not the one it adopts today, but rather one that <em>excludes </em>specific acts of violence by victims when those acts are unknown to the defendant. See <em>ante </em>at 661 n.15. See, e.g., <em>Allen </em>v. <em>State, </em>945 P.2d 1233, 1240-1241 (Alaska Ct. App. 1997), and cases cited (prohibiting specific act evidence of victim\u2019s violent character and limiting proof to reputation and opinion evidence, and noting courts construing Federal Rules of Evidence and State courts construing their counterparts to Federal rules have consistently reached same conclusion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacoby, </em>260 N.W.2d 828, 838 (Iowa 1977) (adopting \u201cmajority\u201d rule that homicide victim\u2019s violent character may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>established by proof of specific acts).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I could have been persuaded of the need for today\u2019s new rule of evidence if provided with a convincing reason for adopting it. The distinguishable law of other jurisdictions is not sufficiently convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The court attempts to rein in its new rule through judicial discretion. See <em>ante </em>at 663 (\u201csound discretion of trial judges to exclude marginally relevant or grossly prejudicial evidence can prevent the undue exploration of collateral issues\u201d). However, the court\u2019s hope that judges will exercise their discretion to exclude specific act evidence after today\u2019s sea change in our rules of evidence is unrealistic. Judges are no longer able to rule the evidence per se inadmissible, theoretically leaving open for \u201cdiscretion\u201d the issues of relevancy and probative value versus prejudice. But the court has already made these determinations as well for judges, in effect leaving little discretion to be exercised by judges who do not wish to contradict this court\u2019s holdings. For the court has concluded that this specific act evidence is relevant, <em>ante </em>at 657, has \u201csubstantial probative value,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 656, and that the risk of prejudice to the defendant is the \u201cgreater danger,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 658. While the court\u2019s reliance on judicial discretion sounds reasonable, it offers little more than a false hope. On the rare occasions when trial judges risk reversal in order to exclude specific act evidence, the inadequate guidance provided to judges by the court today, see <em>ante </em>at 662-664, is certain to lead to inconsistent application of the new rule, protracted proceedings, and lengthy appeals. Because our deferential standards of review require us to uphold judges\u2019 evidentiary decisions absent abuses of discretion, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>442 Mass. 135 (2004), our case law will soon reflect the uncertainty and inconsistency of the case-by-case assessments encouraged by the court today.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Contrary to the court\u2019s intentions, today\u2019s endorsement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>character evidence will not foster more accurate jury findings; nor will it enhance justice for victims or defendants. Because I believe we should affirm our existing law that evidence of a victim\u2019s violent character is only admissible if the defendant knew of that violent character at the time of the alleged crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 291 (2000), I would affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Although today\u2019s rule applies <em>only </em>where \u201cthe identity of the first aggressor is in dispute,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 664, it would not be surprising if, after today, we find an increasing number of trials where defendants assert such disputes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The court downplays the vast differences between the \u201cknown\u201d evidence currently admitted under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733 (1986), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496 (1974), and the character evidence of which the court now approves. See <em>ante </em>at 654, 662-663. The former type of evidence helps a jury to consider whether a defendant reasonably feared for his or her life during the incident in question. The latter invites a jury to consider, \u201cWas the victim the sort of person who might have been a first aggressor?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Presumably aware of these risks, the court encourages judges to \u201cmitigate the dangers of prejudice and confusion inherent in introducing evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence by delineating the precise purpose for which the evidence is offered.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 664. I do not believe limiting instructions will be adequate on this subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In a recent decision, we determined that a third-party suspect\u2019s history of sexual aggression was relevant to a theory that he, rather than the defendant, may have assaulted and killed the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, ante </em>60, 66-70 (2004). The evidence deemed relevant in the <em>Conkey </em>case is wholly distinct from the evidence at issue here. There the evidence was probative of whether the defendant, as opposed to someone else, committed the crime. The trial judge had excluded the evidence on relevance grounds. In reversing, we found the evidence was relevant and did not change any evidentiary rules to do so. Here, the court must change our common-law rules of evidence in order to admit the evidence in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\">See, e.g., <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>State, </em>262 Ala. 236, 240 (1955); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>State, </em>945 P.2d 1233, 1240 (Alaska Ct.
