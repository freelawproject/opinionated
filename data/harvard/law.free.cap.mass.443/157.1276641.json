L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, or are his benefits limited by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, which provides among other things for specific compensation for \u201can injury involving brain damage?\u201d The question arises in this case as a consequence of debilitating brain damage suffered by Stanley E. Walker due to a work-related injury. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Walker is entitled to benefits under \u00a7 36 because \u00a7 36A applies only in those cases where the employee has died before fully collecting his benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u00a7 36. We reverse the decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (board), which reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Background. </em>The facts found by an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents and summarized by the board are, in the words of the board, \u201cstraightforward, undisputed and tragic.\u201d On August 7, 1995, Walker received cardiopulmonary resuscitation for approximately forty-five minutes after suffering cardiac arrest with brain injury, having developed severe dehydration while at work. Walker now suffers from anoxic encephalopathy, a condition involving the death of brain tissue and resultant permanent losses of function. The judge found that Walker is in a \u2018\u2018near-vegetative state\u201d and is \u201cunable to do anything without the assistance of another person.\u201d According to his physician, Walker \u201chas, inter alia, lost cognitive function, has paranoid ideation, has difficulty eating, has no social graces, has difficulty sleeping, requires assistance walking, and he has a loss of depth perception.\u201d There is no chance Walker will recover his lost functions, and his injury likely will cause further functional deterioration. We now summarize the legal proceedings that have brought this case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Walker sought compensation from the town of Barnstable (town), a self-insurer, for the total loss of the use of both arms, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (1) <em>(e), </em>total loss of the use of both legs, pursuant to \u00a7 36 (1) <em>(g), </em>and bodily disfigurement, pursuant to \u00a7 36 (1) <em>(k).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The town accepted Walker\u2019s injury as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>work related, but disputed his claim for such compensation. On August 3, 1998, an administrative judge held a conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A. The next day, the judge issued an order denying the claim. Walker appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On April 20, 1999, the judge held a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 11B. On January 14, 2000, the judge concluded that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, rather than G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, applied to Walker because his losses were due to brain damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge, however, denied Walker benefits under \u00a7 36A, concluding that he had \u201cfailed to meet his burden of providing proof that he has reached maximum medical improvement for which he would be entitled to benefits under \u00a7 36A.\u201d Walker appealed from the decision to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On July 30, 2002, the board affirmed the judge\u2019s decision to the effect that the brain damage provision of \u00a7 36A applied to Walker, but reversed the ruling that Walker had not reached maximum medical improvement. The board ordered benefits be paid to Walker to the maximum amount provided in \u00a7 36A. Walker appealed from the decision to a single justice of the Appeals Court and requested an award of full benefits for his specific injuries under \u00a7 36. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2); Rule 2:04 of the Rules of the Appeals Court (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>On April 21, 2004, the single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision. Walker appealed to a panel of the Appeals Court. We granted Walker\u2019s application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). We scrutinize the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), in accordance with the standards expressed in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (a)-(d), (f), and (g), to determine whether \u201cthe board correctly decided that the administrative judge had properly applied [\u00a7 36A].\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 &amp; n.4 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The town argues that the plain language of \u00a7 36A compels the result it seeks. But, as the board itself explained, it did \u201cnot consider that the brain damage provision, given its placement in \u00a7 36A, is subject to a simple, plain meaning reading.\u201d Resolution of this case therefore turns on our construction of \u00a7 36A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In the context of claims for workers\u2019 compensation this court has said that the act is to be interpreted \u201cso far as may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995), quoting <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). Enacted as a \u201chumanitarian measure\u201d in response to strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers, we give this remedial statute a \u201cbroad interpretation.\u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., supra. </em>While the Legislature has from time to time made substantial revisions to the original workers\u2019 compensation legislation enacted in 1911, a \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d of the act remains appropriate because the act\u2019s exclusivity provision eliminates the employee\u2019s common-law remedies against his employer. See <em>id. </em>at 75 (\u201cpurpose of the workers\u2019 compensation act was to ensure that employees, who give up their rights to sue employers in tort, will recover lost wages and lost earnings capacity and medical expenses resulting from work-related injuries, regardless of fault or forseeability\u201d). See <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136, 139 (1914). Against this general background we turn to examine the legislative history of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A.</p>\n<p id=\"A6N\">Two provisions of the act are at issue in this case. The first, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, sets forth the amount of compensation for \u201cspecific injuries\u201d to which an employee is entitled for work-related injuries. Specifically, compensation is paid to an employee who sustains permanent loss of sight, hearing, arms, legs, or other bodily functions, or who has a permanent disfigurement. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>This compensation is in addition to any amount the employee or his dependents are entitled to receive under other sections of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The amount of the compensation depends on which bodily function or functions the employee has lost as a result of his injury, and is calculated as a specific multiple of the average weekly wage in Massachusetts for the date on which the employee was injured. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1g\">The second provision at issue here, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, identifies the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a lump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sum payment should the employee die before fully collecting his \u00a7 36 compensation payments. Section 36A limits payment to his survivors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> based on the type of injury and whether the employee lived for a sufficiently long period after being injured. We examine the intent, purpose, and history of these provisions to determine their proper application in this case. See <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">From the beginning of the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation system in 1911, an employee was entitled to compensation for specific work-related injuries under earlier versions of what is now \u00a7 36. See St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 11. The compensation to which an employee was entitled but had not fully collected at his death did not, however, inure to survivors. See, e.g., <em>Cherbury\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 397, 398-399 (1925); <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 13 (1914). That changed in 1947, when the Legislature added to \u00a7 36 a paragraph that, for the first time, provided for survival rights of compensation for specified injuries due but unpaid at the employee\u2019s death, and specified the beneficiaries entitled to such payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For reasons that are not clear from the legislative history, two years later the Legislature rewrote this paragraph, removed it from \u00a7 36 and placed it in a newly created \u00a7 36A with the marginal note of \u201c[l]ump sum payment to dependants in case of death.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>only substantive changes to the section as amended in 1947 broadened the group of defined beneficiaries entitled to receive unpaid compensation at the time of the employee\u2019s death and provided for payment in a lump sum. At its inception, therefore \u00a7 36A applied only to cases involving deceased employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There were no legislative changes to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, until 1981. See St. 1981, c. 572, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Walker argues, and the board does not contend otherwise, that the 1981 changes to \u00a7 36A were in reaction to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bagge\u2019s </em>Case, 369 Mass. 129 (1975), and the court\u2019s invitation in that case for legislative action to address disparities in compensation due to injured workers as a result of \u201carbitrary and illogical factors.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 137. That case concerned an employee who died within minutes of receiving work-related injuries that caused brain damage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court concluded that the employee\u2019s family was entitled to a lump-sum payment under \u00a7 36A for the employee\u2019s resulting losses of bodily function and disfigurement that qualified for \u00a7 36 benefits, noting that the \u201cLegislature has said nothing about the cause of death or the manner in which the specified injuries compensated for under \u00a7 36 are received.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>With the 1981 change, the Legislature addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>precisely these points by adding a new paragraph to \u00a7 36A, which limited compensation for specific injuries involving brain damage to a specified amount, twenty thousand dollars, but disallowed such compensation entirely in cases of \u201cinstantaneous death.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We have reviewed carefully the legislative history leading to this amendment. It is apparent to us that the Legislature intended such limitations to apply only in cases where an employee\u2019s work-related brain injuries had in fact resulted in death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>There is nothing in the legislative history that reveals a concern with a brain-damaged worker\u2019s progressive loss of function while assisted by \u201cmedical technology available that theoretically could keep someone alive for an indefinite amount of time simply by hooking them up to machines,\u201d as the town argues here. Indeed, the employee in <em>Bagge\u2019s Case, supra, </em>did not benefit from any advances in medical technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">As of 1981, \u00a7 36A continued to serve two purposes: it identified those survivors entitled to receive uncollected compensation for specific injuries on an employee\u2019s death, and it specified the amount of such compensation based on the type of injury and the amount of time between the occurrence of the injury and the employee\u2019s death. There matters stood until 1985, when the Legislature once again turned its attention to the complex problem of how to compensate injured employees fairly, while controlling the related costs to employers. See St. 1985, c. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Of the extensive legislative changes to the act enacted in 1985,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> only one is relevant to our inquiry. As in 1981, the 1985 amendments to \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A contained an increase in the amount of compensation for specific injuries, this time adding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>mechanism for future increases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Prior to 1985 both \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A had contained fixed dollar amounts to calculate the amount of compensation for specific injuries. The 1985 amendments modified both sections such that compensation under both was now calculated on the basis of the average weekly wage in the Commonwealth on the date of the injury, effectively introducing an automatic cost-of-living adjustment to such compensation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once again, the Legislature left intact the distinction between compensation payable to an employee who survives his injuries, as described in \u00a7 36, and the compensation payable to the employee\u2019s survivors on his death, described in \u00a7 36A. In short, as amended in 1985, \u00a7 36A remained consistent with its original legislative purpose: to identify those survivors entitled to receive uncollected compensation for specific injuries on an employee\u2019s death, and to specify the amount of such compensation based on the type of injury and the amount of time between the occurrence of the injury and the employee\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Legislation in 1991, driven by the escalating cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums, once again sought to overhaul the workers\u2019 compensation act. The amendments included two changes relevant to our inquiry. First, death benefits for specific injuries were no longer available to survivors in cases where an employee did not survive his injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for at least forty-five days.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 70.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Previously such compensation was not available to survivors only in cases of \u201cinstantaneous death.\u201d) Second, the 1991 amendments added to \u00a7 36 a provision requiring for the first time that an employee survive his injury for thirty days before qualifying for specific injuries compensation under that section. St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The board said it recognized \u201cthe strength\u201d and \u201cpersuasive[ness]\u201d of Walker\u2019s argument that \u00a7 36A\u2019s brain damage provision cap applies only in cases where the employee has died, and \u201cmight even have agreed with\u201d it. But, in reflecting on the 1991 changes to \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A, the board concluded that, because the noncompensatory periods contained in \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A were different (thirty days under \u00a7 36 and forty-five days under \u00a7 36A), the two were in \u201cconflict.\u201d That \u201cconflict\u201d it said, could only be resolved if \u201cthe cap on \u00a7 36 benefits in the \u00a7 36A brain damage provision applies to <em>both </em>living and deceased employees\u201d (emphasis added). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Different noncompensatory periods in \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A do not compel the conclusion that the \u00a7 36A brain damage provision must necessarily apply to living employees as well as those employees who are deceased. The 1991 amendments to \u00a7 36 provide that an employee must survive for a certain period, thirty days, before <em>an employee </em>is entitled to compensation for specific injuries, whether his injuries are due to brain damage or any other cause. The forty-five day noncompensation period in \u00a7 36A is directed to survivor beneficiaries of an employee who suffers from brain damage.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under that section, an employee must survive an injury involving brain damage for forty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>days before a <em>survivor </em>is entitled to uncollected compensation for specific injuries. Thus, an employee who suffers brain-related injuries may collect whatever compensation is available to him under \u00a7 36, provided he survives his injury for thirty days. If he dies between the thirtieth day and forty-fifth day of his injury, his survivors are entitled to no compensation whatsoever, i.e., if he dies within forty-five days of his injury there are no remaining uncollected \u201cbalances\u201d from \u00a7 36 due to his survivors under \u00a7 36A. Only if he dies after the forty-fifth day of his injury, will his survivors be entitled to any uncollected amounts of compensation for any injuries to which the employee had become entitled under \u00a7 36. Thus \u00a7 36A remains a death provision that serves its two original purposes: to identify those survivors entitled to receive uncollected compensation for specific injuries on an employee\u2019s death, and to specify the amount of such compensation based on the type of injury and the amount of time between the date of injury and the employee\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Whether one adopts the interpretation of the board, or the interpretation of Walker, the language of \u00a7 36A cannot be internally reconciled, or reconciled fully with \u00a7 36.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In these circumstances the purpose of the two sections as evidenced by the legislative history becomes determinative. Close analysis of the legislative history of the noncompensatory periods added in 1991 to both \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A leads us to our conclusion that \u00a7 36A applies only in cases where the employee dies. Although the over-all thrust of the 1991 legislation was to reduce the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance to employers, the discrepancy between the length of the noncompensatory periods under \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A arose from successive amendments to the proposed legislation that in fact favored employees. More importantly, and as we shall explain, the way in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>discrepancies arose makes it unlikely that the Legislature intended to enact a dramatic change to \u00a7 36A to the effect that it apply for the first time since its enactment in 1947 to employees who <em>survived </em>brain injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Throughout the 1991 legislative process, the noncompensatory periods proposed for both \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A were of the same duration. See, e.g., 1991 Senate Doc. Nos. 1741, 1745; 1991 House Doc. No. 6357. On December 11, 1991, during one of the last substantive debates on the proposed legislation, a member of the House of Representatives proposed an amendment to <em>benefit </em>employees by reducing the noncompensatory periods in both \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A from ninety to forty-five days. See 1991 House J. 1438. The House approved the amendment without discussion or debate. <em>Id. </em>Later in the same session, another Representative proposed a further amendment, again to <em>benefit </em>employees, this time shortening the noncompensatory period under \u00a7 36 to thirty days. See 1991 House J. 1440. The House approved this amendment, which gave rise to the discrepancy between \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 36A, without discussion or debate. <em>Id. </em>There is no suggestion that this minor amendment to \u00a7 36 was intended to effectuate a dramatic change in \u00a7 36A to the substantial detriment of a certain class of employees, namely those employees who survive but are severely disabled by brain injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On December 20, 1991, without further discussion or debate on \u00a7 36 or \u00a7 36A, the House enacted the bill containing the two different noncompensatory periods. See 1991 House Doc. No. 6410; 1991 House J. 2423. The board\u2019s conclusion that the 1991 amendment to \u00a7 36 necessarily requires that \u00a7 36A be interpreted to apply to living employees who suffer work-related injuries involving brain injury is counter to the intent, purpose, and history of \u00a7 36A. It also produces arbitrary and inequitable results. Under the board\u2019s reasoning, \u00a7 36 compensation for specific injuries is payable to any employee with permanent losses of bodily function such as those suffered by Walker, but if, and only if for example, those losses were caused by a spinal cord injury, rather than a brain injury. Benefits to an employee with precisely the same losses of bodily function caused by brain damage would be limited. Our analysis of the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>history of \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A reveals no suggestion that the Legislature intended to differentiate in such an arbitrary manner between classes of disabled, but living, employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In summary, the limitation on unpaid compensation for specific injuries involving brain injury contained in the second paragraph of \u00a7 36A is operative only on the death of the employee. Walker is entitled to receive compensation for specific injuries for his losses of bodily function and disfigurement under \u00a7 36. As Walker is the prevailing party, he is also entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs resulting from his appeal. See G.

See 1979 House Doc. No. 1316. Thereafter, different bills took different approaches. Some bills denied compensation to the employee\u2019s survivors unless the injured employee survived his work-related injury for a stated period. See, e.g., 1979 House Doc. No. 3852 (thirty days); 1979 Senate Doc. No. 135 (fifteen days); 1980 House Doc. No. 3326 (\u201cIn no event shall payments be made when there is instantaneous death\u201d). Other bills provided a lump-sum payment of benefits to survivors if the employee dies from a cause unrelated to the original injury. See, e.g., 1979 House Doc. No. 2874; 1980 House Doc. No. 1026. Some applied both types of restrictions. See, e.g., 1979 House Doc. No. 1316 (thirty days), 1980 House Doc. Nos. 3334, 3343 (same). Most of these bills implemented restrictions by rewriting the first sentence of \u00a7 36A; none placed the restrictions in \u00a7 36. See, e.g., 1979 House Doc. Nos. 1316, 2874; 1980 Senate Doc. No. 171. Several of the bills included the phrase \u201ccertain death cases\u201d in their titles. See 1979 House Doc. No. 1316; 1980 House Doc. Nos. 3334, 3343; 1981 House Doc. No. 467 (each entitled, \u201cAn Act relative to the payment of compensation for specified benefits in certain death cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The first bills specifically limiting benefits for deceased employees whose \u00a7 36 losses were due to brain damage were proposed in 1980. See 1980 House Doc. No. 3326; 1980 Senate Doc. No. 171. Each of these bills modified the first sentence of \u00a7 36A by adding a proviso, \u201cexcept that where any specified loss under [\u00a7 36] may be a result of an injury involving brain damage, then, to that extent, payments under this section shall be limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The Senate referred all of the 1980 bills cited above, together with others not relevant here, to the Committee on Commerce and Labor to sit during recess \u201cfor the purpose of making an investigation and study of the subject matter.\u201d See 1980 Senate Doc. No. 2102. This order was committed to the Committee on Ways and Means, which reported a bill following the recess. See 1980 Senate Doc. No. 2241. This was the first bill that limited payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>in cases involving brain damage or instantaneous death by adding a second paragraph to \u00a7 36A rather than by modifying the first paragraph. It also rewrote \u00a7 36. Although the Legislature took no further action in 1980 on this bill, the Senate introduced a similar one the next year. See 1981 Senate Doc. No. 186. The Legislature enacted the bill with minor amendment. See note 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Many of the titles of these bills refer specifically to compensation in \u201cdeath\u201d cases. Most bills proposed placing the restriction in the first sentence of \u00a7 36A, a sentence that begins, \u201cIn the event that an injured employee who has become entitled to compensation under [\u00a7 36] dies . . . .\u201d The final sentence of \u00a7 36A, inserted by St. 1981, c. 572, \u00a7 4, expressly applies only in cases of \u201cinstantaneous death.\u201d If the Legislature had intended to restrict benefits to surviving employees, it could have added the restriction to \u00a7 36, which was contemporaneously amended in other respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The House referred seventy-nine individual documents concerning the act to the Committee on Commerce and Labor, which reported back a single bill. See 1985 House J. 627. The bill was rewritten by the Committee on Ways and Means and was enacted with minor amendments. 1985 Senate Doc. No. 2596. St. 1985. c. 572.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The only one of the bill\u2019s seventy sections that affected \u00a7 36A replaced the first sentence of the second paragraph with the following: \u201cWhere any specified loss, losses or disfigurement under [\u00a7 36] is a result of an injury involving brain damage, payment in total under <em>that </em>section for the sum of such loss, losses or disfigurement resulting from said brain damage <em>shall not exceed an amount equal to the average weekly wage in the commonwealth at the date of injury multiplied by one hundred and five\u201d </em>(emphasis added). St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 47. The twenty thousand dollar limit contained in the 1981 version of \u00a7 36A was thereby replaced by an escalating maximum based on the average weekly wage at the time of injury multiplied by 105 weeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The 1985 legislation made another, seemingly minor, change to \u00a7 36A: it replaced the phrase \u201cpayment in total under <em>this </em>section,\u201d i.e., \u00a7 36A, with \u201cpayment in total under <em>that </em>section,\u201d i.e., \u00a7 36 (emphases added). We think this change intended to clarify that any \u00a7 36 payments made to the employee while alive would count toward the new 105 week limit under \u00a7 36A. Previously, \u00a7 36A could have been interpreted to provide that payments made to the employee before his death did not count toward the $20,000 limit under \u00a7 36A. This change apparently originated in the Committee on Commerce and Labor during its study of the many proposed amendments, none of which included any changes to \u00a7 36A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The 1991 amendment revised the final sentence of \u00a7 36A to provide: \u201cIn no event shall payments be made under this section to any employee where the death of such employee occurs within forty-five days of the injury.\u201d St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The Lieutenant Governor explained that the rising cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance was \u201cthe major impediment to economic growth in the state.\u201d State House News Service Press Release, Dec. 23, 1991.
