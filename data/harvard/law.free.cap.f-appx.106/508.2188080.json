Bridges petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging a prison disciplinary conviction for refusing to submit to a random drug test. Bridges alleged in his petition that he was denied his right to an impartial decisionmaker. The district court denied the petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">A correctional officer issued a conduct report charging Bridges with refusing to submit a urine sample, which the officer was collecting for the purpose of a random drug test. On a chain-of-custody form accompanying the urine sample, the officer noted that Bridges \u201crefused\u201d to provide a specimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">After receiving notice of the disciplinary charge for refusing to take the urine test, Bridges presented his defense to the Conduct Adjustment Board. At the hearing, he admitted orally and in a written statement that he refused a request to undergo a urine test, but argued that the request was voluntary and not mandatory. The Board found Bridges guilty based on the conduct report, the chain-of-custody form, a statement from Superintendent Davis denying any personal knowledge, and Bridges\u2019s written and oral comments. As a result of the disciplinary conviction, Bridges lost 90 days\u2019 earned credit time. He then exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>On appeal Bridges renews his contention that he was denied his right to an impartial decisionmaker because the Board \u201cfail[ed] to read or consider Bridges[\u2019s] testimony during the hearing.\u201d As further evidence of his decisionmaker\u2019s bias, Bridges also argues generally that the Board\u2019s disciplinary report miseharacter-ized and \u201calter[ed]\u201d his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Bridges, however, misunderstands the concept of bias. A claim of bias involves a decisionmaker who has \u201ca direct personal or otherwise substantial involvement ... in the circumstances underlying the charge\u201d or \u201ccircumstances <em>other than </em>those arising directly out of the disciplinary process that may raise doubt about the integrity of the hearing procedure and the impartiality of its participants.\u201d <em>Redding v. Fairman, 717 </em>F.2d 1105, 1113 (7th Cir. 1983) (internal citations and quotations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see Whitford v. Boglino, </em>63 F.3d 527, 534 (7th Cir.1995). And we presume Board members to be honest and impartial. <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). Here Bridges alleged no inappropriate involvement or other circumstances impugning the impartiality of any Board member. Nor has he substantiated his assertion that the Board failed to consider his testimony. The Board\u2019s report summarized Bridges\u2019s written statements, and though this summary may contain minor variations, the differences are slight and not suggestive of bias.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-5\">. The Board summarized Bridges's comments as stating, \"is it a refusal if a staff writer asking if I was going to provide a sample. He didn\u2019t have a cup in his hand. I responded, no.\u201d As relevant here, Bridges\u2019s written statement was, \"Krueper gave no direct order to perform such act. He asked me if I was going to provide.\u201d Although the Board\u2019s summary differs linguistically from Bridges's statement, the summary captures the essence of Bridges\u2019s underlying defense \u2014 that he refused a voluntary request, not a mandatory directive. Further, Bridges does not dispute the state's contention that the Board\u2019s summary and Bridges\u2019 written statement contain minor differences because the Board was also summarizing Bridges\u2019s oral testimony at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
