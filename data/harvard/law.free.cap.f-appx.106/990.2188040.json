The District Court was clearly correct in determining that the dispute between the parties constitutes a \u201cminor dispute\u201d under the Railway Labor Act and is subject to mandatory arbitration. Because the reasons supporting this conclusion have been fully articulated by the District Court, the issuance of a detailed opinion by this Court is unnecessary. Finally, in affirming the District Court\u2019s decision, this court expresses no opinion on the merits of the Appellant\u2019s case as it proceeds to arbitration. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
