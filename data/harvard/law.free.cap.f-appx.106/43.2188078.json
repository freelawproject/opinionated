Alapan seeks review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming a decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) denying Alapan\u2019s application for a deferred retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). <em>Alapan v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. SE0831030140-I-1 (May 23, 2003). Because Mr. Alapan\u2019s service does not satisfy the statutory requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">A Board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">To qualify for a CSRS annuity, an applicant must have completed at least five years of creditable civilian service, of which one of the last two years of service must be covered under the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(a)-(b) (2000). While most service is creditable, not all service is covered. <em>Rosete v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>48 F.3d 514, 516 (Fed.Cir.1995). Covered service only includes an appointment that is subject to the CSRA and for which an employee must deposit part of his or her pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Mr. Alapan argues that the Board\u2019s denial of an annuity was not in accordance with law. First, Mr. Alapan contends that he obtained CSRS coverage when he was promoted to the position of Power Plant Mechanic effective April 29, 1979, and remained covered until September 30, 1992, when he resigned. In support of his contention, Mr. Alapan relies on language contained in the SF-50 that effected his promotion. Second, Mr. Alapan also argues that the Navy must have given him a permanent appointment because his \u201ctenure group\u201d for reduction-in-force purposes was listed as \u201cI\u201d (permanent) beginning on June 27, 1976, when he received an indefinite appointment. As such, Mr. Alapan contends that he obtained competitive status and, consequently, that one of his last two years of service was covered under the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">As a general matter, we agree with the Board that the documents in Mr. Ala-pan\u2019s employment file do not demonstrate that he was subject to CSRA retirement provisions. Mr. Alapan served in temporary appointments between August 26, 1974, and June 26, 1976. Thereafter, he served in an indefinite appointment between June 27, 1976, and September 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>1992. The CSRS clearly excludes retirement coverage for these appointments. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(1), (13) (2004). Thus, the Board properly concluded that Mr. Alapan did not complete at least one year of covered service during the two-year period immediately preceding his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We particularly discount Mr. Alapan\u2019s argument that he obtained \u201ccompetitive status,\u201d and therefore coverage, with his promotion on April 29, 1979. The language in the SF-50 upon which Mr. Ala-pan relies \u2014 \u201c[s]election made under the Merit Promotion Plan\u201d \u2014 is not dispositive. In that same SF-50, item 28, \u201cPosition Occupied,\u201d contains the number 2, indicating that the position does not qualify for competitive status. In addition, that particular SF-50 indicates in Block 10 that Mr. Alapan\u2019s retirement coverage is \u201cNone.\u201d Thus, the Board had substantial evidence upon which to conclude that Mr. Alapan did not obtain competitive status with his April 29,1979, promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We also discount Mr. Alapan\u2019s arguments based on his tenure-group listing. In <em>R\u00f3sete, </em>this court remarked that tenure-group designations \u201ccould be circumstantial evidence that [the retiree] did not hold an indefinite appointment if [the retiree] was \u2018at any time subject to the CSRS and [the retiree\u2019s] personnel record was incomplete as to evidence.\u2019 \u201d 48 F.3d at 520 (quoting <em>Fredeluces v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>57 M.S.P.R. 598, 602 n. 4 (1993)). But it did not hold that tenure grouping alone determines eligibility for CSRA benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 519-20. Thus, the court also evaluated the other evidence, noting that the SF-50s indicated either \u201cnone,\u201d \u201cnot applicable,\u201d or \u201cother\u201d entries in the various retirement-related parts. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court sustained the Board\u2019s determination, concluding that this other evidence outweighed the tenure-group designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Here, similarly, the Board properly concluded Alapan is not entitled to CSRS annuity benefits. The SF-50 on June 27, 1976, shows that Mr. Alapan\u2019s appointment was \u201cindefinite,\u201d not permanent. In addition, as discussed above, the SF-50 from April 29, 1979, specifies that Mr. Alapan was in the excepted service. Finally, both of these SF-50s note, in Block 10, that Mr. Alapan\u2019s entitlement to retirement benefits is \u201cnone.\u201d Thus, as in <em>R\u00f3sete, </em>the SF-50s contained substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Mr. Alapan held an indefinite appointment, excluded from coverage, despite Mr. Alapan\u2019s placement in Tenure Group I. Accordingly, he is not entitled to retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We have considered Alapan\u2019s other arguments and find them without merit. In particular, we do not agree with Mr. Ala-pan\u2019s continuity-of-coverage argument; he neither demonstrated initial appointment to a covered position nor transference from a non-covered position to a covered position.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
