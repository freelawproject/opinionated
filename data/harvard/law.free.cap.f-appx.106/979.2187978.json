Neff contends that the district court erred in (1) holding that the state trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of a hearsay statement from the murder victim did not have an injurious effect on the fundamental fairness of Neffs trial; (2) concluding that the state trial court\u2019s accomplice instruction did not violate Neffs Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights; (3) ruling that the state trial court\u2019s exclusion of Neffs expert testimony on battered woman\u2019s syndrome did not deprive Neff of her right to present a defense; and (4) holding that the state trial court\u2019s admission of semi-nude and erotic photographs of Neff did not deny her a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Having heard oral argument and reviewed the record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that Neff failed to demonstrate that the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [fjederal law.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s opinion and order denying Neffs petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
