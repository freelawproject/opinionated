The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to uphold the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Medina\u2019s expert witness did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to compel witnesses. An accused \u201cdoes not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). In upholding the decision to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony, the California Court of Appeal relied on a standard rule of evidence allowing for the exclusion of unreliable expert testimony. <em>See People v. Ramos, </em>15 Cal.4th 1133, 1175, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 938 P.2d 950 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">2. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to uphold the jury instructions given in Medina\u2019s case was not contrary to clearly established federal law. Courts must consider a challenged instruction within the context of the other instructions and the entire record. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). The Court of Appeal properly applied a similar standard. <em>See People v. Frye, </em>18 Cal.4th 894, 957, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The decision to uphold the jury instructions also does not warrant relief under AEDPA\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong. The fact that the instruction for the affirmative defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d (CALJIC 4.43) preceded the instruction for \u201caccident\u201d (CALJIC 4.45) did not impermissibly place the burden on the defendant of proving that his assault of the victim was accidental. Other instructions informed the jury that the prosecution bore the burden of proving that an assault occurred (CALJIC 9.00), and that the prosecution bore the burden of proving Medina\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (CALJIC 2.90). As observed by the Court of Appeal, reading the \u201caccident\u201d instruction in conjunction with the other instructions negated any harm that might have been caused by the placement of the \u201caccident\u201d instruction. <em>See McGuire, </em>502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">3. Medina\u2019s challenge to the \u201cassault with a deadly weapon\u201d instruction (CALJIC 9.02) fails for the same reason. The fact that this instruction does not contain an \u201cintent to use force\u201d element does not warrant habeas relief. The logical inference is that the jury would have read the instruction for \u201cassault,\u201d which contains the required element, to determine whether Medina committed an \u201cassault with a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>See McGuire, </em>502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">4. The gravamen of Medina\u2019s challenge to the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction is that use of the term \u201cabiding conviction\u201d is unconstitutional absent coupling with a probability standard incorporating a high certainty of guilt. The Court of Appeal\u2019s rejection of Medina\u2019s claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>consistent with federal law holding that the term \u201cabiding conviction,\u201d standing alone, properly conveys the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 14-15, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994); <em>see also Lisenbee v. Henry, </em>166 F.3d 997, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>Ramirez v. Hatcher, </em>136 F.3d 1209, 1214 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">5. Medina\u2019s corollary challenge to the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction asserts that the instruction allowed conviction by a \u201csatisfactory showing\u201d of guilt rather than requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the instruction that guilt must be \u201csatisfactorily shown\u201d is necessarily informed by the other instructions requiring the jury to convict only if guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and if they felt an \u201cabiding conviction\u201d of Medina\u2019s guilt. <em>See McGuire, </em>502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">6. Medina has not made out any cognizable claims for ineffective assistance of counsel, or for judicial bias.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Medina claims that his counsel acted ineffectively by failing to object when the trial court advised Medina that proceeding to trial could result in a sentence nearly twice as long as the prosecution\u2019s offered plea bargain. However, the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the failure to object was a reasonable defense tactic was not contrary to federal law. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The Court of Appeal also ruled that the trial court\u2019s warning that any reference to Medina\u2019s brain injury during trial would result in a finding of contempt was not judicial bias. That holding was consistent with federal law recognizing the trial court\u2019s authority to manage the presentation of the case. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Similarly, the trial judge\u2019s admonitions to Medina for nonresponsive answers fell within his authority to manage the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 114 S.Ct. 1147 (recognizing that the trial court may admonish witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The Court of Appeal also reasonably concluded that the trial court\u2019s isolated reference to Ennion as a \u201cvictim\u201d reflected no judicial bias. <em>See Kaupp v. Texas, </em>538 U.S. 626, 628, 123 S.Ct. 1843, 155 L.Ed.2d 814 (2003) (per curiam) (referring to the corpse as that of the \u201cvictim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling that the trial court\u2019s reference to the jury note as reflecting the \u201cdumbing down of America\u201d was neutral as to Medina was not objectively unreasonable. <em>See Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding no constitutional violation when considering fairly significant judicial misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">The Court of Appeal did not explain its reasons for denying the remainder of Medina\u2019s ineffective assistance/judicial bias claims. Thus, we conduct an \u201cindependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>review\u201d of the record to determine whether the court\u2019s decision to deny relief is consistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>Pirtle v. Morgan, </em>313 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Outside of the presence of the jury, the judge remarked that \u201ctwo people [in the previous trial] apparently bought something. I don\u2019t know what it is yet ...\u201d The judge also required Medina to describe himself as \u201cdisabled\u201d rather than \u201cpermanently disabled\u201d as requested by counsel. Finally, the judge allegedly threw up his arms in disbelief, moved back his head, and rolled his eyes in a \u201cgesture of disbelief1\u2019 while Medina was testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Even if Medina\u2019s counsel should have objected to any or all of these occurrences, Medina has failed to make a showing of prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Duckett, </em>67 F.3d at 740-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">7. Medina claims entitlement to a federal evidentiary hearing pursuant to our decision in <em>Jones v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1002, 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1997). However, Medina\u2019s reliance on that case is unfounded, since it predates AEDPA. Instead, Medina\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Medina has not explained why he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under this standard, nor do we independently discern any basis for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. The California Court of Appeal denied relief on this ground but did not provide its rationale for doing so. Therefore, we conduct an \"independent review\u201d of the record to determine whether the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision warrants relief under AEDPA. <em>See Pirtle v. Morgan, </em>313 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. The California Court of Appeal held that Medina's claim of judicial bias was procedurally barred due to Medina's failure to interpose any contemporaneous objections. However, because Medina contended that his counsel acted ineffectively by failing to object, the Court of Appeal reached the merits of Medina's judicial bias claims through the filter of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, thereby rendering this claim reviewable on appeal. <em>See Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 801, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
