(\u201cStrauss\u201d) in Wasinger\u2019s suit against Strauss for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,633,510 (\u201cthe \u2019510 patent\u201d). Because we conclude that the district court erred in its claim construction, we <em>vacate </em>the judgment of non-infringement and <em>remand </em>for consideration of the issue of infringement under the correct claim construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-24\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-26\">Wasinger is the owner of the \u2019510 patent. He also is a co-inventor named on the patent. The \u2019510 patent is directed to a process for simultaneously desizing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>decolorizing a dyed fabric. Desizing and decolorizing are two critical steps in the manufacture of color-faded denim products, such as blue jeans. \u201cSizing\u201d is a chemical composition that protects yarn as it is woven. Sizing can include different kinds of starch, polyvinyl alcohol, other synthetic compositions, or combinations thereof. Because sizing can be a barrier to wet finishing processes, such as dying and bleaching, it is typically removed as a first step in wet processing. This process is called \u201cdesizing.\u201d The \u201cdecolorizing\u201d process, traditionally accomplished by oxidation or bleaching, results in color fading or partial removal of color from the dyed denim cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Independent claim 1 of the \u2019510 patent is the only claim at issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">1. A method for simultaneously de-sizing and decolorizing a dyed fabric or dyed garment having a sizing and a reducible dye which comprises treating said fabric or garment with an effective amount of reducing agent in an aqueous bath whereby the fabric or garment is both desized and decolor-ized prior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Wasinger originally alleged that certain finishing processes used by Strauss literally infringe independent claim 1 and several dependent claims of the \u2019510 patent. Strauss uses the accused processes to de-colorize, desize, and abrade denim garments to give them, as fashion dictates, a desired look and feel. The processes range from a \u201cbasic rinse finish,\u201d costing about $1.25 per pair of jeans to a complex finishing process, costing $65 per pair.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The district court conducted a <em>Mark-man </em>hearing to construe only the single disputed claim term, \u201cdesizing.\u201d In its summary judgment ruling, however, the court further modified its claim construction, adding an additional limitation to the \u2019510 patent as a whole. In the court\u2019s view, \u201c[pjlaintiff disclaimed coverage of multi-step processes while prosecuting the \u2019510 patent.\u201d As a consequence of this disclaimer, the district court concluded, \u201cthe \u2019510 patent is limited to single-step processes and cannot include multi-step processes.\u201d Based upon that construction, the court granted summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Strauss because \u201cin the accused processes desizing and decolonization are carried out in a seriatim, multi-step process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Wasinger now appeals to us. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo. See Gasser Chair Co. v. Infanti Chair Mfg. Corp., </em>60 F.3d 770, 773 (Fed.Cir.1995). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record indicates \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The determination of infringement is a two-step process. First, the court construes the claims at issue to correctly determine their scope. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir. 1998) (en banc). Claim construction is an issue of law which this court reviews <em>de novo. Id. </em>The second step in an infringement analysis is applying the correctly construed claims to the accused method; this is a factual determination. <em>Embrex, Inc. v. Serv. Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>216 F.3d 1343, 1348-49 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">On appeal, Wasinger challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that multi-step processes were disclaimed during prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the \u2019510 patent. Wasinger asserts that the district court\u2019s construction adds an entirely new limitation that is unsupported by the actual claim language. Additionally, Wasinger argues that the district court misinterpreted the prosecution history and that, when viewed in context, there was no disavowal of multi-step processes. For its part, Strauss contends that the district court properly relied on intrinsic evidence to conclude that Wasinger disclaimed mul-ti-step processes. According to Strauss, Wasinger\u2019s statements in the file history unambiguously limit the claims to a single operation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Claim 1 recites \u201ca method for simultaneously desizing and decolorizing a dyed fabric ... which comprises treating said fabric or garment with an effective amount of reducing agent in an aqueous bath .... \u201d \u2019510 patent, col. 6,11.1-5. The claim concludes with a \u201cwhereby clause,\u201d which requires the fabric to be \u201cboth desized and decolorized prior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col. 6,11. 5-7. Use of the open-ended transition \u201cwhich comprises\u201d indicates that there may be additional unclaimed steps in the method. <em>Scanner Techs. Corp. v. ICOS Vision Sys. Corp., N.V., </em>365 F.3d 1299, 1305 (Fed.Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe use of the transitional phrase \u2018comprising\u2019 ... indicates that the elements or steps following the transition may be supplemented by additional elements or steps and still fall within the scope of the claim.\u201d). The whereby clause signifies that there may be subsequent oxidation or bleaching steps that are not part of the claimed method. Therefore, on its face, claim 1 clearly contemplates the claimed method being performed as part of a multi-step finishing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The specification confirms that Wasinger contemplated multi-step processes. For example, after describing a preferred operation of the claimed method, the specification states \u201c[t]he garments or fabrics can then be further processed if desired.\u201d \u2019510 patent, col. 3, 11. 63-64. Similarly, the examples at the end of the written description also indicate that the inventor contemplated multi-step processes. The first example, after describing a particular washing sequence, teaches that \u201c[i]f an even lighter color is desired the process can be repeated for 10 minutes prior to rinsing since concurrent desizing is not necessary. The garments can be further decolorized by subjecting them to a standard bleaching operation or by treatment with ozone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col. 4, 1. 67\u2014 col. 5, 1. 5. In the third example, denim jeans that have already been enzymatically desized are subjected to the method of the claimed invention. <em>Id. </em>col. 5, 11. 22-25. The specification thus explicitly teaches that the claimed method may be performed as one step in a multi-step finishing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Neither do we find support for the single-step limitation in the prosecution history. The district court relied heavily on the prosecution history to support its single-step process limitation, stating that \u201c[pjlaintiff disclaimed coverage of multi-step processes while prosecuting the \u2019510 patent.\u201d The \u2019510 patent prosecution history consists of a reply to a first office action rejecting the claims and a reply after final rejection. Claim 1 is reproduced below, indicating the amendments made during prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">1. A method for simultaneously de-sizing and decolorizing a <em>dyed </em>fabric or <em>dyed </em>garment having a sizing and a reducible [coloring agent] <em>dye </em>which comprises treating said fabric or garment with an effective amount of reducing agent <em>in an aqueous bath </em>whereby the fabric or garment is both desized and decolorized <em>prior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Wasinger had to overcome an obviousness rejection based primarily on U.S. Patent No. 5,199,957 to Pascoe (\u201cPascoe\u201d). According to the examiner, \u201cthe method of removing sizing and dye from textiles by using a reducing agent is well known as shown by Pascoe.\u201d In his reply to the first office action rejection, Wasinger disputed the examiner\u2019s characterization of Pascoe, asserting that the dyed fabric in Pascoe is not treated with a reducing agent, and that \u201cPascoe operates at a high temperature and still requires the use of an oxidizing wash.\u201d To further distinguish Pascoe, Wasinger argued that \u201capplicants operate at a different time and place of the treatment process,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe usual practice for the garment processors ... is to enzymatically desize the garments and then decolorize or fade the dye with a bleaching agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Wasinger then described certain advantages of the claimed invention, such as allowing elimination of enzymatic removal of sizing and \u201cproviding a single operation for both desizing and color fading.\u201d After addressing other references besides Pas-coe, Wasinger summed up his position by stating, \u201c[T]he cited references all relate to the use of oxidizing agents and not reducing agents. None of the references teach simultaneously desizing and reducing the dye on the fabric.\u201d As part of this first response, Wasinger added the <em>\u201cdyed\u201d </em>limitations to the fabric and garment of claim 1; replaced the term \u201c[coloring agent]\u201d with <em>\u201cdye;\u201d </em>and added the <em>\u201cin an aqueous bath\u201d </em>limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The second office action was made by a different examiner, who essentially repeated the arguments made by the examiner in the first office action. The second examiner summarized Wasinger\u2019s position with respect to how the claimed invention overcame prior art problems, and with respect to how one of the asserted advantages of the invention was \u201cconsolidation of [a] multiple stage process into fewer stages.\u201d The second examiner found, however, that \u201cthe claims herein still permit oxidation to be a part of the process.\u201d The second examiner concluded that \u201c[i]t appears that there is indeed patentable subject matter in the application since the use of the reducing agents without oxidation agent follow-up shows some advantages and an advance in the state of the art. If the claims were amended to exclude the possibility of oxidation as part of the process claimed, the claims would be looked upon favorably.\u201d This second office action rejection was made final.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In Wasinger\u2019s response after final rejection, he amended claim 1 by adding the <em>\u201cprior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching\u201d </em>limitation. Wasinger thereby incorporated the second examiner\u2019s suggestion to \u201cexclude the possibility of oxidation as part of the process claimed.\u201d Was-inger then emphasized again that \u201c[t]he invention relates to the discovery that reducing agents can be utilized in lieu of oxidizing agents to discolorize dyed fabrics [and] garments so as to provide a fashion faded effect that is generally performed with harsh oxidizing agents.\u201d Wasinger again explained the advantages of the claimed invention and stated that \u201c[i]t is surprising that a reducing agent, which is the complete opposite to an oxidizing agent, can provide the same effects plus other benefits.\u201d Wasinger also stated that \u201cnone of the references teach simultaneously desizing and reducing the dye of the fabric.\u201d Wasinger received a Notice of Allowability as a result of the reply after final rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">A fair reading of the prosecution history indicates that Wasinger disclaimed oxidization and bleaching \u2014 traditional decolorizing methods \u2014 as part of the claimed method for simultaneously desizing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>decolorizing dyed fabrics. This is clear from the prosecution history and is supported by the language of the amendment made to claim 1. However, Wasinger did not disclaim or give up a multi-step process wherein the claimed method is but one step, of many, in what may be a complicated finishing process. What Wasinger gave up was oxidation as part of that one step. A potential infringer should not be able to perform the claimed method, yet avoid infringement merely by adding subsequent steps that further decolorize or desize the garments using traditional means such as bleaching, oxidation or mechanical steps. Wasinger\u2019s description of the advantages of the claimed method during prosecution \u2014 e.g., the ability to eliminate the use of harsh oxidizing agents\u2014 does not amount to a disclaimer of multi-step processes that do not take advantage of the advantages or benefits of the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In sum, we conclude that the district court\u2019s single-step process limitation is unsupported by the claim language and the written description, and we see no disclaimer of multi-step processes in the prosecution history. Because the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment of non-infringement was premised upon an incorrect construction of the \u2019510 patent, the order granting summary judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the district court for proceedings with respect to infringement based upon a claim construction that does not include the limitation of a single step process. <em>See Scanner, </em>365 F.3d at 1306.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b60-5\">DYK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5B\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The majority holds that claim 1 is limited only to the ordinary and customary meaning of \u201c[a] method for simultaneously desizing and decolorizing a dyed fabric or dyed garment ... prior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching,\u201d U.S. Patent No. 5,366,510 (the \u201c \u2019510 patent\u201d), col. 6,11. 1-7, and that Wasinger did not disclaim a mul-ti-step process including a subsequent oxidation step, despite the prosecution history to the contrary. Maj. Op., <em>ante </em>at 37-38. Because I think that the applicants\u2019 statements in the prosecution history, coupled with those of the examiner, rise to the level of a clear disclaimer of a process including a subsequent oxidation step, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u201cGenerally speaking, we indulge a \u2018heavy presumption\u2019 that a claim term carries its ordinary and customary meaning.\u201d <em>CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., </em>288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Johnson Worldwide Assocs., Inc. v. Zebco Corp., </em>175 F.3d 985, 989 (Fed.Cir.1999)). However, \u201ca claim term will not carry its ordinary meaning if the intrinsic evidence shows that the patentee ... expressly disclaimed subject matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1366-67. \u201cThe prosecution history limits the interpretation of claim terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution.\u201d <em>Southwall Techs., Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., </em>54 F.3d 1570, 1576 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 987, 116 S.Ct. 515, 133 L.Ed.2d 424 (1995). While I think that the district court went too far in holding that the applicants \u201cdisclaimed coverage of [all] multi-step processes while prosecuting the \u2019510 patent,\u201d <em>Wasinger v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>No. 01-CA-1056-EP, slip op. at 9 (W.D.Tex. Mar. 31, 2003), I agree with the core of the district court\u2019s holding that there was a disclaimer in the prosecution history of multi-step processes involving subsequent oxidation steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">During the prosecution of the \u2019510 patent, the examiner first rejected all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>applicants\u2019 claims as obvious over U.S. Patent No. 5,199,957 to William M. Pascoe (\u201cPascoe\u201d), in view of a dictionary and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,171,332, 5,118,322, and 4,231,890. The examiner found the claimed process to be obvious because, as claimed, \u201cthe technique may include a subsequent oxidizing agent treatment.\u201d (J.A. at 58.) In response, the applicants argued that, in the claimed process, \u201charsh oxidizing agents which degraded the fabric were not utilized,\u201d and they distinguished Pas-coe, stating that \u201cPascoe ... still requires the use of an oxidizing wash.\u201d (J.A. at 62.) The examiner then finalized the rejection, repeating that \u201cthe [claimed] technique may include a subsequent oxidizing agent treatment,\u201d and noting that the claims as amended \u201cstill permit oxidation to be a part of the process.\u201d (J.A. at 67, 69.) However, the examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">It appears that there is indeed patentable subject matter in the application since the use of the reducing agents <em>without oxidizing agent follow-up </em>shows some advantages and an advance in the state of the art. <em>If the claims were amended to exclude the possibility of oxidation as part of the process claimed, the claims would be looked upon favorably.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">(J.A. at 69 (emphases added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In response to the final rejection, the applicants made several amendments that they stated were \u201cas per the Examiner\u2019s suggestion.\u201d (J.A. at 72.) First, the applicants amended claims 1, 13, and 17 by adding the phrase \u201cprior to any subsequent oxidation or bleaching.\u201d (J.A. at 71-72.) The applicants stated that \u201c[t]his limitation specifically excludes the oxidation process from the claims and distinguishes the invention at issue from the cited refer-enees.\u201d (J.A. at 72.) Second, the applicants cancelled claims 9-11. Claim 9 claimed exactly what Wasinger now asserts (and what the majority now holds) that claim 1 encompasses: \u201cThe method of claim 1 wherein said fabric or garment is subsequently treated with an oxidizing agent.\u201d (J.A. at 54.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The applicants stated that they \u201ccancelled claims 9-11 because they spoke to the specific use of an oxidizing agent which the Examiner determined would read on the prior art.\u201d (J.A. at 72.) The applicants also stated: \u201cThe amended claims specifically <em>exclude the use of any oxidizing agents. </em>This limitation puts the claims in condition for allowance.\u201d (J.A. at 73 (emphasis added).) The examiner found the application, as amended, to be allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Based on this history, I would hold that Wasinger disclaimed a process involving a subsequent oxidation step.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">The majority may suggest that the disclaimer in the prosecution history is ineffective because it is not clear and unambiguous in light of the \u201cprior to\u201d language of claim 1, which, standing alone, seems to contemplate the use of \u201csubsequent oxidation\u201d steps. However, the disclaimer plainly overcomes this language in claim 1. Moreover, it appears that the applicants acted as their own lexicographers in using the \u201cprior to\u201d language. A \u201cclaim term will not receive its ordinary meaning if the patentee acted as his own lexicographer and clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim term in either the specification or prosecution history.\u201d <em>CCS Fitness, </em>288 F.3d at 1366; <em>see also, e.g., Golight, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>355 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>1327, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2004). In this case, the examiner clearly required that the claims \u201cexclude the possibility of oxidation as part of the process claimed\u201d and that the process be performed \u201cwithout oxidizing agent follow-up.\u201d (J.A. at 69.) In response to the examiner, the applicants amended the claims and asserted that the amendments were made \u201cas per the Examiner\u2019s suggestion,\u201d representing that the added claim language was crafted to satisfy the limitations imposed by the examiner. (J.A. at 72.) The applicants thus appear to have acted as their own lexicographers, defining the added language to \u201cexclude the possibility of oxidation as part of the process claimed.\u201d (J.A. at 69.) To hold otherwise is to give apparent sanction to an effort to mislead the Patent and Trademark Office by pretending that added claim language cures an examiner\u2019s rejection when, in fact, it was designed to have the very opposite effect. <em>See Pall Corp. v. PTI Techs. Inc., </em>259 F.3d 1383, 1393 (Fed.Cir.2001), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>535 U.S. 1109, 122 S.Ct. 2324, 153 L.Ed.2d 152 (2002) (\u201cThe public notice function of patents requires that a patentee be prevented from expressly stating during prosecution that the claims do not cover a particular device and then later suing for infringement by that same device.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"Agle\">The majority properly does not address the validity of its broad claim construction. During prosecution, the examiner stated that only \u201cthe use of the reducing agents without oxidizing agent follow-up\u201d was non-obvious over Pascoe in view of the other cited references, and he rejected as obvious claims that encompassed subsequent oxidation steps. (J.A. at 69.) While neither I nor the majority expresses a view with respect to whether the examiner was correct, I note that, on remand, the district court must consider whether claim 1 as construed is invalid because it is obvious. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">.
