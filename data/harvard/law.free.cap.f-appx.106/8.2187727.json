R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Plaintiff Eduardo Uriostegui appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Klinger Constructors Inc. on his claims of national origin discrimination and retaliation under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e through 20006-17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Uriostegui alleged that he was terminated on the basis of his national origin and that, in response to Mr. Uriostegui\u2019s discrimination complaint, Klinger retaliated by giving him bad employment references after his termination. On appeal, Mr. Uriostegui argues that the district court erred in finding that he failed to rebut Klinger\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination and that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies on his retaliation claim. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) as the district court. <em>See Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Having reviewed the briefs, the record, and the applicable law pursuant to the above-mentioned standard, we conclude that the district court correctly decided Mr. Uriostegui\u2019s national origin claim. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment in favor of Klinger on this Title VII claim for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its Memorandum Opinion of June 6, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">On the retaliation claim, Mr. Uriostegui failed to allege retaliation in his EEOC complaint and the district court found that Mr. Uriostegui\u2019s retaliation claim was not reasonably related to his discrimination claim. Mr. Uriostegui, therefore, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, which is a prerequisite to bringing suit in federal court. <em>See Davidson v. Am. Online, Inc., </em>337 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">The district court stated that Mr. Urios-tegui\u2019s retaliation claim was not reasonably related to his discrimination claim because \u201cthe act allegedly giving rise to the claim did not occur until after his original claim had been dismissed by the EEOC.\u201d Aplt. App. at 211. This statement is not factually accurate. The act allegedly giving rise to Mr. Uriostegui\u2019s retaliation claim occurred before the dismissal of the EEOC charge. Because there has been an intervening change in the law, however, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">Previously, a plaintiff could seek judicial relief on claims not listed in the original EEOC charge if the new claims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u201clike or reasonably related to the allegations of the EEOC charge ...\u201d <em>Martinez v. Potter, </em>347 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). This court explained in <em>Martinez, </em>however, that <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) abrogated this so-called \u201ccontinuing violation doctrine\u201d so that unex-hausted claims involving discrete employment actions are no longer viable. <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201ceach discrete incident of [discriminatory or retaliatory] treatment constitutes its own unlawful employment practice for which administrative remedies must be exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, Mr. Uriostegui\u2019s claim that Klinger retaliated against him by giving a bad employment reference after his termination is a discrete incident of retaliatory treatment, which required him to file a separate EEOC claim. Because Mr. Uriostegui failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Klinger on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-16\">. Mr. Uriostegui does not appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on his hostile work environment claim. See Aplt. Br. at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-17\">. The parties consented to proceed before a United States Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum Opinion is therefore the final order of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
