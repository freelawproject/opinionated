We need not do so here because the government was compelled at oral argument to concede that the adequacy of the warning in this case could not be shown. Therefore, we grant the petition for review with respect to the IJ\u2019s finding that Gor-ou\u2019s application was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">In rejecting Gorou\u2019s application, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination, which Gorou challenges here. We may only reject the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination if the \u201cevidence presented would <em>compel </em>a reasonable finder of fact to reach a contrary result.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the IJ supported his credibility determination with legitimate, specific, and cogent reasons, including Gorou\u2019s having told an entirely different story in Greece.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We thus have no reason to reject that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">The INS\u2019s use of the documented story in Greece as impeachment evidence did not violate due process. The evidence came in to impeach testimony that Gorou had just given. There is nothing to indicate that he was denied \u201ca full and fair hearing of his claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf, as required by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process in [removal] proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">Despite the adverse credibility finding against Gorou, the IJ was obliged to examine the documentary evidence in the record to determine if Gorou has a well-founded fear of persecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, Gorou\u2019s Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) claim should also have been analyzed with regard for the record\u2019s non-testimonial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">We grant the petition for review with respect to the finding that Gorou filed a frivolous application, and remand for further proceedings to determine whether, accepting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, Gorou has nevertheless demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution and eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\">. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4), (6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.3(c)(5); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1208.20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\">. <em>Singh-Kaur v.

I concur in the remainder of the memorandum disposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
