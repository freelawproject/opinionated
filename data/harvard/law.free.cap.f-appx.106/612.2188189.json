We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Hernandez-Flores\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Cartiche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-50 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The challenge to the decision on the merits fails because substantial evidence supports the determination that he failed to establish a cognizable ground for asylum. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2003). Hernandez-Flores\u2019s claim that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion is belied by his own testimony; he confirmed that the alleged guerrillas never accused him or his father of belonging to the national government and never imputed a political opinion upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Hernandez-Flores necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">We decline to address the merits of Hernandez-Flores\u2019s contentions regarding his eligibility for suspension of deportation under <em>Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.1999), because there is no evidence in the record that he applied for suspension during his deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> \u25a0j\u2019jjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
