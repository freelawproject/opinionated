We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ghobrial\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(2) (2002), because the record shows, and Ghobrial does not dispute, that the motion was filed on May 3, 2002, more than 90 days after the November 5, 2001 final order of deportation, and Ghobrial has failed to raise any equitable tolling arguments, <em>see Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir.2002), or adequately show changed circumstances in Egypt, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (formerly 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(3)(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">To the extent Ghobrial seeks review of the BIA\u2019s November 5, 2001 decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of deportation, we lack jurisdiction because the petition for review of that order, No. 01-71865, was dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">Ghobrial\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s af-firmance without opinion violates due process lacks merit because the BIA did not issue a summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">The clerk shall file Ghobrial\u2019s reply brief received on August 27, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">The clerk shall file Ghobrial\u2019s request to consider new evidence received on November 6, 2003. The request is denied. <em>See Gomez-Vigil v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (noting that the court is not permitted to consider evidence that is not part of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The court sua sponte changes the docket to reflect that John Ashcroft, Attorney General, is the proper respondent.
