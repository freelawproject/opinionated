State of New York, </em>No. 90 Civ. 6170, 2008 WL 178715(MBM) (S.D.N.Y. Apr.3, 2003); <em>Davis v. State of New York, </em>No. 90 Civ. 6170, 1991 WL 156351(MBM) (S.D.N.Y. Aug.6, 1991); see <em>also People v. Davis, </em>226 A.D.2d 125, 640 N.Y.S.2d 53 (1st Dep\u2019t) (affirming Davis\u2019s judgment of conviction of second-degree murder and denial of his motion for relief pursuant to N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 440.10), <em>leave to appeal den\u2019d, </em>88 N.Y.2d 1020, 651 N.Y.S.2d 19, 673 N.E.2d 1246 (1996). We assume familiarity with the pleadings and the history of proceedings, including the above court decisions as well as the denial of Davis\u2019s petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Davis v. Kelly, </em>No. 97 Civ. 1653(LMM), 2000 WL 1772794 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.30, 2000), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>316 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">The district court properly dismissed Davis\u2019s complaint pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486 \u2014 87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), see <em>also Amaker v. Weiner, </em>179 F.3d 48, 51\u201452 (2d Cir.1999) (applying <em>Heck </em>in dismissing plaintiffs \u00a7 1985 claim). Although Davis filed his complaint before <em>Heck </em>issued, the Supreme Court applied that decision to the parties before it and, thus, the holding \u201cmust be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review,\u201d including Davis\u2019s case. <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>accord Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (applying <em>Heck </em>to complaint filed on January 26, 1994, some five months before <em>Heck </em>was decided).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">Because the application of <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>alone would result in dismissal without prejudice, we note that the record is sufficiently developed for us to affirm on other grounds the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of many of Davis\u2019s claims. <em>Cf. Amaker v. Weiner, </em>179 F.3d at 52. Specifically, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the Eleventh Amendment bars Davis\u2019s claims against the State of New York, the New York State Unified Court System, and Crossen and Ralls in their official capacities. <em>See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>(1984); <em>Davis v. New York, </em>816 F.3d 93, 101\u201402 (2d Cir.2002). We also affirm dismissal, on the ground of absolute immunity, of Davis\u2019s claims against clerk Ralls in his personal capacity, Justice Collins, District Attorney Johnson, and Assistant District Attorney Greenfield. <em>See Bernard v. County of Suffolk, </em>356 F.3d 495, 504\u201405 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Tucker v. Outwater, </em>118 F.3d 930, 932\u201433 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Rodriguez v. Weprin, </em>116 F.3d 62, 66 (2d Cir. 1997). We further affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), of Davis\u2019s claims against Justice Roberts and Dr. Allen. <em>See generally Deleon v. Doe, </em>361 F.3d 93, 94 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Accordingly, because we find Davis\u2019s points on appeal uniformly without merit, the district court\u2019s orders dated August 6, 1991 and April 3, 2003 are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
