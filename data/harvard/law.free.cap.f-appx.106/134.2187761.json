In the first, a discrimination case under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791, the District Court concluded that Van Houten failed to establish that he was disabled. <em>Van Houten v. Gober, </em>98-CV-0270 (E.D. Pa. June 6, 2003). In the second, a retaliation case under the Act, the Court concluded that Van Houten failed to establish a nexus between any adverse action and his having filed EEO complaints. <em>Van Houten v. Principi </em>02-CV-2173 (E.D.Pa. July 30, 2003). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The parties are familiar with the underlying facts. As such, we will provide a brief summary of those facts at the outset, incorporating additional facts only as necessary to our discussion of the issues. In October 1993, Van Houten was hired as a First Notice of Death Clerk (level GS-3) by the VA in the Philadelphia Regional Office. Upon hiring, he informed the VA that he had carpal tunnel syndrome and a cervical condition and that the Veterans Administration had recently rated him 30% disabled. His position with the VA required him to type notifications of death, eight hours a day, five days a week. The constant typing exacerbated his carpal tunnel syndrome, causing burning in his arms and weakness in his shoulders but, according to Van Houten, he learned to \u201ctough[ ] it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">In October 1994, Van Houten was accepted to the Insurance Phone Specialist training program (level GS-5). He began an intensive, six month training program, expecting to be awarded an Insurance Phone Specialist position (level GS-7) after its completion. Prior to completing the program, however, Van Houten was removed from the training sessions, and on May 31, 1995, he was transferred to a Claims Clerk position (GS-5). According to Van Houten, he was singled out, harassed, unfairly scrutinized, and ultimately removed because of his disability. He claims that his supervisor, Karen Berent, frequently spoke to him in a loud tone and that she provided better assistance to other trainees, although he admits he was the only trainee provided various accommodations, including one-on-one instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the VA, he was transferred in response to an incident on May 11, 1995 involving \u201cinsubordination and a physical threat to a supervisor\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful conduct to other employees.\u201d According to Berent, however, Van Houten was asked to use his training manuals to look up information on dividends, when, in front of other students, he began banging the manuals and then stood up and loudly exclaimed that he would be damned if he was going to be humiliated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">On July 18, 1995, Van Houten filed an EEO complaint, alleging that he had been removed from the training sessions because of discrimination. On April 17,1996, he filed a second complaint in connection with his transfer, and in 1996 he filed a third complaint, alleging that the 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>complaint was processed improperly. The Agency dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In March 1998, Van Houten applied for a vacant Veterans Claims Examiner position (GS-7/9). His new supervisor, Jeffrey Branin, as required, submitted a Supervisory Appraisal of Employee Promotion form. Although it is clear that Branin knew about Van Houten\u2019s EEO complaints at the time he wrote the appraisal, this form required him to calculate numerical ratings by applying largely objective data to a grid matrix. Van Houten received a rating of 3 out of 5 in each area analyzed: (1) knowledge of VA life insurance rules, regulations and procedures; (2) ability to demonstrate interpersonal oral communication skills; (3) ability to communicate in writing; and (4) skill in analyzing data and making decisions. Based on this report, he was not one of the eleven individuals selected for an interview, of whom two were hired. On July 14, 1998, Van Houten filed another EEO complaint, alleging that Branin\u2019s mediocre evaluation was in retaliation for Van Houten\u2019s previous EEO complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In November 1998, the VA posted a notice of vacancy for a Veterans Claims Trainee/Examiner position (GS \u2014 5/7). Van Houten applied for one of seven openings and, again, Branin submitted a Supervisory Appraisal form. This time, Van Houten was selected for an interview,- but he did not receive an offer. On July 12, 2000, he amended his August 26, 1998 EEO complaint to include alleged discrimination by Branin with regard to this latest Supervisory Appraisal form. After a hearing, an ALJ issued a finding of no discrimination, which was adopted by the Agency. Around this time, Van Houten was promoted to Lead Claims Adjustment Technician (GS-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Av7\">A. <em>Discrimination Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"APc\">Under the Rehabilitation Act, an employer will be granted summary judgment if an employee is unable to establish at least a genuine issue of material fact as to \u201cone or more elements of his prima facie case.\u201d <em>Krouse v. American Sterilizer Co., </em>126 F.3d 494, 501 (3d Cir.1997). To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the Act, a plaintiff must set forth the following: 1) that he or she has a disability; 2) that he or she is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and 3) that he or she was nonetheless terminated or otherwise prevented from performing the job. <em>Gagliardo v. Connaught Laboratories, Inc., </em>311 F.3d 565, 568 (3d Cir. 2002). Disability is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">(1) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">(2) A record of such impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">(3) being regarded as having such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(g)(1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">Van Houten claims he was impermissibly removed from the Phone Specialist training program because of his disability. At issue is whether he adequately established that the VA regarded him as an individual with a disability, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [his] major life activities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A person can be \u201cregarded as having such an impairment\u201d in one of two ways, either: 1) his or her employer mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>takenly believes he or she has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or 2) his or her employer mistakenly believes that an actual nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). Here, the latter situation is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">There is no disagreement that carpal tunnel syndrome is an \u201cimpairment,\u201d and that the relevant \u201cmajor life activity\u201d is that of working, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(1). With respect to working, \u201c[t]he term substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1630.2(j). Our inquiry is thus whether Van Houten set forth facts from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the VA regarded his carpel tunnel syndrome as an impairment that \u201csignificantly restricted [his] ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j). We believe he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">To be sure, the VA knew that Van Houten had carpal tunnel syndrome, but, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Van Houten, the facts do not establish that the VA thought his impairment substantially limited his ability to work. He held the position of Claims Clerk for seven years and was promoted in 2000. Further, the position of Claims Clerk generally requires more typing than that of Insurance Phone Specialist. That the VA denied Van Houten a position because it considered him disabled, yet transferred him to a long-term position that would have been more difficult for a person with such a disability to perform, stretches the imagination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">B. <em>Retaliation Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">We turn now to Van Houten\u2019s retaliation claim. It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u201cbecause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or a hearing under [Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3a. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show the following: 1) that he or she engaged in protected activity; 2) that his or her employer took an adverse employment action against him or her; and 3) that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Weston v. Pennsylvania, </em>251 F.3d 420, 430 (3d Cir.2001). The District Court correctly found that Van Houten failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. At issue is whether Van Houten adequately set forth a causal connection between his complaints to the EEO and Branin\u2019s mediocre evaluation. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Van Houten relies primarily on the sequence of events. In <em>Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>120 F.3d 1286 (3d Cir.1997), we noted that \u201cour cases are seemingly split on the question whether the timing of the allegedly retaliatory conduct can, by itself, support a finding of causation.\u201d It appears that if timing alone is ever sufficient, that timing must be \u201cunusually suggestive.\u201d <em>See Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 280 (3d Cir.2000) (holding that temporal proximity alone will generally \u201cbe insufficient to establish the necessary causal connection when the temporal relationship is not \u2018unusually suggestive\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also, Clark County School District v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (holding that even \u201c[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer\u2019s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be Very close\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The time period between Van Houten\u2019s most recent EEO complaint (March 1997) and the first non-selection in June 1998 is more than 15 months. Even were we to measure as of October 10, 1997, the date Branin first manifested his knowledge of the EEO complaints (as evidenced in an email), the period of time is more than eight months. By itself, this sequence of events is not unusually suggestive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Van Houten has also failed to set forth any additional evidence of retaliation. He merely claims that he had \u201cdemonstrably better qualifications than all of the selections\u201d and that the above-referenced email sent by Branin demonstrates resentment towards his protected activities. Van Houten, however, provides no evidence that he was more qualified than applicants who received higher ratings, and Branin\u2019s email not only fails to show any animus but, to the contrary, evidences a lack of animus: \u201cwith workload currently being light at the cat level, [J]im\u2019s visits to the union office <em>aren\u2019t currently hurting our customers. \u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In sum, Van Houten failed to establish any causal connection between his protected activity and Branin\u2019s appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">For the foregoing reasons we will affirm both orders granting summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">. Upon starting the program, Van Houten informed management that he was impaired and needed certain accommodations. He was provided with a special chair for his back, one-on-one training, and additional time to input information into the computer. He was also permitted to wear wrist guards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"><em>. </em>Van Houten does not appeal the District Court\u2019s finding that he did not in fact have such an impairment. Nor has he ever asserted that he has a record of such an impairment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">. It should be noted that Van Houten does not allege that the second appraisal differs from the first. Under these facts, therefore, his EEO complaint regarding his first non-selection could not have motivated Branin to produce the second appraisal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
