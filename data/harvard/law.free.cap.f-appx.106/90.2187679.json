The district court ruled that a release signed by Clorofilla precluded his pursuit of the federal claims asserted and refused to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. We affirm for substantially the reasons articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">Clorofilla joined the New Castle Police Department (\u201cNCPD\u201d) in 1979. In 1995 he was injured in a car accident that he alleges left him disabled in February 2001, when he stopped working. Clorofilla had not yet returned from disability leave a year later, when he agreed to retire from the NCPD with full retirement benefits and the Department\u2019s promise to drop any charges then pending against him. Cloro-filla and his lawyer signed a release which \u201crelease[d] and discharged\u201d New Castle, the NCPD and all other defendants from any and all claims arising out of his employment, including, but not limited to claims he might have brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983 and the United States Constitution. For its part, the Town agreed that it would not raise Clorofilla\u2019s voluntary departure as a defense to any workers compensation claim then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">Three weeks after Clorofilla retired from the NCPD, the New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Board ordered the Department to continue making payments to Clorofilla at a \u201cpartial disability rate of $400 per week.\u201d In a move that Clorofilla claims breached the release, the Town petitioned the Board to suspend the payments on the ground of voluntary separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">Clorofilla filed the underlying civil-rights action alleging that New Castle petitioned the Board in \u201cretaliation\u201d for his having filed the workers compensation claim, as well as national-origin discrimination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>state-law breach of contract, and other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss an action on the pleadings. As the district court properly held, the release \u2014 which specifies \u00a7 1983 and the federal Constitution as sources of potential causes of action precluded by its terms \u2014 bars the underlying federal claims, all of which arise out of his employment with the NCPD. With respect to the remaining state-law claims, it is firmly settled that \u201c[w]hen all bases for federal jurisdiction have been eliminated from a case so that only pendent state claims remain, the federal court should ordinarily dismiss the state claims.\u201d <em>Baylis v. Marriott Corp., </em>843 F.2d 658, 665 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Clorofilla invokes (i) the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, <em>see Livingston v. Adirondack Beverage Co., </em>141 F.3d 434, 438 (2d Cir.1998); and (ii) the \u201cspecter of fraud in the inducement\u201d to evade the release, but his arguments are meritless. Clorofil-la and his attorney signed a release supported by ample consideration; the Town\u2019s alleged breach does not invalidate the release or Clorofilla\u2019s knowing and voluntary assent to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
