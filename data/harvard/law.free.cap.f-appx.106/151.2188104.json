In No. 08-1422, Aghdam, a native and citizen of Iran, seeks review of a decision of the immigration judge, affirmed without opinion by the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003). The decision denied Aghdam\u2019s request for cancellation of removal, as well as his application for asylum relief and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Aghdam first challenges the Board\u2019s use of summary affirmance procedures in reviewing his appeal. We have recently upheld a similar challenge where the Board has elected not to issue a separate opinion. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 282 (4th Cir.2004) (upholding the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure set forth at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(2003)). We find that reasoning applicable here, and conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Aghdam challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of such a determination, the alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Aghdam fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Aghdam next disputes the finding of the immigration judge that he failed to qualify for cancellation of removal because he did not establish that his removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to his mother, a lawful permanent resident of the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) (2000). Because the immigration judge\u2019s hardship determination is discretionary in nature, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (2000); <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In No. 03-2256, Aghdam challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider. This court\u2019s review of the denial of such motions is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir. 1999). We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Aghdam was ineligible for an adjustment of status, in view of his failure to timely depart. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review in these appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
