We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In March 1998, Performance Fiberglass &amp; Linings (\u201cPerformance\u201d) purchased a Commercial General Liability policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) from Pennsylvania National. The following month, Performance entered into a Master Work Agreement for Construction and Field Services (\u201cMWA\u201d) with Kerr-McGee. Under the MWA, Performance agreed to perform certain rubber lining and fiberglass work for Kerr-McGee at Kerr-McGee\u2019s electrolytic plant in Hamilton, Mississippi. The MWA contained a provision that required Performance to indemnify Kerr McGee \u201cfrom and against any and all losses, damages, bodily injuries ... directly or indirectly arising out of\u2019 Performance\u2019s work under the MWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Two of Performance\u2019s employees were seriously injured while they were relining a tank at Kerr-McGee\u2019s facility. These employees sued Kerr-McGee alleging that Kerr-McGee was liable for their injuries due to its negligence. Kerr-McGee demanded that Performance and its insurer, Pennsylvania National, defend and indemnify Kerr-McGee in these two lawsuits. When Performance and Pennsylvania National refused, Kerr-McGee and its insurers, Certain London, settled the two lawsuits brought by the injured employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">After the settlements, Certain London filed this declaratory judgment action against Performance and Pennsylvania National seeking indemnity from Performance and coverage under the Policy from Pennsylvania National for the costs associated with settling the two employees\u2019 lawsuits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a one-day bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of Pennsylvania National, concluding that because the indemnity provision in the MWA was invalid under Mississippi law it could not be an \u201cinsured contract\u201d under the Policy. Certain London timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">\u201cThe standard of review for bench trials is well-established: \u2018findings of fact are reviewed for clear error; legal issues <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d See Gebreyesus v. FC Schaffer &amp; Assoc\u2019s, Inc., </em>204 F.3d 639, 642 (5th Cir.2000)(quoting <em>F.D.I.C. v. McFarland, </em>33 F.3d 532, 536 (5th Cir.1994)). Questions of contract interpretation are legal issues and are reviewed <em>de novo. See Am. Totalisator Co., Inc. v. Fair Grounds Corp., </em>3 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">The parties agree that the MWA is a construction contract governed by Mississippi law, and that certain indemnity agreements in construction contracts are void under Mississippi law as against public policy. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 31-5-41 (2004). The parties also agree that Kerr-McGee was not a named insured under the Policy and that the Policy contains a contractual liability exclusion, which excludes from coverage any agreement or contract under which Performance \u201cassumes liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ty,\u201d for another party unless that agreement is an \u201cinsured contract.\u201d Thus, the parties agree that Certain London is only entitled to coverage under the Policy if Performance\u2019s agreement to indemnify Kerr-McGee in the MWA is an \u201cinsured contract\u201d under the Policy and if that indemnity agreement is valid under Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The Policy defines an \u201cinsured contract\u201d in relevant part as: \u201c[t]hat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to [Performance\u2019s] business ... under which [Performance] assumes the tort liability of another party.\u201d Tort liability is defined as \u201ca liability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract or agreement.\u201d Therefore, any provision in the MWA requiring Performance to indemnify Kerr-McGee is an \u201cinsured contract\u201d only if Performance is assuming Kerr-McGee\u2019s tort liability under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">But Certain London has not proven that Performance assumed any of Kerr-McGee\u2019s tort liability. First, Certain London has not established that Kerr-McGee would have any tort liability for Performance\u2019s negligence. In fact, Certain London admits in this case that Kerr-McGee had no liability for Performance\u2019s negligence and that it only settled the employees\u2019 lawsuits as a \u201cbusiness decision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqt-dedup-2\">Second, the only other tort liability besides its own liability that Performance could have assumed under the indemnity provision of the MWA that would also be an \u201cinsured contract\u201d under the Policy is tort liability arising from Kerr-McGee\u2019s own negligence. However, in a construction contract, \u201cevery covenant, promise and/or agreement contained therein to indemnify or hold harmless another person from that person\u2019s own negligence is void as against public policy\u201d under Mississippi law. <em>See </em>Miss.Code. Ann. 31-5-41 (2004); <em>Crosby v. Gen. Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>543 F.2d 1128 (5th Cir.1976). Therefore, there is no valid basis for establishing tort liability necessary to constitute an \u201cinsured contract\u201d under the Policy. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Pennsylvania National is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-11\">. Kerr-McGee was subsequently joined as a plaintiff, but both Kerr-McGee and Performance were dismissed as parties by the district court prior to trial and are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\">. Moreover, Performance and its employees were designated by the MWA as \"independent contractors.\u201d Because there is no vicarious liability under Mississippi law for the acts of independent contractors, <em>see Carr </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>212 Miss. 656, 55 So.2d 408 (1951), Kerr-McGee could not have any liability for Performance\u2019s negligent acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. In its reply brief, Certain London also argues that it is entitled to coverage under a second exception to the Policy\u2019s contractual liability exclusion. That exception would permit coverage for Performance\u2019s agreements to assume another's tort liability \u201c[t]hat the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement.\u201d However, this argument is waived because Certain London failed to raise it before the district court. <em>See For-bush v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>98 F.3d 817, 822 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
