Bryan contends that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by causing him to be detained without an indictment in 1978, following an \u201cabduction\u201d in Alabama, and that they falsified and destroyed documents in order to hold him indefinitely. He also seeks to assert a civil claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\u201cRICO\u201d) Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of a prison inmate\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999)). A district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint at any time it determines that the complaint is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201c \u2018an arguable basis in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-23\">The district court properly cited three grounds for dismissing Bryan\u2019s complaint. First, all but one of the named defendants, Buckley, were prosecutors who were entitled to absolute immunity for acts in their role as prosecutors. <em>See Brooks v. George </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>County, Miss., </em>84 F.3d 157, 168 (5th Cir. 1996). Second, Bryan\u2019s action is barred by the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his Fourth Amendment claims call into question the validity of his conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Finally, Bryan\u2019s allegations, almost all of which appear to concern in events in 1978, are barred by the applicable one-year Louisiana limitations statute for personal-injury actions. <em>See Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint as frivolous. <em>Taylor, </em>257 F.3d at 472. The court also did not abuse its discretion in declining to appoint counsel for Bryan. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Bryan\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
