R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b628-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">Min Xue, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002), we grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">Xue testified that he was persecuted by the Chinese Government for his sincere belief in Christianity. Xue was expelled from school at the age of fifteen because he \u201ctalked about the story of Jesus\u201d and encouraged students to follow him to church. A notice written on school stationary corroborates Xue\u2019s account, noting Xue\u2019s expulsion because of his promotion of \u201creligious ideas\u201d among his fellow classmates. Xue also testified that, in addition to his parents\u2019 numerous arrests on ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>count of their religious beliefs, he was arrested and beaten after he had attended church when he was seventeen or eighteen years old. The officials told his parents that he was being arrested because he was a Christian. Xue was only released after paying a fine. Despite his arrest, Xue remained enrolled at his church, often attending \u201cin secret.\u201d The church verified that he had been enrolled there continuously since 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The IJ found Xue\u2019s account of persecution not credible based on the IJ\u2019s observations regarding the substance of Xue\u2019s religious beliefs. These observations, however, appear to be based on conjecture and the IJ\u2019s subjective understanding of Christian tenets which \u201ccannot be substituted for objective and substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). Further, the IJ ignored Xue\u2019s explanations for the perceived discrepancies. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013-14 (9th Cir.1998). Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence and to the contrary, Xue\u2019s account is corroborated by documentary evidence, we deem Xue\u2019s testimony credible. <em>See Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Accordingly, we remand for a determination of whether Xue\u2019s testimony qualifies him for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
