We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners first challenge the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) finding that their asylum application is untimely. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Petitioners next dispute the IJ\u2019s finding that they failed to qualify for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that petitioners did not properly exhaust this claim because they failed to raise it in their motion for reconsideration. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-21\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
