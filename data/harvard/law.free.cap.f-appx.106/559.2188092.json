INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">Thirteen days after Espino-Roldan signed for an Order to Show Cause on September 2, 1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) sent a Notice of Hearing in Deportation Proceedings (\u201cNotice\u201d) to him at the same address, informing him of the time and location of his scheduled hearing on December 17, 1993. The Notice was returned as \u201cunclaimed\u201d after two delivery attempts by the United States Postal Service. At the December 17, 1993 hearing, Espino-Rol-dan did not appear and was ordered deported to Mexico <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">More than eight years later, Espino-Roldan filed a motion to reopen. He contends that because he did not receive the Notice, his motion to reopen is timely and the <em>in absentia </em>order of deportation was invalid pursuant to immigration law in effect at the time, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252b(a)(2), (c)(3) (repealed 1996). The Government argues that the motion to reopen was not timely because actual notice was not required and the INS satisfied the statutory notice requirement by sending the Notice to the proper address by certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-19\">In <em>Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429 (9th Cir.1997), we determined \u201cthat notice by certified mail sent to an alien\u2019s last known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>address can be sufficient under the Act, even if no one signed for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431 (adopting <em>In re Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27, 1995 WL 314388 (BIA 1995)). It is presumed under former \u00a7 1252b(a)(2) that certified mail delivery is proper absent strong evidence to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 432. \u201cThus, if [the alien] can establish that her mailing address has remain unchanged, that neither she nor a responsible party working or residing at that address refused service, and that there was nondelivery or improper delivery by the Postal Service, then she has rebutted the presumption of effective service.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Espino-Roldan has not established based on any evidence in the record \u201cthat neither [he] nor another responsible party ... refused service\u201d and \u201cthat there was nondelivery or improper delivery by the Postal Service.\u201d Because Espino-Roldan failed to rebut the presumption of effective service under <em>Arrieta, </em>the IJ did not err in denying Espino-Roldan\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
