His sole claim on appeal is that he is entitled to a downward departure pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1, notwithstanding the absence of a Government motion for such a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Having reviewed the record and considered the arguments of the parties, we conclude that, in the circumstances presented here, there was no error in the decision of the District Court to deny defendant\u2019s application for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. A district court\u2019s review of a Government\u2019s decision to not file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is necessarily limited to questions of constitutionality and bad faith, <em>see Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), neither of which is present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
