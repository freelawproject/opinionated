Petitioners are natives and citizens of Albania who entered the United States on November 1, 2000. On March 12, 2001, the INS issued notices alleging that Petitioners were removable as aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Petitioners conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture. On June 5, 2001, an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Petitioners\u2019 application. Petitioners filed an appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. On October 4, 2002, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Petitioners subsequently filed the instant petition for review. For the reasons set forth below, their petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-23\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-24\">Paloke Tanazi (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201clead Petitioner\u201d) and his family have been persecuted by the communists in Albania since 1945. In 1976, Petitioner and other family members were put into an internment camp for ten years. After his release in 1986, Petitioner performed agricultural work. In 1989, Petitioner became involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>in politics and the democratic movement against communism. Petitioner held local offices on behalf of the Albanian Democratic Party and attended multiple political demonstrations. Petitioner claims that as a result of his involvement in politics, he was arrested, beaten, and/or mistreated on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Petitioner became a police officer after the Albanian Democratic Party came to power in 1992. In 1997, Petitioner lost his job after the accession of the Socialist Party. After his termination, Petitioner sought an explanation as to why he was fired. The \u201cchairman\u201d in charge of local police refused to provide an explanation and Petitioner refused to leave the chairman\u2019s office. Petitioner claims he was subsequently arrested, detained for six hours, and beaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">After leaving the police force, Petitioner opened a \u201cvariety\u201d store while still continuing his Albanian Democratic Party activities. Petitioner claims that he \u201cfaced problems and one threat after another.\u201d J.A. at 116. Petitioner specifically recalls being assaulted by four armed, masked men who appropriated the store goods he was carrying and threatened further violence if he continued his involvement with the Party. Petitioner claims that he ultimately terminated his business in early 2000 because of the duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Petitioner claims that he was next harmed when the police grabbed him after a political meeting in January 2000. Petitioner alleges that he was detained and beaten for six days. Petitioner also claims that he was mistreated during the October 1, 2000 elections. Petitioner asserts that it was these events that triggered his departure from Albania with his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Petitioners entered the United States from Canada on November 1, 2000. On March 12, 2001, the INS issued Notices to Appear, alleging that Petitioners were removable pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, as aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Petitioners conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">I. The Decision Of The Immigration Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">On June 5, 2001, the IJ denied Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal, and deferral of removal under the CAT. The IJ noted that Petitioners conceded removability and sought relief based upon lead Petitioner\u2019s allegation of persecution by the communist and later socialist regimes in Albania. The IJ then reviewed the legal standards for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. The IJ found lead Petitioner was not credible \u201cwith respect to the most recent triggering events that caused him to come to the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. at 57. The IJ also noted several problems with Petitioners\u2019 documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Significantly, the IJ found that Petitioners had established persecution only \u201cin the communist era,\u201d and that lead Petitioner had last been persecuted in 1991, before the fall of communism in Albania. J.A. at 54. The IJ found that the fall of communism constituted a \u201cfundamental change\u201d in country conditions. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the IJ held that Petitioners were \u201cnot entitled to a presumption of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>II. The Decision Of The Board Of Immigration Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Petitioners appealed the decision of the IJ to the Board of Immigration Appeals. On October 4, 2002, the BIA affirmed the decision of the I J. In a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the BIA stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The Immigration Judge\u2019s decision dated June 5, 2001, is affirmed. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the lead [Petitioner] did not establish an adequate, credible objective basis for a finding that he and, through him, the minor [Petitioner] qualify for a grant of asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The [Petitioner] has raised no arguments on appeal which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. The appeal is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">J.A. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Petitioners seek review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 final order for two primary reasons. First, Petitioners challenge the adverse credibility findings and denial of relief by the I J. Second, Petitioners argue that the BIA\u2019s issuance of a \u201csummary affirmance\u201d constitutes a failure to engage in meaningful review in violation of Petitioners\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights to due process. For the reasons set forth below, Petitioners\u2019 arguments must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">We review questions of law involving immigration proceedings <em>de novo. Huico-chea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 699 (6th Cir.2001). Judicial review is restricted to the administrative record. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). The BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioners are ineligible for asylum or withholding of deportation must be upheld if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citations omitted). In order to reverse the BIA\u2019s determinations, \u201cthe reviewing court must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but indeed compels it.\u201d <em>Klawitter v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 149, 152 (6th Cir.1992)(citing <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">A. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">\u201cDisposition of an application for asylum requires a two-step inquiry; first, whether the petitioner is a \u2018refugee\u2019 within the meaning of the [Immigration and Nationality Act], and second, whether the petitioner merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the. Attorney General.\u201d <em>Perkovic v. INS, </em>33 F.3d 615, 620 (6th Cir.1994). A \u201crefugee\u201d is a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">If the alien does not prove past persecution, or if that evidence is rebutted because of a fundamental change in country conditions, no presumption of future persecution exists. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). \u201cInstead, the applicant must show a good reason to fear future persecution by adducing credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094 (9th Cir.2002) (citations and internal punctuation omitted); <em>see also Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1035 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cAn asylum applicant\u2019s well-founded fear of persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>tion must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable to qualify for asylum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">B. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Removal will be withheld to a particular country \u201cif the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe standard [of proof] for withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard of asylum in that it requires the applicant to show a greater likelihood of persecution.\u201d <em>Hakeem, v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001). To qualify for withholding of removal, the alien must prove a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution, <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 412, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984), or that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that she will be persecuted on account of an enumerated ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">II. There Is Substantial Evidence To Support The Decision Of The Immigration Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Petitioners raise several challenges to the decision of the IJ denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, Petitioners argue that they were entitled to the rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Second, Petitioners contend that the IJ ignored contradictions in \u201ccountry materials.\u201d Lastly, Petitioners claim that the IJ misinterpreted lead Petitioner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Petitioners argue that the IJ erred by failing to analyze \u201cwhether due to Petitioner\u2019s past persecution that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d Pet. Br. at 16. Petitioners contend that they were entitled to the presumption of future persecution because lead Petitioner was persecuted in the past under the communist regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">If an alien does not prove past persecution, or the evidence is rebutted because of change country conditions, no presumption of future persecution exists. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). In this case, the IJ found that \u201cthe only persecution established is within the communist regime,\u201d with lead Petitioner last suffering persecution in 1990 or 1991. J.A. at 54. The IJ further stated, \u201cThings have changed and [Petitioner] has not proven any persecution after that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ held that the subsequent fall of communism was a \u201cfundamental change in circumstance\u201d in Albania. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the IJ properly held that because there was a fundamental change in country conditions, Petitioners were \u201cnot entitled to the rebuttable presumption\u201d of a well-founded fear of future persecution. J.A. at 55; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments essentially challenge the factual conclusions reached by the IJ. It is not enough, however, for Petitioners to argue that the IJ could have drawn different inferences, or that this court should substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See INS v. RiosPineda, </em>471 U.S. 444, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985). Further, an IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are accorded due deference. <em>Palacios-Torres v. INS, </em>995 F.2d 96, 100 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">In this case, the IJ noted numerous material credibility problems with lead Pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>titioner\u2019s testimony and evidence. Given the inconsistencies, the IJ was well within his discretion in doubting Petitioners\u2019 version of the facts. Further, Petitioners\u2019 allegation that the IJ ignored contradictions in \u201ccountry specific\u201d materials is also without merit. In fact, the IJ analyzed the conflicting reports in detail. Accordingly, in light of the record evidence, the IJ\u2019s decision rejecting Petitioners\u2019 application for relief finds ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">III. The Board Of Immigration Appeals Provided Meaningful Review Of The Immigration Judge\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Petitioners assert that the BIA, by utilizing its authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) to affirm without separate opinion, failed to provide meaningful review of the IJ\u2019s decision and therefore violated their rights to due process. For the following reasons, we reject Petitioners\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">First, the BIA issued a separate, <em>per curiam </em>written opinion, and did not utilize its authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). Therefore, this court need not address Petitioners\u2019 challenges to the \u201cstreamlining\u201d regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the court will address Petitioners\u2019 substantive due process challenges based on the brief nature of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Petitioners argue that \u201cby adopting the reasoning of the immigration judge as opposed to making its own independent conclusions, the BIA failed to undergo meaningful review of the judgment of the immigration judge.\u201d Pet. Br. at 11. Petitioners contend that the single paragraph affirmance fails to articulate reasons for denying relief and does not meet the standards for adequately addressing its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>the IJ\u2019s decision rejecting Petitioners\u2019 application for relief was supported by substantial evidence. The BIA subsequently adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ in a short opinion. The BIA\u2019s October 4, 2002 Opinion stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">The Immigration Judge\u2019s decision dated June 5, 2001, is affirmed. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the lead [Petitioner] did not establish an adequate, credible objective basis for a finding that he and, through him, the minor [Petitioner] qualify for a grant of asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The [Petitioner] has raised no arguments on appeal which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision. The appeal is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">J.A. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">Petitioners have failed to provide any basis to conclude that the BIA gave their case anything less than a full, independent review. Although brief, the BIA\u2019s decision was clear in its reasoning. Further, one cannot, in the absence of evidence, infer that the BIA failed to conduct the required review merely because of the brief nature of its decision. As the Seventh Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>stated in <em>Guentchev v. INS, </em>77 F.3d 1036, 1038 (7th Cir.1996),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Perhaps some summary dispositions obscure the Board\u2019s reasons, or hide the lack of reasons. What the Board\u2019s order says, however, is that the Board agrees with the immigration judge\u2019s reasons, and we have no greater reason to doubt that statement than we have to doubt that the explanation in an elaborate opinion is an honest recapitulation of the reasons for decision. To adopt someone else\u2019s reasoned explanation <em>is </em>to give reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the BIA provided meaningful review of the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we DENY the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s October 4, 2002 Final Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. Lead Petitioner, Paloke Tanazi, testified in support of his and his son's application for relief. Lead Petitioner\u2019s son, Erlis, the second Petitioner, did not testify before the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. Petitioners have not addressed the denial of their application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, the court deems that claim abandoned. <em>See Ener-tech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm\u2019rs, </em>85 F.3d 257, 259 (6th Cir.1996) (Issues raised in the district court but not addressed on appeal are deemed abandoned and unreviewable on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">. The court notes that several circuits have rejected similar challenges to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). <em>See Mendoza v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003)(finding that summary affirmance does not violate any due process rights because \"under the [INS] regulations, no entitlement to a full opinion by the BIA exists\"); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 366 (1st Cir.2003)(concluding that the summary affirmance scheme adopted by the INS does not constitute a violation of due process or render judicial review of INS decisions impossible even if the BIA does not explicate its reasons for affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003)(\"This court has previously joined the majority of circuits in approving the authority of the BIA to affirm the immigration judge's decision without giving additional reasons\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
