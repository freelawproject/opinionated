He argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by two for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The district court\u2019s decision to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is a factual determination subject to review only for clear error. <em>United States v. Devine, </em>934 F.2d 1325, 1339 (5th Cir.1991). Because Laurent failed to present any rebuttal evidence at sentencing, the district court was free to adopt the facts in the presentence report without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Mir, </em>919 F.2d 940, 943 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">At sentencing, Laurent did not dispute that the firearm in question was possessed by a co-defendant. Moreover, the presentence report contained sufficient facts for the district court to conclude that drugs and the co-defendant\u2019s firearm were thrown from the vehicle occupied by Laurent and his co-defendants on November 22, 2002. The presentence report also noted that Laurent had $727 on his person when he was arrested, even though he was unemployed, and that Laurent told the probation officer that the drugs in the vehicle on November 22, 2002, were for distribution. Accordingly, based upon the unrebutted evidence in the presentence report, it was not clear error for the district court to apply the adjustment for possession of a firearm as Laurent could reasonably foresee that his co-defendant possessed a firearm as a tool of the trade in their drug conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209, 1215 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
