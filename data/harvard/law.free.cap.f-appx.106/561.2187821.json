We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm Gaybor\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for resen-tencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">I. Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b584-19\">Gaybor raises several challenges to the district court\u2019s exclusion of proffered testimony from a \u201chuman factors\u201d expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-20\">We review the exclusion of expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702 for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Morales, </em>108 F.3d 1031, 1035 (9th Cir.1997). The proffered testimony regarding the effect of Gaybor\u2019s inattentiveness and the armored car\u2019s convex mirrors, did not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>cern subjects requiring \u201cexpert illumination.\u201d <em>United States v. Seschillie, </em>310 F.3d 1208, 1212 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see United States v. Finley, </em>301 F.3d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining that expert testimony \u201cmust be beyond the common knowledge of the average layman\u201d). While some courts have admitted expert testimony on identification and human factors, those cases do not compel a finding that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that the proffered testimony in this case was not the proper subject of expert testimony. We thus conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the proffered testimony under Rule 702.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Additionally, while the excluded expert testimony would have supported Gaybor\u2019s defense, Gaybor was not deprived the opportunity to present his theory to the jury so there was no due process violation. <em>See Greene v. Lambert, </em>288 F.3d 1081, 1092 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining that a defendant\u2019s due process rights are not offended when a trial court prohibits \u201cthird-party evidence of <em>the truthfulness of </em>the <em>substantive content </em>of the defendant\u2019s testimony\u201d) (emphasis in the original); <em>see also United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\u201d); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Gaybor\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">II. Sentence Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Gaybor also challenges the imposition of a four-level sentence enhancement based on the district court\u2019s determination that he was \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). We review the determination that Gaybor was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d for purposes of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Tank, </em>200 F.3d 627, 633 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The district court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement here was clearly erroneous because the court mistakenly applied a \u201cbut for\u201d test in determining whether Gaybor was an \u201corganizer or leader.\u201d <em>United States v. Harper, </em>33 F.3d 1143, 1151 (9th Cir.1994) (explaining that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is not the test \u201cfor determining whether the aggravating role adjustment can be applied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">The proper test is whether \u201cthe defendant \u2018exercised some control over others involved in the commission of the offense [or was] responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mares-Molina, </em>913 F.2d 770, 773 (9th Cir. 1990)). The government\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 884 (5th Cir.2000), for the proposition that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is appropriate in this case is unpersuasive; we have consistently rejected application of the \u201cbut for\u201d test to determine if a defendant was an \u201corganizer or leader.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d 712, 716-17 (9th Cir. 1998) (relying on <em>Harper, </em>33 F.3d at 1151).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Moreover, it is insufficient that Gaybor may have been more culpable than some of his accomplices. <em>See Harper, </em>33 F.3d at 1150. To receive an aggravated role enhancement Gaybor must have exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>cised some control over one or more of his accomplices. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Notwithstanding the district court\u2019s use of an improper test, the government also argues that the evidence supports that Gaybor controlled or organized others. Application note 4 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, provides a seven-factor test to determine whether a defendant was an organizer or leader. <em>See Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d at 717. Although the district court made findings that could support some of these factors, the court did not find, and the government does not point to any evidence, that Gaybor organized or exercised control over his fellow robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The government contends that supervision and control can be inferred because the robbery \u201cwas conducted in such a way to protect [Gaybor] from view.\u201d We disagree. The case against Gaybor was that he was the \u201cinside man\u201d who played an important role in the planning stages of the robbery by furnishing his accomplices with critical information. Each accomplice had an interest in hiding Gaybor\u2019s role in the robbery. If his role had not been concealed, he would have been the obvious suspect who could have led the authorities to each accomplice. Thus, although the evidence shows that the robbery was conducted in a manner to hide that it was an inside job, the record does not support that Gaybor directed or controlled his accomplices to cover-up his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Accordingly, we vacate Gaybor\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing without the imposition of the aggravating role adjustment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">On the basis of the foregoing, we affirm Gaybor\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing without imposition of the \u201corganizer or leader\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.

Because, given our disposition, there is no possibility that <em>Blakely v.
