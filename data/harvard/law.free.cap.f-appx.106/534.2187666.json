We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Delta Sav. Bank v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-20\">On appeal, Phillips raises only two contentions, first that his right to refuse treatment as provided in CaLCode Regs, tit.15 \u00a7 3363 (1995) was violated. This contention fails because section 3363(b) provides an exception to the general right to refuse treatment if the inmate is suffering from a mental illness which poses a danger to others or to himself. Phillips\u2019 medical records demonstrate that Phillips posed a danger to himself, and therefore the right to refuse treatment did not apply, to Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-21\">Phillips also contends that the district court improperly denied his request for counsel. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Phillips\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel because he failed to demonstrate \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
