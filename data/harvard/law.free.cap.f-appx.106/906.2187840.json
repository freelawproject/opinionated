In addition, Doe 5 appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">A plaintiff asserting a claim under \u00a7 1983 must \u201c(1) allege a violation of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States or laws of the United States; and (2) demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Priester v. Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a municipality could be held liable for an injury under \u00a7 1983 if the injury was caused by a custom or policy of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">Doe 5 alleges that she was confined in the Haltom City jail in connection with various misdemeanors without being afforded an indigency hearing, without being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>informed of her right to counsel, and without the benefit of appointed counsel. According to Doe 5, the City is liable under \u00a7 1983 for these alleged constitutional violations because it had a policy of jailing inmates, such as her, for misdemeanors, without providing counsel or determining whether they had the ability to pay their misdemeanor fines. Assuming that Doe 5 has alleged violations of her constitutional rights, we conclude that Doe 5\u2019s theory of liability is flawed. The relevant decisions were made, not by a City policymaker, but by a municipal judge acting in his judicial capacity. As the Ninth Circuit reasoned in <em>Eggar v. City of Livingston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-4\">Because [the judge] was functioning as a state judicial officer, his acts and omissions were not part of a city policy or custom. A municipality cannot be liable for judicial conduct it lacks the power to require, control, or remedy, even if that conduct parallels or appears entangled with the desires of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">40 F.3d 312, 316 (9th Cir.1994) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In the alternative, Doe 5 alleges that the City is liable because it ratified the municipal judge\u2019s conduct. Because the municipality did not have the power to control the municipal judge\u2019s actions, however, it also did not have the power to ratify them. We, therefore, conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Doe 5\u2019s wrongful-incarceration claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Doe 5\u2019s remaining claims require no extended discussion. Verbal sexual harassment does not violate a detainee or inmate\u2019s constitutional rights; thus, Doe 5 has no claim against the City under \u00a7 1983 for any sexual harassment she suffered while in jail. <em>See, e.g., Austin v. Terhune, </em>367 F.3d 1167, 1171-72 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Bender v. Brumley, </em>1 F.3d 271, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cMere allegations of verbal abuse do not present actionable claims under \u00a7 1983.\u201d). Next, even if Doe 5 has alleged a constitutional violation arising out of the video system\u2019s misuse, she has presented no basis for holding the City liable because she has not alleged that the misuse arose out of a City custom or policy. <em>Cf. Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Even if the jail had a policy of staffing a lone male jailer, as Doe 5 alleges, we held in <em>Scott v. Moore, </em>114 F.3d 51, 52 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc), that the Constitution does not require jails that house female detainees either to staff more than one jailer at a time or to staff a female jailer. Finally, the City is not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the jail\u2019s policies regarding clothing, diet, and exercise because Doe 5\u2019s averments do not demonstrate that her constitutional rights were violated by these policies. <em>Cf. Hamilton v. Lyons, </em>74 F.3d 99, 106-07 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (5th Cir.1996) (finding no Fourteenth or Eighth Amendment violation when a detained parolee \u201cwas denied visitation, telephone access, recreation, mail, legal materials, sheets, and showers for a three-day period\u201d). Consequently, the district court did not err by dismissing these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">We also conclude that, under the facts of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Doe 5\u2019s motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint. Doe 5 was permitted to file three amended complaints, but failed to remedy her pleading deficiencies. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>thermore, she did not seek leave to file her fourth amended complaint in a timely manner. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Doe 5\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) and the district court\u2019s denial of Doe 5\u2019s motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-22\">. For purposes of oral argument, this case was consolidated with twelve similar cases and heard under the name <em>Drake v. City of Haltom City, </em>No. 03-10594, 2004 WL 1777144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. On appeal, Doe 5 presents a number of other grounds for holding the City liable for her alleged wrongful incarceration, which she did not assert in the district court. We will not address Doe 5\u2019s new arguments on appeal because we conclude that no miscarriage of justice will occur by our failure to consider them. <em>See McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Watson, </em>69 F.3d 36, 44 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
