Hus-sain argues that he clearly established that he suffered past persecution because on two separate occasions he was arrested, detained for several months, and beaten by Pakistani police due to his membership in the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) political party. He argues that he has established that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution due to his political activities if he returned to Pakistan. The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Hus-sain was not a credible witness and that his testimony was internally contradictory and unbelievable; the IJ denied his request for asylum. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. We will not substitute our judgment of Hussain\u2019s credibility for that of the IJ and BIA. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Hussain has not shown that the evidence in the record compels a conclusion contrary to the decision of the IJ and BIA that he was not a credible witness and that he did not establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b945-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
