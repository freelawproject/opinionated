Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a municipality could be held liable for an injury under \u00a7 1983 if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>the injury was caused by a custom or policy of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Whisenant alleges that he was incarcerated in the Haltom City jail for fifty days in connection with various misdemeanors. According to Whisenant, former municipal judge Jack Byno incarcerated him without informing him of his right to counsel, providing him with appointed counsel, or holding a hearing to determine whether Whi-senant was able to pay his misdemeanor fines. Whisenant argues that the City is responsible for these alleged constitutional violations because (1) the City had a policy of incarcerating defendants who were unable to pay misdemeanor fines without providing them with indigency hearings or appointing counsel for them, (2) the City ratified Byno\u2019s actions, and (3) the city council conspired with Byno to incarcerate indigent defendants in order to extract money from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The City cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983 for having a \u201cpolicy\u201d of wrongfully incarcerating indigent defendants because the relevant decisions were made by a municipal judge acting in his judicial capacity. As the Ninth Circuit reasoned in <em>Eggar v. City of Livingston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">Because [the judge] was functioning as a state judicial officer, his acts and omissions were not part of a city policy or custom. A municipality cannot be liable for judicial conduct it lacks the power to require, control, or remedy, even if that conduct parallels or appears entangled with the desires of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">40 F.3d 312, 316 (9th Cir.1994) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir.1992). Similarly, because the City had no power to control Byno\u2019s judicial actions, the City cannot be liable for \u201cratifying\u201d his judicial conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Whisenant, however, also contends that the City is liable because the city council conspired with Byno to incarcerate him and other indigent defendants in order to raise money for the City. To state a claim for conspiracy under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the existence of (1) an agreement to do an illegal act and (2) an actual constitutional deprivation. <em>See Ci-nel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1343 (5th Cir.1994). Whisenant has alleged an agreement between Byno and the city council to violate his rights (and the rights of other indigent defendants): \u201cByno conspired with the City counsel [sic] to establish procedures designed to deprive individuals of their constitutional rights to generate revenues for the City by intimidating accused individuals to plead guilty, levying unjust fines, refusing to appoint counsel ... and throwing citizens in \u2018debt- or\u2019s prison.\u201d Whisenant Compl. at 4. Furthermore, by alleging that he was not given an indigency hearing or provided with appointed counsel before being incarcerated, Whisenant has alleged actual deprivations of his constitutional rights. <em>See Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979); <em>Tate v. Short, </em>401 U.S. 395, 399, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The next question is whether the City could be liable under \u00a7 1983 for this conspiracy. The City cannot be liable for Byno\u2019s role in the conspiracy, since Byno was not acting as a municipal official or lawmaker. <em>Johnson, </em>958 F.2d at 94. But the City can be held liable for the city council\u2019s part in the conspiracy, because the city council is the City\u2019s policymaking body and, consequently, its decisions constitute City policy. <em>See id. </em>(defining \u201cofficial policy\u201d). Therefore, we hold that Whisenant has stated a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City for his wrongful incarceration. Whether the claim will survive a properly supported motion for summary judgment is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Whisenant has failed to state a claim regarding his conditions of confinement, however, because he has not alleged that his diet was medically unsafe or nutritionally inadequate. <em>See Green v. Ferrell, </em>801 F.2d 765, 771-70 (5th Cir.1986). Thus, the district court properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Whisenant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the City for wrongful incarceration and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Whisenant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the City for unconstitutional conditions of confinement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
