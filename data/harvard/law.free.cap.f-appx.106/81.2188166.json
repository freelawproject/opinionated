We add that it appears Solomon has forfeited his civil RICO and invasion of privacy claims by failing to provide any developed argument in support of those claims in his appellate brief. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to allow Solomon\u2019s late-filed motion to amend, <em>see Maine State Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, </em>359 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2004); and we reject his suggestion that Judge O\u2019Toole was required to recuse himself from this matter. <em>See In re Boston\u2019s Children First, </em>244 F.3d 164, 167 (1st Cir.2001) (recusal required only where facts exist which \u201can objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-22\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
