ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Martin Esparza-Varela pled guilty to one count of reentry into the United States following deportation and following a prior conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2). He was sentenced to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by two years of unsupervised release. Mr. Espar-za-Varela appeals his sentence, arguing the government failed to provide sufficient reliable evidence of two prior convictions that were counted in the calculation of his criminal history category. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Mr. Esparza-Varela was arrested at a United States Border Patrol checkpoint near Las Cruces, New Mexico, on March 20, 2003, after a background check revealed that he had been deported to Mexico on November 12, 2001, following his conviction on a charge of attempted forgery, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Without entering into a plea agreement, he pled guilty to the sole charge brought against him, illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-14\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the U.S. Probation Office calculated a criminal history category of IV for Esparza-Varela, based in part on a prior conviction for battery domestic violence in the municipal court of Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 2, 2001, and a prior conviction for battery in the Clark County Justice Court in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 15, 2001. Together with the calculated offense level of 13, this yielded a sentencing range of twenty-four to thirty months. Among the other details included in the PSR were the following facts: that Espar-za-Varela was born on August 14, 1978, in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico; that he lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1991 to 2001; that he married Bonnie Lenore Campos in Las Vegas in 1998; and that he has a tattoo depicting the name \u201cBonnie\u201d in Old English on his lower abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-15\">Esparza-Varela objected to the PSR\u2019s inclusion of three criminal history points based on the two battery convictions, arguing that the computer printouts indicating the convictions were not reliable evidence. He argued the convictions should therefore not be included in the criminal history calculation, and thus his category should be reduced from IV to III, yielding a sentencing range of eighteen to twenty-four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-16\">At the subsequent sentencing hearing, in response to Esparza-Varela\u2019s objection that he had not received copies of the probation officer\u2019s evidence of these two convictions, the court issued a brief continuance to allow the officer to produce his evidence. In support of the first convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tion, the officer submitted, in his description, a \u201ccomputer printout generated by the probation office in Las Vegas, Nevada,\u201d together with a police report of the arrest. Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 11, R. Vol. IV. The printout indicated the defendant, listed as \u201cEsparza, Martin,\u201d had pled guilty as charged to battery domestic violence. The police report had the same \u201cevent number\u201d as the printout and recorded the arrestee\u2019s name as \u201cEsparaza, Martin,\u201d with a birth date of August 14, 1978. The report further indicated the arrest arose out of a dispute between \u201cMartin Esparaza\u201d and his wife, \u201cBonnie Campos.\u201d In support of the second conviction, the officer submitted a \u201ccomputer generated court proceedings printout\u201d from the database of the Las Vegas municipal court, together with a police report of the arrest. <em>Id. </em>The printout indicated the defendant, listed as \u201cEsparca, Martin,\u201d entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of battery domestic violence. The police report, again having the same \u201cevent number\u201d as the printout, indicated \u201cMartin Esparca\u201d had been arrested following a dispute with his ex-wife, \u201cBonnie Campos,\u201d that Esparca\u2019s real date of birth was August 14, 1978, and that Esparca had a tattoo of \u201cBonn\u201d on his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Reviewing the documents on the bench, the court noted the near identity of the names of the defendants in the Las Vegas convictions with Esparza-Varela, and the identical dates of birth. The court asked \u201cwhether the defendant seeks to present any evidence in contradiction of the conclusion that was suggested by the probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. \u25a0 Esparza-Varela made proffers that he had no recollection of the convictions. The court then made a finding that the two Las Vegas convictions \u201care supported by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14, and proceeded to sentence Esparza-Varela in accord with the PSR\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On appeal, Esparza-Varela renews his argument that the evidence of the two Las Vegas convictions was insufficiently reliable and that the government failed to meet its burden of proof. He also argues he had no reasonable opportunity to contest the probation officer\u2019s evidence because it was not made available to him prior to the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>94 F.3d 1373, 1380 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Here, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Esparza-Varela had two prior battery convictions in Las Vegas and its conclusion that these convictions were properly included in Esparza-Varela\u2019s criminal history calculation. \u201cAt sentencing, the district court may rely on facts stated in the presentence report unless the defendant has objected to them.\u201d <em>United States v. Shinault, </em>147 F.3d 1266, 1277 (10th Cir.1998). However, \u201c[w]hen a defendant objects to a fact in a presentence report, the government must prove that fact at a sentencing hearing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278; <em>see also United States v. Torres, </em>182 F.3d 1156, 1162 (10th Cir.1999) (holding the government must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cwhatever facts are needed to justify adding additional criminal history points\u201d (further quotation omitted)). The evidence offered need not be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). Nevertheless, it must have \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (Nov.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>In this case, the evidence produced by the probation officer in response to Espar-za-Varela\u2019s objection was sufficiently reliable. The computer printouts from the databases of the Las Vegas municipal court and the U.S. probation office in Las Vegas, though the parties do not refer to them as docket sheets, contain similar information to that found on a docket sheet. They indicate the history of court proceedings in both cases, one ending in a guilty plea and one ending in a nolo contendere plea. The probation office\u2019s assertion that the subject of these printouts is Esparza-Varela is corroborated by factual details in the accompanying police reports \u2014 the defendant\u2019s name, his date of birth, his residence in Las Vegas, the name of his wife or ex-wife, and the tattoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Esparza-Varela\u2019s sole quibble with the reliability of these documents appears to be that they are not certified and are therefore \u201cof uncertain provenance,\u201d lacking proof \u201cthat they are accurate copies of court or other official records.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. He cites no authority, however, and we have found none, requiring such documents to be certified in order to be found reliable. <em>See, e.g., Simpson, </em>94 F.3d at 1381 (holding \u201ca certified docket sheet is adequate, absent some contradictory evidence by the defendant, to establish the existence of a prior conviction for this sentencing purpose,\u201d but not indicating certification was necessary to the adequacy holding). The presence of supporting documentation from government sources, despite its lack of certification, is sufficient, we believe, to distinguish this case from <em>United States v. Floyd, </em>343 F.3d 363 (5th Cir.2003), cited by Esparza-Varela, where a district court\u2019s criminal history finding was overturned because \u201c[t]he only evidence ... from which the district court could have concluded that [the defendant] had a prior conviction was the unsworn statements of the probation officer,\u201d and no \u201csupporting documentation evidencing [the] conviction[ ] was ever provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373. <em>Compare Shinault, </em>147 F.3d at 1277-78 (upholding prior conviction findings based on charging documents citing names other than the defendant\u2019s, together with the probation officer\u2019s testimony that the names were aliases of the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">We conclude that the government met its burden of proof and reject Esparza-Varela\u2019s claim that the district court improperly shifted the burden to him. \u201cOnce the government had established the fact of [a] prior conviction, the burden then shifted to [the defendant] to challenge its validity.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>63 F.3d 952, 955 (10th Cir.1995). We also reject Esparza-Varela\u2019s claim that he had insufficient opportunity to mount such a challenge because he did not see the probation office\u2019s documentation until the sentencing hearing. Esparza-Varela was made aware of the alleged prior convictions when he received the PSR. His written objections to the PSR indicate he knew about the alleged prior convictions and that the probation office was relying on \u201ca computer printout and not ... an actual copy of the judgment and conviction.\u201d Attach, to Second Addendum to PSR, R. Vol. II. After the documents were produced at the sentencing hearing, the court gave Esparza-Varela an opportunity to contradict the probation office\u2019s claim, but Esparza-Varela offered no evidence indicating the documentation was unreliable or the information contained therein was inaccurate, nor does he suggest on appeal that such evidence exists. Although the probation office should have provided the documents to the defense earlier, its failure to do so does not, we think, warrant reversal under these circumstances. <em>Compare United States v. Wise, </em>990 F.2d 1545, 1549-50 (10th Cir.1992) (holding defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>district court did not allow the defendant to question the probation officer at the sentencing hearing regarding the factual basis for his conclusions).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">We therefore uphold the district court\u2019s criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b24-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
