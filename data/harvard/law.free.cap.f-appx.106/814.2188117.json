California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising four potential issues: (1) whether statements Evans made to Government officials should have been suppressed; (2) whether Evans knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel; (3) whether Evans was properly subjected to the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(d); and (4) whether the Government condones child pornography by not shutting down all internet \u201cchat rooms\u201d that may pertain to child pornography. Evans has filed a supplemental brief, alleging that he should not have been subjected to the ten-year mandatory minimum, his sentence is excessive when compared with the sentences received by similarly situated offenders, and his standby counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to suppress statements Evans made to Government officials. Evans made the statements, which indicated his culpability, voluntarily and, at one point, even after having been advised by his counsel not to speak. A review of the record also discloses that Evans knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>323 F.3d 263, 275 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 531, 157 L.Ed.2d 412 (2003). Additionally, Evans was properly subjected to the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 2251(d). <em>See United States v. Rast, </em>293 F.3d 735, 737-38 (4th Cir.2002). Evans has not demonstrated that other offenders, convicted under \u00a7 2251(d), were not also subjected to the mandatory minimum sentence. Counsel\u2019s suggestion that the Government\u2019s failure to eliminate child pornography from the internet is tantamount to condonation of the crime is patently meritless. Finally, Evans\u2019 allegation that his standby counsel was ineffective is not appropriately raised on direct appeal. Evans is free to raise this claim in the district court in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Evans\u2019 conviction and sentence. We deny the motion to withdraw as counsel at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Evans. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
