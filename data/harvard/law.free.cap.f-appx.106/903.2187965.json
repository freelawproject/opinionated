In addition, Soto appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-20\">A plaintiff asserting a claim under \u00a7 1983 must \u201c(1) allege a violation of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States or laws of the United States; and (2) demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Priester v. Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a municipality could be held liable for an injury under \u00a7 1983 if the injury was caused by a custom or policy of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-21\">Soto alleges that she was confined in the Haltom City jail in connection with various misdemeanors without being af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>forded an indigency hearing, without being informed of her right to counsel, and without the benefit of appointed counsel. According to Soto, the City is liable under \u00a7 1988 for these alleged constitutional violations because it had a policy of jailing inmates, such as her, for misdemeanor violations, without providing counsel or determining whether they had the ability to pay their misdemeanor fines. Assuming that Soto has alleged violations of her constitutional rights, we conclude that Soto\u2019s theory of liability is flawed. The relevant decisions were made, not by a City policymaker, but by a municipal judge acting in his judicial capacity. As the Ninth Circuit reasoned in <em>Eggar v. City of Livingston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">Because [the judge] was functioning as a state judicial officer, his acts and omissions were not part of a city policy or custom. A municipality cannot be liable for judicial conduct it lacks the power to require, control, or remedy, even if that conduct parallels or appears entangled with the desires of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">40 F.3d 312, 316 (9th Cir.1994) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In the alternative, Soto alleges that the City is liable because it ratified the municipal judge\u2019s conduct. Because the municipality did not have the power to control the municipal judge\u2019s actions, however, it also did not have the power to ratify them. We, therefore, conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Soto\u2019s wrongful-incarceration claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Soto\u2019s remaining claims require no extended discussion. Even if Soto has alleged a constitutional violation arising out of the video system\u2019s misuse, she has presented no basis for holding the City liable because she has not alleged that the misuse arose out of a City custom or policy. C<em>f. Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Similarly, even if Soto\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when she was allegedly strip searched, by male guards \u201cwithout good cause,\u201d Soto has not alleged that the City had a policy or custom of allowing baseless cross-gender strip searches. <em>Cf. id. </em>Even if the jail had a policy of staffing a lone male jailer, as Soto alleges, we held in <em>Scott v. Moore, </em>114 F.3d 51, 52 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc), that the Constitution does not require jails that house female detainees either to staff more than one jailer at a time or to staff a female jailer. Finally, the City is not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the jail\u2019s policies regarding clothing, diet, and exercise because Soto\u2019s averments do not demonstrate that her constitutional rights were violated by these policies. <em>Cf. Hamilton v. Lyons, </em>74 F.3d 99, 106-07 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (5th Cir.1996) (finding no Fourteenth or Eighth Amendment violation when a detained parolee \u201cwas denied visitation, telephone access, recreation, mail, legal materials, sheets, and showers for a three-day period\u201d). Consequently, the district court did not err by dismissing these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">We also conclude that, under the facts of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Soto\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Soto was permitted to file an amended complaint, but failed to remedy her pleading deficiencies. Furthermore, she did not seek leave to file her second amended complaint in a timely manner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number><em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Soto\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) and the district court\u2019s denial of Soto\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-22\">. For purposes of oral argument, this case was consolidated with twelve similar cases and heard under the name <em>Drake v. City of Haltom City, </em>No. 03-10594, 2004 WL 1777144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. On appeal, Soto presents a number of other grounds for holding the City liable for her alleged wrongful incarceration, which she did not assert in the district court. We will not address Soto\u2019s new arguments on appeal because we conclude that no miscarriage of justice will occur by our failure to consider them. <em>See McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Watson, 69 </em>F.3d 36, 44 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
