Clifford Wallace, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b144-8\">SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The Commissioner of Social Security denied Paul F. Sinclair\u2019s application for benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. The District Court, exercising jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. We have appellate jurisdiction over Sinclair\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Our review is the same as that of the District Court, \u201cnamely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Pe-rales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Sinclair, who was fifty-nine years old, claimed he was unable to perform any substantial gainful activity because he suffered from hepatitis B and C. The ALJ disagreed and denied his claim for benefits, finding that he was able to perform his past relevant work as a real estate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">Sinclair appealed, raising three issues. First, Sinclair asserted that the ALJ erred because he failed to comply with the mandate of <em>Burnett v. Comm\u2019r, </em>220 F.3d 112, 119-20 (3d Cir.2000), to provide a reasoned explanation why Sinclair\u2019s condition did not satisfy the criteria of any of the impairments listed in Appendix 1 of the Social Security regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, Appendix 1. Second, Sinclair argued that the ALJ erred because he failed to evaluate whether there were any limitations resulting from Sinclair\u2019s pain. Sinclair\u2019s third contention was that the ALJ failed to substantiate his conclusion that Sinclair could perform medium level work. None of Sinclair\u2019s arguments have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Sinclair\u2019s reliance on <em>Burnett </em>is misplaced because meaningful judicial review did not require an exhaustive explanation as to whether Sinclair\u2019s condition satisfied any of the impairments listed in Appendix 1. <em>Burnett, </em>220 F.3d at 119-20. As the District Judge noted, there was only one listing for hepatitis and the record was devoid of any evidence that Sinclair exhibited the criteria required for that listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">For Sinclair to take issue with the ALJ for allegedly failing to consider his pain is, at the very least, cheeky. Sinclair himself testified before the ALJ that the pain he alleged in his application had been present initially for only several days and that he no longer experienced pain. Thus, the fact that the ALJ did not discuss this symptom at greater length was a direct result of Sinclair\u2019s own testimony. In any event, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Sinclair\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>allegations of pain were sufficient and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, there is substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sinclair was able to perform his past relevant work as a real estate broker which was sedentary in nature. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e). Sinclair did not challenge that finding here. Indeed, Sinclair\u2019s own description of his duties as a real estate broker confirmed that the position was sedentary, requiring sitting for eight hours a day. Thus, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sinclair was able to perform the sedentary duties of his past relevant work as a real estate broker and was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In sum, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Sinclair was not disabled. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
