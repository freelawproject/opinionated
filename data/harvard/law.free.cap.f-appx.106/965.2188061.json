Cummings argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Shells actually implemented a reduction in force, whether Cummings was replaced by a younger employee, and whether Shells\u2019s allegations of his workplace misconduct were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-22\">Having heard oral argument and reviewed the record, the applicable law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that Shells terminated Cummings as part of a reduction in force and that Cummings failed to present evidence that Shells singled him out for discharge based on his age, as required to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as stated in that court\u2019s memorandum and order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
