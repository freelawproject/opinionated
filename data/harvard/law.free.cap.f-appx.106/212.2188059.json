Minter asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion. He relies on <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186 (5th Cir.1999), to assert that his sentence should be based solely on application of Guidelines Amendment 484, which was effective in 1993, to the 1988 edition of the Guidelines. The Government argues that the law of the case doctrine precludes this court from considering Minter\u2019s appeal. Minter argues that the law of the case doctrine does not apply because the district court\u2019s prior decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice in light of <em>Mueller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Minter was originally sentenced to a total of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. In response to a prior 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence, the district court reduced Minter\u2019s sentence to a term of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence reduction was made in response to Minter\u2019s argument that Amendment 484, which modified the application notes to Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1 and excluded waste water from the drug quantity calculation, warranted a reduction in his sentence. <em>See </em>Amendment 484, U.S.S.GApp. C (1993). The district court reduced Minter\u2019s sentence after determining that Amendment 484 was retroactively applicable and that it warranted a reduction in Minter\u2019s sentence. However, the district court also analyzed the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and concluded that a sentence within the range of 108-135 months, which was produced by applying Amendment 484 to the 1888 Guidelines, would not comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which directs courts to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\"><em>Mueller </em>does not indicate that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Minter\u2019s second 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>63 F.3d 350, 351 (5th Cir.1995) (district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under section 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion). We have carefully examined the district court\u2019s prior decision in light of <em>Mueller. </em>The <em>Mueller </em>panel specifically noted in its holding in which it vacated the district court\u2019s ruling on an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that it was not implying \u201cthat the district court lacks discretion to consider appropriate factors, such as those set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), in making its decision whether to reduce Muller\u2019s sentence of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Mueller, </em>168 F.3d at 190. In Minter\u2019s case, unlike in <em>Mueller, </em>the district court\u2019s opinion on Minter\u2019s initial 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion indicates that the decision was guided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), most specifically the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">Minter has therefore failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s prior decision is clearly erroneous and would work a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>manifest injustice. <em>See Free v. Abbott Labs. Inc., </em>164 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.1999) (setting forth exceptions to the law of the case doctrine). Accordingly, the law of the case doctrine applies. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appel-lee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
