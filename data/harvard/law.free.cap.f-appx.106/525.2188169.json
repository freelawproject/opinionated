(Penford). The Union argues that its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with Penford requires arbitration of a grievance filed on behalf of a member whom Penford refused to allow to return to work after she resigned and, some two months later, claimed that her resignation was an episode of irrational behavior caused by an unspecified illness. Upon <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with the district court\u2019s resolution. <em>See Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Ironworkers v. EFCO Corp., </em>359 F.3d 954, 955 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">The district court appropriately concluded that the grievance does not present an arbitrable dispute. The CBA provides for arbitration of any matter which \u201crelates to the interpretation or application of the provisions of [the CBA].\u201d Although the Union mentioned \u201closs of seniority\u201d under the CBA in its grievance, loss of seniority is entirely collateral to the Union\u2019s principal argument \u2014 that a Union member may rescind her resignation because she tendered it while unable to make a \u201cvoluntary and competent decision\u201d to resign. This argument rests on the assertion that employee competence is a general contractual prerequisite to Penford\u2019s valid acceptance of employee resignations; it does not plausibly involve interpretation or application of the provisions of the CBA. <em>Cf. Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC. v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>300 F.3d 945, 949-50 (8th Cir.2002) (noting that the presumption in favor of arbitration does not apply to matters \u201cwhich go beyond the interpretation and application of contract terms.\u201d (citation omitted)). We are satisfied that Penford never intended to arbitrate such a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">We affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
