After he exhausted his state remedies, Hopper filed a \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court raising seven grounds for relief. The district court denied Hopper\u2019s petition in its entirety and refused to grant a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">Hopper now seeks a COA on three<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> broad grounds: (1) ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>counsel arising from a post-indictment polygraph and custodial interview that resulted in Hopper\u2019s confession to Rozanne\u2019s murder; (2) denial of his constitutional rights to counsel and silence during that custodial interview in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which would render Hopper\u2019s confession and certain after-acquired corroborating evidence inadmissible; and, (3) due process and confrontation clause violations arising from the lead investigator\u2019s surreptitious entry into a book deal about the case. We grant a COA on Hopper\u2019s ineffective assistance claim to the extent that the two-part analysis in <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is applicable. We also grant COA on Hopper\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claims, but deny COA as to all other claims. After a review of the merits, however, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief as to the ineffective assistance and <em>Miranda </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On October 4, 1983, Rozanne Gailiunas was found unconscious in the bedroom of her home. She had been brutally assaulted and shot twice in the head. Rozanne never regained consciousness and died a few days later. Her murder went unsolved for several years until a tip to the police suggested that Rozanne\u2019s murder was arranged by Joy Aylor, the estranged wife of Rozanne\u2019s boyfriend. Police confirmed that Ms. Aylor paid $5,000 to have Rozanne killed, and were able to trace the money as it passed through the hands of several individuals. Each individual had skimmed a little of the money and passed the remainder along. The last person in this chain was Hopper, who apparently received $1,500 of the original $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The police began looking for Hopper in the summer of 1988 to discuss Rozanne\u2019s murder. At that time, the police did not know whether Hopper was Rozanne\u2019s killer. All the police knew then was that Hopper was the most recent person to receive the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Despite an attempt to flee from justice, Hopper was arrested on December 20, 1988 and arraigned the following day. But counsel was not appointed and Hopper made no request for counsel at that arraignment. On December 22, 1988, and despite his lack of counsel, Hopper contacted Detective McGowan offering to cooperate. Hopper admitted that he had received the money to kill Rozanne, and that he had passed $1,000 of that money on to a drug dealer named \u201cChip.\u201d Hopper also gave Detective McGowan a description of Chip as well as information regarding Chip\u2019s usual haunts.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Hopper was not appointed counsel until December 27, six days after his arraignment and five days after he first willingly spoke with Detective McGowan and gave the detective the \u201cChip story.\u201d Jan Hemphill, the appointed counsel met with Hopper several times over the next few weeks as well as with the prosecution. The prosecution informed Hemphill of its intent to seek the death penalty for Joy Aylor as well as the shooter. The prosecution also told Hemphill that it was willing to work with all of the middlemen in the chain to get those two death penalty convictions. The record shows that Hemphill repeatedly advised Hopper of the prosecution\u2019s plans and discussed with him the risks of cooperation. The record also shows that Hemphill advised Hopper that her advice was based on the information that Hopper gave her.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>On February 21, 1989, Hopper again contacted Detective McGowan and informed the detective of his intent to cooperate. Hopper also told Detective McGowan that he had spoken with Hemphill and that Hemphill had given Hopper permission to contact the police. Detective McGowan then called the prosecution who verified with Hemphill that Hopper had her permission to talk with the police. The prosecution also secured Hemphill\u2019s consent to give Hopper a polygraph examination, and a blanket consent to talk to Hopper in the future without having to contact her first.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The following day, on February 22,1989, Hopper met with Detective McGowan. Hopper was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and after waiving those rights, Hopper completed a six-page written statement detailing and supplementing the story he had previously given to Detective McGowan that inculpated the drug dealer Chip. After this interview, Hopper was told that the story would be verified by a polygraph examination to be scheduled in the upcoming few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Hopper was given a polygraph examination on February 27, 1989. Prior to this examination, he was again read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After being told that the polygraph examination indicated falsity, and after receiving a fresh <em>Miranda </em>recitation, Hopper was questioned by Detective McGowan. The detective asked Hopper to tell the his story once again, starting at the beginning. After Hopper recounted the \u201cChip story,\u201d Detective McGowan told Hopper that McGowan believed Hopper was not telling the police the entire story. Detective McGowan then showed Hopper a picture of Chip and told Hopper that the police were close to locating Chip. The detective asked Hopper what would happen if the police questioned Chip and Chip passed a polygraph. Hopper said that the investigation would \u201clead back to me [Hopper]\u201d and asked \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d The detective responded, \u201cAndy, I want the truth now.\u201d After a brief pause, Hopper admitted that he killed Rozanne Gailiunas. He subsequently gave a factually detailed confession, which was both audio and videotaped. This confession, along with corroborating physical evidence, including the gun used to shoot Rozanne, were admitted into evidence at Hopper\u2019s trial. Additionally, testimony regarding an independent confession Hopper made to a jailhouse informant and an admission of guilt in a letter Hopper wrote to a close friend were admitted into evidence along with his police confession. The testimony of the jailhouse informant closely tracked the confession that Hopper gave to the police. The letter admission of guilt was not detailed, but in that letter Hopper wrote \u201cI am the one who killed this person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">At trial, Hopper vigorously challenged the admissibility of the confession and argued a causation theory to the jury. Hopper\u2019s counsel admitted that Hopper was at the scene when Rozanne was shot and implicitly admitted that Hopper shot her. Using the results of a post-mortem toxicology test showing that Rozanne had a significant amount of Thorazine, a sedative, in her blood when she died, Hopper argued that it was the Thorazine that actually killed her instead of the bullet that entered her brain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hopper\u2019s theory, supported by an expert witness, was that the Thorazine exacerbated the brain swelling that Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>zanne would have suffered from the bullet wound and made that brain swelling ultimately fatal. The prosecution presented its own expert testimony that contradicted Hopper\u2019s causation theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">A jury convicted Hopper of capital murder in 1992 and he was sentenced to death. After Hopper was convicted, prosecutors became aware that Detective McGowan had entered into an agreement to work on a book about the murder of Rozanne Gaili-unas. Evidence adduced in 1994 showed that Detective McGowan first considered the idea prior to Hopper\u2019s arrest and entered into an oral agreement to collaborate with a writer in late 1989 or early 1990, long after Hopper had confessed. However, a written agreement of collaboration was signed prior to Hopper\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Hopper\u2019s conviction and sentence but did not consider the newly discovered evidence of Detective McGowan\u2019s book deal. <em>Hopper v. State, </em>No. 71,477 (Tex.Crim.App. Nov. 5, 1997) (unpublished). Hopper did not seek a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court, but instead, Hopper filed a state application for habeas corpus. The trial judge expanded the record to include the detective\u2019s book deal evidence, and entered findings of fact as well as conclusions of law in denying relief. The trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions on Hopper\u2019s state habeas application were adopted by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in denying habeas relief. <em>Ex parte Hopper, </em>No. 23,168-02 (Tex.Crim.App. Mar. 1, 2000)(unpublished). On March 20, 2000, Hopper filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Hopper\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under AEDPA, Hopper must obtain a COA before he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a COA is not granted, we lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of Hopper\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">To obtain a COA, Hopper must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Making such a showing requires Hopper to demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">In <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>the Supreme Court instructed, as it previously held in <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>that we should \u201climit [our] examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [the petitioner\u2019s] claims.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court observed that \u201ca COA ruling is not the occasion for a ruling on the merit of petitioner\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>...\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, our COA determination must be based on \u201can overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThis threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not have jurisdiction to justify our denial of a COA based on an adjudication of the actual merits of the claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we cannot deny an \u201capplication for a COA merely because [we believe] the applicant will not demonstrate an entitlement to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Even if we grant Hopper\u2019s application for COA, Hopper is not necessarily entitled to habeas relief. \u201cTo prevail on a petition for writ of habeas corpus, a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court proceeding \u2018resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States ... if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A state court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolves an unreasonable application of [] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States ... if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">In making the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d inquiry, this court must determine whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2018We have no authority to grant habeas corpus relief simply because we conclude, in our independent judgment, that a state supreme court\u2019s application of [federal law] is erroneous or incorrect.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cThe federal habeas scheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for these judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention only when a state court decision is objectively unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">Finally, for Hopper to be entitled to habeas relief based on a constitutional \u201ctrial\u201d error, he must demonstrate not only that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, but also that it was harmful under the standard set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Brecht v. </em>Abrahamson.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cUnder <em>Brecht, </em>a federal court may grant habeas relief on account of constitutional error only if it determines that the constitutional error had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">(1) Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Hopper first seeks a COA on his claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to be present at, or negotiate an agreement with prosecutors to limit the scope of, the post-indictment polygraph examination and interview. In order to establish his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Hopper must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he was actually prejudiced by the deficient performance.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Deficient performance is determined by examining whether the challenged representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201cSo long as counsel made an adequate investigation, any strategic decisions made as a result of that investigation fall within the wide range of objectively reasonable professional assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cA conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy cannot be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if Hopper establishes that Hemphill\u2019s performance was deficient, he must also establish that \u201cprejudice caused by the deficiency is such that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> To do this, Hopper must show that the prejudice rendered the trial \u201cfundamentally unfair or unreliable.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Because defendants have a right to counsel at all critical stages of a proceeding,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> reasonable jurists might debate whether Hemphill\u2019s decision not to attend the polygraph session or limit the scope of the examination falls outside the wide range of objectively reasonable professional assistance. Because confessions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201clike no other evidence\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and highly damaging to a criminal defendant,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> reasonable jurists might also debate the existence of actual prejudice in this case. Therefore, a COA is warranted on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Despite our grant of COA, we find sufficient reason in the record to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a fair assessment of counsel\u2019s performance requires a reviewing court to \u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Moreover, there is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We have held that counsel is not constitutionally ineffective for failing to discover, and make strategic decisions based on, evidence that a defendant consciously withholds from counsel.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The constitution does not require perfect knowledge from counsel, and we cannot evaluate Hemp-hill\u2019s conduct under the distorting lens of hindsight.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Hopper knew that the \u201cChip story\u201d was false, began cooperating with the police prior to having counsel appointed, and still sought to talk to police after learning from his counsel that the prosecution intended to seek the death penalty for the shooter. Hopper also knew that Hemphill\u2019s acquiescence in his second decision to cooperate with the police was based on her knowledge of only the \u201cChip story.\u201d Yet, Hopper still made the decision to talk to the police for a second time. While in an ideal world, counsel would have perfect knowledge and unlimited time in which to interview clients and formulate trial strategy, that is not what the constitution requires.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> \u2018We will not find inadequate representation merely because, with the benefit of hindsight, we disagree with counsel\u2019s strategic choices.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">The Texas courts relied upon relevant and well-settled federal precedent and noted that the choices made by Hemphill were reasonable based upon the information that she had before her, and she kept Hopper reasonably informed of the consequences of cooperation with the police. Hopper\u2019s failing of the polygraph exam and subsequent confession were regrettable from a defense perspective but also reasonably unforeseeable under the totality of circumstances. Therefore, finding no unreasonable application of the <em>Strickland </em>deficient performance standard, and concluding that it need not consider the preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>dice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test in the absence of a constitutionally deficient performance,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the district court properly denied habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">(2) Custodial Denial of Right to Silence and Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Hopper also seeks a COA on his claim that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated because Detective McGowan did not cease questioning Hopper when he asked \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d during the post-polygraph interview on February 27, 1989. Hopper claims that this failure renders the highly detailed and corroborated confession he made within moments of asking that question inadmissible. Hopper argues that his question \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d is both a request to remain silent and a request for counsel and the admission of his confession at trial therefore violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Under <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a statement made by a person in custody is inadmissible unless that person was informed that he has the right to have an attorney present during questioning, the right to remain silent, and that anything that the person says may be used against him.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> A person may waive these rights, so long as the waiver is knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, police must scrupulously honor a person\u2019s unambiguous invocation of these rights,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and once invoked, the police may not make any further attempts to elicit statements from that person unless that person initiates further communication.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But ambiguous assertions of the right to counsel<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and the right to silence<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> are not sufficient to trigger the cessation of police questioning. Under <em>Davis v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the test is whether a reasonable police officer would understand the request to be an invocation of a constitutionally guaranteed right under the circumstances in which the request is made.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court held that a suspect\u2019s statement, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer\u201d uttered over an hour and a half into a custodial interrogation when he had previously waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights was an ambiguous assertion of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Expressly declining to \u201crequire law enforcement officers to cease all questioning\u201d when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the Court held that once a suspect validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, police questioning could continue until the suspect \u201cclearly requests an attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Because the application of the <em>Davis </em>test to Hopper\u2019s statements requires an assessment of not only the words he spoke, but also a determination of what a reasonable police officer would have understood those words to mean in the circumstances in which Hopper spoke them,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> we find that reasonable jurists might debate whether the district court should have resolved the issue in a different manner. Therefore, a COA is warranted on Hopper\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Despite our grant of COA on these claims, we find sufficient reason in the record to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. Both the district court and the Texas state courts considered whether the statements made by Hopper and his decision to cooperate without the presence of his counsel were voluntary and whether the question \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d was sufficient to require the cessation of the post-polygraph interview under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis. </em>Hopper does not articulate a challenge to the voluntariness determinations made by the Texas state court and the district court in this case. He also he does not challenge the district and state courts\u2019 use of the <em>Davis </em>test in determining whether his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated. Hopper does, however, contend that the courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when they determined that his confession was admissible because his question \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d was too ambiguous to invoke his rights to remain silent and to counsel. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"AkC\">In this case, Hopper first contacted Detective McGowan on December 22, 1988 after he was arraigned. Hopper made this contact and offered to talk before he had even been appointed counsel and did, in fact, talk. After Hopper was appointed counsel, Hopper still sought to cooperate and contacted the detective a second time. Hopper, knowing that cooperation was only in his best interest if he was not Rozanne\u2019s killer, met with the detective and gave the police a second voluntary statement on February 22, 1989. Despite receiving a <em>Miranda </em>rights recitation on each occasion, the record shows that Hopper made no request for counsel and never elected to sit there and simply remain silent. It was not until his third meeting with Detective McGowan, on February 27, 1989, after he: (1) took the polygraph; (2) was told he failed that polygraph; ^received another <em>Miranda </em>warning; and (4) agreed to speak and spoke with Detective McGowan again without his counsel present, that Hopper asked \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d Yet this question came not at the beginning of that day\u2019s meeting or at the initiation of a first custodial interview. Instead it came after a fourth recitation of the \u201cChip story\u201d and after Hopper was confronted with a picture of Chip. When Detective McGowan responded, \u201cAndy, I want the truth now,\u201d Hopper immediately confessed to killing Rozanne Gailunas.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">On direct appeal, as well as in the state habeas proceedings, the Texas courts applied the test set forth in <em>Davis v. United </em>States<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and compared Hopper\u2019s question to statements found to be ambiguous by Texas and other state courts.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Davis and the comparison, the Texas courts held Hopper\u2019s question was an ambiguous invocation of his rights to counsel and silence under the circumstances in which Hopper asked that question. The Texas courts concluded that under the rule set forth in <em>Dams, </em>the police would not have reasonably understood that Hopper was invoking his rights to counsel and silence, and therefore Hopper\u2019s subsequent confession was admissible at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">While <em>Davis </em>expressly applies to the question of whether a defendant has invoked his right to counsel, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has expressly held that <em>Davis </em>applies in cases where the question is whether a person has invoked his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But this court has twice held that a state court does not run afoul of clearly established federal law when it applies <em>Davis </em>in such circumstances.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Moreover, if the statement \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer\u201d made in <em>Davis </em>is an ambiguous request for counsel insufficient to warrant cessation of police questioning,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the question \u201cCan I go back and think about it?\u201d uttered in the specific circumstances of this case is also an ambiguous query which does not require that the interrogation cease.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">In light of our precedents<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and the specific circumstances in this case, we cannot conclude that the state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in concluding that Hopper\u2019s confession was admissible because he failed to clearly invoke either his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>or right to silence in order to stop the police questioning. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief with respect to both of Hopper\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">(3) The Book Deal</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Hopper contends that a COA should be granted on whether his due process rights under <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> as well as his rights under the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause were violated because his defense counsel was not informed that Detective McGowan signed an agreement to write a book about the case prior to trial. Hopper also contends that the existence of this book deal constitutes structural error not subject to harmless error review under <em>Brecht. </em>We deny COA on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">First, Hopper is not entitled to relief under the confrontation clause. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause is not so much a requirement for the disclosure of certain types of evidence as it is a guarantee that a criminal defendant have the opportunity to physically face the individuals testifying against him.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Hence, the confrontation clause is not a guarantee for effective cross-examination.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Instead, it is a guarantee of an opportunity for effective cross-examination.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Only in instances where cross-examination is limited by a specific statutory or court-imposed restriction do the protections of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause come into play.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In this case, the non-disclosure of the book deal was not due to the operation of any Texas state law or any specific trial court\u2019s ruling. Rather, the non-disclosure was due to Detective McGowan\u2019s decision to remain silent about the deal and there is no evidence that the prosecution knew of the detective\u2019s conflict of interest until well after Hopper\u2019s trial. In light of these facts and the relevant Supreme Court precedent,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> reasonable jurists could not debate whether Hopper\u2019s claim based on the confrontation clause should have been decided differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">Second, Hopper has not established a <em>Brady </em>violation. In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court held that an accused\u2019s due process rights are violated when evidence that is material to either the guilt or punishment phase of a trial is suppressed.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Material evidence is evidence that has a reasonable probability of altering the result of the trial or sentence.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The measure of that \u201creasonable probability\u201d for <em>Brady </em>claims is when the evidence suppressed, in light of the entire record, undermines confidence in the verdict or sentence imposed.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Under <em>Brady, </em>the prosecution is required to provide the defense any available exculpatory evidence or impeachment evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>dence.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In order to state a claim under <em>Brady, </em>a habeas petitioner must establish that: (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence; (2) the evidence was favorable to the accused because it was exculpatory or impeaching; (3) the evidence was material to either guilt or punishment.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Because <em>Brady\u2019s </em>suppression prong encompasses evidence withheld by the police even if the prosecution was unaware of its existence,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Texas conceded at the state habeas proceeding, as it does here, that the book deal evidence was suppressed and could have been used to impeach Detective McGowan\u2019s testimony. The relevant question then becomes whether the book deal evidence is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Both the state habeas court and the district court found that it was not. Both courts looked at the entirety of the record, which included testimony regarding Hopper\u2019s confession by a police officer other than Detective McGowan, a jailhouse confession, and a letter admission of guilt, as well as strong physical corroborating evidence. The courts also noted that the timing of Detective McGowan\u2019s book deal, which was not formalized until after Hopper\u2019s arrest and confession, did not support an inference of improper purpose in the detective\u2019s investigation or trial testimony. Furthermore, both courts examined the nature and timing of the compensation received by Detective McGowan as a result of the book deal and concluded that none of the compensation received was tied to or affected the outcome of Hopper\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"agk-dedup-0\">This court has held that a materiality determination regarding withheld impeachment evidence requires a court to look to whether the testimony of the witness who would have been impeached was corroborated by other evidence.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> As the state habeas court and the district court duly noted, the vast majority of Detective McGowan\u2019s testimony was corroborated. In addition to Hopper\u2019s police confession, there was also a jailhouse confession and a letter admitting his guilt. Furthermore, not only was there physical evidence corroborating Hopper\u2019s confession, such as the gun, Hopper did not contest at the guilt phase of the trial that he shot the victim. Instead, he argued that the shots fired were not the cause of her death. Hopper has alleged no new facts, such as evidence that Detective McGowan planted evidence or influenced the content of Hopper\u2019s confession, that undermine the confidence of Hopper\u2019s guilty verdict. And Hopper articulates no argument that the existence of the book deal had any effect on his death sentence. Therefore, under these case facts, reasonable jurists could not debate whether the evidence of Detective McGowan\u2019s book deal was sufficiently material to make out a <em>Brady </em>claim or that the district court should have resolved this issue in a different manner. Accordingly, we deny Hopper\u2019s request for a COA on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Finally, Hopper argues that the existence of the book deal constitutes structural error warranting immediate reversal of his conviction. As the district court noted, the cases Hopper used to support this claim are factually distinguishable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>do not stand for the proposition that the existence of a media deal is structural error <em>per se. </em>In fact, the Supreme Court has only identified a precious few circumstances that qualify as structural error.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> None of these rare circumstances are present in this case. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has also noted that most trial errors of constitutional magnitude should \u201cbe quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> And in denying Hopper\u2019s request for COA on this issue under <em>Brady </em>we have found that Hopper has not made a substantial showing that he was denied any constitutional right. Thus, reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court\u2019s disposition of this claim should have been resolved differently and the request for COA is concomitantly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">With respect to Hopper\u2019s claims that Hemphill provided ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>and that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated when his confession was admitted at trial, we GRANT his application for COA. But we conclude that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on these claims, and we therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of relief. We also DENY Hopper\u2019s application for COA on his other claims. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">COA GRANTED IN PART; COA DENIED IN PART; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth 5th Cir.

But the fourth issue is not an independent issue warranting separate review. Instead, this issue centers on the argument that the state courts and the district court have unreasonably applied the relevant legal standards and settled constitutional law in reviewing Hopper\u2019s claims. Because this is not truly an issue, but rather a general standard of review for habeas claims, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), this court will not treat Hopper\u2019s fourth \"issue\u201d independently in this opinion.
