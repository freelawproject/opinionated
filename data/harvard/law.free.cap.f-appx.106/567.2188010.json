We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Stoneman contends that his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution were violated when, in answer to a question by Stone-man\u2019s counsel, an officer said that Stone-man had indicated that he thought he wanted an attorney. Stoneman relies upon <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), for that proposition. <em>See also Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 295 &amp; n. 13, 106 S.Ct. 634, 640\u201441 &amp; n. 13, 88 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>123 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kallin, </em>50 F.3d 689, 693 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Stoneman points to no authority that a brief passing reference like the one at hand, elicited by his own counsel and never again referred to or relied upon at trial, constitutes a <em>Doyle </em>violation. <em>See Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 763\u201464, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 3108, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987); <em>McMillan v. Gomez, </em>19 F.3d 465, 469\u201470 (9th Cir.1994); <em>cf. Killian v. Poole, </em>282 F.3d 1204, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (extensive references to post arrest silence); <em>United States v. Newman, </em>943 F.2d 1155, 1157\u2014 58 (9th Cir.1991) (same). Moreover, even if there were a technical error, it is plain on this record that there was no substantial and injurious effect upon the verdict. <em>See O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 435 \u2014 36, 115 S.Ct. 992, 994, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995); <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).
