We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because it identified material inconsistencies between Si-dhu\u2019s declarations and testimony that go to the heart of his asylum claim, including the name of the political group to which he claimed membership and whether he filed a complaint against the police. <em>See Val-derrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam). Accordingly, we do not reach the issue whether the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Sidhu also lacks an objective, well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">Because Sidhu failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-18\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Sidhu\u2019s contention that he is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to exhaust the issue. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
