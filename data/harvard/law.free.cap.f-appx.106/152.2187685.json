R. Civ. P. 60(b), as an initial motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and its denial of the motion. Randolph correctly asserts that, prior to its recharacterization, the district court was required to, but did not, give him notice of its intent to recharacterize the motion, warn him that the effect of the recharacterization is that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d motions, and provide him with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">However, we find no reversible error in this case. The mandate of this court affirming Randolph\u2019s conviction and sentence issued on April 18, 1997. Randolph did not file the pleading at issue, in which he clearly seeks habeas relief, until December 29, 2003, well beyond the one-year statute of limitations applicable to habeas petitions. Thus, even if the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>had provided Randolph with the requisite notice and warnings required under <em>Castro </em>and <em>Emmanuel, </em>Randolph could not have salvaged any habeas claim. <em>See, e.g., Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d at 650 (providing that where the failure to provide notice to mov-ant results in no adverse consequences, such failure is harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">A final order in a \u00a7 2255 action is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Randolph may satisfy this requirement by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Randolph has not made the requisite showing because, under <em>Emmanuel, </em>the district court\u2019s dispositive procedural ruling is not reasonably debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Randolph\u2019s appeal. However, we note that in the event Randolph subsequently files a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court\u2019s failure to provide Randolph with the requisite warnings associated with recharacterizing his pleading as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion precludes the court from considering Randolph\u2019s presently recharacterized \u00a7 2255 motion as his first such motion and applying the succes-siveness restrictions under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Castro, </em>540 U.S. at-, 124 S. Ct. at 793. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
