We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that no extraordinary circumstances excused Bernal\u2019s untimely asylum application. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review of her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">As to Bernal\u2019s contentions regarding the denial of withholding of removal, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the killings of Bernal\u2019s relatives and the threatening phone calls she received were not on account of political opinion or membership in a particular social group. <em>See Molina-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1094-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Bernal\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations violate due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carache v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure does not violate an alien\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We need not address Bernal\u2019s contention that the IJ improperly made an adverse credibility determination because we conclude that the IJ did not make an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d 1070, 1074 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The IJ properly denied relief under CAT because Bernal failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if removed to Colombia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
