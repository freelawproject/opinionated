The district court had diversity jurisdiction over this state-law action for libel, false light, misappropriation of identity, and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332 &amp; 1441. We exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The defendants contend that the district court properly dismissed the complaint because (1) the plaintiffs failed to file their complaint within New Jersey\u2019s applicable statutes of limitations, and (2) the complaint does not state a valid claim as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because we agree that the complaint does not state a valid claim under New Jersey law, we need not reach the defendants\u2019 timeliness challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">To state a valid claim for libel, a plaintiff must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat the defendant made a defamatory statement of fact [in print]____\u201d <em>Taj Mahal Travel, Inc. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 186, 189 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cA defamatory statement is one that is false and injurious to the reputation of another or exposes another person to hatred, contempt or ridicule or subjects another person to a loss of the good will and confidence of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The advertisement is not libelous as a matter of state law because it cannot reasonably be construed as communicating a false message <em>concerning the plaintiffs. </em>The advertisement, which was affixed to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, depicts a fictional African-American male who turned to alcohol and \u201cwasted\u201d his mind because he could not afford a college education. The plaintiffs, who are Caucasian, do not claim that readers of the Times could reasonably draw the conclusion that they are African-Americans in need of a UNCF college scholarship. The district court properly dismissed their libel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Plaintiffs contend that the advertisement places them in a false light as \u201calcoholics\u201d and \u201cderelicts.\u201d \u201cThe interest protected by the duty not to place another in a false light is that of the individual\u2019s peace of mind, i.e., his or her interest in not being made to appear before the public in an objectionable false light or false position, or in other words, otherwise than as he is.\u201d <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 N.J. 282, 537 A.2d 284, 294 (N.J.1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The plaintiffs stretch the advertisement\u2019s message beyond its rational limits. No reasonable person could confuse the advertisement\u2019s fictional \u201cLarry Botts\u201d for any of the three plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cmisappropriation of identity\u201d claim also fails under New Jersey law. In this case, the defendants arguably used the name \u201cLarry Botts\u201d for a commercial purpose (i.e., fundraising), but they clearly did not misappropriate the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>identity. </em>The name \u201cLarry Botts\u201d merely functions as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d or \u201cJane Roe,\u201d i.e., as a generic placeholder for the prototypical underprivileged African-American youth. Indeed, the advertisement\u2019s effectiveness as a fundraising tool would be significantly compromised if readers actually associated the name \u201cLar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ry Botts\u201d with plaintiff Lawrence Botts III \u2014 a college-educated Caucasian. As such, we affirm the district court holding that the plaintiffs fail to state a valid misappropriation of identity claim. <em>See Palmer v. Schonhorn Enterprises, Inc., </em>96 N.J.Super. 72, 232 A.2d 458, 460 (N.J.Super.Ct.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Finally, plaintiffs seek compensation for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs\u2019 tort claim fails for two reasons. First, the defendants\u2019 use of the name \u201cLarry Botts\u201d in the UNCF advertisement was not sufficiently \u201coutrageous\u201d to support a valid claim under New Jersey law. <em>See Buckley v. Trenton Saving Fund Soc\u2019y, </em>111 N.J. 355, 544 A.2d 857, 863 (N.J.1988); <em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 N.J. 490, 706 A.2d 685, 694 (N.J.1998). Second, the defendants\u2019 alleged tortious conduct was not sufficiently egregious \u201cthat no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>544 A.2d at 863, <em>quoting </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 6, cmt. j (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
