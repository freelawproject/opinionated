(\u201cSCV\u201d), and Point Lookout Prisoner of War Association (\u201cPLPOW\u201d) brought First Amendment challenges to Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) regulations that prohibit \u201cpartisan activities\u201d and \u201corations\u201d at national cemeteries. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the VA, holding that the regulations, as applied to the plaintiffs, are constitutional because they provide for reasonable restrictions on speech in a non-public forum. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the district court in part but hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider two of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Point Lookout Confederate Cemetery is administered by the VA and is located near the former Point Lookout Prison Camp, where Union forces held Confederate prisoners during the Civil War. For approximately the last twenty years, SCV and PLPOW have held formal Confederate memorial ceremonies at the cemetery. In accordance with Congress\u2019 instructions that national cemeteries \u201cshall be considered national shrines as a tribute to our gallant dead,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(c), the VA regulates \u201cdemonstrations\u201d at its facilities, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">(i) All visitors are expected to observe proper standards of decorum and decency while on VA property. Toward this end, any service, ceremony, or demonstration, except as authorized by the head of the facility or designee, is prohibited. Jogging, bicycling, sledding and other forms of physical recreation on cemetery grounds is [sic] prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-16\">(ii) For the purpose of the prohibition expressed in this paragraph, unauthorized demonstrations or services shah be defined as, but not limited to, picketing, or similar conduct on VA property; <em>any oration or similar conduct to assembled groups of people, unless the oration is part of an authorized service; </em>the display of any placards, banners, or foreign flags on VA property unless approved by the head of the facility or designee; disorderly conduct such as fighting, threatening, violent, or tumultuous behavior, unreasonable noise or coarse utterance, gesture or display or the use of abusive language to any person present; and <em>partisan activities, i.e., those involv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number><em>ing commentary or actions in support of, or in opposition to, or attempting to influence, any current policy of the Government of the United States, or any private group, association, or enterprise.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) (emphasis added). Unauthorized demonstrations or ceremonies on the premises of a national cemetery are punishable by removal from the premises and a $250 f\u00edne. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.218(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">During preparations for the 2002 ceremony, Griffin submitted proposed remarks to the VA, in which he criticized its policy of limiting the flying of the Confederate flag at national cemeteries to two days a year. Griffin\u2019s proposed speech said, \u201cThe soldiers here at Point Lookout deserve to have the banner they fought and died under flying over their graves every day as a symbol of their honor, courage, contemporary decency, and respect for their memory and spirit.\u201d Griffin also intended to speak about inadequate maintenance at the cemetery, asserting that \u201cit would appear as though Veterans Administration officials are honoring our heroic ancestors with a deliberate program of demolition by neglect\u201d and that \u201cperhaps the Veterans Administration would have some funds for this cemetery if it weren\u2019t too busy using our tax dollars to defend pernicious rules aimed squarely at disrespecting our Confederate ancestors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In .response to Griffin\u2019s submitted remarks, the VA\u2019s General Counsel wrote Griffin\u2019s lawyer saying, \u201cAs the Point Lookout Confederate Cemetery is a shrine to honor the dead, it would be inappropriate for your client to include in his remarks political statements.\u201d The letter also said that the VA \u201cexpected\u201d Griffin to \u201crevise his proposed remarks and limit them to paying tribute to those who rest within the hallowed grounds of Point Lookout Confederate Cemetery.\u201d On the same day, Deputy Under Secretary Roger Rapp wrote the SCV indicating that if Griffin delivered his proposed remarks, the SCV\u2019s ability to hold future ceremonies would be jeopardized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">In hopes of delivering the speech as originally proposed, the plaintiffs filed the underlying complaint and applied for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) the day before the 2002 memorial service. The district court denied the petition for a TRO, and Griffin delivered a revised version of the speech. At the ceremony, however, Father Alister Anderson gave a speech that the VA had not screened, in which he referred, among other things, to the \u201crise of uncontrolled feminism, the ugly, demonic sexual revolution and the ever-increasing octopus-like domination and control of the federal government.\u201d As a result, Under Secretary Rapp wrote the SCV for a second time and expressed his view that Anderson\u2019s remarks violated VA regulations because they constituted partisan activities. Rapp also objected to Anderson\u2019s \u201ccommentary on current events\u201d and his expression of \u201cpersonal views that were critical of a number of individuals and organizations.\u201d Rapp requested that, for future ceremonies, the SCV provide brief summaries of the intended remarks of any speakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Before the 2003 ceremony, Griffin again submitted proposed remarks to the VA. The VA requested that Griffin edit the remarks to delete comments regarding the VA\u2019s Confederate flag policy, including the sentences, \u201cThe government is surely right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>in allowing our flag to fly here today,\u201d and \u201cEspecially in this place, the flag should fly every day, just as it is doing this morning.\u201d The VA did not object to the phrase, \u201c[W]e are all aware that the battle flag has been misused by various groups as a symbol so utterly unworthy of what Confederate soldiers stood for and what they accomplished, that its misuse constitutes an outright atrocity.\u201d The VA also failed to object to Griffin\u2019s description of the federal government\u2019s treatment of Confederate prisoners during the Civil War as \u201cwrongful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief and granted the VA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the declaratory relief claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Plaintiffs bring as-applied challenges to \u00a7 1.218(a)(14), arguing that (1) the \u201cpartisan activities\u201d prohibition violates their First Amendment rights to engage in formal speech; (2) the \u201cpartisan activities\u201d and \u201corations\u201d prohibitions violate their First Amendment rights to engage in informal speech; (3) the prohibitions in Rapp\u2019s letter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regarding \u201cpersonal views\u201d and \u201ccommentary on current events\u201d violate the First Amendment and are improperly promulgated regulations; and (4) the VA\u2019s requirement that proposed remarks be submitted prior to the ceremony is an unconstitutional prior restraint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">We first address plaintiffs\u2019 formal speech claims. The district court found, and the parties agree, that the cemetery is a non-public forum. The government may reserve a non-public forum for its intended purpose, and speech restrictions will be upheld if they are reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. <em>Perry, </em>460 U.S. at 46; <em>Griffin I, </em>274 F.3d at 820. A reasonable restriction \u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\u201d <em>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. and Educ. Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 808, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). We determined in <em>Griffin I </em>that the purpose of the cemetery is \u201cto honor, as Americans, in tranquil and nonpartisan surroundings, those who have given their lives to the Nation.\u201d 274 F.3d 818, 821. With this purpose in mind, we will uphold the VA\u2019s application of the regulation if done in a reasonable and viewpoint-neutral manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">The plaintiffs argue that the VA applied its speech restrictions unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ably in light of the fact that the VA allowed the display of the Confederate flag on the day of the ceremony. Because the VA restricts the flying of the Confederate flag to two days a year, in an apparent recognition of the contentious nature of the flag, the plaintiffs contend that the VA necessarily opens the forum to discussion of this issue on the day of the ceremony and, accordingly, may not restrict plaintiffs\u2019 speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">We find that this argument lacks merit. By allowing the Confederate flag to fly on the day of the ceremony, the VA did not abandon its statutory directive that national cemeteries are to serve as \u201cshrines to our gallant dead\u201d nor did it undermine the cemetery\u2019s purpose of honoring the dead soldiers in \u201ctranquil and nonpartisan surroundings.\u201d To the contrary, the VA simply accommodated the plaintiffs by allowing them to display the Confederate flag in commemoration of the soldiers buried at the cemetery. Because the VA\u2019s action favored the plaintiffs, it cannot be the very thing that renders the VA\u2019s implementation of \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) unreasonable <em>as to these same plaintiffs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the VA\u2019s application of the regulation was unreasonable because the VA did not demonstrate how Griffin\u2019s proposed remarks and Anderson\u2019s comments threaten the cemetery\u2019s intended use. This argument fails, however, because the Supreme Court has said that no such determination is necessary regarding non-public forums. <em>See Perry, </em>460 U.S. at 52 n. 12 (\u2018We have not required that [proof of past disturbances or likelihood of future disturbances] be present to justify the denial of access to a non-public forum on grounds that the proposed use may disrupt the property\u2019s intended function.\u201d). Because the VA is not required to make this showing, and the plaintiffs have pointed to no other evidence that the VA acted unreasonably, we find that the VA\u2019s application of \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) as to the plaintiffs was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the VA engaged in viewpoint discrimination by objecting to pro-flag statements in Griffin\u2019s proposed speech for the 2003 ceremony while failing to object to other partisan statements in the same speech. For example, the VA did not object to Griffin\u2019s reference to \u201cwrongful former policies of the federal government in regard to the treatment of Confederate prisoners.\u201d The VA also failed to object to Griffin\u2019s criticism of groups that have \u201cmisused\u201d the Confederate flag. The plaintiffs therefore contend that the VA applied the regulation selectively to squelch their pro-flag speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">As to Griffin\u2019s comment about \u201cwrongful former policies,\u201d the regulation, which has already been upheld on a facial challenge, clearly does not apply. By its terms, \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) prohibits \u201ccommentary or actions in support of, or in opposition to ... any <em>current </em>policy of the Government of the United States or any private group, association, or enterprise.\u201d (emphasis added). Because Griffin was referring to a \u201cformer\u201d policy of the government, the regulation is inapplicable. As to Griffin\u2019s reference to the \u201cmisuse\u201d of the Confederate flag, however, we find that these comments would likely fall under the purview of the regulation because Griffin criticized current policies of private groups. Indeed, the VA would have been justified in striking this language as well. But the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in this regard suffers from a fundamental defect: their remedy, if anything, would be for the VA to strike even more of their speech, rather than allowing all speech. Under the regulation, partisan activities are prohibited, and the plaintiffs cannot seriously contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>they should be allowed to make any statement they wish, no matter how partisan, if the VA errs on the side of allowing speech when reviewing proposed remarks. We are unpersuaded, therefore, that the VA has applied \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) in such a way as to discriminate against a particular viewpoint. Accordingly, we hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for the VA on the plaintiffs\u2019 formal speech claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We turn next to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) violates the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights to engage in informal speech. The crux of the plaintiffs\u2019 informal speech claims is that the \u201cpartisan activities\u201d and \u201corations\u201d prohibitions of the regulation apply to informal gatherings, and thus, interfere with their practice of gathering in small groups to deliver prayers or tributes to Confederate soldiers. Although the VA has not applied the regulation to plaintiffs\u2019 informal speech, the plaintiffs argue that they have standing under <em>Babbitt v. United Farm, Workers Nat\u2019l Union, </em>442 U.S. 289, 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979) (holding that where the \u201cplaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder, he should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">While not expressly ruling on the question whether the plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims regarding informal speech, the district court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments failed under the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Griffin 11</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We conclude, however, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of these claims because the plaintiffs have failed to establish a \u201ccredible threat\u201d that the VA will seek to enforce the regulation against informal speech. In fact, the VA takes the position before this court that \u201cinformal, impromptu discussions among small groups of people plainly are not the same thing as orations to assembled groups.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a \u201cthreatened injury that is concrete and particularized,\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), and have failed to set forth justiciable claims. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment on the informal speech claims and remand with instructions that they be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">We next address plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Rapp\u2019s second letter to Camalier Camp, written in response to Anderson\u2019s speech at the 2002 ceremony, improperly promulgated new regulations and that these regulations violate the First Amendment. In his letter, Rapp objected to Anderson\u2019s \u201ccommentary on current events\u201d and expression of \u201cpersonal views that were critical of a number of individuals and organizations.\u201d The district court determined that the VA never applied Rapp\u2019s letter to the plaintiffs, and accordingly, they failed to present a proper as-applied challenge. The district court also determined that Rapp\u2019s letter did not create additional restrictions on speech, but instead explained why Anderson\u2019s speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>was unacceptable under the terms of \u00a7 1.218(a)(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We need not decide whether Rapp\u2019s letter set forth new regulations or, if so, whether they were improperly promulgated, because the plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that the VA ever used the terms of the letter to restrict speech. Rapp\u2019s letter was a response to Anderson\u2019s speech at the 2002 ceremony, and the VA, therefore, could not have restricted speech at that ceremony based on a letter written after its occurrence. Moreover, in objecting to portions of Griffin\u2019s speech at the 2003 ceremony, the VA made no reference to Rapp\u2019s letter, relying solely on \u00a7 1.218(a)(14). Thus, the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they have been injured by the VA\u2019s application of any term in Rapp\u2019s letter. Nor have they established a \u201ccredible threat\u201d of prosecution under <em>Babbitt </em>because even if the VA plans to enforce the terms of Rapp\u2019s letter against them in the future, the screening procedure ensures that the plaintiffs will not be forced to subject themselves to criminal prosecution as the only means of seeking relief. Because the plaintiffs lack standing, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment on these claims and remand with instructions that they be dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Finally, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the VA, by requiring plaintiffs to submit proposed remarks to the VA prior to the ceremony, engaged in an unconstitutional prior restraint. The plaintiffs, relying on <em>Board of Airport Comm\u2019rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 569, 576, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 96 L.Ed.2d 500 (1987), argue that this requirement violates the First Amendment because it places unbridled discretion in the hands of VA officials. We conclude, however, that to the extent the plaintiffs bring an as-applied challenge, there is no indication in the record that VA officials looked to anything other than the terms of \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) in objecting to the plaintiffs\u2019 speech \u2014 terms which have been upheld on a facial challenge. Moreover, when considered in light of the forum\u2019s purpose of honoring those who gave their lives to the nation in tranquil and nonpartisan surroundings, <em>Griffin I, </em>274 F.3d at 821, this requirement was a reasonable response to the partisan remarks delivered by Anderson at the 2002 memorial service. To the extent that the plaintiffs bring a facial attack, we are without jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court in part, vacate in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. This is the first of two letters that Rapp sent to the Camalier Camp, the organization within the SCV that sponsors the ceremony. The Camalier Camp, however, is not a party to this suit. Because the distinction between the two organizations is not relevant for our purposes, we will refer to the Camalier Camp as \u201cSCV.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. Here, we refer to the second letter that Rapp sent to the SCV. To the extent plaintiffs are still pursuing any claim regarding Rapp\u2019s first letter, we address that claim in note 5 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">. Plaintiffs also mounted facial challenges in their complaint. The district court, however, only addressed the as-applied claims because the Federal Circuit previously held \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) constitutional on its face. <em>See Griffin v. Sec\u2019y of Veterans Affairs (\"Griffin II\"), 288 </em>F.3d 1309 (Fed.Cir.2002). To the extent that plaintiffs assert facial challenges on appeal, we do not have jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 (conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit to hear challenges to VA rulemaking); <em>Griffin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs (\"Griffin I\"), </em>274 F.3d 818, 825 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. There, in rejecting a facial challenge to \u00a7 1.218(a)(14), the court said that \u201cvisitors of ordinary intelligence reading \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) would understand what behavior was expected of them on VA property \u2014 particularly on the grounds of a national cemetery.\u201d <em>Griffin II, </em>288 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also challenged the first letter written by Rapp, which was never addressed by the district court. In that letter, Rapp objected to \"political statements\u201d in Griffin's proposed remarks for the 2002 ceremony. Because Griffin amended his remarks in response to this letter, it appears that the plaintiffs would have standing to challenge it. It is unclear, however, whether the plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred by not addressing this prior letter. To the extent that they do, we conclude that such a challenge is without merit. Rapp\u2019s use of the word \"political\u201d was clearly meant to be synonymous with the term \"partisan,\u201d and in any event, \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) explicitly provides that the list of activities included in the term \"unauthorized demonstration\u201d is nonexclusive. Moreover, the VA\u2019s application of \u00a7 1.218(a)(14) to Griffin\u2019s proposed speech at the 2002 ceremony was reasonable in light of the clearly partisan remarks that Griffin intended to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
