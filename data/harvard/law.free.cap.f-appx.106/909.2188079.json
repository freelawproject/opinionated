DeLeon\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>three theories of municipal liability are inadequate under the facts of this case. Former municipal judge Byno, not the City, made the decisions not to provide DeLeon with an indigency hearing, not to inform her of her right to counsel, and not to appoint counsel for her. We reject the contention that the City had the power to set judicial policy for a municipal judge, such as Byno, or that it could have ratified a municipal judge\u2019s judicial conduct, even if its policymakers knew of the judge\u2019s conduct and approved of it. <em>See Eggar v. City of Livingston, </em>40 F.3d 312, 316 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also Johnson, </em>958 F.2d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">DeLeon also contends that the City is hable because her incarceration was part of a conspiracy between Byno and the city council. DeLeon\u2019s complaint states, in a conclusory fashion, that \u201cthe individual Defendants conspired to violate the civil rights of DeLeon ... and to deprive her[ of] equal protection under the law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statement is clearly insufficient to put the defendants on notice of her claims; it does little more than state legal conclusions. DeLeon\u2019s factual allegations, found elsewhere in her complaint, do not support her theories. She does not allege that Byno had any sort of agreement with members of the city council. Her factual allegations regarding Byno and the city council, rather, are that \u201c[a]fter receiving numerous complaints from citizens about Byno, the City Council gave him a raise.\u201d DeLeon Compl. at 14. But this does not support a conclusion that Byno and city council members had an agreement beforehand to violate DeLeon\u2019s civil rights or to deprive her of equal protection under the law. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1343 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that a plaintiff bringing a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy suit must allege the existence of an agreement to commit an illegal act); <em>Green v. State Bar of Tex., </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1089 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that a plaintiff bringing a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy suit must allege the existence of an agreement to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws). Consequently, we find that the district court correctly dismissed DeLeon\u2019s conspiracy claims under \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">DeLeon also seeks to hold individual city council members<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> responsible for her incarceration. She argues that their liability stems either from their ratification of Byno\u2019s conduct or from their conspiracy with Byno. But city council members could not \u201cratify\u201d Byno\u2019s conduct because Byno was not a subordinate of the city council and city council members had no authority to control Byno\u2019s judicial actions. <em>Cf. Eggar, </em>40 F.3d at 316. Furthermore, as explained above, DeLeon\u2019s allegations re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>garding a conspiracy between Byno and the city council are inadequate because she does not aver that the parties had an agreement before the fact to violate her rights. Consequently, the district court properly dismissed DeLeon\u2019s claims against the members of the city counsel in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Finally, we hold that the district court correctly dismissed DeLeon\u2019s claims against Byno in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Byno\u2019s actions were judicial in nature and, in performing these actions, Byno did not act in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. Thus, Byno is protected from liability by absolute judicial immunity. <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>765 F.2d 517, 522-25 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>Sparks v. Duval County Ranch Co., </em>604 F.2d 976, 979-80 (5th Cir.1979) (en banc), <em>aff'd sub nom. Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of DeLeon\u2019s suit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. For purposes of oral argument, this case was consolidated with twelve similar cases and heard under the name <em>Drake v. City of Haltom City, </em>No. 03-10594, 2004 WL 1777144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-21\">. DeLeon\u2019s complaint alleges that her constitutional rights were also violated during her incarceration. She does not, though, appeal the district court's dismissal of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-22\">. In addition to damages, DeLeon's complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. De-Leon, however, lacks standing to seek prospective relief. <em>See Johnson v. Moore, </em>958 F.2d 92, 94-95 (5th Cir. 1992). Consequently, we will only consider DeLeon's claims for damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b933-6\">. DeLeon\u2019s complaint originally included class allegations, wherein she made additional allegations regarding the conspiracy between Byno and the city council. DeLeon's class allegations were, however, dismissed by the district court because DeLeon failed to move for certification of a class within ninety days of filing her complaint. DeLeon does not challenge this dismissal on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">. In any event, DeLeon has not stated a claim under \u00a7 1985(3) because she alleges that the conspiracy was motivated by bias towards the poor, but the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1985(3) does not reach conspiracies motivated by bias towards others on account of their economic status. <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., Local 610 v. Scott, </em>463 U.S. 825, 837, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b933-12\">. A suit against city council members in their official capacities is, in reality, a suit against the City. <em>See Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). Thus, the preceding analysis regarding the City\u2019s liability applies to DeLeon\u2019s official-capacity claims against city council members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b934-15\">. DeLeon does not appeal the dismissal of her claims against Byno in his official capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
