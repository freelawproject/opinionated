During those negotiations, Jimenez admitted to prosecutors that he possessed a firearm, which he kept in the same apartment where he stored most of his cocaine inventory. This admission effectively prevented Jimenez from showing he was eligible for \u201csafety valve\u201d consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In his plea agreement, Jimenez agreed not to appeal any sentence at or below 120 months. This Court will generally enforce such waivers, even for possibly incorrect sentences, unless the waiver falls into a \u201cvery circumscribed area\u201d of exceptions. <em>United States v. Gomez-Perez, </em>215 F.3d 315, 319 (2d Cir.2000). None of these exceptions applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">This Court has also generally enforced such waivers when the basis of a defendant\u2019s appeal is ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. Monzon, </em>359 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.2004). Moreover, in <em>Monzon, </em>this Court specifically stated that a future claim of ineffective assistance is waived when, as here, it attacks the <em>sentence </em>itself and not the underlying plea agreement that supported the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Based on his waiver of the right to appeal, Jimenez\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the district court is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
