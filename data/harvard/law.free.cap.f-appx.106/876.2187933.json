Womack appeals the district court\u2019s rulings relative to an evidentiary hearing held on June 11, 2003. Only Womack\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s rulings on his motions for return of property, for a government accounting, and for appointment of counsel are properly before this court for consideration. <em>See </em>Local Rule 34(b). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order reflecting its rulings relative to the motions at issue. We dismiss as moot Womack\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion for return of property because the district court granted the motion. We affirm the district court\u2019s denials of Womack\u2019s motions for a government accounting and for appointment of counsel on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Womack, </em>No. CR-00-27; CA-00-236 (D.S.C. Feb. 11, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
