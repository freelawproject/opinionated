He appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 federal habeas petition challenging that conviction. The district court denied Hunt\u2019s petition on the basis that: Hunt admitted he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion; he could not meet the requirements for filing a successive habeas petition; and his \u00a7 2241 petition was merely an attempt to circumvent those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">The district court erred, however, because Hunt did not acknowledge the previous filing of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and there is no record of Hunt having done so. Although that basis for the denial is erroneous, we may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Real Property, </em>123 F.3d 312, 313 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Hunt\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was properly denied on the ground that he failed to show that his remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
