Hall, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b767-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b767-24\">Plaintiff-Appellant Garraway appeals the judgment of the district court (McA-voy, <em>J.) </em>dismissing a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action that Garraway brought against Defendant-Appellee Julian. The suit claimed Julian had failed to release a dog that Garraway said was his. In 2000, a dog control officer and a New York State trooper seized the dog and placed it with the Broome County Humane Society in Binghamton, New York. Sometime later, when the trooper allegedly ordered the release of the dog, Julian, the administrator of the Humane Society, refused to comply. Garraway then sought legal redress, first in state court and later in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-25\">The district court decided the case on two grounds. First, it found Garraway\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>suit to be collaterally estopped because the New York State Supreme Court had ruled that the dog did not belong to Garraway, and that, as a result, Garraway lacked standing \u201cto pursue legal claims arising from the alleged wrongful withholding of [another person\u2019s] dog[].\u201d Second, the district court determined that Julian was not a state actor and therefore was not capable of being sued under section 1983. Finding that Garraway raised no new claims, the court also denied Garraway\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">On appeal, Garraway proffers many arguments addressing issues of state action, but does not challenge the district court\u2019s collateral estoppel finding. Because that unchallenged holding is sufficient to support a dismissal of Garraway\u2019s claim and because the district court was correct in denying reconsideration, Garraway\u2019s appeal is unavailing. <em>See Green v. Mazzuc-ca, </em>377 F.3d 182 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Kaminski v. United States, </em>339 F.3d 84, 85 n. 1 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers, Local Union No. S-251 v. Thys-senkrupp Elevator Mfg., Inc., </em>365 F.3d 523, 526-27 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We have considered all of Garraway\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
