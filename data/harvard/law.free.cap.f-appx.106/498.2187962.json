Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b520-20\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">Carl Davis sued his former employer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., and three of its employees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17, and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging discrimination and harassment on the basis of his race and retaliation for complaining about the discrimination and harassment. The district court granted summary judgment to Sears, pointing out that Davis\u2019s failure to respond to the Local Rule 56.1 Statement submitted by Sears constituted an admission of facts contained in that document, which defeated his claim. The claims Davis brought under \u00a7 1983 also failed, the district court noted, because Davis offered no evidence that Sears had acted under color of state law. Finally, the district court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the three employees because Davis had never served them with notice of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On appeal Davis does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusions or present any legal argument. A litigant must comply with Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9), which requires that an appellant\u2019s brief contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d We construe pro <em>se </em>filings liberally, <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001), and have examined Davis\u2019s brief searching for any challenge to the district court\u2019s decision, but his brief consists largely of narrative that ignores the effect of his failure to contest the Local Rule 56.1 Statement from Sears, and is not responsive to the district court\u2019s analysis. Although we \u201care generally disposed toward providing a litigant the benefit of appellate review,\u201d we will not craft a litigant\u2019s arguments or perform legal research for him. <em>Id. </em>By failing to comply with Rule 28(a)(9), Davis has forfeited appellate review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Mathis v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998). The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
