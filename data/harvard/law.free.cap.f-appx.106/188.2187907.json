We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s orders and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the Essiens failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in a protected category, as necessary to qualify for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of the Essiens\u2019 applications for withholding of deportation and/or removal. The standard for receiving withholding is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As the Essiens failed to establish refugee status, they cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation or removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Ubong Essien petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision denying suspension of deportation under former INA \u00a7 244(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (1994). Section 309(c)(4)(E) of the IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules provides that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section ... 244.\u201d This court \u201cmay review all aspects of the BIA\u2019s decision except those that are committed to its discretion by law.\u201d <em>Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001). Any \u201cdecision with respect to whether extreme hardship is established is a discretionary one [that the Court] may not review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the immigration judge denied the application for suspension of deportation based on his finding that Ubong Essien failed to demonstrate extreme hardship; the Board affirmed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that ground. Thus, the decision is not renewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as to the denial of Essien\u2019s request for suspension of deportation. The remainder of the petition for review is denied. We also deny Essien\u2019s motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-13\"> Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009, effective April 1, 1997, because Ubong Essien's case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
