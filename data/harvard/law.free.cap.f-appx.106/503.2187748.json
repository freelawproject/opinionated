While at the Illinois River Correctional Center in early 1999, he was banned from religious activities for two months because of his \u201ccontinual preaching in Bible studies as well as complaints by Volunteers concerning [his] excessive speaking.\u201d His disciplinary troubles continued at the Southwestern Illinois Correctional Center, where he was reprimanded for possessing reading materials (a Bible) in the prison cafeteria and was required to use the term \u201chigher power\u201d instead of \u201cGod\u201d at his substance abuse counseling sessions. His behavior during choir practice (grabbing the microphone to preach) and Bible study class (repeatedly interrupting the instructor and other inmates) led to disciplinary tickets for abuse of privilege, violation of rules, insolence, and disobeying orders, for which he received increasingly stiff sanctions: a verbal reprimand, a one-week suspension of gym and yard privileges, and finally one month in segregation arid a demotion in grade. Later, after a transfer to the Pinckneyville Correctional Center, Mr. Dupree was removed from a church service for disruptive behavior, and received tickets (later expunged as unsubstantiated) in connection with his work at the prison cafeteria \u2014 one for allegedly disobeying an order not to participate in a prayer circle, and one for inadequate performance of his work responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Mr. Dupree filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that various prison officials, by limiting and sanctioning his religious activities, interfered with his right to practice his religion. Prior to service on the defendants, the district court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), deeming it frivolous. The court quoted <em>Canedy v. Boardman, </em>91 F.3d 30, 33 (7th Cir.1996): \u201cA prison may restrict a prisoner\u2019s ability to adhere absolutely to a particular tenet of his religion, and if the prison has sound penological interests supporting the restriction and, if those interests outweigh the prisoner\u2019s religious interests, the restriction does not violate the First Amendment.\u201d Reasoning that Mr. Dupree had simply been disciplined \u201cfor deliberately disobeying [prison] regulations,\u201d the court dismissed his claims of religious interference and thus the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">On appeal, Mr. Dupree points out that his claims were based not only on the First Amendment, but also on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc to cc-5. That statute, which the district court did not consider, prohibits governments from substantially burdening a prisoner\u2019s exercise of religion, even by a rule of general applicability, unless that burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> RLUIPA\u2019s restraints on prison administrators go beyond the protection afforded inmates by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which requires only that an infringing practice be \u201creasonably related to a legitimate penological objective.\u201d <em>Tarpley v. Allen County, Ind., </em>312 F.3d 895, 898 (7th Cir.2002). <em>See also Lindell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>McCallum, </em>352 F.3d 1107, 1110 (7th Cir. 2003); <em>Charles v. Verhagen, </em>348 F.3d 601, 604 \u2014 05 (7th Cir.2003). RLUIPA also defines \u201creligious exercise\u201d more broadly then does traditional First Amendment jurisprudence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7) (\u201cThe term \u2018religious exercise\u2019 includes any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d); <em>Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v. City of Chicago, </em>342 F.3d 752, 760 (7th Cir.2003) (discussing the difference between the two meanings of \u201creligious exercise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Because his complaint was dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, Mr. Dupree did not have an opportunity to present evidence that the restrictions and sanctions he complained of were a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on his religious exercise. Nor were the defendant prison officials asked to demonstrate that the regulations in question were the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. Although we recognize that prisons are entitled, even required, to address disruptive behavior, we cannot say at this point whether the means used in this case to do so were proper under RLUIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">It is not even clear that Mr. Dupree has failed to state a claim under the First Amendment. The district court observed generally that \u201csound penological interests\u201d can justify a restriction that would otherwise violate the First Amendment, but it did not identify what those interests were. The defendants may be justified in banning reading material from the cafeteria, for example, or in requiring participants in a substance abuse program to use the term \u201chigher power\u201d instead of \u201cGod,\u201d but we cannot determine that in the absence of any stated rationale. <em>See Lindell v. Frank, </em>377 F.3d 655, 657-58 (7th Cir. 2004) (vacating dismissal of First Amendment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Dupree\u2019s complaint and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. Mr. Dupree\u2019s complaint also invoked the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb to bb~4, but RFRA does not apply to state and local governments, see <em>City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997); <em>O\u2019Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>349 F.3d 399, 400\u201401 (7th Cir.2003), and so is not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
