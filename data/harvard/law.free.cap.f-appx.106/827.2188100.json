Barraclough appeals her convictions and one-year probationary sentence imposed after she pled guilty to communicating a threat and reckless driving, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2000) (assimilating, respectively, N.C.GemSt. \u00a7\u00a7 14-277.1, 20-140(b) (1993)).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">Barraclough essentially asserts that her guilty plea was involuntary because the district court refused to conduct an in camera review of a social services report involving the victim of the offenses, in violation of the Confrontation and Compulsory Process Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, thereby forcing her to choose between seeking a continuance or entering a guilty plea. Because Barraclough did not move in the district court to withdraw her guilty plea, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). Our review of the transcript of the plea hearing convinces us that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Barraclough voluntarily entered her guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">Barraclough also challenges as unreasonable the district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition of probation, which required her to perform 100 hours of community service, without considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004). Barraclough did not object to her sentence; thus, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). After a thorough review of the record, we find that the district court properly considered the nature and circumstances of Barraclough\u2019s offenses, Barraclough\u2019s personal circumstances, and all other relevant factors before requiring Barraclough to perform community ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>vice. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cA court need not engage in ritualistic incantation in order to establish its consideration of a legal issue. It is sufficient if ... the district court rules on issues that have been fully presented for determination. Consideration is implicit in the court\u2019s ultimate ruling.\u201d). We therefore find no plain error in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Barraelough\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-14\"> Barraclough also was changed with assault with a deadly weapon, but the district court dismissed that charge on the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
