Gabriel relies on <em>Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>959 F.2d 307 (D.C.Cir.1992), in support of his argument that, when calculating his initial custody classification, the BOP incorrectly classified his \u201cfailure to appear\u201d for community supervision on a prior conviction as \u201cabsconding\u201d or an \u201cescape\u201d from community supervision. Gabriel argues that, due to the classification error, he was ineligible for placement in less restrictive custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In the context of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, the district court\u2019s determinations of law are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). As a general rule, inmates have no protected liberty interest in initial custodial classification. <em>See Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 435-36 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 432, 157 L.Ed.2d 310 (2003). Absent an abuse of discretion by prison officials, the custodial classification will be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Gabriel\u2019s reliance on <em>Sellers </em>is misplaced because the record in Gabriel\u2019s case contains administrative records from the BOP informing him that his classification status was consistent with the prison classification manual. <em>Cf. Sellers, </em>959 F.2d at 312 (absence of administrative records for verification purposes). The classification manual used by the BOP includes the concepts of \u201cfailure to appear\u201d and \u201cabsconding\u201d from community supervision within the broad definition of \u201cescape.\u201d Gabriel has failed to show that the BOP abused its discretion in assigning his initial custodial classification. <em>See Wilkerson, </em>329 F.3d at 436. Accordingly, because Gabriel has no constitutional right in his initial custodial classification and because the record reflects that the BOP did not abuse its discretion in assigning his initial classification, the district court did not err in denying Gabriel\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Royal, </em>141 F.3d at 599. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
