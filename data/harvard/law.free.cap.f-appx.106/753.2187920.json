District courts have wide discretion in fashioning sentences, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Livor-si </em>180 F.3d 76, 83 (2d Cir.1999), and the District Court\u2019s decision was clearly within that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>No. 04-104, 2004 WL 1713654 (U.S. <em>cert. granted </em>Aug. 2, 2004) (mem.), and <em>United States v. Fan-fan, </em>No. 04-105, 2004 WL 1713655 (U.S. <em>cert. granted </em>Aug. 2, 2004) (mem.). Should any party believe there is a special need for the District Court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fan-fan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until 14 days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. By letter to this Court dated August 5, 2004, defendant also raises a Sixth Amendment challenge under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to a 16-point enhancement to his sentence based on a previous conviction. In accordance with <em>United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2004), we reject this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
