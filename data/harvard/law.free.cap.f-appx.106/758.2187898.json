In a decision and order entered March 30, 2000, the District Court denied and dismissed the petition, and the Court entered judgment against appellant on the same date. On November 13, 2001, the District Court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which it disposed of upon remand from this Court. <em>See Brewer v. Nash, </em>5 Fed. Appx. 89 (2d Cir.2001). Pursuant to our remand order, appellant\u2019s notice of appeal which he had filed on May 4, 2000, to challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition automatically became effective upon the November 13, 2001 entry of the District Court\u2019s order disposing of appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, on December 27, 2002, we reinstated appellant\u2019s appeal challenging the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">Having now before us that challenge to the District Court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s habeas petition, we have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and found each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>them to be without merit, and we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
