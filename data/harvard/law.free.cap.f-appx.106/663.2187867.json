SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Petitioner John T. Webster, who is represented by counsel, appeals from the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">On July 21, 1995, five-year-old Tristien Hilmes died as a result of blunt force trauma to his head. Tristien lived with his mother and his stepfather, Mr. Webster. A jury convicted Mr. Webster of first degree murder (Count I) and first degree rape (Count II) in the District Court of Oklahoma County. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on Count I, and to one hundred years\u2019 imprisonment on Count II. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">After exhausting all of his state remedies, Mr. Webster timely filed his federal \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. In it he raised the same issues he raised in his direct appeal, and added several additional grounds for relief. Mr. Webster\u2019s petition was referred to a magistrate judge who, after thoroughly considering each of Mr. Webster\u2019s fourteen claims, recommended habe-as relief be denied. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied Mr. Webster\u2019s habeas petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">On appeal, Mr. Webster raises four issues. This court previously granted Mr. Webster a certificate of appealability as to all four.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends (1) there was constitutionally insufficient evidence to show that a rape was committed, (2) there was constitutionally insufficient evidence to show that he committed or permitted child abuse murder, (3) he was denied a fair trial because the trial court would not allow him to introduce evidence that another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>person could have killed Tristien, and (4) he was denied his right to present a defense because the court refused to grant a continuance in order to secure the presence of expert witness Dr. Krause or, alternatively, his trial attorneys were ineffective for failing to subpoena Dr. Krause.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs whether Mr. Webster may obtain federal habeas relief. Under AEDPA, we cannot grant habeas relief on a claim a state court adjudicated on the merits unless the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; 2254(d)(2). Additionally, we presume state court findings are correct unless the petitioner rebuts this presumption with clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Having reviewed the briefs, the record, and applicable law pursuant to the above-mentioned standard, we conclude for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s detailed and well-reasoned report and recommendation that Mr. Webster has not established his entitlement to habeas relief. Indeed, Mr. Webster\u2019s appellate brief ignores the standard governing whether a petitioner may obtain federal habeas relief, instead arguing the issues as though this were a direct criminal appeal. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s July 19, 2002, order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s April 29, 2002, report and recommendation is AFFIRMED and we DENY Mr. Webster\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-17\">. We deem abandoned the other ten issues that Mr. Webster raised in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
