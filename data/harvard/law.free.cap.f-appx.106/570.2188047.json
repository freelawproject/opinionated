Harington appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">We may not grant a petitioner habeas relief unless he has demonstrated that the state court adjudication on the merits was contrary to or an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70\u201471, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402 \u2014 03, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1518, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1067-69 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">(1) Harington first claims that, because he continuously detained his victim, his conviction for two counts of kidnaping violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. However, the Nevada Supreme Court determined that there were two abduction episodes and in the second frolic the \u201crisk of further harm to the victim over and above that existing in the [initial] crime\u201d of abduction and assault was present. <em>Stalley v. State, </em>91 Nev. 671, 675, 541 P.2d 658, 661 (1975); <em>cf. Larson v. State, </em>102 Nev. 448, 449, 725 P.2d 1214, 1214-15 (1986) (mere act of returning victim to <em>place of safety </em>not new crime). Because the Nevada Supreme Court neither whimsically nor unreasonably interpreted Nevada\u2019s kidnaping statute to authorize two counts, we must defer to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>construction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and based on that, there was no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">(2) Harington also cites several instances where his counsel allegedly provided ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">(a) On his first contention, Harington developed no evidence before the Nevada courts that the state did anything wrong in conjunction with the search of his car; thus, their determination that counsel were not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress was not unreasonable. Also, because Harington consistently admitted to having beaten the victim and to the presence of the implements, even if there was error, it was harmless. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 699-700, 104 S.Ct. at 2071.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">(b) Counsel probably should have, prior to trial, interviewed two potential witnesses who knew about Harington and the victim\u2019s sexual history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, the victim herself admitted at trial that she regularly had sexual relations with Harington following his violent episodes, yet the jury still believed that this incident was different. Therefore, the potential testimony was cumulative at best, and counsels\u2019 failure to present it did not prejudice Haring-ton\u2019s defense. <em>See Bragg v. Galaza, </em>242 F.3d 1082, 1089 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">(c) Contrary to Harington\u2019s claim, his counsel did in fact consult a toxicology and battered women\u2019s syndrome expert, but strategically chose not to pursue those defenses. Further, he does not posit how those defenses would have been successful, and the Nevada courts\u2019 conclusion that they would not have been was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">(d) Counsel\u2019s failure to present certain mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing also was a reasonable strategic choice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 699, 104 S.Ct. at 2070-71; <em>Correll v. Stewart, </em>137 F.3d 1404, 1412 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Smith v. Stewart, </em>140 F.3d 1263, 1269 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Gerlaugh v. Stewart, </em>129 F.3d 1027, 1033 (9th Cir. 1997). Moreover, the record makes it pellucid that the presentation of the evidence would not have swayed Harington\u2019s sentencing judge, who also heard his postcon-viction claims. <em>See Gerlaugh, </em>129 F.3d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">(e) Because the challenged excerpts from the government\u2019s closing were \u201cinference[s] from evidence in the record,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they did not constitute improper vouching. Even if there were some slight tinge of vouching, it was so minor that counsel were not ineffective in failing to object. <em>Necoechea </em>986 F.2d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">(3) Harington\u2019s claim that jury instruction 30 (victim consent) violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>right to due process fails as well. That instruction was, at worst, ambiguous, and other instructions clarified the elements of sexual assault and the government\u2019s obligation to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Therefore, the holding that instruction 30 did not infect Harington\u2019s trial with unfairness was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Middleton v. McNeil, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1830, 1832-33, 158 L.Ed.2d 701 (2004); <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">(4) Finally, in combination, the minor errors did not deny Harington a fair trial. <em>See Davis v. Woodford, </em>333 F.3d 982, 1007 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. <em>See Ohio v.
