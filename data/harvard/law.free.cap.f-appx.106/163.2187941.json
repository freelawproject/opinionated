Orr, Jr., was convicted of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5812, 5861(b), 5871 (2000), knowingly receiving and possessing a sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5812, 5861(c), 5871 (2000), and knowingly receiving and possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841, 5861(d), 5871 (2000). Orr was sentenced to thirty-three months incarceration, two years of supervised release, and to pay $300 in special assessments. Orr raises several issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">First, Orr asserts the district court erred in instructing the jury on a defendant\u2019s liability for willful blindness to a firearm\u2019s illegal characteristics. We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Whittington, </em>26 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.1994). Orr\u2019s claim is uncompelling. The jury instructions, taken as a whole, fairly stated the controlling law. <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>905 F.2d 784, 788-89 (4th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Schnabel, </em>939 F.2d 197, 203 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Second, Orr asserts the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. We review this claim to determine \u201cwhether there is substantial evidence (direct or circumstantial) which, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would warrant a jury finding that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. MacCloskey, </em>682 F.2d 468, 473 (4th Cir.1982). Orr\u2019s claim lacks merit. The Government introduced evidence sufficient to allow a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Third, Orr asserts the district court erred in denying his suppression motion. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on a suppression motion de novo, and the court\u2019s underlying factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). We find no error. The search warrant was valid. <em>United States v. Oloyede, </em>982 F.2d 133, 138 (4th Cir.1992). The discovery of the shotgun was a valid part of the search. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>131 F.3d 1105, 1109 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 810 (4th Cir.1996). Orr was not subjected to a custodial interrogation during the search. <em>Accord, Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). The credibility of the officers who testified regarding the search is not subject to appellate review. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). Moreover, Orr fails to establish grounds for appellate relief by asserting one of two troopers was unavailable to testify at his suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Fourth, Orr asserts the district court erred in admitting into evidence statements he and a state trooper made when the shotgun was found at his residence. We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1994). Orr\u2019s claim is uncompelling. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Fifth, Orr asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to strike two jurors for cause. We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>Poynter v. Ratcliff, </em>874 F.2d 219, 222 (4th Cir.1989). We find the district court did not err in concluding the jurors in question could be impartial. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1105 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Sixth, Orr asserts the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice based on perjury. We review this claim for clear error. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir.1995). The record supports the district court\u2019s finding of perjury, thereby justifying the enhancement. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)). (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Seventh, Orr asserts the district court erred in denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. We review this claim for clear error. <em>United States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1280 (4th Cir.1995). We find no error. The district court\u2019s perjury finding warranted denying an adjustment. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a), comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Eighth, Orr asserts the district court erred in denying him a downward departure for aberrant criminal behavior. We deny review since the record reveals the district court was aware of its authority to grant a departure, but chose not to do so. USSG \u00a7 5K2.20; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Orr\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
