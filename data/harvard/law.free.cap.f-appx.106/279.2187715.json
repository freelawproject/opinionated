After carefully reviewing the record, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">In August 1997, the Beganovics, Albanians from Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro, entered the United States on visitors\u2019 visas. Six months later, the INS served them notice to appear charging them as eligible for deportation for overstaying their visas. The Beganovics then filed an asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">In the asylum application, Ernad claimed that he was subject to both past and future persecution due to his participation in political activities with the Democratic Action Party (\u201cPDA\u201d), and Democratic League of Kosovo (\u201cLDK\u201d). Ernad alleged mistreatment or harassment by the Serbian police on five separate occasions because of his political affiliation with those groups. In sum, the allegations of fact in the asylum application are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">A. <em>First Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">In October 1991, in his hometown of Pec, Ernad joined the SDA, a secular party that advocated for the right of Albanians in Kosovo as well as other Muslims throughout then \u2014 Yugoslavia. A month later, a Serbian police officer arrested Er-nad while Ernad was hanging posters with some friends. The officer confiscated the posters and took Ernad and his friends to the police station for questioning. The young men were roughly treated by the police and Ernad claims that he was beaten for roughly half an hour. When the officers were finished asking questions, Ernad asked for the return of his posters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In response, an officer punched Ernad in the face and stomach and threatened worse if he caught Ernad again.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">B. <em>Second Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In April 1992, Serbian police officers stepped up their harassment of party members and arrested SDA\u2019s regional president, Balic. Balic was jailed for two days and was allegedly beaten. In response to Balic\u2019s arrest and the increasing police harassment of party members, the SDA was disbanded and Balic fled the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">C. <em>Third Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In 1994, after marrying Safeta and fathering Yasmin, Ernad joined LDK. He worked frequently for the party and became a editorial writer for its newsletter. In the middle of the night on February 3, 1996, Beganovic heard pounding on the door by three men he suspected were police officers though the men wore no uniform. When Ernad opened the door, one of the men, who was armed, attacked him and began to beat him. The man put his foot on Ernad to hold him down and at times dropped to his knee to punch Ernad in the face. The other two men ransacked the apartment, yelling, \u201cWhere are your guns? Where are your friends? Where\u2019s your damned paper?\u201d One of the men threatened to throw Safeta and Yasmin off of the apartment\u2019s balcony if she and Yas-min did not quit screaming. After beating Ernad sufficiently enough to leave welts and bruises on his body and destroying most of the Beganovics\u2019 possessions in the apartment, the men left.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">D. <em>Fourth Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">In June of 1996' four uniformed officers came to Ernad\u2019s apartment and took him to the police station. The police questioned Ernad about LDK and its officers. When Ernad did not give the officers any specific information, he was taken into a dark room and beaten until he was unconscious. Ernad awoke and was questioned a second time. After Ernad refused to sign a piece of paper upon which he could not see what was written, Ernad was again taken into the dark room and beaten until unconscious. Ernad awoke near his apartment door on the 11th floor, but could not recall how he got there. He knocked on the door and his wife Safeta helped him inside. The Beganovics then abandoned their home to live with Ernad\u2019s parents who lived nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">E. <em>Fifth Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Seven months later, in January 1997, while Ernad was out with a friend, the police came looking for him at his parents\u2019 home. His wife testified that the officers had a menacing tone and when informed that Ernad wasn\u2019t there, said \u2018We\u2019ll find him.\u201d After this incident, the Beganovics moved to Novi Sad, and in August 1997, they fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">F. <em>The Hearing and the IJ\u2019s decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">At the two-day asylum hearing before the IJ, the Beganovics had five people testify in support of the asylum petition. They were: (1) Ernad; (2) Safeta; (3) Professor Reinhartz, a history professor at University of Texas-Arlington; (4) Benin Sucheere, one of Safeta\u2019s cousins, and (5) Dennis Mala, an acquaintance of Ernad\u2019s from Kosovo. After the hearing, the IJ concluded that the Beganovics had not carried their burden of persuasion on their asylum petition because the testimony of Ernad and Safeta regarding past persecution was incredible. The IJ made an alternative ruling that even if he had found the Beganovics\u2019 testimony credible, the five incidents of harassment Ernad suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ly, the IJ concluded that because of changed country conditions in Kosovo, even if the five incidents of harassment constituted persecution, the Beganovics failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, the IJ denied all relief, except that he granted the Beganovics\u2019 request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The Beganovics appealed the IJ\u2019s findings to the BIA. The Beganovics also asked to supplement the record with additional material regarding conditions within the country as well as some specific documentary evidence of medical treatment Ernad received as a result of the June 1996 incident and that Ernad was still wanted by the Serbian police. The BIA summarily denied all relief, primarily relying on the adverse credibility determinations made by the IJ. The BIA also denied the motion to supplement the record because the additional materials would not have affected the outcome of the case. The Beganovics timely filed a petition for review with this court challenging both the denial of asylum and the BIA\u2019s refusal to grant the Beganovics\u2019 motion to supplement the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201cAny alien who is present in the United States or who arrives in the United States, ... irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, may apply for asylum.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). \u201cThe Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum ... if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The term \u201crefugee\u201d includes \u201cany person who is outside of any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe applicant may qualify as a refugee because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13. It is the alien who bears the burden of proof to show that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d in order to be eligible for a grant of asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In reviewing BIA decisions, we review factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law <em>de novo. Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). We will \u201caccord deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cIn other words, [an alien] must show that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 905; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)(\u201c[A]dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d). This court only reviews decisions made by the BIA. <em>See Castillo-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>929 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1991). Because the BIA summarily adopted the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions in this case, we refer to those findings as incorporated by the BIA decision. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The primary basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of the Beganovics\u2019 asylum petition is that he did not find the Beganovics credible and thus did not find that they carried their burden in proving past persecution. This adverse credibility determination is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>on a number of inconsistencies that the IJ observed between the petitioners\u2019 pre-hearing asylum statement, Ernad\u2019s hearing testimony, Safeta\u2019s hearing testimony, and the Beganovic\u2019s failure to present documentary evidence in support of their asylum claim. It is clear that we give great deference to an immigration judge\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). In addition, the immigration judge has the duty to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to make findings accordingly. <em>Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977). Furthermore, this court is simply \u201cnot permitted to substitute our judgment for that of the Board or the [Judge] with respect to the credibility of this testimony or the ultimate findings of fact based thereon.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1226 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">But the IJ may not completely insulate his findings from our review simply by stating that a petitioner is not credible. <em>See Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (citing <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)). We agree with other circuits that the IJ must provide cogent reasons for his credibility determination, <em>see, e.g., Cordero-Trejo v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1994); <em>Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 56 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998); <em>Mansour v. INS, </em>230 F.3d 902, 906-09 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2000), and those reasons must be supported by substantial evidence in the record much like any factual determination. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002)(\u201ca credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Our review of the IJ\u2019s reasons and the record in this case, however, does not compel us to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Ernad\u2019s testimony before the IJ was inconsistent with the first and second incidents of persecution he alleged in his asylum petition. For example, in the first incident, the asylum petition states that Ernad was beaten for a period of 30 minutes during police questioning. But his testimony before the IJ alleges only that he was punched in the stomach once after the end of questioning and only when he asked the police for the posters back. Similarly, the second incident of alleged persecution in the asylum petition makes no mention of Ernad being questioned and released by the Serbian police as he testified before the IJ. Instead, the petition only details the arrest of the SDA\u2019s regional president, Balic.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Further, as the IJ noted, the testimony of Ernad and Safeta with regard to the fourth incident in June of 1996 is inconsistent. Ernad never testified that he was hospitalized or that he went to the hospital for outpatient treatment as a result of the police beating. Conversely, Safeta testified first that Ernad was taken by an ambulance to the hospital \u201cfor a day or so.\u201d Safeta next testified that Ernad had not gone to the hospital until hours later, was released the same day, and that he had been initially treated by an emergency ambulance crew. In light of the inconsistencies, the shifting nature of Safeta\u2019s account of who was present at the apartment when the ambulance arrived, and the absence of any reference to an ambulance or hospital visit in the rather detailed asylum petition submitted on the Beganovics\u2019s behalf, we cannot conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this case was not supported by substantial evidence. A reasonable judge could view these inconsistencies as evidence of falsity. <em>See Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 667, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957)(\u201cFlat contradiction between the witness\u2019 testimony and the version of the events given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness\u2019 trial testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Moreover, the IJ stated that his adverse credibility determination was also bolstered by his \u201cobserving the respondent closely while Ernad was testifying and by the lack of any documentation directly in support of Ernad\u2019s political activities or his troubles with the Serbian police. While the Beganovics were not required to provide documentary corroboration of the alleged incidents of persecution, the immigration regulations \u201cunambiguously contemplate cases where an applicant\u2019s testimony alone will not satisfy his burden of proof.\u201d <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000)(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)). Though we agree that Er-nad initially testified why documentation was not available, <em>i.e. </em>the danger of keeping political articles and party membership cards coupled with the difficulty of getting information from Serbian officials, that initial testimony was undercut by his later testimony in which he stated that civil unrest prevented him from providing any documentary corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Ultimately, we cannot find a compelling reason in the record to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the IJ\u2019s concomitant determination that the Beganovics had not carried their burden of proving past persecution necessary to warrant a grant of asylum. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the IJ\u2019s alternative rulings withstand our scrutiny. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
