R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment filed August 27, 2004 be affirmed. Lower courts have no authority to compel Supreme Court clerks to take any action, <em>see In re Marin, </em>956 F.2d 339, 340 (D.C.Cir.1992) (per curiam), and these clerks enjoy absolute immunity concerning \u201call acts ... that are \u2018basic and integral part[s] of the judicial function,\u2019 unless those acts are done \u2018in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sindram v. Suda, </em>986 F.2d 1459, 1461 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam). Moreover, despite appellant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court did not make any impermissible findings of fact, and no amendment could have saved his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-16\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
