Garza also requests that this court remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under FedR.CrimP. 36 to reflect that Garza pleaded guilty to count two of the indictment and that the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss count one of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appel-lee\u2019s brief. The Government also joins in Garza\u2019s request that we remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment as noted above. The Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, and the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED. We also REMAND to the district court with an instruction to correct the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36 to reflect that Garza pleaded guilty to count two of the indictment and that the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss count one of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">MOTION GRANTED; AFFIRMED and REMANDED with instruction.'</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
