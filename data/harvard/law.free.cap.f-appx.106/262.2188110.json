Turner appeals his conviction on two counts of transporting aliens within the United States for private financial gain by means of a motor vehicle in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. Turner argues that the district court erred by refusing to give a requested jury instruction on the requirement that the Government provide additional evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilty knowledge when contraband is found in a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">The type of instruction Turner requests is generally given only in controlled substance cases. <em>See </em>Note, Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 1.31 (Criminal Cases). Neither party has cited a decision addressing the applicability of such an instruction when the hidden cargo consists of human beings rather than controlled substances. However, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such an instruction is available in this type of case, we conclude that Turner has not shown that he was entitled to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">If contraband is not \u201cclearly visible or readily accessible,\u201d control over the vehicle alone is insufficient to prove knowledge of the contraband. <em>See United States v. Pennington, </em>20 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The \u201cthreshold issue\u201d is whether the contraband is \u201chidden\u201d; if it is hidden, then the Government must produce \u201cfurther evidence of knowledge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-18\">We conclude that the aliens discovered in the sleeper compartment of Turner\u2019s tractor-trailer were not \u201chidden.\u201d Even <em>if </em>we assume that the aliens were not \u201cclearly visible\u201d from the driver\u2019s seat, they clearly were \u201creadily accessible\u201d from that position. Because the aliens were not hidden, Turner was not entitled to the requested instruction, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the instruction. <em>See United States v. Barnett, </em>197 F.3d 138, 142 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
