Coplin pled guilty to all counts. The District Court sentenced Coplin to concurrent sentences of 20 years imprisonment and 10 years supervised release, the mandatory minimum where a defendant has previously been convicted for a felony drug offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Attorney Wayne R. Maynard filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for Coplin. In support of the motion to withdraw, Maynard has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule (L.A.R.) 109.2(a) in which he maintains that there are no non-frivolous grounds for an appeal. In addition, Coplin has filed a <em>pro se </em>brief, in accordance with L.A.R. 109.2(a). For the reasons stated below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment and grant the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-18\">This Court\u2019s inquiry when counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief is twofold: (1) wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>er Counsel adequately fulfilled L.A.R. 109.2(a); and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfriv-olous issues. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). In order for counsel to discharge his duty under the first prong, the brief must \u201c(1) ... satisfy the court that counsel has thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues, and (2) ... explain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. \u201cWhere the Anders brief initially appears adequate on its face, the proper course \u2018is for the appellate court to be guided in reviewing the record by the Anders brief itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (quoting <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We conclude that the brief in this case is adequate, and therefore it guides our independent review of the record. <em>See Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 301. Maynard raises the following seven issues in his brief: (1) Was the Appellant\u2019s guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily entered?; (2) Did the District Court commit an abuse of discretion in denying the Appellant\u2019s pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea?; (3) Did the Government violate the law in not entering a plea agreement with the Appellant that called to make a motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines?;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (4) Is resentencing required because counsel allegedly did not review the pre-sen-tence report with the Appellant and because the pre-sentence report contained an erroneous criminal history?; (5) Did the District Court err in not crediting the Appellant for accepting responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines?; (6) Is resentencing required on account of sentencing entrapment on the part of the government?; and (7) Are 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and (B) facially unconstitutional? Notably, Coplin appears to have specifically advised Maynard of the issues he wanted raised on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Coplin presents almost the identical issues in his pro <em>se </em>brief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only argument that appears to be distinct is his claim that he was the victim of selective prosecution. After reviewing the record, we agree with counsel that there are no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">First, Judge Joyner fully complied with the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in conducting the plea colloquy, ensuring that Coplin was entering into the plea knowingly and voluntarily, and was aware of the 20 year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Second, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Coplin\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>336 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir.2003). \u201cOnce a court accepts a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the defendant is not entitled to withdraw that plea simply at his whim. Rather, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e), a defendant must have a \u2018fair and just reason\u2019 for withdrawing a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Coplin conceded at the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea that he responded truthfully at the plea colloquy when he indicated that he entered the plea freely and voluntarily, and had not been given any promises or assurances in an effort to induce a guilty plea. <em>See </em>App. at 44a.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Third, the Government did not violate the law in not entering into a plea agreement with the Appellant that called to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. \u201c[T]he prosecutor\u2019s discretion to file [a \u00a7 5K1.1] motion [is] almost unfettered: the government\u2019s refusal could only be challenged if it \u2018was based on an unconstitutional motive,\u2019 like race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>141 F.3d 477, 481 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)). Coplin\u2019s assertion that he \u201cwas denied a downward departure to retaliate against his sister [sic] decision not to take DEA agents directly to the target\u2019s house and introduce undercover DEA agent to target,\u201d Coplin Br. at 16, does not fall within these narrow grounds for challenging the prosecutor\u2019s discretion. Coplin suggests that he was somehow misled into believing there was an agreement because the prosecutor told him the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion \u201cwas already type[d] out and that she had forgot and left it on her desk at her office and she would make sure that she had it with her the next time we had a meeting.\u201d Coplin Br. at 14. However, at the plea colloquy Coplin indicated that he had not been given any promises or assurances in an effort to induce his plea, <em>see </em>App. at 14a, and Coplin affirmed the truthfulness of these responses at the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, <em>see id. </em>at 51a-52a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Fourth, there is no evidence that counsel failed to review the pre-sentence report or that the report contained an erroneous criminal history. Maynard indicated at Coplin\u2019s sentencing hearing that he had an opportunity to review the presentence report with his client, <em>see </em>App. at 94a, and Coplin did not raise either of these objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tions when given the opportunity to address the District Court prior to the imposition of his sentence, <em>see id. </em>at 95a.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Fifth, the District Court did not err in not crediting Coplin for accepting responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Because the Sentencing Guidelines cannot supersede the statutory minimum, the District Court had no discretion to grant a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Tannis, </em>942 F.2d 196, 198 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Sixth, there is no evidence supporting the charge of sentencing entrapment, which \u201c \u2018occurs when a defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped into committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sumler, </em>294 F.3d 579, 582 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Ramirez-Rangel, </em>103 F.3d 1501, 1506 (9th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Seventh, we find frivolous Coplin\u2019s claim of selective prosecution on the grounds that \u201c[i]f law enforcement didn\u2019t need the appellant\u2019s] sister [as a confidential informant], he would not have been prosecuted.\u201d Coplin Br. at 7. To begin, \u201c[a] selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.\u201d <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 463, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996). Moreover, there is no support in the record for this argument, and, at any rate it does not amount to a claim of selective prosecution for unconstitutional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">There is only one argument that gives us pause. Coplin contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and (B) are facially unconstitutional. As Maynard explains, Coplin sent a letter to this Court and Maynard, contending that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>259 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2001) supports his claim that this provision is unconstitutional. As Maynard points out, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision on rehearing en banc. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>amended and superseded by United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1105, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">While Coplin\u2019s reliance on <em>Buckland </em>is easily dismissed, his argument raises the more interesting question whether Coplin has a nonfrivolous ground for appeal based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), rendered after the filing of the briefs in this case. Without delving into the many complex questions raised by <em>Blakely, </em>we conclude that under any interpretation of <em>Blakely, </em>Coplin has no nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the Supreme Court explained that <em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (emphasis added). In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court, in a case reviewing the Washington state sentencing scheme, ruled that for the purpose of <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201cthe relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2537.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Even if <em>Blakely </em>applies to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the rule enunciated in <em>Blakely </em>would be inapplicable in this case because Coplin explicitly pled guilty to the elements of the offense that are a prerequisite to the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and ten years of supervised release. First, Coplin specifically pled to knowingly and intentionally distributing or possessing with the intent to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base. <em>See </em>App. at 19a-20a; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). These facts and quantities mandate the imposition of a \u201cterm of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years\u201d and \u201ca term of supervised release of at least 5 years.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). .</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Second, Coplin was subject to the increased penalty of \u201ca term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years\u201d and \u201ca term of supervised release of at least 10 years in addition to such term of imprisonment\u201d because of his prior conviction for a felony drug offense. Thus, the only fact relevant to Coplin\u2019s sentence, other than the elements to which he specifically pled, was the fact of a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The prior conviction was not disputed at sentencing. The Presentence Investigative Report (PSR) specifically indicated that Coplin agreed and stipulated that he had been convicted of a prior felony drug offense, and was therefore subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). PSR 113(b). At the plea colloquy, Coplin acknowledged the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>App. at 14a-15a. At sentencing, Maynard represented that his client \u201cunderst[ood] that there\u2019s a mandatory minimum ... of 20 year sentence that the Court must impose,\u201d App. at 95a, and at no point did Coplin raise an objection to the PSR.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Moreover, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument that where the fact of prior conviction made a defendant eligible for an increased sentence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cthe Constitution requires Congress to treat recidivism as an element of the offense ... [and][t]he Government must prove that \u2018element\u2019 to a jury.\u201d 523 U.S. 224, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi </em>specifically declined to overrule the prior decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>explaining that \u201c[bjecause Almendarez-Torres had <em>admitted </em>the ... earlier convictions ... \u2014 all of which had been entered pursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own \u2014 no question concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ing the right to a jury trial or the standard of proof that would apply to a contested issue of fact was before the Court.\u201d <em>Ap-prendi, </em>530 U.S. at 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Rather, <em>Apprendi </em>specifically limited its holding to facts \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Nothing in <em>Blakely </em>overrules <em>Almendares-Torrez, </em>or the express limitation on the rule announced in <em>Apprendi. Cf. Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2536 (quoting <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348) (reiterating that the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>is that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We are absolutely bound by those decisions, for it is the \u201c[Supreme] Court\u2019s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.\u201d <em>State Oil Co. v. Khan, </em>522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997). Even if we believe that the foundation of a prior Supreme Court decision is thoroughly undermined, it is up to the Supreme Court to complete the demolition of its own decision. Thus, there is no nonfrivo-lous claim that Coplin\u2019s sentence violated Blakely.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed, and we will grant Wayne R. Maynard\u2019s motion to withdraw.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">.
