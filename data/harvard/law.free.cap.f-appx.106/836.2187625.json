Strong, who is an inmate in the maximum security unit of Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina, initiated a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action in which he challenged various conditions of his confinement. In the course of that proceeding, Strong filed the following motions, the denial of which is the subject of this appeal: (1) For declaratory judgment and/or preliminary injunction to prevent defendants from cutting his hair and beard; (2) For a temporary restraining order to restrain the defendants from denying him \u201cincoming publications, periodicals, renewal of subscriptions, religious literature, magazines, books, etc.\u201d; and (3) For a preliminary injunction for removal of restraints during outdoor exercise. Those motions, along with several others, were referred to a magistrate judge for a recommendation. The magistrate judge recommended that all of the motions be denied. After considering Strong\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and denied all of Strong\u2019s motions, and Strong timely appealed. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">To the extent that Strong appeals the denial of temporary restraining orders, such orders are generally not appealable. <em>See Virginia v. Tenneco, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 1026, 1029-30 (4th Cir.1976). We therefore dismiss the appeal insofar as Strong is appealing the denial of temporary restraining orders. We review the denial of preliminary injunctive relief, which is appeal-able under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), for abuse of discretion \u201conly in order to determine \u2018whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding the presence or absence of irreparable harm and a probability that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge v. Camblos, </em>155 F.3d 352, 359 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Cir.1998) (en banc). We find no such abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of preliminary injunctive relief. Thus, to the extent that Strong appeals the denial of preliminary injunctive relief, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Strong v. Ozmint, </em>No. CA-03-2256 (D.S.C. Mar. 23, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
