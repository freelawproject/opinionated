Goguadze petitioned for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals denying his motion for reconsideration and to reopen his claim for asylum, for withholding of removal and for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-22\">Goguadze, a physician from the Republic of Georgia, filed an application for asylum in the United States, withholding of removal to the Republic of Georgia, and relief under the United Nations Conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tion Against Torture. Goguadze claimed that he was a political refugee because he had supported President Eduard Shevardnadze\u2019s former defense minister Tingiz Ketovani. As a result of that support, Go-guadze alleged, he was fired from his position as chairman of the local hospital\u2019s emergency department. In addition, Go-guadze claimed that he was beaten, arrested, detained, and interrogated on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Goguadze\u2019s beliefs were \u201clike most Georgian citizens,\u201d and that his activities were not so political that they would \u201cdraw the interest of the government.\u201d In addition, the IJ found that the events of which Goguadze complained did not constitute persecution, explaining that Goguadze\u2019s family was unharmed and that he later regained his position as the chairman of the local emergency department. Although Goguadze testified that he had been arrested and detained on two occasions, the IJ found that Goguadze\u2019s claim of persecution was exaggerated inasmuch as he remained in Georgia unharmed for more than two years after his arrest in May 1996. Goguadze\u2019s \u201cprimary motivation\u201d for seeking asylum in the United States, according to the IJ, was to join his childhood friend who had immigrated to America and had been granted leave to remain through a lottery program.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Goguadze filed a timely motion for reconsideration and to reopen his case. After the BIA denied the motion, Goguadze petitioned for review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The BIA had jurisdiction over Go-guadze\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2. We have appellate jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration and to reopen because it is a final order of removal for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 171 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">A motion for reconsideration must \u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Regulation 1003.2(a) provides that the \u201cdecision to grant or deny a motion to ... reconsider is within the discretion of the Board.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Accordingly, we review to determine if the BIA abused its discretion. \u201cDiscretionary decisions of the BIA will not be disturbed unless they are found to be \u2018arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tipu v. I.N.S., </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Chung v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>602 F.2d 608, 612 (3d Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Section 1229a(e)(6) allows an alien to file a motion to reopen which must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B). Regulation 1003.2(c) provides that a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The regulation further provides that granting a \u201cmotion to reopen ... is within the discretion of the Board.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Thus, our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See I.N.S. v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (holding that a motion to reopen under a regulation which was a predecessor of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 was subject to review for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The BIA denied Goguadze\u2019s motion for reconsideration, stating \u201cwe find no new legal argument or particular aspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the case which was overlooked and no ground upon which to reconsider our previous decision.\u201d Goguadze contends that the BIA abused its discretion because it failed to recognize several errors of fact in the IJ\u2019s decision which, if viewed properly, would have established that he was persecuted. We disagree. Although some of the facts identified by Goguadze may have strengthened his contention that he was persecuted, none of those facts would have definitively established that he was subject to more than the \u201cgenerally harsh conditions\u201d shared by many other Georgians. <em>See Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cBIA suggested that generally harsh conditions shared by many other persons do not amount to persecution\u201d) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222, 1985 WL 56042 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The BIA denied Goguadze\u2019s motion to reopen, explaining that the newspaper articles submitted by Goguadze, which described contemporaneous events in Georgia, did not establish that he \u201cwould be placed at risk for persecution on account of a protected ground or torture.\u201d Goguadze asserts, however, that these articles confirmed the \u201ccontinuing war-like situation\u201d where he had lived and that he \u201ccould still have been persecuted if returned to Georgia.\u201d Goguadze fails to recognize that \u201cgeneralized conditions of strife do not support a claim for asylum because they do not show that [he] will be singled out for persecution on account of one of the enumerated grounds.\u201d <em>Bradvica v. I.N.S., </em>128 F.3d 1009, 1013 (7th Cir.1997). Thus, the new evidence Goguadze offered was not material to his claim that he would be persecuted if returned to Georgia. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A9g\">. We do not have jurisdiction over the BIA's decision to deny Goguadze\u2019s claim for asylum, withholding, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Jurisdiction is lacking because Goguadze did not file a petition for review of that order within the thirty day period of limitations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
