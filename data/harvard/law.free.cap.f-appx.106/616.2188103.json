R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Suthakaran Velauthan, a native and citizen of Sri Lanka, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. \u201cWhere, as here, the BIA adopts the Id\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The BIA erred in adopting the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Velauthan did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution by the LTTE on account of imputed political opinion because his dispute with them was grounded in personal revenge. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 934 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cthe threats to Lim are accurately viewed as \u2018revenge plus\u2019 \u2014 revenge partly motivated by (and thus on account of) imputed adverse political opinion\u201d). The LTTE visited Velauthan\u2019s home in part to stop his father\u2019s translation services for the Sri Lankan army. The resulting verbal dispute included an expression of political opinion by Velauthan\u2019s father \u2014 \u201c[the Tigers] all must get destroyed, then only we could live peacefully.\u201d After the altercation turned physical, there were threats to Velauthan that were repeated after Velauthan\u2019s departure from Sri Lanka. These threats (\u201cwe will forgive an enemy, but not a traitor\u201d) were couched in language that indicates not mere personal revenge, but imputation of a political opinion to Velauthan. Taking all the evidence together, the record compels a finding that \u201cit is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated, at least in part, by an actual or implied protected ground.\u201d <em>Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (quoting <em>In re T-M-B, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 775 (BIA 1997) (en banc)). We therefore remand for the agency to reassess whether Velauthan has a well-founded fear of persecution by the LTTE. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">That Velauthan suffered past persecution by the Sri Lankan army on account of his Tamil ethnicity is undisputed. Defending the BIA\u2019s finding of changed country conditions, the government contends that we should not take judicial notice of the most current information concerning the Sri Lankan peace process.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">The BIA\u2019s finding of changed country conditions was based on a different State Department report from that relied upon by the IJ. By taking administrative notice of the 2002 report without informing Ve-lauthan and providing him with an opportunity to respond, the BIA acted in contravention of due process. <em>See Gomez-Vigil v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 1111, 1114 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (applicants must receive warning of administrative notice taken by the BIA and \u201can opportunity to contest or rebut by further evidence the facts of which administrative notice was taken\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Further, while the 2002 report is optimistic about the course of peace negotiations, it does not indicate that the dispute between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE was finally settled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>opportunity to contest the report\u2019s predictions, Velauthan might have been able to demonstrate that his well-founded fear of persecution was not rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence and thereby establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See Babal-lah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1078 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe burden is on the INS to demonstrate that conditions have changed.\u201d); <em>cf. Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[E]ven a ten percent chance of persecution may establish a well-founded fear.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Moreover, the 2003 State Department report, published after the BIA\u2019s ruling, chronicles the suspension of the peace negotiations that had provided the basis for that decision. In <em>Gafoor v. INS, </em>231 F.3d 645 (9th Cir.2000), we reviewed a changed country conditions determination and noted that \u201c[o]rdinarily, we would accept the BIA\u2019s finding of changed country conditions as long as it was not undermined by evidence in the record. But recent events have rendered the State Department\u2019s ... report hopelessly out of date.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. Similarly, the important turn of events in Sri Lanka subsequent to the publication of the 2002 report relied upon by the BIA permits judicial notice of the 2003 report. <em>Id. </em>at 655-56. As in <em>Gafoor, </em>we therefore remand for consideration of \u201cwhether recent events in [Sri Lanka] undermine the finding that [Velauthan\u2019s] well-founded fear of persecution is rebutted by changed country conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655; <em>see also Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 805 (9th Cir.2004) (requiring this determination to be individualized); <em>cf. INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). We also remand Velauthan\u2019s withholding claim for further consideration in light of this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-16\">.
