Counsel for Kurbini did not respond to a request to show cause why oral argument would be necessary in this case, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">Kurbini was born in Albania in 1970. He attempted to enter this country in 1998 without a valid passport and visa, and was placed in removal proceedings. He conceded removability and requested the relief set forth above on the basis that he feared persecution in Albania due to his known opposition to the ruling Socialist Party. A hearing was held before an immigration judge (IJ), who denied the requests for relief. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the decision without opinion on April 30, 2002, but Kur-bini asserts that his former counsel did not inform him of this decision. He was ordered to report for removal on July 12, 2002, and on July 30, through new counsel, he moved to reopen and reconsider, arguing that he was denied effective assistance because his former counsel had been suspended from the practice of law and her father, an attorney, filed a brief before the BIA that was rejected as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">The BIA denied the motion, noting that it was properly construed as a motion to reconsider rather than a motion to reopen, that it was not timely filed, and that Kurbi-ni had failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the failure to file a timely brief. In his brief before this court, Kur-bini argues that the BIA erred in construing his motion as one to reconsider rather than one to reopen, that equitable tolling rendered the motion timely, and that he established prejudice in that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the denial of relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>without the benefit of a brief on Kurbini\u2019s behalf, was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Upon consideration, we conclude that no abuse of discretion can be demonstrated in this case because Kurbini failed to establish the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by showing he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely brief before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Kurbini\u2019s argument that the BIA frequently treats motions based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel as motions to reopen rather than motions to reconsider may have merit. See <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 895-96 (9th Cir.2003). Similarly, his argument that his former counsel\u2019s deception regarding the status of his appeal equitably tolled the time period for filing a motion to reopen may also be persuasive. <em>Fajardo v. INS, </em>300 F.3d 1018, 1022 (9th Cir.2002). However, we need not reach either of these arguments, because the BIA concluded in the alternative that, even if the motion to reopen were timely, it failed due to Kurbini\u2019s inability to establish that the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced his administrative appeal on the merits. <em>Huicoehea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Kurbini argues that his attorneys\u2019 failure to file a timely brief before the BIA caused prejudice. He has not shown, however, that his appeal would have been successful but for the failure to file a brief. He has presented nothing that challenges the IJ\u2019s underlying conclusion that his testimony was not credible and has not established that he was eligible for asylum. It follows that Kurbini cannot prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Huicochea-Gomez, </em>237 F.3d at 699-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Kurbini argues further that he was prejudiced when the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. But the BIA\u2019s action is not attributable to Kurbi-ni\u2019s attorneys\u2019 errors. In any event, an argument that affirmance without opinion violates an aliens\u2019 due process rights has recently been rejected in <em>Denko v. INS, </em>351 F.3d 717, 730 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">For all of the above reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
