Although the IJ granted Juma\u2019s application for withholding of removal to Somalia, he denied her application for asylum and for withholding of removal to Kenya. <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (\u201c[Wjithholding only bars deporting an alien to a particular country or countries\u201d). The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal to Kenya in a final order, and we therefore have jurisdiction over this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">Although we have jurisdiction, we deny the petition. Initially, Juma petitioned for review of the mandatory denial of her application for asylum due to her alleged firm resettlement in Kenya. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi). However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>BIA did not affirm the IJ\u2019s <em>mandatory </em>denial of asylum, but rather affirmed the IJ\u2019s <em>discretionary </em>denial of Juma\u2019s application for asylum. \u201cWhere, as here, the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002). \u201c[T]his court cannot affirm the BIA on a ground upon which it did not rely.\u201d <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 658 n. 16 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Juma failed to petition for review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum and thus waived the issued. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152, 1157 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cIssues not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief are typically deemed waived.\u201d). Juma then attempted to correct her error by arguing the proper issue in her reply brief. However, \u201c[i]t is well established in this circuit that [t]he general rule is that appellants cannot raise a new issue for the first time in their reply briefs.\u201d <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1260 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Even had Juma not waived the issue, we would deny the petition. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Juma\u2019s application for asylum on discretionary grounds. <em>See Lopez-Galarza v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (setting forth standard of review). Juma had safely resided in Kenya for nine years prior to her arrival in the United States, the majority of her family still remains in Kenya, she did not have any family or connections in the United States, and she entered the United States fraudulently without attempting to follow orderly refugee procedures in the United States or in Kenya. <em>See Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1040 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Matter of Pula, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 467, 473-74 (BIA 1987). Juma failed to meet her \u201cburden of establishing that the Board should exercise discretion in [her] favor.\u201d <em>Ajayi v. INS, </em>28 F.3d 104, *1 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-23\">.
