We dismiss the appeal of the order transferring the case for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>See Technosteel, L.L.C. v. Beers Constr. Co., </em>271 F.3d 151, 153-54 &amp; n. 2 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-21\">We also dismiss the appeal of that part of the district court\u2019s order that denied Idokogi\u2019s petition as a successive habeas petition. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of ap-pealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Idokogi has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-22\">We deny Idokogi\u2019s motions for stay pending appeal and to place the case in abeyance. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
