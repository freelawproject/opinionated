The IJ and BIA denied Rusz\u2019 petition for asylum finding that he had failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Additionally, Rusz requested that the BIA reopen his case for consideration under the Convention Against Torture, which was implemented by Congress while his case was on appeal to the BIA. The BIA denied Rusz\u2019 request to reopen. Rusz\u2019 timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201cWhere ... the BIA has reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and incorporated portions of it as its own, we treat the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Thus, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, including the supplemental reasoning of the BIA, as the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Auk\">We \u201creview factual findings underlying the denial of an asylum application for \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 The BIA\u2019s determination must be upheld if \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">II. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">The Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee, that is, one who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1). \u201cAn alien\u2019s \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u2019 must be <em>both </em>subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">To satisfy the objective component, an alien must show that he has suffered from past persecution or that he has a \u201cgood reason to fear future persecution by adducing credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">A. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">\u201cA finding of past persecution raises the presumption that an asylum-seeker has a well-founded fear of future persecution, rebuttable by a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions have changed sufficiently so as to overcome that presumption.\u201d <em>Rios v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>287 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir.2002). Rusz does not contend that he was personally subjected to persecution while in Poland. Instead, he argues that the past persecution of his father entitles him to the rebut-table presumption that his fear of future persecution is well-founded. Rusz\u2019 argument is foreclosed by INS regulations which grant the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution to <em>only </em>applicants who <em>personally </em>suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">B. Fear of Future Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The IJ and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Rusz failed to present credible, direct, and specific evidence that would support an objectively reasonable fear of persecution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">First, Rusz returned to Poland for a visit of a month to month-and-a-half in 1996 or 1997 and experienced no problems with the authorities. Additionally, Rusz\u2019 father testified that he was unaware of any former KOR members having problems in Poland at the present time. It logically follows that Rusz \u2014 the son of a former KOR activist \u2014 would be unlikely to be persecuted by the current Polish government if no former KOR members are presently being persecuted themselves. Moreover, the 1995 and 1997 State Department reports submitted by the INS and relied on by the IJ establish that anti-Communists \u2014 much less, any Poles \u2014 are not likely to be killed, kidnapped, tortured, arbitrarily arrested, arbitrarily detained, or prohibited from assembling. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cPersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">B. Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">While Rusz\u2019 case was on appeal to the BIA, Congress passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, implementing Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (the \u201cCAT\u201d). FARRA \u00a7 2242, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231, note. In his brief to the BIA, Rusz argued that remand was necessary for the IJ to consider his case under the CAT. The BIA denied Rusz\u2019 request, holding that Rusz failed to present any evidence that it would be more likely than not that he would be tortured by a public official or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official if returned to Poland.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Both parties agree that Rusz\u2019 request to the BIA for remand to consider his case under the CAT is the equivalent of a motion to reopen. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1281 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">To qualify for relief, [Rusz] was required to demonstrate it is \u201cmore likely than not that [he] would be tortured if removed to [Poland].\u201d The Convention\u2019s implementing regulations define torture as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person\u201d for certain purposes \u201cwhen such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-13\"><em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 966 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Abassi v. INS, </em>305 F.3d 1028, 1030 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">Rusz has failed to meet his burden. As discussed above, Rusz\u2019 visit of at least one month to Poland in 1996 or 1997, the testimony of his father about knowing of no former KOR members having problems in Poland, and the State Department reports establish that anti-Communists \u2014 much less, any Poles \u2014 are not likely to be killed, kidnapped, tortured, arbitrarily arrested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>arbitrarily detained, or prohibited from assembling.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\">.
