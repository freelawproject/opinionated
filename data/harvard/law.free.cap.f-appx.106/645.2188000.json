Because the BIA adopted the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as though it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Petitioners\u2019 credibility was in question because a forensic document examiner determined that the data on Mrs. Manuk-yan\u2019s birth certificate had been chemically altered. The IJ allowed petitioners about a month to respond, advising them to read <em>In re 0-D-, </em>21 I. &amp; A. Dec. 1079 (BIA 1998), in which the BIA sustained an adverse credibility determination due to the submission of false documents. At the subsequent hearing, petitioners neither presented testimony from Mrs. Manuk-yan\u2019s sister, who lived in the city where the hearing was held, nor provided an explanation for her absence. We conclude that petitioners\u2019 failure to produce \u201cnon-duplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence,\u201d or an explanation for the absence of such evidence, after receiving notice that their credibility was contested, supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Mejiar-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723-24 (9th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s summary affir-mance does not offend due process. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We grant petitioners\u2019 request that the period of voluntary departure be equitably tolled because they filed, and we granted, a motion to stay removal before the voluntary departure period expired. <em>See Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897, 899 n. 2 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Petition DENIED. Petitioners\u2019 voluntary departure period tolled from the day they filed the motion to stay removal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
