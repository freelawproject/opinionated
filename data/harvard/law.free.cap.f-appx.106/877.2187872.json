Because the district court properly construed Corbett\u2019s action as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, he may not appeal unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 374 n.7 (4th Cir. 2004) (finding certificate of appealability required even where district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Corbett has not shown that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling that his \u00a7 2255 motion was successive was wrong or debatable. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
