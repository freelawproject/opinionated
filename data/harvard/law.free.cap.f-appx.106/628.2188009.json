The BIA determined that Singh had not met his burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">An applicant is eligible for asylum if he or she is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of origin because of a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh did not establish that he faces a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a qualifying ground. Singh has converted to Christianity. Singh had limited involvement with the Sikh Student Federation over fifteen years ago. Singh presented no compelling evidence that he was of continued interest and would be persecuted on account of his race, religion, nationality, or political opinion if he returned to India. <em>See Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1029-30 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">Because Singh did not establish eligibility for asylum, he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of exclusion and deportation. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). Singh is not entitled to relief under the Convention because he failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured upon return to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Agqy\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
