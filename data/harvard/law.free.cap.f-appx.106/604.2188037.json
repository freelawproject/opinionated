We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-26\">Monroe challenges the district court\u2019s failure to depart downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4, which provides that although physical condition is not ordinarily a permitted basis for departure, \u201can extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward.\u201d The district court first made the factual finding that Monroe\u2019s kidney disease did not constitute an extraordinary physical impairment. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Guerrero, </em>987 F.2d 618, 620 (9th Cir.1993) (to analyze departure request under \u00a7 5H1.4, first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>step is factual finding of extraordinary impairment). We review that factual finding for clear error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The court considered the testimony of Monroe and his mother, as well as his medical records. The evidence showed that although intermittent flare-ups of Monroe\u2019s disease made him gain weight and feel tired, he largely controlled it with medication. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that his illness was not extraordinary. Because it did not find an extraordinary physical impairment, the court did not have the discretion to depart downward. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b627-7\">OTTO R. SKOPIL, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ai6-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">SKOPIL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">I dissent because I believe we lack jurisdiction to review Monroe\u2019s contention that the district court erred by not departing downward. We have long held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) \u201cprecludes appellate review of a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from the guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>898 F.2d 99, 101 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Linn, </em>362 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is settled law that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 strips us of jurisdiction to review a discretionary denial of a downward departure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">There are clear indications in this case that the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward was wholly discretionary. The district judge, after reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, stated that \u201cI am not going to exercise my discretion and make a downward departure based on 5H1.4.\u201d The court thereafter summarized the underlying facts regarding Monroe\u2019s claim of extraordinary physical impairment and again stated \u201cI\u2019m not going to exercise my discretion to make a downward departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Notwithstanding these statements, the majority reviews the district court\u2019s decision not to depart by examining the court\u2019s findings for clear error. The majority relies on <em>United States v. Martine-Guerrero, </em>987 F.2d 618 (9th Cir.1993). In <em>Martinez-Guerrero, </em>however, we noted that \u201c[t]he record plainly shows that the district court refused to depart downward because, according to its interpretation of section 5H1.1 and case law on which it relied, it had no discretion to depart downward.\u201d <em>Martinez-Guerrero, </em>987 F.2d at 620. Thus, we reviewed the district court\u2019s decision because \u201c[w]e have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward based on its interpretation of the law as barring such a departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Our case is not one where the court believed that a fact or circumstance precluded it from exercising its discretion to depart. <em>See United States v. Roe, </em>976 F.2d 1216, 1218 n. 1 (9th Cir.1992) (reviewing a factual finding that the district court believed prevented it from exercising its discretion). Rather, the court here indicated it had the discretion to depart downward; it simply concluded that Monroe\u2019s circumstances did not warrant departure. A district court\u2019s explanation for why a departure is unwarranted should not be interpreted as a statement that the court lacked legal authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 617 (9th Cir.2003). Rather, such statements \u201csimply ma[k]e the case for why the departure was unwarranted ... and indicates a decision founded in discretion, not lack of authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">I would dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
