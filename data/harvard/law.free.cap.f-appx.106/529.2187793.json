We review the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision because the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed without opinion. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We take testimony by the Floras as true because the Immigration Judge found them credible. <em>Vukmirovic v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cAdministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">We affirm the order of removal. We stay the mandate, however, so the Floras may move the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen proceedings to consider adjustment of status in light of new developments regarding their 1-130 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Ample evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that the Floras were paroled into the United States rather than admitted as refugees as they claim. The evidence includes the Floras\u2019 1986 parole authorization forms; a series of 1-94 arrival-departure cards documenting yearly extensions of parole; and repeated statements by the Floras over the years that they were paroled into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">The record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that the Floras were parolees rather than refugees.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">The Floras do not make the required showing for estoppel against the United States from treating them as parolees. The first requirement for estoppel against the government, affirmative misconduct, is lacking. \u201cNeither the failure to inform an individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation constitute affirmative misconduct.\u201d <em>Sulit v. Schiltgen, </em>213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir.2000). The Floras\u2019 testimony merely established that immigration officers did not explain to them what their status as parolees signified.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b552-18\">Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that the Floras lack an objective basis for their fear of persecution. The evidence includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>fact, acknowledged by Manuel Flora, that even former President Marcos\u2019s wife Imelda Marcos has returned to the Philippines without harm; a State Department Profile reporting that former Marcos supporters have returned to the Philippines \u201cwithout difficulty\u201d and \u201c[a]vailable evidence\u201d does not support claims that former Marcos supporters are threatened because of their support for the Marcos regime; and Josie Flora\u2019s testimony that the president of the Philippines at the time of the hearing, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, was a \u201cclose supporter of Marcos\u201d and her family did not \u201chave to be scared of his government\u201d. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion from the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that the Floras are ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Congress has stripped this court of jurisdiction to review denials of voluntary departure, \u201cincluding statutory eligibility for voluntary departure.\u201d <em>Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>861 F.3d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(f), 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)(2004)). Because Congress has eliminated jurisdiction over all denials of voluntary departure, whether discretionary or not, we have found ourselves jurisdictionally precluded from considering an appeal though the Board\u2019s denial of voluntary departure was \u201cin apparent violation of its own precedent decisions.\u201d <em>Alvarez Santos v. I.N.S., </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Floras\u2019 argument that the Immigration Judge erred in ruling that they are ineligible for voluntary departure because they are arriving aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Agency streamlining did not violate the Floras\u2019 due process rights. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848, 851 (9th Cir.2003). As far as we have jurisdiction to review, <em>see id. </em>at 854 &amp; n. 8, the regulatory criteria for streamlining in force when the Floras appealed to the Board and when the Board affirmed were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">We do not have jurisdiction to consider the Floras\u2019 request to adjust status based on new developments regarding their 1-130 petitions. <em>See Ortiz v. I.N.S., </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.1999). The Floras must move the Board to reopen proceedings so that they may seek adjustment of status based on the disposition of their 1-130 petitions, not ask this court to compel the Board to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">The petition for review is DENIED. We stay the mandate for ninety days to give the Floras an opportunity to move the Board to reopen their case. See <em>id. </em>at 1153. The Floras may ask the Department of Homeland Security to join in the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(iii). If the Floras file a motion to reopen with the Board within ninety days of the filing of this memorandum disposition, the stay will continue until the Board disposes of the motion. If no motion to reopen is made with the Board, the petition for review will be denied for the reasons stated herein, and the mandate will be filed. Counsel for the parties are to file status reports ninety days from the date of this disposition, and every ninety days thereafter, if the mandate has not been filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
