(\u201cGFL\u201d) appeals the October 30, 2002 order of the District Court for the District of Maryland (Alexander Harvey II, <em>Judge) </em>granting the motion of Appellees Pepper Hamilton LLP (\u201cPepper Hamilton\u201d), Marcy L. Colkitt &amp; Associates, P.C. (\u201cMLCA\u201d) and the United States for distribution of proceeds of a directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy held by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\u201cNational Union\u201d). Pepper Hamilton, MLCA and the United States claim entitlement to the insurance proceeds pursuant to a settlement agreement between Dr. Douglas Colkitt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the insured, and the United States. GFL claims that the settlement agreement does not entitle the United States to certain portions of the insurance proceeds, and that its claim to those portions is superior to the claims of Pepper Hamilton and MLCA. Because we find that the district court properly interpreted the provision of the settlement agreement at issue, we affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">This appeal arises from a collateral order entered in a <em>qui tam </em>action originally filed in 1995 by Syed Rahman (the <em>\u201cRah-man </em>action\u201d). In August of 1998, the United States filed its complaint in the <em>Rahman </em>action naming as defendants Dr. Douglas Colkitt, his wife, his business partner, and over eighty health care facilities owned, controlled or operated by Dr. Colkitt. The defendants allegedly engaged in a fraudulent billing scheme, defrauding the Medicare and Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (\u201cCHAMPUS\u201d) programs of more than $12 million. <em>See United States ex rel. Rahman v. Oncology </em>Assocs., <em>P.C., </em>269 B.R. 139, 143-44 (D.Md.2001). After extensive pretrial proceedings, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement (the <em>\u201cRahman </em>Agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court approved the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement on September 8, 2000. <em>See id. </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">As part of this settlement, the defendants agreed to pay the United States $9,885,000. To secure payment in full, the defendants assigned their rights to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany proceeds\u201d of liability insurance policies under which one or more defendants, or their officers or directors, were insured. <em>Rahman </em>Agreement 1113.b. However, a proviso to 1113.b stated, \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph, the United States shall not be entitled to recover from Defendants or Defendants\u2019 counsel any amounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Dr. Colkitt was an officer and director of National Medical Financial Services, Inc. (\u201cNational Medical\u201d), another defendant in the <em>Rahman </em>action. As such, Dr. Colkitt sought coverage for his defense costs under National Medical\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy (the \u201cD &amp; O policy\u201d) with National Union. In 1999, he requested that National Union accept Pepper Hamilton as his legal counsel. National Union agreed to provide his defense under a reservation of rights, and accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Pepper Hamilton as counsel for Dr. Colk-itt.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Pepper Hamilton represented Dr. Colk-itt in the <em>Rahman </em>action from 1999 through approval of the <em>Rahman </em>agreement. National Union paid Pepper Hamilton directly for its services for most of this time. But in November of 2000, it notified Pepper Hamilton that defense costs incurred after April 30, 2000 were not covered by the D &amp; O policy and would not be paid. Consequently, Dr. Colkitt opened arbitration proceedings against National Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">After one law firm refused to represent Dr. Colkitt in this insurance coverage dispute on a contingency fee basis, he engaged MLCA. MLCA agreed to accept as payment for its services forty percent of any \u201cpayments made by National Union as a result of\u2019 a favorable judgment in the arbitration proceeding. (J.A. 227). A tribunal of the American Arbitration Association held a ten-day hearing between October 24, 2001 and March 26, 2002. On April 24, 2002, the arbitrators found in favor of Dr. Colkitt and directed National Union to pay him $1,791,450. On September 6, 2002, Pepper Hamilton and MLCA moved the district court to order distribution of the arbitration award to them and the United States pursuant to If 13.b of the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. Pepper Hamilton, MLCA and the United States had agreed to a division of the arbitration award as follows: $700,000 to the United States, $500,000 to Pepper Hamilton, and $591,450 to MLCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">On October 7, 2002, the district court permitted GFL to intervene. In July of 2000, GFL had obtained a judgment against Dr. Colkitt for more than $21 million in federal court in Pennsylvania. <em>See GFL Advantage Fund, Ltd. v. Colkitt, </em>No. 4:CV-97-0526, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21747 (M.D.Pa. July 17, 2000). In an effort to enforce this judgment, GFL had garnished purported assets of Dr. Colkitt and of entities in which Dr. Colkitt had an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">GFL\u2019s attempts to secure its judgment against Dr. Colkitt threatened to draw it into litigation with the United States because of the government\u2019s interests secured in the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. Consequently, GFL and the United States entered into an agreement on January 18, 2002 (\u201cJanuary 2002 Agreement\u201d) whereby GFL agreed that it would not \u201csuffer or permit existing or future charging orders or garnishments to be placed against ... any entity which is among the Protected Assets.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> January 2002 Agreement 11I.B.4. \u201cProtected Assets\u201d included the insurance proceeds assigned to the United States in 1113.b of the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. <em>See </em>January 2002 Agreement 111.A &amp; Ex. F, 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Despite the January 2002 Agreement, on March 26, 2002, GFL sought and obtained a writ of execution attaching the property of Dr. Colkitt in the possession of National Union. <em>GFL Advantage Fund, Ltd. v. Colkitt, </em>No. 4:97-CV-526 (M.D.Pa. Mar. 26, 2002). It was based on this writ that GFL sought to intervene as a party-in-interest in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">The court below determined that the issues involved in the motion for distribution of the arbitration award did not require a hearing. Based on the papers submitted to it, the district court held that GFL had no right to any portion of the insurance proceeds obtained as a result of the arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The right to receive funds payable by National Union to Colkitt have [sic] been assigned to the United States pursuant to the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement approved by this Court. The insurance proceeds are under the January 2002 Agreement \u201cProtected Assets\u201d to be disbursed to the United States by an entity. GFL has specifically agreed that such assets distributable to the United States \u201cwill remain free of any claim of GFL.... \u201d Moreover, Colkitt has no remaining ownership interest in the insurance proceeds which might be subject to garnishment by GFL. Under the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement, the proceeds of a Policy like the one issued by National Union were to be paid to the United States to satisfy the amount which Colkitt had agreed to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>United States ex rel. Rahman v. Oncology </em>Assocs., <em>P.C., </em>229 F.Supp.2d 458, 463-64 (D.Md.2002) (footnote omitted). Thus, even if Pep-per Hamilton and MLCA were not entitled to a portion of the arbitration award, \u201cthe United States would be entitled to receive the entire sum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And because the United States agreed to a particular division of the arbitration award, Pepper Hamilton and MLCA were entitled to their portions of the award in any event. <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Both the district court and this Court denied GFL\u2019s subsequent applications for a stay of distribution pending appeal. The district court then distributed the arbitration award to the United States, Pepper Hamilton and MLCA according to their agreed-upon apportionment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">On appeal, GFL concedes that its claim to the arbitration award is subrogated to that of the United States under the January 2002 Agreement. It also concedes that the arbitration award constitutes \u201cproceeds\u201d within the meaning of H 13.b, nor could it argue otherwise. The award represents insurance proceeds that National Union should have paid under the D &amp; O policy \u2014 an insurance policy that falls within the assignment of rights in II 13.b. Rather, GFL argues that the monies owed under the D &amp; O policy to Pepper Hamilton and MLCA\u2019s contingency fee are \u201cNon-US proceeds\u201d \u2014 proceeds in which the United States has no interest. Under GFL\u2019s interpretation, these monies are thus not \u201cProtected Assets\u201d and the January 2002 Agreement does not bar it from attaching these amounts. GFL then argues that its judgment lien takes priority over any interest Pepper Hamilton or MLCA might have in these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">The first question we must answer, then, is whether the United States has any interest, under 1113.b, in \u201camounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.\u201d The proper interpretation of a settlement agreement, as with any contract, is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Nehi Bottling Co. v. All-Am. Bottling Corp., </em>8 F.3d 157, 161-62 (4th Cir.1993). When construing a provision of a contract, we must \u201cgive meaning and effect to every part of the contract, rather than leave a portion of the contract meaningless or reduced to mere surplus-age.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>7 F.3d 1123, 1127 (4th Cir.1993). With this rule in mind, we address GFL\u2019s claims to the portions of the arbitration award claimed by Pepper Hamilton and MLCA in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Paragraph 13.b provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-12\">Subject to the condition that all rights to insurance are retained to defend any claim (including third party claims or cross claims) relating to the Covered Conduct that has or may be made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>any party other than the United States, all Parties other than NRTS agree that <em>any proceeds from insurance policies </em>that provide coverage for some or all of the Covered Conduct in which any of the Defendants, or their officers or directors, are insured parties <em>will be paid to the United States to satisfy the Settlement Amount up to Payment in Full. ... </em>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph, <em>the United States shall not be entitled to recover from Defendants or Defendants\u2019 counsel any amounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><em>Rahman </em>Agreement 1\u00cd 13.b (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Through 1\u00cd 13.b, Dr. Colkitt has assigned his rights to <em>\u201cany </em>proceeds\u201d from the D &amp; 0 policy to the United States. The <em>Rah-man </em>Agreement does not define the term \u201cproceeds.\u201d In the absence of a contractual definition, we give contract terms their ordinary meaning. <em>See Bynum v. Cigna Healthcare of N.C., Inc., </em>287 F.3d 305, 313 (4th Cir.2002) (applying dictionary definition to undefined term in insurance contract). In ordinary usage, \u201cproceeds\u201d means \u201csomething that results or accrues,\u201d RANDOM HOUSE WEBSTER\u2019S UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY 1542 (1998); \u201cthe net sum received (as for a check, a negotiable note, an insurance policy) after deduction of any discount or charges,\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1807 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAny proceeds\u201d is therefore an all-encompassing phrase. Any monies resulting from Dr. Colkitt\u2019s coverage under the D &amp; 0 policy for the <em>Rahman </em>action are \u201cproceeds\u201d of that policy, and the United States retains a priority interest in them until the Settlement Amount is paid in full. Because \u201camounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses\u201d result from Dr. Colkitt\u2019s coverage under the D &amp; 0 policy, amounts owed to Pepper Hamilton are \u201cproceeds\u201d of the D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy and the United States has a security interest in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The proviso, when read in full, reinforces this conclusion. It states, \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph, the United States shall not be entitled to recover from Defendants or Defendants\u2019 counsel any amounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.\u201d <em>Rahman </em>Agreement H 13.b. Contrary to GFL\u2019s reasoning, the paragraph does not state that the United States shall not be entitled to any amounts owed for legal fees; it provides that the United States \u201cshall not be entitled <em>to recover from Defendants or Defendants\u2019 counsel\u201d </em>such amounts. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). GFL\u2019s contention that the United States has no interest in amounts paid or owed for legal fees reduces the emphasized language to surplus-age, a result we cannot accept. <em>See Goodman, </em>7 F.3d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The limitation imposed on the United States by the terms of K 13.b is both specific and narrow. Although the United States is barred from recovering from Dr. Colkitt or Pepper Hamilton legal fees and expenses paid or owed to them, it is not barred from seeking to recover such amounts from another entity. Contrary to GFL\u2019s argument, f 13.b creates no \u201cnon-US\u201d category of proceeds. The proviso grants the United States a reversionary interest in any \u201camounts paid or owed by insurers for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.\u201d The district court was thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>correct to conclude that, if any such amounts were paid to someone other than \u201cDefendants or Defendants\u2019 counsel,\u201d the United States would be entitled to recover those amounts from that person or entity. Were GFL that other entity, the United States would be entitled to recover those sums; in fact, GFL has conceded that the United States\u2019 interest supercedes its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">But, GFL argues, this interpretation of H 13.b translates a promise by Dr. Colkitt to pay insurance proceeds to the United States into a promise by the United States to pay Dr. Colkitt\u2019s attorneys. GFL is mistaken. First, 1113.b is not a mere promise by Dr. Colkitt to pay the United States; it is an assignment of Dr. Colkitt\u2019s right to any proceeds to the United States. Dr. Colkitt no longer has an interest in insurance proceeds to which the United States is entitled; it follows that Dr. Colk-itt retains no interest to which GFL\u2019s claim can attach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the proviso is not a promise by the United States to pay legal fees to defendant\u2019s counsel; it is a promise not to challenge an insurer\u2019s determination as to what constitutes legal fees and expenses payable under the policy. The only reason the proviso might appear to be a promise by the United States to pay Pepper Hamilton is that the arbitration award was a lump sum, combining amounts due for legal fees and expenses with the indemnification amount. If National Union had not failed to abide by the terms of the D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy, it would have paid Pepper Hamilton as its fees became due. It was these payments that the United States agreed not to seek to recover from Dr. Colkitt or his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We hold that If 13.b of the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement includes in the term \u201cproceeds\u201d amounts payable to Pepper Hamilton for its legal fees and expenses actually incurred during the course of its representation of Dr. Colkitt under the D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy. Because 1\u00cd 13.b grants the United States a security interest in \u201cany proceeds\u201d of the D &amp; 0 policy, amounts owed to Pepper Hamilton are \u201cProtected Assets\u201d to which GFL is not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Our interpretation of If 13.b does not resolve GFL\u2019s claim to MLCA\u2019s contingency fee. The proviso applies only to \u201camounts paid or owed <em>by insurers </em>for legal fees and expenses actually incurred.\u201d <em>Rahman </em>Agreement H 13.b. In context, this language can only refer to legal fees and expenses paid or owed by insurers under an insurance policy \u201cthat provide[s] coverage for some or all of the Covered Con-duct in which any of the Defendants, or their officers or directors, are insured parties,\u201d such as Dr. Colkitt\u2019s D &amp; 0 policy. <em>Id. </em>National Union does not owe any legal fees or expenses to MLCA under such a policy. Rather, Dr. Colkitt owes MLCA a portion of the arbitration award pursuant to their contingency fee agreement. Its fee would be paid out of monies otherwise payable to the United States or Pepper Hamilton. Hence, any interpretation of the proviso would not affect GFL\u2019s claim against MLCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The analysis, however, does not end there. Dr. Colkitt agreed to pay MLCA\u2019s contingency fee out of the arbitration award, <em>i.e., </em>the proceeds of the D <em>&amp; </em>0 policy. As we have noted, as a result of his assignment, Dr. Colkitt retained no interest in those proceeds out of which he could agree to pay MLCA. The United States would be entitled to this portion of the arbitration award. As such, MLCA\u2019s fee is a \u201cProtected Asset\u201d under the Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>ary 2002 Agreement. That agreement therefore precludes GFL from seeking to attach MLCA\u2019s contingency fee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The January 2002 Agreement precludes GFL from seeking to attach the portions of the arbitration award representing Pepper Hamilton\u2019s legal fees and expenses and MLCA\u2019s contingency fee. We need not determine therefore the priority of GFL\u2019s claims relative to those of Pepper Hamilton or MLCA. The remaining issues raised by the parties are thus moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Because we believe, based on the foregoing analysis, that the district court reached the conclusion to which 1113.b is most reasonably amenable, its order is</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">. Marcy L. Colkitt of MLCA and Dr. Colkitt are siblings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\">. The <em>Rahman </em>Agreement was one of four settlement agreements entered into by the United States, Dr. Colkitt and other parties to resolve the claims resulting from the practices of Dr. Colkitt\u2019s various business enterprises. The other settlement agreements are not relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">. The January 2002 Agreement vested the District Court for the District of Maryland and the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland with exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising from it. January 2002 Agreement 11 II.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">. In the context of an insurance policy, \"after deduction of any ... charges\" would mean the total amount payable under the policy less the deductible and any other sums the insurer would require the insured to pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">. We note that Dr. Colkitt theoretically retains a reversionary interest in the proceeds of the D &amp; O policy to the extent any proceeds remain after the United States has been paid in full under the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\">. The only party that could arguably challenge the United States\u2019 right to these proceeds is MLCA. MLCA might be able to establish a charging lien against the arbitration award that would supercede the United States\u2019 secured interest. But as the district court noted, \u201cthe United States, which has been substantially benefited by the award, [quite reasonably] has recognized the right of these attorneys to be compensated for the substantial legal services rendered by them.\u201d <em>Rahman, 229 </em>F.Supp.2d at 464. Because the United States and MLCA have agreed to a particular division of the award between them, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b834-8\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWL\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Pepper Hamilton LLP and Marcy L. Colkitt &amp; Associates, P.C. (\u201cMLCA\u201d) moved the district court (primarily pursuant to Paragraph 13(b) of the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement) for distribution of the $1,791,450 National Union Insurance Company arbitration award, and these law firms \u2014 along with the United States\u2014 agreed that the award should be divided as follows: $700,000 to the United States; $500,000 to Pepper Hamilton; and $591,450 to MLCA. <em>United States ex rel. Rahman v. Oncology Assocs., </em>229 F.Supp.2d 458 (D.Md.2002). The district court \u2014 which had expressly approved the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement \u2014 granted the motion and ordered the money to be distributed in the manner proposed by the law firms and the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-12\">[T]he United States is ... entitled to all of the proceeds of the insurance coverage arbitration. That the United States has agreed to pay from these proceeds the legal fees and expenses of the mov-ants does not alter its right to receive the entire amount. Both Pepper Hamilton and MLCA have claimed that a part of the award should be paid to them, and the United States has not opposed these claims. The legal services rendered by Pepper Hamilton were covered by the Policy under which National Union agreed to pay compensation for such services rendered to its insured. Moreover, the legal services rendered by MLCA resulted in the award made by the arbitrators. Quite reasonably, the United States, which has been substantially benefited by the award, has recognized the right of these attorneys to be compensated for the substantial legal services rendered by them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-13\">If this Court were to accept the position of GFL that its lien on the proceeds is superior to the equitable hen of Pepper Hamilton and to the charging lien of MLCA, the entire sum would then be paid to the United States which in turn has agreed to compensate these attorneys for the legal services rendered by them. Rather than permitting the claims of Pepper Hamilton and MLCA to be paid in such a roundabout manner, the Order entered herein by the Court will approve the movants\u2019 request to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ceive amounts sought by them directly from National Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 464 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The district court\u2019s resolution of the matter before us is based primarily on its interpretation of the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. Because the district court presided over the settlement of the <em>Rahman </em>litigation and approved the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement, its interpretation of that settlement agreement is entitled to our deference. <em>See Simmons v. South Carolina State Ports Auth., </em>694 F.2d 63, 66 (4th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If I were left to my own devices, I may have reached a different result than the district court. However, based on the arguments presented and the deference due to the district court, I am not convinced that the district court erred. Therefore, I concur in the result reached by the majority. Despite my concurrence, one matter concerning this litigation that appears in the record is left unclear. The <em>Rahman </em>Agreement, which is the heart of the controversy before us, provided the United States with a monetary judgment in the amount of $9,885,000 plus interest against Douglas Colkitt and his co-defendants in that case. At the time of the district court\u2019s order distributing the arbitration award, the United States had not been paid in full under the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. Subsequent to that order, on July 31, 2003, the United States informed the district court that it had received the full amount owed under the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement, and it set forth the sources from which the payments came. <em>See Joint Status Report And Request For Declaration Of Payment In Full And Other Relief (\u201cJoint Status Report\u201d), </em>at 3, 12-13. In doing so, the United States represented that it had received from National Medical Financial Services a payment of $700,000, and it specified that this payment relates to \u201cNational Union Insurance.\u201d <em>Joint Status Report, </em>at 13. Nowhere in that document does it appear that the United States accounted for the additional $1,091,450 of the arbitration award that was paid to Pepper Hamilton and MLCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">It seems to me that in light of the fact that (1) the United States is \u201centitled to all of the proceeds of the insurance coverage arbitration,\u201d and (2) the United States\u2019 agreement to pay from these proceeds the law firms\u2019 legal fees and expenses \u201cdoes not alter its right to receive the entire amount,\u201d 229 F.Supp.2d at 464, the United States should be required to credit Colkitt with the entire $1,791,450 of the arbitration proceeds \u2014 rather than only $700,000 \u2014 in satisfaction of the judgment created by the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement. The United States\u2019 gratuitous (though perhaps understandable) decision to pay some of this money to the law firms does not negate the fact that <em>all </em>of the money was assigned to the United States by Colkitt under the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement for the purpose of satisfying the judgment. A proper accounting of that money would (everything else being equal) free up $1,091,450 for Colkitt\u2019s creditors (such as GFL) to pursue. Although the district court is entitled to deference in construing the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement, the United States\u2019 final accounting appears to be inconsistent with the district court\u2019s construction of that agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">. I note that neither GFL nor the law firms were parties to the <em>Rahman </em>Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\">. While this issue appears in the record and is worthy of note, the accounting was not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>pealed, and GFL did not argue that this inconsistency undermines the district court's order distributing the arbitration proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
