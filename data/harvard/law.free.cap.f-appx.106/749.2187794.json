Slater appeals from a judgment entered following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Wolle, <em>J.), </em>dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>missing her employment discrimination claims under Title VII. Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Slater raises two challenges on appeal, both of which we reject on the merits:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">1. \u201cThe formulation of special verdict questions rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and should be reviewed by an appellate court only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Vichare v. AMBAC Inc., </em>106 F.3d 457, 465 (2d Cir.1996). The third special verdict question involved no such abuse because it did not \u201cmislead or confuse the jury\u201d and did not \u201cinaccurately frame the issues to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">2. The district court\u2019s <em>Allen </em>charge was not \u201ccoercive\u201d because it did not \u201cencourage[ ] jurors to abandon, without any principled reason, conscientiously held doubts.\u201d <em>Vichare, </em>106 F.3d at 465. Likewise, the manner in which the judge polled the jury did not unduly pressure the jury and therefore was proper. <em>See Lowenfield v. Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 239-40, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed.2d 568 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Because we reject these claims as merit-less, it is unnecessary to determine whether Slater preserved these claims below or whether she relied improperly on a post-hoc affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
