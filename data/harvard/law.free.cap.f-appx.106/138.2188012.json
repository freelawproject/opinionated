One action, led by BHP New Zealand, was filed by a New Zealand company and three Australian companies (collectively referred to as \u201cBHP\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The other action, led by Ferromin International Trade Corp., was filed by 26 foreign corporations with their principal places of business in the United States, Thailand, Turkey, Australia, China, Austria, and Sweden, and one U.S.-based affiliate that acted on behalf of two of the Turkish plaintiffs in this group (collectively referred to as \u201cFerromin\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The actions were filed against a group of American, Japanese, and German companies that manufacture and sell graphite electrodes in the domestic and foreign graphite electrode markets (collectively referred to as \u201cUCAR\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The two actions were consolidated in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>To produce steel, plaintiffs use a high-temperature technique that requires the burning of large quantities of graphite electrodes. Plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to artificially inflate graphite electrode prices by establishing a global cartel that fixed prices and allocated business among graphite electrode producers throughout the worldwide market. App. at 58-59,107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were beyond the subject matter of the Sherman Act. The District Court, by order of June 13, 2001, granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaints. <em>See Ferromin Int\u2019l Trade Corp. v. UCAR Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>153 F.Supp.2d 700 (E.D.Pa.2001). UCAR cross-appeals the same order. The District Court held that it had no subject matter jurisdiction over antitrust suits for overcharges on electrodes purchased outside the United States. It also ruled that claims based on items purchased abroad but invoiced in the United States were within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Both sets of parties appeal, following certification by the District Court of certain of its rulings under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1292(b) and its certification of the other rulings with the statements required under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The principal question before us on appeal is whether the Sherman Act\u2019s coverage with respect to activities involving foreign commerce, as defined by the general exclusionary rule and the specific exceptions contained in the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act (\u201cFTAIA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6a, extends to the specific antitrust claims asserted by plaintiffs. While this case was pending our decision, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2359, 159 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004), in which it held that where the alleged anticompetitive conduct causes an adverse foreign effect that is independent of the domestic effects of the conduct, \u201cthe FTAIA [domestic-injury] exception does not apply (and thus the Sherman Act does not apply).... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2366. The Court reasoned that \u201ctwo sets of considerations, the one derived from comity and the other reflecting history, convince us that Congress would not have intended the FTAIA\u2019s exception to bring independently caused foreign injury within the Sherman Act\u2019s reach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2371. The Court, however, stated no position regarding situations in which the foreign injury was not independent of the alleged anticompetitive conduct\u2019s domestic effects because the Court of Appeals had not addressed that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">We requested that the parties provide us with letter memoranda addressing the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Empagran </em>on the appeal before us. Both parties agree that, to the extent that plaintiff steel producers claim foreign injuries that are independent of the domestic effects of the alleged anticompetitive conduct, <em>Empagran </em>controls our ruling on such claims. Letter from plaintiff-appellants\u2019 counsel to the court of June 30, 2004, at 1-2; Letter from defendant-appellees\u2019 counsel to the court of July 1, 2004, at 1. Plaintiffs, however, assert that the basic questions on appeal, in light of <em>Empagran, </em>are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Have plaintiffs made a preliminary showing, sufficient to proceed with this litigation, that the prices they paid for graphite electrodes were linked to, and not \u201cindependent\u201d from, the raising of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>prices in the United States by defendants\u2019 alleged global price-fixing cartel? If not, should plaintiffs have an opportunity to make such a showing on remand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_R\">Letter from plaintiffs-appellant\u2019s counsel, at 1. Defendants, on the other hand, maintain that the District Court erred in allowing the claims of certain plaintiffs based on foreign purchases of graphite electrodes that were invoiced in the United States to proceed. Letter from defendants-appel-lees\u2019 counsel, at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Because the District Court, and the parties, did not have the benefit of <em>Empagmn, </em>we will remand the case to the District Court for its reconsideration. The District Court, should it deem it necessary or helpful, may give the parties the opportunity to present evidence as to whether the alleged anticompetitive conduct\u2019s domestic effects were linked to the alleged foreign harm. The District Court may consider and take evidence, if necessary, on any other related issue. For the reasons set forth above, we will vacate the decision of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-11\">.
