The parties have expressly waived oral argument in this case. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">On March 31, 2003, Clark pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of cocaine base. Clark was sentenced as a career offender to 188 months of imprisonment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">On appeal, Clark contends that the district court improperly sentenced her as a career offender because, although she was convicted of four prior state felony drug offenses as a result of three separate indictments, she was sentenced in a single court appearance while she was represented by the same attorney. In addition, Clark suggests that the determination of whether prior offenses are \u201crelated\u201d pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) may violate due process principles. The government responds that the district court did not err in sentencing Clark as a career offender and that Clark\u2019s due process contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">Generally, Clark is a career offender if she committed the instant felony offense when she was at least eighteen years old and had at least two prior felony drug offenses. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. For purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1, prior offenses count separately if the sentences imposed for the crimes are not \u201crelated\u201d as defined under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1. <em>See </em>USSG 4.B1.2(c). Prior offenses are \u201crelated\u201d if they: (A) occurred on the same occasion; (B) were part of a single scheme or plan; or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Horn, </em>355 F.3d 610, 613 (6th Cir.2004). Prior offenses are not \u201crelated\u201d if they are separated by an intervening arrest. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3). This court reviews only for clear error a district court\u2019s fact-bound determination of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>er prior criminal offenses are \u201crelated\u201d for purposes of USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2 <em>&amp; </em>4B1.1. <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001); <em>Horn, </em>355 F.3d at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Here, the district court did not commit clear error in determining that Clark had at least two prior felony drug convictions when she committed the instant drug trafficking offense. Essentially, it is undisputed that Clark pleaded guilty in 1998 to four state felony drug offenses committed on different dates in October and November of 1997. Clark was charged with the offenses in three separate indictments, but pleaded guilty to all of the offenses at a single court appearance, at which she was represented by the same attorney. The cases were not formally consolidated for sentencing, but the record reflects that Clark was sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years of imprisonment and two concurrent terms of five years of imprisonment. Clark concedes that her offenses were separated by intervening arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Under these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in sentencing Clark as a career offender. The district court correctly concluded that Clark\u2019s pri- or felony drug offenses are not \u201crelated\u201d because they were separated by intervening arrests. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.3). Moreover, Clark\u2019s prior offenses otherwise are not \u201crelated\u201d pursuant to this court\u2019s prior precedent, which Clark at least tacitly concedes on appeal by inviting this court to revisit the question. <em>See Horn, </em>355 F.3d at 613-15; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>283 F.3d 755, 757-58 (6th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Irons, </em>196 F.3d 634, 637-38 (6th Cir.1999). The government correctly notes that a panel of this court cannot revisit the question absent inconsistent Supreme Court or en banc precedent. <em>See Banks v. City of Whitehall, </em>344 F.3d 550, 553-54 (6th Cir.2003). In any event, the district court did not clearly err in sentencing Clark as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Finally, the government also correctly notes that Clark\u2019s due process contention lacks merit. This court has suggested that USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), with the applicable commentary, created the potential for unwarranted wide disparity in the treatment of prior offenses based on factors unrelated to the offenses themselves. <em>See Carter, </em>283 F.3d at 758-59. However, this court also noted that the United States Sentencing Commission had added USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), comment, (n.3), which applies in this case, to avoid unwarranted disparity in the application of the guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 760 n. 7. Under these circumstances, Clark\u2019s due process claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
