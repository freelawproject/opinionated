Frugoli, a State of California prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition, which challenged his conviction for battery with great bodily injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-26\">Frugoli\u2019s sole claim before us is that when the state trial court allowed the jurors to sign requests that their personal juror identifying information be conditionally sealed, he was denied the fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-27\">We see no great significance to the argument over whether the California courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>precisely followed the requirements of California law when they allowed the signing of the forms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The important issue is whether there was a violation of the United States Constitution that resulted in error<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of a magnitude sufficient to require issuance of the writ. Here, even assuming that there was error of constitutional magnitude, it is apparent that the error was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence against Frugoli was overwhelming, and there is simply no reason to believe that the jury\u2019s determination was affected by the claimed form-signing error. If there was any error at all, it did not have \u201c \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637\u2014 38, 113 S.Ct. at 1721 \u2014 22 (citation omitted); <em>Morales v. Woodford, </em>336 F.3d 1136, 1148 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Ghent v. Woodford, </em>279 F.3d 1121, 1126 \u2014 27 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">. As a matter of fact, issues of state law are not generally reviewable in federal habeas corpus proceedings. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67 \u2014 68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 479\u201480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). But, even if they were, we are very dubious about the proposition that on the evidence available in this case, California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 237 prohibited the obtaining of the signatures of the jurors at the time they were obtained. <em>Compare People v. Goodwin, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1089\u201491, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 576, 578\u201480 (1997), <em>with Erickson v. Superior Court, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 755, 757\u201459, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 230, 232\u201433 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. The issue of whether there was error at all would be one concerned with whether the signing of the request forms gave Frugoli an aura of dangerousness to some extent. Surely, more direct indications of dangerousness \u2014 such as, armed guards in the courtroom, prison attire, shackles, or refusal to give any juror information to counsel at any time \u2014 might have that effect. <em>See Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 567\u201472, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 1345\u201447, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986); <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 970\u201473 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Rhoden v. Rowland, </em>172 F.3d 633, 636\u201437 (9th Cir.1999). Nothing quite that problematic appears here. But, as the text indicates, we need not decide whether on the record before us the signing might have slipped over the border dividing the undesirable from the unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-21\">. We are, of course, dealing with trial-type error. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 629\u201430, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1717, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Castillo v. Stainer, </em>983 F.2d 145, 148 (9th Cir.1992); <em>cf. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 483\u201484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1038, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000); <em>Calderon v.
