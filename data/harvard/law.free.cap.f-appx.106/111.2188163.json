For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Because we write only for the parties, we need not reiterate the facts except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Ahmed is a native and citizen of Syria. He entered the United States on June 12, 1988 as a nonimmigrant with authorization to remain until August 2 of the same year. A.R. 227. Sometime in 1989, he filed an application for asylum with the Immigration and Naturalization Service<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Newark, New Jersey. A.R. 143-44.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 11, 1990, he filed a second application for asylum in Los Angeles, California and was interviewed by an asylum officer the same day. A.R. 211-15. However, no decision was reached at that time. On August 26, 1998, almost eight years later, the INS conducted a second asylum interview, and determined that Ahmed was ineligible for relief. A.R. 186-87. Shortly thereafter, the INS initiated removal proceedings against Ahmed for overstaying his visa in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). A.R. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Ahmed conceded removability before the immigration court, but applied for asylum and withholding of removal or, in the alternative, voluntary departure. A.R. 59-60. As part of his asylum application, he submitted a declaration describing two incidents of \u201cabuse and mistreatment on account of [his] political views.\u201d A.R. 195. First, Ahmed stated that in 1979, he was \u201cbeaten and abused for voting in opposition to President Assad in a national election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, he claimed that, in 1983, he was detained and beaten for twenty-five days because he wrote a paper expressing his disapproval of the Syrian government\u2019s economic policies. Ahmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>stated that he was eventually released on the condition that he become a government informant and never tell anyone about his detention. A.R. 196-97. Neither incident was mentioned in his 1990 application or during his immigration interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On January 14, 1999, the IJ set a hearing date of April 27 and stated that he would not consider \u201canything\u201d submitted less than 10 days prior to the hearing. A.R. 63. At the hearing, Ahmed\u2019s counsel requested, for the first time, that his psychiatrist, Dr. Delston, be allowed to testify on his client\u2019s behalf and that his written report be submitted into evidence. A.R. 67-68. The IJ refused both requests. A.R. 72. Thereafter, Ahmed testified on his own behalf and described the 1979 and 1983 incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The IJ ultimately denied Ahmed\u2019s claim, finding that his testimony was not credible. A.R. 39. Alternatively, the IJ found that, even if Ahmed testified truthfully, he had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution because the most recent incident of abuse occurred more than 16 years prior to the hearing. A.R. 42. However, the IJ did grant Ahmed\u2019s request for voluntary departure. On August 29, 2002, the BIA issued a <em>per curium </em>order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), thereby making it the final agency determination. A.R. 2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">A. Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b). The Immigration and Nationalization Act defines \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). In order to meet this standard, an alien must possess \u201ca subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1166 (3d Cir. 1997). In other words, \u201c[t]he applicant's statements ... must be viewed in the context of the relevant background situation.\u201d <em>Matter of Dass, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 120, 125 (1989). However, an alien does not have to show a clear probability of persecution in order to be granted asylum. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987), \u201c[o]ne can certainly have a well-founded fear of an event happening when there is less than a 50% chance of the occurrence taking place.\u201d If an alien establishes that he/she suffered past persecution, a rebuttable presumption arises that he/she has a well-founded fear of persecution in the future. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">In order to withstand appellate review, the agency\u2019s decision must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Balasubra-manrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sion....\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). This standard applies with equal force to adverse credibility determinations. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201c[Ajdverse credibility determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">As stated above, the IJ denied Ahmed\u2019s claim for lack of credibility. His decision was based primarily on the fact that Ahmed did not mention the 1979 and 1983 incidents until after his application was denied by the INS. A.R. 39. Moreover, Ahmed not only failed to mention these incidents in his 1990 asylum application (A.R.211-215), he also failed to discuss them in either of his two asylum interviews in 1990 and 1998. During his testimony, Ahmed attempted to explain the latter two omissions. First, he testified that he did not mention these incidents during the 1990 interview because he did not trust his cousin, who was acting as his interpreter. A.R. 138-40. Later, he testified that he chose not to mention these incidents during the 1998 interview because he was not sure whether he could add any \u201cnew\u201d information to his claim at that point. A.R. 142. The IJ found both explanations implausible. A.R. 41. Finally, the IJ noted that Ahmed\u2019s \u201coverall demeanor and way of answering questions ... [was] utterly evasive.... \u201d A.R. 42.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Ahmed\u2019s failure to mention the 1979 and 1983 incidents were not minor omissions; rather, these allegations go to the very \u201cheart of [his] asylum claim.\u201d <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Those incidents are, in fact, the only evidence of persecution offered in support of his claim. Without them, there is no question that his application would be summarily denied. This case is therefore distinguishable from <em>Ba-lasubramanrim, </em>143 F.3d 157, where we held that courts must be careful not to place too much emphasis on statements made by an alien during an involuntary interview conducted immediately upon his/ her arrival in the United States. There, we stated that \u201can arriving alien who has suffered abuse during interrogation sessions by government officials in his home country may be reluctant to reveal such information during the first meeting with government officials in this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163; <em>see also Senathirajah v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 218 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201cGiven Sena-thirajah\u2019s allegations of torture and detention, he may well have been reluctant to disclose the breadth of his suffering in Sri Lanka to a government official upon arriving in the United States.... \u201d). Ahmed had been in the United States for more than 2 years before filing his current asylum application. By the time the INS conducted its second interview and issued a decision on his application, he had been in the country for more than 10 years. Ahmed\u2019s application does not, therefore, present the intricacies that troubled us in <em>Balasubramanrim </em>and <em>Senathirajah. </em>We conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>nation is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">B. Exclusion of Expert Witness\u2019 Testimony and Written Report</p>\n<p id=\"AKG\">Ahmed also argues that his due process rights were violated when the IJ declined to consider the testimony and written report of his psychiatrist and expert witness, Dr. Delston. There is no question that an alien facing removal has a right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Chong v. INS, </em>264 F.3d 378, 386 (3d Cir.2001). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of removal proceedings, an alien: (1) is entitled to fact-finding based on the record before the court; (2) must be given the opportunity to make arguments on his/ her own behalf; and (3) has the right to an individualized determination of his/her claims. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>We review alleged due process violations in removal proceedings <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">An \u201cImmigration Judge may order any party to file a pre-hearing statement of position that may include, but is not limited to ... a list of proposed witnesses and what they will establish.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.21 (now located at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.21). Here, more than four months prior to the hearing, the IJ indicated that he would not accept \u201canything\u201d submitted less than 10 days in advance of the hearing (hereinafter, \u201cthe 10-day rule\u201d). A.R. 63. Nonetheless, at the hearing, Ahmed\u2019s counsel requested, for the first time, that Dr. Del-ston be allowed to testify on his client\u2019s behalf and that his written report be submitted into evidence. The last minute request caught the government by surprise as counsel for the government was unaware of Dr. Delston\u2019s qualifications and the nature and scope of his proposed testimony. A.R. 68. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that Dr. Delston \u201cforgot\u201d to bring his resum\u00e9 to the hearing. <em>Id. </em>Not surprisingly, the IJ therefore refused to allow Dr. Delston\u2019s testimony or admit his written report.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">That decision hardly offends notions of due process. Ahmed was clearly given an opportunity to make arguments and submit evidence in support of his case in a \u201cmeaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Chong, </em>264 F.3d at 386. He simply failed to observe the reasonable evidentiary deadline imposed by the IJ. He then failed to offer a compelling reason why Dr. Delston\u2019s testimony and report should be exempted from the court\u2019s 10-day rule. At the hearing, counsel sought to justify the late submission by stating that, due to Dr. Delston\u2019s busy schedule, he only recently had an opportunity to evaluate Ahmed. A.R. 72. Counsel also indicated that he was unaware that his client was even evaluated by Dr. Delston until the day before the hearing. A.R. 69, 72.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These excuses are inadequate for several reasons. First, Ahmed had eight months to seek an expert psychological evaluation in support of his claim, beginning August 26, 1998, the date his asylum application was denied by the INS, and ending April 17, 1999, 10 days prior to the immigration court hearing. Even assuming that this period was somehow insufficient to schedule an appointment with Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Delston \u2014 which we seriously doubt\u2014 Ahmed should have found a psychiatrist willing to evaluate him within the court\u2019s deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Ahmed also fails to explain why he did not bother to inform opposing counsel of his decision to seek a psychological evaluation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is simply no justification for his secretiveness, nor is there a judicial remedy. <em>Compare, Balasubramanrim, </em>143 F.3d 157. Finally, Ahmed has failed to offer any indication that the IJ\u2019s decision would have been influenced by Dr. Delston\u2019s testimony or report. <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (2000) (In order to establish a due process violation, \u201can alien [must] show prejudice, which means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation.\u201d). We fail to see how the witness\u2019 testimony would have changed Ahmed\u2019s credibility. In any event, it is clear that excluding the testimony does not implicate the Due Process Clause or deny Ahmed any of the constitutional protections he was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-13\">. Effective March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist, and its interior enforcement functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act, 116 Stat. 2135 Pub.L. 107-296 \u00a7 441 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-18\">. This application was not presented below (A.R.41-42), and is not part of the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\">. The IJ also mentioned that there were some discrepancies between Ahmed\u2019s 1989 and 1990 asylum applications. A.R. 41-42. However, because Ahmed\u2019s 1989 application was never introduced into evidence, the IJ was forced to admit that he \"[did not] really know what those differences [were].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we will not consider Ahmed's 1989 application in determining whether there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. In light of this finding, we need not consider whether the IJ\u2019s alternative rationale for denying Ahmed's claim \u2014 that he did not have a reasonable fear of future persecution \u2014 was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\">. This is consistent with Ahmed\u2019s statement at the hearing that he \"only called [counsel] yesterday .... \u201d regarding his evaluation by Dr. Delston. A.R. 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b138-20\">.
