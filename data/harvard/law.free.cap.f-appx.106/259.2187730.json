He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for tax evasion for the years 1994 through 1997, that the Government did not prove that the Internal Revenue Service made a tax assessment or demand for the years 1994 through 1997, and that the Government failed to prove the willfulness requirement of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. A review of the evidence establishes that the district court\u2019s finding that O\u2019Kane was guilty of four counts of tax evasion for the years 1994 through 1997 is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and that \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 411 (5th Cir.2000). The evidence established that there were tax deficiencies for the years 1994 through 1997, that O\u2019Kane took numerous affirmative steps to evade or attempt to evade taxes, and that he acted willfully. <em>See United States v. Townsend, </em>31 F.3d 262, 266 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">O\u2019Kane argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment based on' his claim that the Government withheld \u201cnotices of deficiency issued for tax periods 1994 and 1995.\u201d O\u2019Kane has not established a violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) as he has not shown that the Government withheld such notices or that the notices would have been favorable to the defense. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>162 F.3d 840, 851 (5th Cir.1998). Therefore, the district court did not err in denying his motion to quash the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">O\u2019Kane argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to require the Government to show its authority to act. Although O\u2019Kane filed this motion in the district court, he argues for the first time on appeal that this motion was based on his claim that the federal income tax laws are unconstitutional. Therefore, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We have rejected on numerous occasions attacks on the constitutionality of the federal income tax laws. <em>See Stelly v. Comm\u2019r, </em>761 F.2d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1985). Therefore, O\u2019Kane has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of this motion was error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
