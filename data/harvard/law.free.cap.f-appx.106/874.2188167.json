Nicholson seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint challenging the government\u2019s filing of tax hens. The district court dismissed Nicholson\u2019s complaint in an order entered on March 31, 2004. Nicholson\u2019s notice of appeal, dated April 29, 2004, was received in the district court on June 3, 2004. Nicholson asserted that he mailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>his notice of appeal on April 29, 2004, and, upon discovering that it had not been filed, sent a copy of the notice of appeal on June 3, 2004. Nicholson\u2019s notice of appeal was made within the period of time applicable for a determination of excusable neglect or good cause under Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and expressed his desire to preserve his appeal. <em>See Myers v. Stephenson, </em>781 F.2d 1036, 1038-39 (4th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of permitting that court to determine whether Nicholson has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of time for filing a notice of appeal. The record, as supplemented, then will be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
