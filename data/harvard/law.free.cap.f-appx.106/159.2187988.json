Hill appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny Hill Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income. Hill argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not give proper weight to the opinion of Hill\u2019s primary physician or a psychiatrist with whom Hill met once. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). Contrary to Hill\u2019s argument, the ALJ properly declined to fully credit the medical assessment of Muhammad Javed, M.D. The medical source opinion regulations indicate that the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight the Commissioner will give it. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d), 416.927(d) (2000). The bulk of the remaining medical sources of record opined that, although Hill experienced various limitations, he was still able to perform various functions, including, inter alia, standing for several hours, sitting for several hours, and lifting to a certain degree. Thus, we find that the ALJ did not err by discounting Javed\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Next, Hill argues that the ALJ erroneously substituted his own medical opinion for that of David Forester, M.D., a psychiatrist with whom Hill met once for ninety minutes. Again, Hill\u2019s argument is without merit. In reaching his conclusion, the ALJ properly considered Dr. Forester\u2019s testimony in the context of the other medical evidence. Therefore, although Hill clearly suffers from back and lung problems, as well as anxiety, substantial evidence supports a finding that these deficiencies do not significantly limit Hill\u2019s ability to work a light to sedentary unskilled job.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
