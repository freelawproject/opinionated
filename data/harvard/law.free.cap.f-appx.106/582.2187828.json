We issued a certificate of appealability with respect to one issue: Whether the prosecution committed misconduct during closing argument in violation of appellant\u2019s federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-24\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a habeas petition. <em>Killian v. Poole, </em>282 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1179, 123 S.Ct. 992, 154 L.Ed.2d 927 (2003). As the facts are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to understand our disposition. We vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Watkins\u2019s habeas petition and remand so that the transcript of the state court proceedings can be obtained and reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The district court should have requested, sua sponte, Watkins\u2019s state trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The habeas statute requires petitioners who attack the sufficiency of the evidence against them to provide the relevant record or show that they are unable to obtain it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(f). Ninth Circuit law so recognizes. <em>See Austad v. Ris-ley, </em>761 F.2d 1348, 1351 (9th Cir.1985) (en banc) (reviewing habeas petitioner\u2019s due process violation claim regarding unfair pretrial publicity). Under Ninth Circuit law, however, a federal district court itself must obtain and examine state court records when a habeas petitioner seeks review of a mixed question of fact and law. <em>See Ruff v. Kincheloe, </em>843 F.2d 1240, 1242 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Chaney v. Lewis, </em>801 F.2d 1191, 1194 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Reiger v. Christensen, </em>789 F.2d 1425, 1428-29 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In general, a mixed question is one \u201cin which the historical facts are admitted or established, the rule of law is undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard, or to put it another way, whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated.\u201d <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 289 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). <em>See also Suzy\u2019s Zoo v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>273 F.3d 875, 878 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA mixed question of law and fact exists when primary facts are undisputed and ultimate inferences and legal consequences are in dispute.\u201d); <em>In re Bammer, </em>131 F.3d 788, 792 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (\u201cMixed questions ... require consideration of legal concepts and the exercise of judgment about the values that animate legal principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Applying these standards, we conclude that Watkins\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim presented a mixed question of fact and law. Resolution of a prosecutorial misconduct claim does not require determination of any historical facts; what was said or not said at the trial is a matter of record. Instead, resolution of a prosecutorial misconduct claim concerning comments in closing argument requires an inquiry into whether \u201cthe prosecutors\u2019 comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). As such, clearly established Supreme Court law requires an inquiry into whether the prosecutor manipulated or misstated the evidence, <em>id. </em>at 181-82, 106 S.Ct. 2464; the weight of the evidence against the defendant; <em>id. </em>at 182, 106 S.Ct. 2464; and whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were responsive to earlier defense arguments. <em>Id. </em>If a court finds that misconduct did occur, it will also typically consider whether the trial court judge issued curative instructions to the jury. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>F.3d 851, 869 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Johnson v. Sublett, </em>63 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Burks v. Borg, 27 </em>F.3d 1424, 1430-31 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Conducting a <em>Darden </em>analysis requires the district court to review the relevant transcript. Only review of a transcript will allow the court to place the prosecutor\u2019s statements in context, to compare the statements for accuracy with regard to the evidence adduced at trial, and to thereby determine the relevant legal question: whether the trial overall was fundamentally fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We conclude that under this court\u2019s precedents the trial court was obliged to obtain the state court transcripts before deciding Watkins\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As respondent observes, this case, unlike the <em>Reiger </em>line of cases, is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997) (settling AEDPA\u2019s effective date). AEDPA did not, however, alter the language of \u00a7 2254 central to this court\u2019s allocation of responsibility for ordering relevant state court records. Instead, as it pertains to this case, AEDPA simply ordered the redesig-nation of \u00a7 2254(e) as \u00a7 2254(f). Deference to state court factual findings existed pre-AEDPA and, in any event, does not determine who is responsible for obtaining state court records. We therefore reject the contention that AEDPA requires reconsideration of this court\u2019s precedents regarding the allocation of responsibility in a \u00a7 2254 case for obtaining the state court transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The argument that Watkins should have obtained the transcripts himself or explained why he could not do so is particularly unpersuasive in this case. Watkins was a pro se petitioner, and was under the misapprehension that the district court automatically received the trial transcript from the state. This was not an unreasonable assumption. Habeas Corpus Rule 5 requires the state to attach relevant portions of state court transcripts to its answer to a petition. <em>See </em>Rule 5 Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases (\u201cThe answer shall indicate what transcripts ... are available, [and] when they can be furnished____ There shall be attached to the answer such portions of the transcripts as the answering party deems relevant.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Watkins\u2019s ha-beas petition, and REMAND for proceedings in light of this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">. The subsection states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">If the applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in such State court proceeding to support the State court\u2019s determination of a factual issue made therein, the applicant, if able, shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such determination. If the applicant, because of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record, then the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to do so by order directed to an appropriate State official. If the State cannot provide such pertinent part of the record, then the court shall determine under the existing facts and circumstances what weight shall be given to the State court's factual determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
