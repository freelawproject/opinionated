Valentino was a bank vice-president who pled guilty to bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. His plea agreement stated that he agreed to restitution of $1,358,596 \u201cas directed by the Court\u201d and further included a waiver-of-appeals provision. At sentencing, Valentino stated he had spent most of the money entertaining clients and offered no further explanation. The district court found \u201cthere\u2019s no way you can dispose of 1.3 [million] without some clear record of where you spent it,\u201d and ordered Valentino to make monthly payments of at least $20,000 during supervised release unless he could provide an itemized explanation of how the money was spent. The court said it would revisit the payment schedule if he could produce such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Valentino\u2019s appeal fails at the threshold inquiry of jurisdiction. Paragraph 3 of the agreement stated that Valentino would make restitution \u201cas directed by the Court.\u201d Paragraph 10 waived appeal of the \u201cconviction, sentence, or any other matter relating to this prosecution.\u201d Despite the waiver, Valentino could file a direct appeal \u201cbut may raise only claims that\u201d his sentence \u201cexceeds the statutory maximum\u201d or that the court \u201cerroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Valentino\u2019s waiver precludes this appeal. \u201cWaivers of appeals, if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, are valid, unless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 563 (3d Cir.2001). Although waivers are strictly construed, see <em>id., </em>even the narrowest construction of the phrase \u201cany other matter relating to this prosecution\u201d embraces the restitution order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, Valentino agreed to make restitution \u201cas directed by the Court,\u201d underscoring that restitution did not fall within the narrow range of issues permitted to be appealed despite the waiver. <em>See United States v. Greger, </em>98 F.3d 1080, 1081 (8th Cir.1996). Valentino does not challenge the government\u2019s assertion that the district court reviewed the waiver with Valentino and assured that he entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily. Nor has he shown that enforcement of the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(e); <em>United States v. Voigt, </em>89 F.3d 1050, 1093 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Because we lack appellate jurisdiction, the appeal will be DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\">. Defendant cites cases where Courts of Appeals refused to enforce a waiver of the right to appeal the \"sentence.\u201d Such cases are inapposite because of the phrase \"any other matter relating to this prosecution,\u201d which unambiguously includes the restitution order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
