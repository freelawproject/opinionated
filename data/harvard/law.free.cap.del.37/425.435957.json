That <em>section </em>does provide that acknowledgments of a married woman to all instruments of writing relating to her real estate shall be taken as provided in <em>Chapter </em>92 of the <em>Code </em>of 1915, which <em>chapter </em>includes <em>Section </em>3200; but the same <em>chapter, </em>also, includes other general provisions relating to the acknowledgment of deeds and before whom they shall be taken. This is particularly true of <em>Section </em>3199.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">As the husband of Mrs. Harrington was not a party to her deed, there was no reason for the certificate of the Notary to show that her acknowledgment was taken separate and apart from him, and <em>Section </em>3200, therefore, has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys then closed their case, but, on being asked by the court whether they had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case by the mere proof of the execution and delivery of a deed conveying the title of Mrs. Harrington to Gilpin, without any proof, whatever, of possession either by Mrs. Harrington or by any other prior owner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they then asked permission to produce other evidence. This permission was granted, and they proved the legal title of the real plaintiff by introducing deed records as far back as 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The defendant\u2019s attorney then admitted that Mrs. Harrington, the grantor of the real plaintiff in the action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>had taken possession of the property in dispute under the deed to her of Walker L. Mifflin, <em>et al., </em>dated November 15th, 1919;</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The defendant\u2019s attorney produced no evidence, whatever, and judgment was, therefore, entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\"> Whether such proof of possession was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case, see 19 <em>C.
