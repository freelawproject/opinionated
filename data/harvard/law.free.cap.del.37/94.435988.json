He produced evidence to show that Mrs. Brand had since died, and then offered in evidence a certified copy of the record of her testimony in that court, claiming that it had been given in an action between the same parties on the same subject matter, and was, therefore, admissible in this court. He cited <em>Rogers v. Rogers, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>267, 66 <em>A. </em>374.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The attorneys for the plaintiff objected to the admission of the record offered, claiming that the death of Mrs. Brand alone did not make her evidence pertinent, and, therefore, admissible, and that there being no evidence that Mr. Miller was acting for the Industrial Trust Company, the defendant\u2019s offer was governed by the ruling of the Court above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The Court (Rodney, J.) sustained the objection on the ground that the relevancy of the evidence offered had not been shown.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-15\">See, also, <em>Gibson v.
