J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">A writ of attachment issued in this case which, upon motion of defendant, was discharged on the ground that the affidavit required by section 538, Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cis not properly or at all subscribed or sworn to on behalf of the said plaintiff.\u201d Plaintiff appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">The affidavit reads, giving the title of court and cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adu\">\u201cState of California,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">City and County of San Francisco.\u2014ss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">\u201cR. M. Hotaling of the plaintiff corporation in the action above named, being duly sworn, deposes and says: [Then follows statement of the indebtedness to plaintiff and other facts required by the statute]; and this deponent further says [then follow still further facts required to be stated]; that affiant is the duly elected, qualified and acting President of the plaintiff corporation, and makes the affidavit in its behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">\u201cA.

BURNS,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-18\">\u201cNotary Public in and for the City and County of San Francisco, State of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">Section 538, Code of Civil Procedure, provides that the clerk shall issue the writ of attachment, \u201cupon receiving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>affidavit by or on behalf of plaintiff.\u201d All of the facts necessary to a sufficient affidavit appear in the body of the document here, leaving the sole question whether it sufficiently appears that the affidavit was made \u201cby or on behalf of plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In judging of its sufficiency in the particular called in question we must refer to the entire affidavit. It plainly appears that R. M. Hotaling was, when he made the affidavit, the president of the corporation, and that he made it \u201cin its behalf.\u201d That he was the person sworn and the person who made the affidavit and deposed to the facts embodied in it clearly appears from the body of the document which the notary certifies was subscribed and sworn to. It was not necessary that the affidavit be signed. <em>(Ede </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 Cal. 53; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Kirchner, </em>77 Cal. 152, [19 Pac. 264]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Washoe Co., </em>5 Nev. 320.) The corporation could not make the affidavit, and the fact that its name is attached to it is of no importance, and involves no ambiguity upon the question as to who in fact made it. That the affiant affixed the corporate name, followed as it is\u2014\u201cBy R. M. Hotaling, President,\u201d does not change the fact, clearly appearing, that he, Hotaling, personally made the affidavit and was the one who subscribed and swore to it. Taking the document as a whole, there can be no doubt as to the essential statutory requirement appearing that a sufficient affidavit must be made \u201cby or on behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d Nor do we doubt that the test suggested by respondent is here met, namely, that the affidavit must \u201cbe so clear and certain that an indictment for perjury may he sustained upon it if false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Blyth &amp; Fargo Co. </em>v. <em>Swensen et al., </em>7 Wyo. 303, [51 Pac. 873], is cited by both parties. In that ease the affidavit read: \u201cPlaintiff in the action above named, being duly sworn, deposes and says,\u201d etc., and is signed: \u201cThe Blyth &amp; Fargo Co. by Sherman Fargo, Managing Agent. Subscribed and sworn to before me . . . John W. Sammon, Clerk.\u201d The court said: \u201cIt is not the affidavit of the plaintiff, for, being a company, it cannot take an oath. It is not the affidavit of the agent for nowhere in the paper is it purported that the agent makes any statement whatever. The language is that \u2018the plaintiff deposes and says.\u2019 \u201d In the case here, however, it appears clear enough that the plaintiff did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>make the affidavit, but Hotaling made it; that he was a proper person to make it, and that he made it, as the statute authorized him to do, on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We are well satisfied that the affidavit was sufficient, and the order is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Burnett, J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
