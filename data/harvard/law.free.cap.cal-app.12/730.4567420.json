Appellant claims that the confession was not made voluntarily, but that he was induced to make it by reason of the chief of police and another officer assuring him (together with other promises which, if made, were sufficient to render the confession inadmissible) that if the valuables stolen were returned and he would \u201ctell the whole business,\u201d the prosecution would be dropped and the case dismissed. Not only did these officers deny making the several statements and representations attributed to them by defendant, and upon the strength of which he claims to have made the confession, but they denied using any language of like import. It thus appears there is a sharp conflict in the testimony of the witnesses upon a question of fact, as to which, like any other disputed fact, the finding of the trial court must be deemed conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Upon discoyering that her diamonds had been stolen from the box wherein they were placed, which box was deposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>in the custody of the cashier of the bathhouse where she went in bathing, the owner applied to the chief of police to assist her in their recovery. During his investigation of the circumstances connected with the commission of the crime, and before defendant was arrested, the chief of police said to him: \u201cI am satisfied that you know exactly where the diamonds are, and come through and tell me where they are; the game is young.\u201d We are unable to perceive how this language could be construed as a promise of immunity. The words, \u201cthe game is young,\u201d have no secret or hidden meaning. The police officer was engaged in an effort to recover the stolen goods, and being satisfied that defendant was cognizant of the theft, requested that he tell of their whereabouts, thus relieving the officer from the duty of a further search. The cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>133 Cal. 165, [65 Pac. 323], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>84 Cal. 598, [24 Pac. 384], have no bearing upon the question. In the former case, the defendant\u2019s admission was excluded from evidence because it was obtained by duress, while in the latter the defendant was induced to confess by reason of the sheriff telling him, in response to an inquiry, it would be better for him to make a full disclosure. In the case at bar it is significant that the confession was not made until several days after the alleged promise of immunity and after the officer had recovered possession of the stolen property and obtained further evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. The direct evidence of the officers contradicting the testimony of defendant, as well as the inferences fairly deducible from circumstances, the existence of which was conclusively shown by the evidence, or admitted by defendant, fully justified the court in holding the confession to have been made voluntarily and without promise of any kind whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">While in jail defendant wrote a letter to one who had been his accomplice in the commission of the crime. The contents of this letter strongly tended to prove defendant\u2019s guilt. It was received in evidence over defendant\u2019s objection that it was procured by strategy and fraud. In the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Swaile, ante, </em>p. 192, [107 Pac. 134], this court, in discussing .an objection of like character, said: \u201cThough papers and other subjects of evidence may have been illegally taken from the possession of the party against whom they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>are offered, or otherwise unlawfully obtained, this is no valid objection to their admissibility if they are pertinent to the issue. (1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 16th ed., see. 254a.) \u201d Moreover, there was evidence tending to prove that defendant\u2019s surrender of the letter was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Other points urged by appellant are deserving of no consideration, other than to say that they are wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Allen, P. J., and Taggart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
