This demurrer was overruled, and upon final hearing the prayer of the petition was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">Section 4460 defines a newspaper of general circulation as follows: \u201cA newspaper published for the dissemination of local or telegraphic news and intelligence of a general character, having a <em>bona, fide </em>subscription list of paying subscribers, and which shall have been established, printed and published at regular intervals in the state, county, city, city and county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>or town where such publication, notice by publication, or official advertising is given or made, for at least one year preceding the date of such publication, notice or advertisement. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The \u201cPalo Alto Tribune,\u201d as above stated, was published weekly during a part of the period of one year preceding the filing of the petition in the superior court, and daily during the remainder of that period; and the single question presented for determination is, Can it be said under those circumstances that such newspaper was published at regular intervals for one year?</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">It does not appear that the efficiency of a journal would be at all impaired by a change from weekly to daily publication. It might perhaps be said, in answer to the claim of the contestant, that the publication in this case was irregular, that a newspaper published every day is necessarily published every week, and the argument could be made that a newspaper published weekly for nine months, and thenceforth daily for three months, has been published weekly for a year. But we think it unnecessary to resort to such an argument, for it appears plain to us, bearing in mind the purpose of the act as well as the language of the provision in question, that the publication in this case constitutes a publication at regular intervals for one year. The section does not require the interval between dates of publication \u2018to be equal from beginning to end, but it must be regular, that is, not spasmodic or occasional.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Hall, J., and Cooper, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
