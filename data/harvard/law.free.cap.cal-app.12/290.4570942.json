Petitioners\u2019 only contention is that said ordinance has been abrogated by section 25% of article IV of the constitution of the state, adopted as an amendment in 1902. Said amendment is as follows: \u201cThe legislature may provide for the division of the state into fish and game districts, and may enact such laws for the protection of fish and game therein as it may deem appropriate for the respective districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">It is admitted that the legislature has taken no action in pursuance of said amendment, and as the provision itself is not self-operative, it is impossible to hold that by the terms of said amendment the ordinance involved herein has been repealed. The most that could be urged by petitioners is that the power to regulate the pursuit of fish and game has been taken away from the board of supervisors and given exclusively to the legislature. But conceding without deciding this, it is manifest that the said amendment is prospective and not retrospective in its operation, and it does not expressly, nor can it be held by implication to affect any prior legislation by the board of supervisors valid at the time of its enactment. Article 22 of the constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>provides: \u201cThat no inconvenience may arise from the alterations and amendments in the constitution of the state, and to carry the same into complete effect, it is hereby ordained and declared: Sec. 1. That all laws in force at the adoption of the constitution, not inconsistent therewith, shall remain in full force and effect until altered or repealed by the legislature ; and all rights, actions, prosecutions, claims and contracts of the state, counties, individuals, or bodies corporate not inconsistent therewith shall continue to be as valid as if the constitution had not been adopted.\u201d The same rule must, of course, apply to amendments to the constitution, and the principle is indorsed in many decisions and, indeed, hardly needs authority in its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In <em>Gurnee </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>58 Cal. 91, it is said: \u201cIt is a well-settled rule of construction, applicable alike to constitutions and statutes, that they are to be considered prospective and not retrospective in their operation, unless a contrary intention clearly appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Ex parte Burke, </em>59 Cal. 8, [43 Am. Rep. 231], in reference to a similar condition, it is said: \u201cAt the time the law in question was passed there was no constitutional objection to special and local legislation. This was held by the supreme court in the very early ease of <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 Cal. 87, and the same doctrine was again laid down in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Central Pacific R. R. Co., </em>43 Cal. 398. When the act was passed it was a valid act, even conceding for the purposes of the argument that it was a special law, as is claimed in this case. The question therefore arises, Was the act abrogated by the provisions of the new constitution referred to above? The language of section 25, article 4, is that \u2018the legislature shall not pass local or special laws. \u2019 The constitutional inhibition manifestly applies to future and' not to past legislation. The provision is purely and simply prospective in its operation and the words will not justify any other construction. It did not, therefore, operate as a repeal of acts passed by the legislature years before the constitution went into effect, but merely p.ut a stop to all future legislation of that objectionable character. If authority were required in support of this view, it will be found in the following cases: <em>State </em>v. <em>Barbee, </em>3 Ind. 258; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>State, </em>24 Ind. 28; Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 76.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We see no necessity for further quotation in support of a proposition that seems so plain. None of' the cases cited by petitioners affords any support to their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The petitioners are remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Hart, J., and Chipman, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
