Pursuant to his October 3, 1985, pleas the trial court sentenced him on November 22, 1985. On count two, the principal term, the court sentenced Reiley to the six-year upper term for residential robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 213.5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enhanced by one year for firearm possession (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)) and three years for great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7). In addition to credit for actual time served, he received 353 days good time credit (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>\u00a7 4019). Reiley appeals from the judgment of imprisonment alleging sentencing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Reiley challenges the imposition of consecutive sections 12022 and 12022.7 enhancements without a statement of reasons. Penal Code section 1170, subdivision (c), provides, \u201cThe court shall state the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing.\u201d Imposition of consecutive rather than concurrent sentences is a \u201csentence choice,\u201d within the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 619, 622 [148 Cal.Rptr. 66].) The provisions of sections 12022 and 12022.7, however, <em>\u201cdo not define a crime or offense </em>but relate to the <em>penalty </em>to be imposed under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Grilli) </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 506, 512 [148 Cal.Rptr. 740], italics in original.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the California Rules of Court, rule 405(c), \u201c \u2018Enhancement\u2019 means an additional term of imprisonment added to the base term.\u201d Both sections 12022 and 12022.7 prescribe \u201cin addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the [underlying] felony ... an additional term....\u201d as enhancement. The statutory language does not define a separate offense, but \u201cmerely imposes <em>additional punishment </em>for the felony or attempted felony committed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Grilli), supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d at p. 513, italics in original.) Thus, <em>if </em>multiple enhancements are imposed, they are inherently consecutive rather than concurrent. Reiley cites no authority to the contrary. The issue is really whether the trial court is required to state reasons for imposing both enhancements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">\u201c \u2018Shall\u2019 is mandatory,... \u2018may\u2019 is permissive.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 407(a).) Both sections 12022 and 12022.7 employ the verb \u201cshall\u201d rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>than the verb \u201cmay.\u201d Furthermore, section 1170.1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> subdivision (d), provides, \u201cWhen the court imposes a prison sentence for a felony pursuant to Section 1170 [the determinate sentencing law] the court <em>shall </em>also impose the additional terms provided in Sections 667.5, 12022, 12022.4, 12022.5, 12022.6, 12022.7, and 12022.9, unless the additional punishment therefore [sic] is stricken pursuant to subdivision (h).\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (h) provides the court may strike the above enumerated enhancements \u201cif it determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the additional punishment and states on the record its reasons for striking the additional punishment.\u201d Thus, if the court imposes enhancements under either section 12022 or 12022.7, it need not state its reasons. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Langevin </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 520, 524 [202 Cal.Rptr. 234].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">\u201cWhen two or more enhancements under Sections 12022, 12022.4, 12022.5, 12022.7, and 12022.9 may be imposed for any single offense, only the greatest enhancement shall apply.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (e).) However, in certain cases including robbery, \u201cthe court <em>may </em>impose both (1) one enhancement for weapons as provided in either Section 12022, 12022.4, or 12022.5 and (2) an enhancement for great bodily injury as provided in Section 12022.7 or 12022.9.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The Attorney General correctly notes, \u201cIt is the use of the permissive \u2018may\u2019 in subdivision (e) that leads appellant to conclude that a statement of reasons for imposition of both enhancements was required below,\u201d but contends the statutory scheme and legislative intent preclude such an interpretation because subdivision (e) \u201ccannot be read to undercut the mandatory nature of such enhancements under Section 1170.1, subd. (d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">On the contrary, the difference in wording between subdivisions (d) and (e) is critical. If the Legislature had meant the double enhancement to be mandatory except if stricken for mitigating circumstances, it could have provided, in the language of subdivision (d), that the court <em>shall </em>impose both weapons and great bodily injury enhancements, unless stricken pursuant to subdivision (h). That the Legislature chose discretionary rather than mandatory language indicates the court here exercised a sentencing choice in imposing both enhancements. \u201cIt goes without saying that in such cases the setting out of the reasons for exercising discretion is crucial for uniformity of sentences and/or meaningful appellate review to determine whether the trial court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 598, 612 [164 Cal.Rptr. 69].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>In assessing the sufficiency of reasons given, the crucial factor, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686], \u201cis that the record reflect recognition on the part of the trial court that it is making a separate and additional choice.\u201d Here the trial court stated its reasons for imposing the upper term on count two, as well as for sentencing consecutively on count seventeen and for two prior convictions under section 667. As to each of the individual enhancements at issue, the court stated there was no dual use of facts (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 441(b)) and no mitigating circumstance (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (h)), even though \u201cthe court need not explain its rejection of the option to strike under the statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Langevin, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 524.)  This generally meticulous attention to explaining its exercise of discretion, and the lack of prior case law on the issue, indicate the trial court may have been unaware it had a separate and additional sentencing choice under section 1170.1, subdivision (e). \u201cWe cannot assume harmless error by speculating on the probability the court will impose the same sentences on remand.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hetherington </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1132, 1143 [201 Cal.Rptr. 756].) The court\u2019s omission requires a remand for resentencing on the firearm possession and great bodily injury enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">The judgment is affirmed but the cause is remanded for resentencing on count two enhancements under Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">Low, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-12\"> Section 213.5 was repealed by Statutes 1986, chapter 1428, section 5; robbery in an inhabited dwelling house is now covered under sections 212.5, subdivision (a), and 213, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1487.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1095-11\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Mendella) </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 754 [191 Cal.Rptr. 1, 661 P.2d 1081], the Supreme Court disapproved the <em>Grilli </em>holding that enhancements are not subject to review under Penal Code section 995 (information set aside if defendant committed without reasonable or probable cause) but not the underlying distinction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 758.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1095-12\"> The issue appears to be one of first impression. A related issue has arisen in cases deciding whether Penal Code section 654 (precluding multiple punishments for a single offense or course of conduct) is applicable to enhancements. (Cf., e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Boerner </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 506, 511 [174 Cal.Rptr. 629], with <em>People </em>v. <em>Moringlane </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 811, 817-819 [179 Cal.Rptr. 726].) We need not enter the fray on that issue since the great bodily injury here was not inflicted by means of the firearm. Thus, each enhancement was imposed for a separate act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1096-7\"> The current statute, although amended since 1984, is the same in all material aspects as that in effect at the time of Reiley\u2019s offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1096-8\"> The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnson </em>for the proposition that imposing both enhancements was mandatory is misplaced as the statute at issue there, Penal Code section 667.5, is not covered by section 1170.1, subdivision (e), at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1097-9\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1487.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
