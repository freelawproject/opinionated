Regardless of whether the additional testimony represented a change in the People\u2019s strategy, there was no prejudice to defendant, who was in the same position as if the People had presented all their evidence in one session.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The court properly denied defendant\u2019s application made pursuant to <em>Batson v Kentucky </em>(476 US 79 [1986]). Defendant did not produce \u201cevidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination ha[d] occurred\u201d <em>(Johnson v California, </em>545 US 162, 170 [2005]), and thus failed to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination in the People\u2019s exercise of their peremptory challenges. The record lacks sufficient information about the racial composition of the available panel to support a finding that the People excluded a disproportionate number of black panelists, or that there was a disparity between the rate at which the People challenged black panelists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>and the percentage of blacks in the panel (see <em>People v Pratt, 291 </em>AD2d 210 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>98 NY2d 654 [2002]; <em>see also Jones v West, </em>555 F3d 90, 98-100 [2d Cir 2009]). Defendant\u2019s additional argument that characteristics of one or more of the challenged panelists also give rise to an inference of discrimination is unpreserved and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are unpreserved and we decline to review them in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we also reject them on the merits. Concur\u2014 Gonzalez, P.J., Tom, DeGrasse and Abdus-Salaam, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
