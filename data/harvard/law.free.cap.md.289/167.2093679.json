Recognizing the purely legal nature of this query, a brief summary of the facts will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Petitioner Dorothy Lou Stevenson was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Kent County (Clark, J.) of the first degree murder of her husband and of setting a fire while perpetrating a crime. She was subsequently sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment and three years, respectively. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The record shows that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s death occurred on July 18, 1977, as a result of second and third degree burns which he suffered from a fire in his home bedroom nineteen days earlier. At the trial, the central question was how the fire started, and extensive testimony was taken to resolve that issue. From this evidence, the following facts may be distilled: On the morning of the fire, petitioner discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>her husband in bed on his boat with another woman. Following a brief argument, petitioner left the boat and returned to the family home where she awaited her husband. Upon his arrival five hours later, a second argument erupted between the Stevensons concerning the husband\u2019s infidelity. According to a statement given by Mr. Stevenson shortly before his death, this heated discussion had ended with his wife leaving the house; he then went to bed, but was later awakened when the petitioner poured gasoline on him and ignited it with a match. Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s version of the events of that morning differed dramatically: According to her statement given to police on the day of the fire, which was introduced at trial without objection (she did not testify), the wife and husband were arguing in their bedroom when Mr. Stevenson advanced towards her in a threatening manner and Mrs. Stevenson, in self-defense, threw a pitcher of gasoline at her husband to impede his approach. Asked how the pitcher happened to be nearby, the petitioner responded by saying that \"I brought it in the house yesterday, because I was going to clean up the yard for a swimming pool and I didn\u2019t take it out again.\u201d Moreover, the wife disavowed any complicity in starting the fire \u2014 \"I didn\u2019t light no matches or nothing. [The gasoline] just exploded when I threw it.\u201d The jury, however, was not convinced and convicted Mrs. Stevenson both of the first degree murder of her husband and of setting the fire while perpetrating a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The gravamen of petitioner\u2019s claim of error is that she was denied due process when the trial judge refused to give her following requested pre and post-evidence instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Pre-evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">The law as given by this court in its instructions to you constitutes the only law for your guidance, and it is your duty to accept and follow it. It is your duty to follow the law as I give it even though you may disagree with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>Post-evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">It is your duty as jurors to follow the law as stated in the instructions of the court, and to apply the rules of law so given to the facts as you find them from the evidence in the case. Counsel may refer to some of the governing rules of law in their arguments. If, however, any difference appears to you between the law as stated by counsel and that stated by the court in these instructions, you of course are to be governed by the instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Instead of these requested directives, which the court ruled were contrary to the law of this State, Judge Clark proceeded to give the jury, both in oral and written form, an extensive set of \"preliminary instructions\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which included a brief explanation of the jury\u2019s unique constitutional role in the trial of criminal cases in this State. The jury was informed that \"[u]nder the Constitution of Maryland, [you are] the judge of the law as well as of the facts. Therefore, anything which I may say about the law, including any instructions which I may give you, is merely advisory and you are not in any way bound by it.\u201d At the close of the evidence, however, when the court actually \"instructed\u201d the jury as to the applicable substantive law, Md. Rule 757 d, the judge did not again mention that his statements concerning the law were for its guidance and not binding; rather he couched all of his remarks in mandatory language. No question has been raised concerning the propriety of the individual instructions given here, other than the failure to inform the jury that all instructions on the law were binding on it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Consequently, we only address, as requested by the petitioner, whether Article 23 which, as interpreted by this Court, requires that jury instructions on the law be advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>only, is itself violative of the United States Constitution. This Maryland constitutionally declared right provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">In the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Article 23, although not in this identical form, was first incorporated into the constitution of this State by the adoption of Article X, section 5 of the Maryland Constitution of 1851.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The debates of the 1851 Constitutional Convention, while shedding little light on the meaning of that article, do reveal that the motivation for its adoption was a concern by the delegates regarding the lack of uniformity in Maryland in the practice of instructing juries. <em>See </em>II <em>Debates and Proceedings of the Maryland Reform Convention to Revise the State Constitution </em>768 (May 7, 1851). As Judge Niles explains in his work on Maryland constitutional law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">In the convention of 1851, there were opposing views as to the power of a jury in a criminal case, which prevailed in different parts of the state, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to guard in the future against such conflicts, the provision . .. was inserted in the Constitution. [A. Niles, <em>Maryland Constitutional Law </em>340 (1915).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Accord, Jacobsohn, <em>The Right to Disagree: Judges, Juries, and The Administration of Criminal Justice in Maryland, </em>1976 Wash. U.L.Q. 571, 574. <em>See generally Beard </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Md. 275, 279, 17 A. 1044, 1045 (1889); Prescott, <em>Juries as Judges of the Law: Should the Practice be Continued?, </em>60 Md. St. Bar Ass\u2019n 246, 247 (1955). Article 23, however, reflects deeper currents of concern relative to administering criminal justice in this State, as Judge Delaplaine noted in his opinion for this Court in <em>Slansky v. State, </em>192 Md. 94, 63 A.2d 599 (1949):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">In England the question whether the jury should have the right to decide the law in criminal cases was for centuries the subject of controversy. But at the time of American independence the prevailing rule of the common law in England was that the court should judge the law, and the jury should apply the law to the facts. This doctrine was condemned by some of the Colonial statesmen, notably John Adams, who believed that the juries should be entitled to disregard the arbitrary and unjust rulings of the judges holding office by authority of the Crown. ... In some of the New England Colonies it was fully understood that the judges held office not for the purpose of deciding causes, for the jury decided all questions of both law and fact, but merely to preserve order and see that the parties were treated fairly before the jury. This procedure received patriotic justification as increasingly oppressive measures were taken by royal officials....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">The restrictions upon the province of the judges in this State were thus due less to the English practice than to the habits to which they themselves had become accustomed in administering the law of the Colonies. ... \"The colonists had had experience of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the close connection of criminal law with politics. ... [T]heir constant fear of political oppression through the criminal law led them and the generation following ... to give excessive power to juries and to limit or even cut off the power of the trial judge to control the trial and hold the jury to its province.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 101-02, 63 A.2d at 601-02 (quoting R. Pound, <em>The Spirit of the Common Law </em>122-23).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\"><em>Accord, Jacobsohn, supra, </em>1976 Wash. U.L.Q. at 573-75. Because Article 23 was designed to curb the power of the judiciary, this Court has long held that if a trial judge should consider it necessary to instruct the jury as to the applicable criminal law, which since 1950 he may be required to do, <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 383-84, 183 A.2d 359, 365 (1962), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>372 U.S. 767 (1963), he should be careful not to intrude on the jury\u2019s prerogative, and thus must couch his instructions on the law in advisory form in order that jurors may \"subject them to the test of their own independent judgment.\u201d <em>Dick v. State, </em>107 Md. 11, 20, 68 A. 286, 290 (1907); <em>accord, e.g., Schanker </em>v. <em>State, </em>208 Md. 15, 21-22, 116 A.2d 363, 367 (1955); <em>Beard v. State, supra, </em>71 Md. at 279, 17 A. at 1045; <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>42 Md. 563, 570 (1875). This practice is now enshrined in Maryland Rule 757. With this brief background, we will now turn to the specific constitutional challenge presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Since its adoption by the people of Maryland in the Constitution of 1851, this Court has twice considered, and rejected, the contention that Article 23 is in conflict with the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution as depriving an accused of his liberty without due process of law. <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 183 A.2d 359 (1962), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>372 U.S. 767 (1963); <em>Slansky v. State, </em>192 Md. 94, 63 A.2d 599 (1949). See also <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>193 Md. 489, 69 A.2d 456 (1950) (reaffirming <em>Slansky </em>without analysis). The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has likewise rejected such a challenge, <em>Wyley </em>v. <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>372 F.2d 742 (4th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 863 (1967), as has the United States District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Wilkins v. State of Maryland, </em>402 F. Supp. 76 (D. Md. 1975). We are nonetheless asked again to review our previous decisions concerning this issue because, in the words of the petitioner, the \"[subsequently] evolving standards of due process and a revised view of federalism have changed the nature of the standards against which state trials and state procedures are [now] measured.\u201d While we agree that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the due process clause has changed dramatically since we last examined this question in <em>Giles, </em>this Court, however, still \"cannot accept the contention... [that this] anachronistic procedure, which has been followed throughout the State for [over] a century and in many sections of the State for possibly two centuries\u201d deprives a criminal defendant of due process of law. <em>Slansky v. State, supra, </em>192 Md. at 106-07, 63 A.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Scope of Article 23</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Before analyzing petitioner\u2019s specific contentions, we must first determine what \"law\u201d it is that a jury is entitled to \"judge\u201d under Article 23, because only after we have established the sweep of the article\u2019s mandate can its federal constitutionality be tested. <em>See, e.g., Stone v. Wainwright, </em>414 U.S. 21, 22-23, 94 S. Ct. 190, 38 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1973) <em>(per curiam) </em>(constitutionality of state law depends on construction of state\u2019s highest court); <em>Mahoney v. Beyers, </em>187 Md. 81, 87, 48 A.2d 600, 604 (1946); <em>State v. Petrushansky, </em>183 Md. 67, 73, 36 A.2d 533, 536 (1944). Despite Article 23\u2019s facial breadth, it is a postulate well recognized in the prior decisions of this Court, and one which the United States Supreme Court correctly observed in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), that Article 23 \"does not mean precisely what it seems to say.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. <em>See, e.g., Giles </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>229 Md. at 382-83, 183 A.2d at 365; <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Md. 273, 283, 131 A.2d 714, 718 (1957). From its inception, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>right of juries in this State to decide the law has not been construed by this Court as all-inclusive, but to encompass a much more limited scope. <em>E.g., Giles v. State, supra, </em>229 Md. at 383, 183 A.2d at 365. The outer boundaries of what is now Article 23 were first set forth in an opinion by Chief Judge LeGrand (speaking for himself, but with the expressed approval in this regard of all the other members of this Court) in the case of <em>Franklin v. State, </em>12 Md. 236 (1858), decided just seven years after the adoption of this article\u2019s predecessor into the organic law of Maryland. Faced with the specific question of whether the constitutionality of statutes was within the province of the jury under this new constitutional practice, the Chief Judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">It was argued, that the true interpretation of these words authorized the jury to judge of the constitutionality of the Act of Assembly. In this opinion I do not concur. The debates which took place in the Convention that framed the Constitution, show what were the reasons that induced the adoption of the section .... It was well known that some members, both of the judiciary and the profession, held, that juries in criminal cases were the judges of law as well as fact, whilst others held a directly contrary opinion. It is not now important to inquire on which side there was a preponderance of authority and reason. When the meaning of the terms are fixed, there is an end to controversy in regard to the relative powers of court and jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">So far as I know, there is no instance in which a court admitted that the words, \"judges of law as well as fact,\u201d authorized the jury to decide on the constitutionality of a law. With those who insisted upon the enlarged power conferred by the words in our Constitution, there was no pretense that it authorized a judgment by a jury of the constitutionality of an Act of Congress or of the State Legislature. <em>All they contended for was, that in a criminal case the jury were not bound to abide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>by the interpretation of the court of the meaning of a law, but were free to construe and apply it according to their own judgments. </em>They never pretended the jury had the right to decide on the constitutionality of an Act defining murder, arson or any other crime, but that <em>they had the right to affix their own meaning on the particular law, </em>and to determine for themselves, whether the facts proven brought the traverser within that meaning. The words in the Constitution have no greater significance since their incorporation into the organic law than they had previously,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>J and I think I have given to them the broadest latitude ever sanctioned or seriously countenanced by any respectable authority. <em>[Id. </em>at 245-46 (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As this lengthy attribution indicates, and our later decisions confirm, the jury was not granted, by Article 23, the power to decide all matters that may be correctly included under the generic label \u2014 \"law.\u201d Rather, its authority is limited to deciding \"the law of the crime,\u201d <em>Wheeler v. The State, </em>42 Md. 563, 570 (1875), or \"the definition of the crime,\u201d as well as \"the legal effect of the evidence before [the jury].\u201d <em>Beard </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Md. 275, 280, 17 A. 1044, 1045 (1889). And this Court has consistently interpreted this constitutional provision as restraining the jury\u2019s law deciding power to this limited, albeit important, area. Thus, we have held that it is not within the province of the jury to decide whether a statute has been repealed, <em>Nolan v. State, </em>157 Md. 332, 340, 146 A. 268, 271 (1929), whether it has operative effect, <em>Slymer v. State, </em>62 Md. 237, 241 (1884), or if it is unconstitutional, <em>Hitchcock v. State, supra, </em>213 Md. at 283-84, 131 A.2d at 718-19; <em>Franklin v. State, supra. </em>Moreover, we have, decided that juries are not permitted to hear or act upon preliminary questions such as the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>151 Md. 87, 98-99, 133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>A. 899, 903 (1926). See also <em>Hitchcock v. State, supra; </em>Dennis, <em>Maryland\u2019s Antique Constitutional Thorn, </em>92 U. Pa. L. Rev. 34, 39 (1943). In addition to these restrictions, it has been long recognized that questions of admissibility of evidence and competency of witnesses are for the court alone to determine and were not transferred to the jury for decision by Article 23. <em>E.g., Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 724, 404 A.2d 1073, 1083 (1979); <em>Giles v. State, supra, </em>229 Md. at 383, 183 A.2d at 365; <em>Vogel v. State, </em>163 Md. 267, 272, 162 A. 705, 708 (1932); <em>Bell, alias Kimball v. State, </em>57 Md. 108, 120 (1881); <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>42 Md. at 570. <em>See Brady v. Maryland, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 89-90. In fact, viewed affirmatively, the past decisions of this Court make it quite evident that the jury\u2019s role in judging the law under Article 23 is confined \"to <em>resolv[ing] con\u00f1icting interpretations of the law [of the crime] </em>and to decidling] whether th[at] law should be applied in dubious factual situations,\u201d <em>and nothing more. Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 581, 357 A.2d 360, 367 (1976) (emphasis in original); <em>see Hamilton v. State, </em>265 Md. 256, 288 A.2d 885, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1006 (1972); <em>Schanker v. State, </em>208 Md. 15, 21, 116 A.2d 363, 367 (1955). Even this area of the jury\u2019s exclusive domain, however, has limitations. For example, in <em>Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 365 A.2d 545 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918 (1977), we pointed out that Article 23 \"does not confer upon [itl ... untrammeled discretion to enact new law or to repeal or ignore clearly existing law as whim, fancy, compassion or malevolence should dictate, even within the limited confines of a single criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 365 A.2d at 553. Moreover, since \"it is the duty of a jury to decide a case according to the established rules of law, ... if it should misapply the law to the prejudice of the accused, and the trial court has the power to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial.\u201d <em>Giles v. State, supra, </em>229 Md. at 384, 183 A.2d at 365; <em>accord, Beard v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Implicit in the decisions of this Court limiting the jury\u2019s judicial role to the \"law of the crime\u201d is a recognition that all other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide. Because of this division of the law-judging function between judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and jury, it is incumbent upon a trial judge to carefully delineate for the jury the following dichotomy: (i) that the jury, under Article 23, is the final arbiter of disputes as to the substantive \"law of the crime,\u201d as well as the \"legal effect of the evidence,\u201d and that any comments by the judge concerning these matters are advisory only; and (ii) that, by virtue of this same constitutional provision, all other aspects of law (e.g., the burden of proof, the requirement of unanimity, the validity of a statute) are beyond the jury\u2019s pale, and that the judge\u2019s comments on these matters are binding upon that body. In other words, the jury should not be informed that all of the court\u2019s instructions are merely advisory; rather only that portion of the charge addressed to the former areas of \"law\u201d may be regarded as non-binding by it, and it is only these aspects of the \"law\u201d which counsel may dispute in their respective arguments to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, the jury should be informed that the judge\u2019s charge with regard to any other legal matter is binding and may not be disregarded by it. An explicit example of this may be seen from an examination of this Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Lewis v. State, supra, </em>where we held that, although both a judge and the jury may be called upon to determine the voluntariness of a confession, instructions to the jury with respect to the type of consideration to be given by that body to such a confession are binding on it since admissiblity of evidence is not \"law\u201d which the jury may decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Furthermore, and aside from the supremacy clause contained in Article VI of the United States Constitution, jurors, no less than the judges of this Court, or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>citizen of the State, owe paramount allegiance to, and are bound by, the Constitution of the United States through the independent dictates of Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, by which \"ail <em>the People </em>of this State are ... bound Lby the federal Constitution]; anything in the Constitution ... of this State to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). It is, of course, a well-established maxim of constitutional interpretation that, as far as possible, each provision of the constitution should be construed to harmonize with all of its other provisions. <em>E.g., Kadan </em>v. <em>Bd. of Sup. of Elections, </em>273 Md. 406, 415, 329 A.2d 702, 707 (1974); <em>Reed v. McKeldin, </em>207 Md. 553, 561, 115 A.2d 281, 285 (1955). Thus, we believe that even if federal constitutional law were otherwise a part of the \"law\u201d which a jury is to decide by virtue of Article 23, Article 2 indicates that it was not so intended to be, because to so construe Article 23 would place these two constitutional provisions in conflict with each other. Consequently, harmonizing Articles 2 and 23 of the Declaration of Rights so that they do not conflict, <em>see Price v.

Consonant with the prevailing view at the time of <em>Slansky </em>and <em>Giles, </em>if the challenged practice existed at the time of the fourteenth amendment\u2019s adoption, then due process of law was provided. <em>See Twining v.

Louisiana, supra. </em>A fundamental element of this right, in the petitioner\u2019s view, is to be tried by a jury which only decides questions of fact and then determines guilt or innocence by applying to these findings binding instructions with regard to the law as explained by the judge. In support of her assertion, petitioner primarily relies on the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Sparf v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 15 S. Ct. 273, 39 L. Ed. 343 (1895), where it was held that, in a federal criminal trial, the jury was to decide only questions of fact, leaving legal issues for the judge\u2019s consideration. While we agree with petitioner that the Court in <em>Sparf </em>did limit the role of juries in federal criminal trials, we do not believe that it did so because it was a constitutionally required aspect of the jury trial right. In <em>Sparf, </em>the defendants challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to tell the jury that it was not bound by the court\u2019s instructions as to the law, <em>id. </em>at 59; thus, the question posed for consideration by the Court was whether the refusal to give the requested charge \"was an interference with [the jury\u2019s] legitimate functions, and, therefore, with the constitutional right of the accused to be tried by a jury.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 99; <em>accord, id. </em>at 169 (Gray, J., dissenting) (the question is, \"what are the rights ... of persons accused of crime, and of juries summoned and empaneled to try them, under the Constitution of the United States\u201d). After an extensive historical review of the relationship of the judge and jury in the trial process, the Supreme Court determined that, since the function of the jury at common law was solely that of a factfinder, the right to a trial by jury contained in the federal constitution did not entail the right to have the jury decide questions of law. Thus, the Court in <em>Sparf </em>did not prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>juries from deciding legal issues because of a conflict with the constitution, but merely held that the jury right of a defendant did not include the additional privilege of permitting juries to determine legal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Even if the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sparf </em>could be read as prohibiting a jury from deciding questions of law because of a conflict with the constitutional right to a jury, that Court has yet to extend the holding of Sparfto state jury trials despite a number of opportunities to do so. <em>See, e.g., Wyley v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>372 F.2d 742 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 863 (1967); <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 183 A.2d 359 (1962), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>372 U.S. 767 (1963) (lack of substantial federal question); <em>Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md.

Ed. 2d 215 (1963) (discusses Maryland constitutional provision making juries judges of law). Moreover, we believe that recent Supreme Court decisions with regard to the jury trial right cast considerable doubt on whether this element of trial by jury established in <em>Sparf </em>would still be a viable component of that right in federal trials, or if it is, whether it now extends as a matter of due process to state trials. <em>See Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972); <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L.

Prior to its decision in <em>Williams v. Florida, supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that juries composed of less than twelve persons were constitutionally permissible, the process of determining the content of the sixth amendment\u2019s jury trial provision was based on \"the easy assumption .. . that if a given feature existed in a jury at common law in 1789, then it was necessarily preserved in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92; <em>accord, Apodaca v. Oregon, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 408-09; <em>id. </em>at 370 n. 6 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>State v. McKay, </em>280 Md. 558, 563, 375 A.2d 228, 231 (1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In <em>Williams, </em>however, the Supreme Court rejected this historical approach to the sixth amendment, and instead began to examine the scope of that amendment\u2019s jury trial clause from the standpoint of its purpose in our scheme of criminal justice; thus, if a particular feature of the common law jury is essential to the function and purpose of a jury trial, then it is required by the sixth amendment. <em>Williams v. Florida, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 99-100; see <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 134; <em>Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 410. Because the purpose of trial by jury, as noted in <em>Duncan, </em>is to prevent governmental oppression by providing \"an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge,\u201d <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 156, the Court has determined that \"the essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common sense judgment of a group of laymen ....\u201d <em>Williams v. Florida, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 100. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that juries of less than the traditional twelve do not conflict with the constitution, <em>id., </em>and that unanimity is not an indispensable element of state jury trials, <em>see Apodaca v. Oregon, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 410-11 (plurality opinion), although unanimity remains a requirement in federal prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>at 369-71 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>accord, Andres v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 740, 748-49, 68 S. Ct. 880, 92 L. Ed. 1055 (1948); <em>Patton v. United States, </em>281 U.S. 276, 288-90, 50 S. Ct. 253, 74 L. Ed. 854 (1930); <em>Maxwell v. Dow, </em>176 U.S. 581, 586, 20 S. Ct. 448, 44 L. Ed. 597 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">What these decisions demonstrate is that all aspects of the common law jury trial no longer may be presumed to be required by the sixth amendment. Of the essential elements of such a trial identified by Supreme Court decisions prior to <em>Williams </em>and <em>Apodaca </em>\u2014 the 12-person jury, the presence and superintendence of a judge having the power to instruct the jury on the law and to advise them upon the facts, and the unanimous verdict, <em>Patton v. United States, supra, </em>281 U.S. at 288; <em>accord, State </em>v. <em>McKay, supra, </em>280 Md. at 563, 375 A.2d at 231 \u2014 two of them (the 12-person jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>unanimous verdict) have been held to be no longer mandatory, particularly in state criminal trials. While this Court recognizes that the Supreme Court has yet to decide whether the remaining element of trial by jury identified in Sparf\u2014 juries as triers of fact only and not as judges of law \u2014 is still a necessary component of the sixth amendment (if it ever was), it seems to us quite unlikely, in light of the standard adopted in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Apodaca, </em>i.e., is the feature essential to the function and purpose of a jury, that the Court would still continue its fact-law distinction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is reason to question whether the <em>Sparf </em>requirement will be imposed on state criminal proceedings as a matter of due process in light of the fact that opinions of the Supreme Court have suggested that the states be permitted to experiment with the actual operation of juries so long as the fundamental purpose of the right \u2014 safeguarding the accused against official oppression \u2014 remains intact. <em>See Burch v. Louisiana, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 136-39; <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 359-60; <em>Apodaca v. Oregon, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 372-75 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>cf., Bloom v.

The Supreme Court has, on more than one occasion, expressly stated that \"ft]he states' are free to allocate functions between judge and jury as they see fit.\u201d <em>Stein v.

Consequently, since Maryland\u2019s constitutional provision, making juries judges of the law, enhances the purpose of a trial by jury by interposing a neutral interpreter of the law between the accused and the accusing government, <em>e.g., Slansky v. State, supra, </em>192 Md. at 101-02, 63 A.2d at 602; <em>Apodaca v. Oregon, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 374 n. 11 (Powell, J., concurring), we hold that this provision of our organic law does not violate the sixth amendment right to trial by jury as it applies to criminal trials in this State under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In addition to the alleged violation of her right to trial by jury, Stevenson also contends that the following constitutional rights are infringed by the Maryland practice under Article 23: (i) the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, including the prohibition against drawing unfavorable inferences from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, <em>Malloy v. Hogan, supra; Griffin v. California, supra; </em>(ii) the presumption of innocence, <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 98 S. Ct. 1930, 56 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1978); <em>but see Kentucky v. Whorton, </em>441 U.S. 786, 99 S. Ct. 2088, 60 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1979); and (iii) the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>In re Winship, supra; Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975). While she does recognize that the trial judge here did properly instruct the jury with respect to these matters, petitioner nonetheless asserts that, as sole judges of law, the jury is not only free to disregard the presumption of innocence and the prohibition on inferring anything from her silence, but it may also lessen the State\u2019s burden of proof from beyond a reasonable doubt to some much reduced level. As we previously stated in this opinion, however, matters such as these are not within the jury\u2019s Article 23 law-judging function, but are the subject of binding instructions by the judge; thus, this contention may be rejected without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">For the reasons explained, we reaffirm our holdings in <em>Giles </em>and <em>Slansky </em>that permitting juries, in criminal cases, to be \"Judges of Law\u201d does not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. In reaching this result, we are, as were our predecessors well over a centruy ago in a similar context, comforted by the realization that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">The ultimate object of this appeal is to annul the organic law of the State, the act of a sovereign Convention .... Our province is not to make or unmake Constitutions, but to interpret them; not by the light of reason and common sense alone, or that higher law which has been invoked, but which has no oracle, but by the text of the Constitution of the United States, as construed by its authorized expounders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">If we err in our conclusions, we congratulate ourselves there is a Supreme Court erected expressly for the final adjudication of such questions, where our judgment may be reviewed and corrected, and the rights of the citizen vindicated. To this we cheerfully defer confidant that none will more cordially concur in the result. <em>[Anderson v.

This Court has recently held that any such preliminary remarks are not post-evidence \"instructions\u201d to the jury within the meaning of Maryland Rule 757. Lansdowne v. State, 287 Md. 232, 243-48, 412 A.2d 88, 94-96 (1980). Moreover, we believe that such extensive preliminary instructions as the record discloses were given here, covering matters that are ordinarily included in the court\u2019s instructions at the conclusion of the evidence, are apt to be confusing to the jury and the giving of them is to be discouraged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">. Because of the extensive comments of the dissenting opinion on this point, it becomes advisable that we set out in particular the petitioner\u2019s objections noted in the trial court which relate to this appeal. The first mention in the circuit court concerning the issue before us followed preliminary remarks to the jury (delivered by the trial judge prior to the opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>statements of counsel and the introduction of any evidence), the pertinent part of which we have just set out in the body of this opinion, wher\u00e9 petitioner\u2019s attorney stated: \"The defense takes exception to the Court\u2019s failure to give instruction requested in #5 [(quoted in the text labelled \"pre-evidence\u201d)] as to the binding nature of the Court\u2019s instructions, rather than advisory instructions.\u201d The only other objection concerning this matter was noted subsequent to the final court instructions to the jury: \"[T]he defense wishes to except to the Court\u2019s failure to give the instruction requested by the defense in paragraph two of the Request for Final Instructions [(quoted in the text labelled \"post-evidence\u201d)], that is, that the instructions of the Court are binding on the jury and not merely advisory.\u201d From this, it is clear to us that the gravamen of petitioner\u2019s objection is that the giving of advisory instructions required by Article 23 with regard to the law applicable to the case is a violation of fourteenth amendment due process of law, and that .therefore the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to give the jury the binding instruction that petitioner requested. The requirements for preservation for appellate review of objections to instructions are clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u25a0 If a party has an objection to any instructions, to any omission therefrom, or to the failure to give an instruction he shall make the objection on the record before the jury retires to consider its verdict and shall state distinctly the matter or omission, or failure to \u2022 instruct to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. [Maryland Rule 757 f.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">If the dissent is correct that the basis of the petitioner\u2019s objection was the specific instruction given, rather than the unconstitutionality of advisory instructions in general, that basis was neither properly presented to nor ruled upon by the trial court and, thus, is not before this Court on appeal. Maryland Rule 885. We are bolstered in our conclusion as to the precise nature of petitioner\u2019s objection by the argument made by her counsel at the motion for a new trial following her conviction by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[T]he third point raised in the Motion for New Trial is perhaps not really addressable by this Court at this time, and that is the Court\u2019s instructions were given as advisory rather than binding. I think it is fair to say that this Court is bound, or might Well feel itself bound, by the requirements of many Maryland cases that the instructions were given as advisory rather than binding. Nevertheless, it is the Defense contention that to give instructions as advisory rather than binding violates fundamental constitutional due process....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">Without elaborating on all of the cases upon which we base our Constitutional argument, <em>in sum it is that advisory instructions are by their nature [a] violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, </em>in that they offer no guidance, in that a jury is free to ignore the law, in that a jury is free to impose guilt based on its interpretation of the law, and therefore there is inadequate notice as to what\u2019s unlawful and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>also inadequate guidance in decision-making. <em>That\u2019s really all I have on that point. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Moreover, nowhere in the petition for certiorari, or in the briefs filed in this case, do we discern a contention by petitioner other than that Article 23 is itself violative of the fourteenth amendment\u2019s prohibition against the denial of due process of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-12\">. A similar provision was retained in the Constitution of 1864 as Article XII, \u00a7 4, and in the Constitution of 1867 as Article XV, \u00a7 5.

It is interesting to note that after examining the Maryland system from a practical, as well as a theoretical, viewpoint, Professor Jacobsohn concludes that, because Article 23 permits juries to \"dull the sharp edge of the law\u201d and do equity in an appropriate case, it \"serves a useful, if not critical, purpose in the administration of criminal justice in Maryland, and therefore should be retained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.

Ed. 2d 184 (1972) (concurring opinion of Powell, J., at 406 U.S. 370 n. 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b225-13\">\n<em>Eldridge, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AqOL\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">The majority has construed Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to make juries in criminal cases the judges of the law only in certain circumstances, finding this permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court then upholds a murder conviction which is based upon an instruction empowering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the jury to reject any or all of the trial judge\u2019s other instructions, whether relating to the well-established elements of a particular crime, who has the burden of proof, the standard of proof, the defendant\u2019s rights, etc. For several reasons, I believe that a conviction grounded upon such instruction cannot be squared with the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>First, </em>Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights, by authorizing a jury to disregard the trial judge\u2019s instructions embodying the law, is inconsistent with the due process requirement that one is entitled to be tried in accordance with the applicable law of the jurisdiction. It is true that, under the majority\u2019s construction of Article 23, the jury\u2019s authorization to disregard the law is confined to situations involving \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime.\u201d Nevertheless, the violation of a due process right does not become justifiable by limiting the circumstances under which the violation will be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\"><em>Second, </em>Article 23, even given the limited scope delineated by the majority, violates the jury trial clause of the Sixth Amendment, deemed applicable to state court proceedings by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968), and <em>Sparf v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 15 S. Ct. 273, 39 L. Ed. 343 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>Third, </em>the instruction given in this case empowered the jury to disregard a panoply of specific rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, such as the right not to testify, the presumption of innocence, the right to the \"reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof, etc. The majority, while apparently not upholding the constitutionality of the instruction, or of Maryland Rule 757 which mandates an instruction like the one given in this case, asserts that the validity of the instruction actually given was neither properly raised at trial, nor ruled upon by the trial court, nor presented to this Court. In my view, the defendant\u2019s counsel consistently objected to the trial court\u2019s giving advisory rather than binding instructions on the law; the trial court and the intermediate appellate court clearly understood and rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>this position, and this was the very issue presented by the petition for a writ of certiorari, briefs and oral argument in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">An essential principle of \"due process of law\u201d is the right to have a case tried and decided in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction. As Justice Black has stated for the Court <em>(Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 403, 86 S. Ct. 518, 521, 15 L. Ed. 2d 447, 450 (1966)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\"Certainly one of the basic purposes of the Due Process Clause has always been to protect a person against having the Government impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Throughout the United States the trial judge, because of his position, learning and experience in the law, is relied upon to insure that the jury is correctly instructed in the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By this means, and the necessary presumption that jurors follow the judge\u2019s instructions, the American legal system insures as best it can that a criminal defendant is tried in accordance with the applicable law of the jurisdiction. Where an appeal is provided by law, as in most cases, the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s instructions with respect to any unresolved \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime\u201d can be tested by an exception and an appeal, ultimately to the highest court of the jurisdiction. If, upon resolution by the highest court, it turns out that the trial judge incorrectly resolved a \"conflicting interpretation of the law of the crime,\u201d the defendant will receive a new trial with proper instructions binding the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>This system of insuring that a criminal defendant is tried in accordance with the law is present in virtually all American jurisdictions except Maryland. In Maryland alone, as to those matters where the lay jury is the \"judge of the law\u201d rather than the trial judge, there is much less assurance that the defendant will be tried in accordance with law. While the trial judge may give the jurors advisory instructions correctly stating the applicable standard concerning \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime,\u201d he emphasizes in the same breath that the jurors may disregard his instructions and that it is their province, not his, to determine the existing law. For example, the trial judge in the present case instructed the jury that \"anything which I may say about the law, including any instructions which I may give you, is merely advisory and you are not in any way bound by it.\u201d He went on: \"You may feel free to reject my advice on the law and to arrive at your own independent conclusions. You are to make the sole determination as to ... what the law is in this case.\u201d Such explicit authorization for the jury to ignore the law as set forth in the court\u2019s instructions cannot be reconciled with the right to be tried \"in accordance with the valid laws of the land.\u201d 382 U.S. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Furthermore, affording the right of appeal does not rectify this deprivation of due process. Although the trial judge\u2019s \"advisory\u201d instructions may be reviewed, there is no way for an appellate court to review the jury\u2019s determination of the applicable law. What the jury finds the existing law to be, pursuant to the authority granted by Article 23 and the trial court\u2019s implementing instruction, seldom if ever will appear on the record. Moreover, reviewing courts have no way of knowing whether two different juries, at the same time, have come to opposite conclusions concerning the existing law applicable to identical fact situations. Conflicting views of different trial judges as to the law can be resolved on appeal; conflicting views of different juries cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Article 23, by granting a criminal jury the license to disregard legally correct instructions on the law, and find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the law to be otherwise than it is, violates a defendant\u2019s right to be tried in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction and, therefore, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I also believe that Article 23 is inconsistent with the jury trial clause of the Sixth Amendment, deemed applicable to state court proceedings by the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Sparf </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>156 U.S. 51, the Supreme Court settled the matter for federal proceedings, holding that the proper role of a jury at common law and under the Constitution was to be the judge only of the facts and not the law. Although the precise basis for the <em>Sparf </em>decision at the time may be a source of some controversy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it signalled the end of dispute, except for this State, over the legitimate role of the jury. Several state courts, relying upon <em>Sparf, </em>have held that under jury trial clauses of state constitutions comparable to the Sixth Amendment, the proper role of the jury is limited to finding the facts. <em>State v. Gannon, 75 </em>Conn. 576, 52 A. 727 (1902); <em>People v. Bruner, </em>343 Ill. 146, 175 N.E. 400 (1931); <em>Roesel v. State, </em>62 N.J.L. 368, 41 A. 408 (1898). Furthermore, regardless of the original basis for <em>Sparf, </em>the decision in that case is viewed today as delineating the role of the jury under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 370-371 n. 6, 92 S. Ct. 1635, 1637-1638, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Consequently, I believe that the Sixth Amendment provision for trial by jury in criminal cases contemplates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>jury which is the judge of the facts, receiving binding instructions on the law from the court. Because <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>391 U.S. 145, held that the Sixth Amendment jury trial clause is applicable to state court proceedings, the provision of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, making criminal juries the judges of the law, is also invalid on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">For the reasons set forth in Parts I and II above, I believe that Article 23, whether given its literal meaning or as construed by the Court today, facially deprives a criminal defendant of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law. However, assuming arguendo that Article 23 as now construed is facially constitutional, the instruction actually given in this case empowered the jury to disregard several specific federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, the instruction was objected to; the defendant\u2019s position was rejected by the trial court; and the question concerning the validity of the instruction was fully presented to this Court. For this reason also the defendant\u2019s conviction should be reversed on federal constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In the course of his preliminary and final instructions in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury on numerous occasions that the State had the burden of proof, both generally as well as regarding various specific matters. Thus, e.g,, the judge told the jury that the State had the burden to prove that the killing was not- legally justifiable, that it was not done in self-defense, that there was an absence of mitigating circumstances which would reduce the crime to manslaughter. These \"burden of proof\u2019 instructions embodied the due process requirements set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975). Similarly, both in general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and with respect to many particular matters, the trial judge told the jury that the standard of proof was \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This is the standard mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause under the holding of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). In addition, the trial judge instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence must be established only \"through evidence introduced at trial,\u201d thereby reflecting the due process principle set forth in <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976), and other cases. The trial judge additionally instructed the jury that the defendant was presumed to be innocent, a due process standard under <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 98 S. Ct. 1930, 56 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1978). The trial judge also admonished the jury that it could not \"attach any significance or draw any inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d and that it \"must not presume any inference of guilt because she chose not to take the stand.\u201d This instruction was in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">At the same time that he gave the above-mentioned instructions expressing federal due process principles, the trial judge further instructed the jury that <em>anything </em>he might say about the law, including <em>any </em>of his other instructions, was merely advisory, that the jury was not \"in <em>any way\u201d </em>bound by his instructions, that the jury was <em>'Tree to reject\u201d </em>his instructions on the law, that it could arrive at its own independent conclusions as to the law, and that the jury was to make the sole determination as to \"what the law is in this case.\u201d While such an instruction may not empower the jury to apply what it believes the law <em>ought to be, </em>clearly such an instruction authorizes the jury to find that the <em>existing law </em>is different than that set forth in the judge\u2019s instructions. And as the trial judge\u2019s instructions on such matters as burden of proof, standard of proof, presumption of innocence, right not to testify, etc., reflect the holdings of the United States Supreme Court, the challenged instruction authorizes the jury to find that the existing law on these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>federal due process requirements is different than that set forth by the Supreme Court. This result would appear to be inconsistent with one hundred and sixty years of American constitutional history, dating at least from <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Under the majority\u2019s construction of Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights, the jury in a criminal case is the judge of the law only with respect to \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime.\u201d That Article 23, as so construed, might not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, is no answer to the due process issue presented by the instruction in the instant case. Because a narrow instruction, that the jury may resolve conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime, might have been unobjectionable on due process grounds, does not mean that the broad instruction given in this case comports with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The majority purports to justify its refusal to review the broad \"advisory\u201d instruction given in this case by asserting that no issue has been raised in this Court concerning the propriety of the instruction given, that at trial the defendant did not object to the specific instruction given, and that \"[i]f ... the basis of the petitioner\u2019s objection was the specific instruction given, . .. that basis was neither properly presented to nor ruled upon by the trial court.\u201d The majority treats the case as if it were a declaratory judgment action challenging Article 23 on its face, rather than a criminal trial involving a complaint over jury instructions. A review of the record demonstrates that there was an objection to the. advisory instruction given, and that the iss\u00fae has continuously been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">After the trial court gave preliminary instructions to the jury, including the instruction that the jurors were the judges of the law, that everything the court said was merely advisory, that the jurors were free to reject the court\u2019s advice and arrive at their own independent conclusions \u00e1s to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>law, etc., the following colloquy occurred between the court and defense counsel (transcript pp. 127-128):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\"Judge Clark: Mr. Falcon, do you have any exceptions to the preliminary instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\"Mr. Falcon IDefense Attorney]: Yes, Your Honor. The Defense takes exception to the Court\u2019s failure to give Instruction requested in #5 as to the binding nature of the Court\u2019s instructions, rather than advisory instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\"Judge Clark: Very well, you are overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Later, at the conclusion of the court\u2019s final jury instructions, the transcript reads as follows (pp. 2350-2351, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\"[The Court:] In conclusion, you are not to allow sympathy, passion or prejudice to in any way influence you in reaching unanimous verdicts based solely upon the evidence that has been adduced in this case and <em>the law as you determine it to be </em>and applied by you to the facts that you have found to be true facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\"Now, Mr. Campen [State\u2019s Attorney], do you have any exceptions to the Court\u2019s Instructions? If there are going to be exceptions I\u2019ll excuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\"State: May we have a moment to consult?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\"Court: Yes. <em>Will you have exceptions?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">\"Mr. Falcon: <em>Yes, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">\"Court: Mr. Falcon, I\u2019ll hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">\"Mr. Falcon: First of all, Your Honor, the defense wishes to except to the Court\u2019s failure to give the instruction requested by the defense in paragraph two of the Request for Final Instructions, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that the instructions of the Court are binding on the jury and not merely advisory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\"Court: You\u2019re overruled there. You well know the law of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\"Mr. Falcon: Well, let me note an exception to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\"Court: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Following the State\u2019s argument to the jury, defense counsel at a bench conference stated that he had certain exceptions to the State\u2019s argument. Before he could say more, the trial court made it clear that it was \"only interested in misstatements of fact\u201d and that counsel could \"argue the law any way ... [they] want to.\u201d (Transcript p. 2421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Finally, at the argument on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, counsel argued \"that to give instructions as advisory rather than binding violates fundamental constitutional due process.\u201d (Transcript, Vol. 6, p. 12.) Defense counsel went on to assert that advisory instructions are violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 13.) The trial court rejected the argument on the ground that the appellate courts of Maryland had upheld the giving of advisory instructions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 12-13.) The defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s reply to the trial court was as follows <em>(id. </em>at 13, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">\"The Maryland <em>pattern instructions </em>have never been passed on by a court as far as counsel is aware of in the last ten years or so. That is, during that period when the Federal Constitution began to play a large part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">The court nevertheless rejected this argument on the ground that the appellate courts \"had every opportunity to declare it unconstitutional if they so desired.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">In light of this record, I have great difficulty understanding the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s attorney was not objecting to the specific \"advisory\u201d instructions given in this case but was raising only the question, as stated by the majority, of \"whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights ... is unconstitutional because the provision, as construed by this Court, facially deprives a defendant of the federally secured right to due process of law.\u201d At no time did defense counsel or the trial judge mention \"facial\u201d constitutionality, Article 23 or this Court\u2019s construction of that Declaration of Rights provision. The dispute related to the <em>instructions, </em>both those actually given and the proffered one which was refused. Twice the trial court asked defense counsel whether there were exceptions to the instructions given, and twice counsel answered \"Yes.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney explained that the proffered binding instruction should have been given, as \"the instructions of the Court are binding on the jury and not merely advisory.\u201d The advisory instructions actually given, and the binding instruction requested, were mutually exclusive. Clearly counsel was objecting to the giving of advisory instructions in lieu of the requested binding instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The argument on the motion for a new trial, upon which the majority opinion (footnote 2) places such great weight, confirms the nature of the defendant\u2019s objection and the trial court\u2019s ruling. Again there was no mention of Article 23 or \"facial\u201d constitutionality. Instead, the defendant referred to the validity of the Maryland pattern <em>instruction </em>not having been ruled upon during the last ten years, and the trial court rejected the argument because the appellate courts had every opportunity to consider it. It is clear that the defendant was complaining about an <em>instruction </em>actually given in criminal cases and not the facial validity of a constitutional provision. Presumably, by \"pattern,\u201d the defendant meant the standard type of advisory instruction given in this case, as that is the type of instruction required by Maryland Rule 757 b. Rule 757 b mandates that <em>in every case </em>involving jury instructions, the court <em>shall </em>instruct the jurors that they are the judges of the law. There are no exceptions in the rule excluding federal constitutional requirements or anything else.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Moreover, by pointing out to the trial court that it has been over the \"past ten years or so\u201d that federal constitutional requirements \"began to play a large part,\u201d one prong of defense counsel\u2019s due process argument became obvious. It was that the standard type of Maryland advisory jury instruction, authorizing the jury to disregard <em>all </em>of the trial judge\u2019s other instructions on the law, was inconsistent with federal constitutional requirements that in recent years have been held applicable to state criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In the Court of Special Appeals, the first argument in the defendant\u2019s brief (p. 19) was that the advisory instruction given by the trial court denied him due process of law. In the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, the complaint was over the instructions actually given in this case. The first question presented was: \"Did the trial court deny Petitioner the right to due process guaranteed by the XIV Amendment when it gave advisory rather than binding instructions.\u201d The principal argument set forth in the petition was that, in recent years, since this Court considered the matter in <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 183 A.2d 359 (1962), and <em>Slansky </em>v. State, 192 Md. 94, 63 A.2d 599 (1949), the Supreme Court has held that several federal constitutional requirements are applicable to state court criminal proceedings, and that the instruction telling the jury that it is not \"in any way bound\u201d by the other instructions on the law, permits the jury to ignore federal constitutional standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This issue presented in the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tion was the reason for the certiorari grant in this case. It was certainly an issue properly before this Court under Rule 813. Now the Court declines to decide the question on the theory that the defendant has never challenged the specific advisory instructions given in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">There is no logical reason for treating the defendant\u2019s objection to the advisory instructions in this case as an attack only upon the facial constitutionality of Article 23. Even if Article 23 does not make the jury the judge of the law with respect to federal constitutional matters, and thus is not facially invalid on this ground, the broad advisory <em>instructions </em>given in this case were facially unconstitutional because they authorized the jury to disregard other instructions embodying federal due process requirements. The defendant clearly objected to the advisory instructions in this case on federal due process grounds; the objection was overruled by the trial court, and the defendant has continuously preserved the same position throughout the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">If the basis for the majority\u2019s narrow view of the issue is the defendant\u2019s request at trial for a totally binding instruction, rather than a partially binding and partially advisory instruction reflecting this Court\u2019s present construction of Article 23, the majority\u2019s reasoning would still be fallacious. There were in this case no \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime\u201d which would fall within the jury\u2019s province under the majority\u2019s construction of Article 23. Therefore, even under the majority\u2019s opinion, the defendant was entitled to the requested instruction that the trial judge\u2019s instructions are binding and not merely advisory. The instructions to be given are to reflect the evidence and issues, and not abstract principles not applicable to the case. <em>See Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>477-478, 365 A.2d 545 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918, 97 S. Ct. 2183, 53 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1977), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Furthermore, if there had been in this case arguable \"conflicting interpretations of the law of the crime,\u201d I would not exp\u00e9ct an attorney to have tailored his objection to this Court\u2019s present construction of Article 23 and requested a partially binding and partially advisory instruction reflecting that construction. This Court\u2019s position on the matter is anything but consistent. After the decisions in the prior cases relied on by the majority for its narrow construction of Article 23, this Court, effective July 1, 1977, promulgated the present version of Maryland Rule 757 b which requires, without qualification, that in every case the jury is to be told that the court\u2019s instructions on the law are only advisory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, when sitting in its rule-making capacity, providing \"precise rubrics\u201d for lawyers and trial judges to follow,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court accords Article 23 its literal meaning. On the other hand, in its adjudicatory capacity, the Court today construes Article 23 quite differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The question of the facial constitutionality of Article 23 as construed in the majority opinion is largely a theoretical matter, having little relationship to the trial of criminal cases in Maryland. In the seven years I have been a judge of this Court, reviewing hundreds of criminal cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I have never come across a jury instruction comporting with this Court\u2019s present view of Article 23. Experienced Maryland criminal trial lawyers have never encountered such an instruction. Instead, the typical instruction given in criminal cases is like the challenged instruction in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>at bar. Although jurors may be told, as they were in the instant case, that they should not arbitrarily interpret the law to make it conform to what they believe it <em>ought to be </em>or that they should not \"arbitrarily make new law,\u201d nevertheless they are invariably told that it is entirely their province to determine the <em>existing law, </em>that <em>all </em>of the court\u2019s instructions are merely advisory, and that the jurors \"are not in any way bound\u201d by any of the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights flatly states, in unambiguous language, that in \"all criminal cases the Jury shall be the Judges of the Law . . . .\u201d The only limitation is that the court is empowered to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 89, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 1198, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), observed that Article 23 \"does not mean precisely what it seems to say.\u201d The observation is an accurate characterization of the theory set forth in some of this Court\u2019s opinions, including the majority opinion in the case at bar. However, it is not an accurate characterization of Maryland practice. The instruction given in this case, the instruction required by this Court\u2019s Rule 757, and the standard instruction given in virtually all Maryland criminal jury trials, is based upon the language of Article 23 as if that provision meant precisely what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The majority opinion fends off a federal constitutional challenge to jury instructions reflecting the literal language of Article 23 and Rule 757 by misreading the record, viewing the issue as if it were an attack upon the facial constitutionality of Article 23 as construed by this Court, and giving a narrow construction to Article 23 which is not supported by the language of Article 23 and which has no relationship to the jury instructions actually given in this case. The majority then upholds Article 23 as so construed and affirms the conviction on this basis. I believe Article 23 to be invalid on its face, even as construed by the majority, for the reasons set forth in Parts I and II of this dissenting opinion. However, assuming for the purposes of argument that Article 23, as now construed, is facially constitutional, the defendant\u2019s conviction should nevertheless be reversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The advisory instructions given, to which objection was made, authorized the jury to disregard the court\u2019s instructions regarding several federal constitutional requirements. Because the challenged instruction actually given by the trial court was inconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the defendant should be awarded a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Judge Cole has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed in Part III of this dissenting opinion, that he would reverse on this ground, and that he would not reach the issues dealt with in Parts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Judge Davidson has authorized me to state that she concurs with the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">. In Maryland today, a defendant in a criminal case is entitled, upon request, to such instructions as correctly state the applicable law. This includes instructions in those areas of law which, under the majority opinion, fall within the jury\u2019s province as the judge of the law. See Maryland Rule 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s lengthy opinion in the <em>Sparf </em>ease, including material quoted with approval from other cases, makes several references to the Constitution, suggesting that the holding was required under federal constitutional provisions then applicable to federal court proceedings. 156 U.S. at 64, 74, 75, 78, 83, 86. At the same time, the Court seemed to indicate that statutes or constitutional provisions (presumably in the several states) could authorize the jury to be the judge of the law. 156 U.S. at 102. <em>Compare </em>G.
