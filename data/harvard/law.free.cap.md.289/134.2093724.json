J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AgO\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">This case presents a narrow question of statutory construction, <em>i.e., </em>whether a person involuntarily committed to a maximum security State hospital for the criminally insane after being found not guilty by reason of insanity of a criminal charge is liable for the cost of his care and treatment under the Mental Hygiene Law, Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1976 Cum. Supp.), Art. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 1-57.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose and policy of the Mental Hygiene Law is stated in \u00a7 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\"It is the policy of the State of Maryland that the mental hygiene of its citizens be fostered and preserved to the best of the ability of the State. To that end, care and treatment to or for all citizens of the State affected by or afflicted with mental illness shall be provided without partiality. It is also the policy of this State that those persons who have financial resources sufficient to pay the cost of their care and treatment shall do so. The provisions of this article shall be construed in a manner consistent with the policy of the State as herein defined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Under \u00a7 27, a person found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity may be committed for evaluation to the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ment of Health and Mental Hygiene (the Department). The court ordering the evaluation, after receiving the Department\u2019s report, is authorized by \u00a7 27 to direct that the person be confined in a facility designated by the Department \"for treatment.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 39 concerns payment for treatment by patients who have been admitted to a State hospital under Art. 59:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">\"(a) It is the intent of this subtitle to require all patients financially able to do so to pay for mental health services received by them. Such obligations extend to not only the patients, but also to those legally responsible for them. Where such patients or their responsible relatives are unable to pay for their care, it is the intent of this subtitle that the cost of mental health services be financed in the manner provided by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">(b) The setting of charges for mental health services rendered in outpatient, inpatient and other facilities, the investigation of the financial ability to pay of patients, responsible relatives, and other persons legally chargeable for any obligation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>patient, the determination of the amounts of payments, the liability of patients and other legally chargeable persons, and the receipt, deposit and enforcement of payments shall be the same as set forth in \u00a7 601 of Article 43 of the Code.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The facts m this case are not disputed. Anthony T. Koyce was charged with murder on January 14, 1974 and was sent to Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital (Perkins), a maximum security State hospital, for evaluation after he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. On January 28, 1975, Koyce was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was involuntarily committed to Perkins until such time as he was not a danger to himself or society. On April 28, 1978, Koyce was released from Perkins under its Conditional Release Program. <em>See </em>Art. 59, \u00a7 28. The State, through its Cental Collection Unit, sued Koyce for $4,155.34 for patient care provided to him from January 29, 1975 through February 25, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The case was submitted to the District Court upon a stipulation of facts, and it concluded that Koyce was not legally responsible for the bill. On appeal, the Baltimore City Court (Levin, J.) found it undisputed that (1) Koyce suffered from mental illness during his stay at Perkins; (2) he was financially able to pay for the cost of his care; (3) mental health services were rendered to Koyce; and (4) Perkins is a mental health facility of the Department. In rejecting Koyce\u2019s argument that the governing statutes did not require that he pay for his treatment at Perkins, the court recognized that he was \"in a sense involuntarily committed and was at Perkins so that society could be protected .. . .\u201d Nevertheless, the court observed that Koyce, having been acquitted of the criminal offense, \"could be released at any time he satisfied the statutory requirements as opposed to an incarcerated prisoner who must complete his prison term.\u201d Judge Levin concluded that Koyce\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>detention \"was for mental illness not criminality,\u201d and that this differed \"from incarceration in prison for crime even when such detention emanates from accusation of crime.\u201d The court said that the Legislature had clearly drawn this distinction in the statutes and because Koyce had received mental health services he must pay for them. We granted certiorari to consider the important issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Before us, Koyce reasserts his position that the payment provisions of Art. 59 were intended to apply only to those persons civilly, as opposed to criminally, committed to a State mental institution. People who are committed as a result of criminal proceedings under \u00a7 27, he argues, are placed in an institution for the protection of society and not for the benefit of the patient. Koyce points to procedural differences for committing and releasing patients who arrive at State institutions under \u00a7 27 as distinguished from those civilly admitted under \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12. Finally, he argues that there is no clear indication that the Legislature intended that patients at Perkins pay for their c\u00e1re.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The State contends that the language of Art. 59 clearly provides for payment by all financially able patients committed to Perkins for treatment. Because the words of the statute are clear and reveal the Legislature\u2019s intent, the State argues that there is no need to look beyond these words. It suggests that if the statutory language is found to be ambiguous, any differences between the purpose or procedure for commitment under \u00a7 27 as opposed to \u00a7\u00a7 11 or 12 are not relevant in deciding whether the Legislature intended that persons committed under \u00a7 27 should pay for their care if able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Prior to major revisions and reorganization in 1970, Art. 59 was entitled \"Lunatics and Insane.\u201d In 1919, this Court considered whether the estate of a person involuntarily committed to a State mental institution after being found not guilty of murder because of insanity was liable for the cost of his care under the then existing provisions of Art. 59. <em>Wagner v. M. &amp; C. C. of Balto., </em>134 Md. 305, 106 A. 753 (1919). Section 1 of Art. 59 provided at that time for civil commitment to State mental hospitals, while \u00a7 5 contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>provisions for committing persons found not guilty of a crime because of insanity. Section 45 prescribed payment to the State of $100 per year by the political subdivision from which the \"patient\u201d had been referred and provided that such payments for the cost of care and treatment would be a charge against the patient\u2019s estate. Wagner had been a patient in a State institution for many years when Baltimore City, pursuant to \u00a7 45, sued his estate to recover a portion of the money the city had paid to the State for the cost of his care. Wagner contended that he was not liable for the cost of his care because \u00a7 45 was intended to apply only to those people who were civilly committed under \u00a7 1. The Court disagreed and held that Wagner\u2019s estate was liable for a statutorily defined portion of the cost of his care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">\"LI]n applying [\u00a7 45] of the statute, we discover no sound reason for distinguishing between those who upon application are adjudged insane and those who are found to be insane under sections 4 and 5 of [Art. 59]; nor do we find anything in the statute indicating that it was the intention of the Legislature to create such distinction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Following the <em>Wagner </em>decision, the Legislature amended Art. 59 by enacting ch. 735 of the Acts of 1920. The amended version contained separate sections that governed payment for care by those patients who had been civilly committed and those who had been criminally committed. Both types of patients, if financially able to do so, were required to pay for the treatment they received in a State mental hospital. In 1970, the Legislature substantially revised Art. 59 and renamed it the \"Mental Hygiene Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Part of the basic policy of Art. 59 is to \"require all patients financially able to do so to pay for mental health services received by them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 39 (a). Exceptions to this general rule are specifically noted in Art. 59. First, if a patient is financially unable to pay, then the cost of care and treatment is borne by the State. Second, under \u00a7 46, court-ordered examinations of potential patients by the Department are to be paid for by the State unless the examination is requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>by the person to be examined.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The procedures for setting rates and collecting fees are set forth in \u00a7 60\u00cd of Art. 43. Section 601 (a) provides that the Secretary of the Department \"shall by rule and regulation set charges for services rendered by the Department in . .. regional and State hospitals ... for the physically and mentally ill... .\u201d Section 601 (b) (1) states that the Department \"shall investigate the financial condition of <em>all patients, </em>their responsible relatives, and other persons legally chargeable for any obligation of the patient in order to determine the ability of the patient or his responsible relatives\" to pay for the cost of care of the patient.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Payments are to be made by the patient or other responsible person to the Department. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 601 (c). The Central Collection Unit is responsible for collecting, all delinquent accounts. <em>Id. </em>at 601 (b) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In determining whether the Legislature intended to exempt persons committed to a State mental institution under \u00a7 27 from the payment provisions of Articles 59 and 43, we strive to ascertain and effectuate the real intention of the Legislature. <em>E.g., Cider Barrel Mobile Home </em>v. <em>Eader, </em>287 Md. 571, 414 A.2d 1246 (1980); <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 407 A.2d 738 (1979); <em>Unnamed Physician v. Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 1, 400 A.2d 396, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 868, 100 S. Ct. 142, 62 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1979). In so proceeding, we first look to the language of the statute itself. <em>E.g., Board v. Stephens, </em>286 Md. 384, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979); <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979); <em>Collier v. Connolley, </em>285 Md. 123, 400 A.2d 1107 (1979). When the language is plain and unambiguous, there is no need to look beyond the language itself, which should be given effect in accordance with the plain meaning of the words. <em>E.g., John McShain, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>287 Md. 297, 411 A.2d 1048 (1980); <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 400 A.2d 1091 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In light of these principles of statutory construction, we conclude that the Legislature intended persons committed to a State mental hospital under Art. 59, \u00a7 27 to pay for the cost of their care and treatment if financially able to do so. As we have already indicated, \u00a7 2 sets forth the State\u2019s policy regarding the provision of mental health care to its citizens and states without equivocation that \"those persons who have financial resources sufficient to pay the cost of their care and treatment shall do so.\u201d Section 2 also states that the provisions of Art. 59 are to be construed in a manner consistent with this policy. Section 39 provides that \"all patients\u201d who are financially able to do so shall pay for the \"mental health services received by them.\u201d Article 43, \u00a7 601 (c) (1) states that \"[p]ayments shall be made 1 to the Department] by the patient, a responsible relative or other person who may be legally chargeable with his or her care.\u201d The two specific exceptions to liability under Art. 59, court-ordered evaluations and inability to pay, are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">It is undisputed that (1) Koyce was admitted to Perkins, a State hospital under the jurisdiction of the Department, <em>see </em>Art. 59, \u00a7 31 (a), and that he received mental health services while he was there; (2) that he suffered from mental illness during his stay at Perkins; (3) that the amount charged for the mental health services was properly calculated and all necessary administrative procedures were followed; and (4) that Koyce is financially able to pay for the services rendered. Thus, if Koyce was a \"patient\u201d within the meaning of Articles 43 and 59, he must pay for the care and treatment he received at Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The word \"patient\u201d is not defined in either Art. 59 or the relevant subtitle of Art. 43. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1014 (5th ed. 1979) defines \"patient\u201d as a \"[p]erson under medical or psychiatric treatment and care.\u201d <em>See also Smith v. Gill, </em>293 Ala. 736, 310 So. 2d 214 (1975); <em>State ex rel. Mental, Etc. v. Guardianship, </em>393 N.E.2d 235 (Ind. App. 1979). As used in Art. 59 and Art. 43, \u00a7 601, the plain meaning of the word \"patient\u201d would appear to include, but not necessarily be limited to, any person suffering from a mental illness who is admitted to a State mental health facility under the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tion of the Department. Koyce, who was admitted to Perkins and received treatment for his mental illness for over three years, clearly qualified as a \u201cpatient\u201d within the commonly understood meaning of that word. Therefore, consistent with the holding of our predecessors in <em>Wagner, supra, </em>we hold that Koyce is liable for the cost of his care and treatment at Perkins, as charged to him by the State. This conclusion is in accord with the majority of jurisdictions that have interpreted statutory provisions substantially similar to those before us today. <em>See generally State v. Estate of Burnell, </em>165 Colo. 205, 439 P.2d 38 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kosiorek, </em>5 Conn. Cir. 542, 259 A.2d 151 (1969); <em>In re Estate of Schneider, </em>50 Ill. 2d 152, 277 N.E.2d 870 (1971); <em>Department of Mental Health v.
