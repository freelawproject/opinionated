On 6 September 1976, the owner applied to the Board of Appeals of Howard County (Board) under \u00a7 19.05 of the 1961 Howard County Zoning Regulations (1961 Zoning Regulations)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a special exception use permit for a commercial aircraft landing field capable of accommodating 60 private aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">As required by \u00a7 2.211 of the Howard County Code, the application included, among other things, a description of the intended use of the subject property and a site development plan showing the proposed development of that property. Before a hearing was held on the application, the Office of Planning and Zoning and the Planning Board recommended approval of the requested special exception use permit subject to certain specific conditions to be imposed by the Board. At the hearing the owner and several other witnesses testified in support of the application. Charles H. O\u2019Donnell, Jr. and others (protestants) testified in opposition to the grant of the requested special exception use permit. In essence, they stated that the then existing use of the aircraft landing field by 15 aircraft created sufficient noise and disturbance to constitute a nuisance that interfered substantially with the use and enjoyment of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On 31 December 1976, the Board filed a decision and order that stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\"1. That a limited commercial aircraft landing field and airport is a use that is essential and desirable to the public convenience and general welfare of the people in Howard County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">5. That the petitioner\u2019s request, <em>if granted with reasonable conditions, </em>will not interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of people in their homes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Board then granted the requested special exception use permit subject to 13 specified conditions. Eight of the conditions imposed were identical to those contained in the owner\u2019s application and site development plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The remaining five conditions imposed were additional to those contained in the owner\u2019s application and site development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>plan (additional conditions).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These additional conditions required, among other things, that the number of airplanes utilizing the proposed facility be reduced from 60 to 15, that the number of flights be limited to 15 flights per day, and that the proposed facility\u2019s use be limited to aircraft stored at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Thereafter, the owner made the changes necessary to conform the existing aircraft landing field to the site development plan. These changes included, among other things, \"twisting the runway slightly to meet [al 500 foot setback requirement . .. shavfing] a few humps <em>olf </em>the cornfield and planning] grass for the new parking area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>On 9 February 1977, the protestants appealed to the Circuit Court for Howard County. The owners cross appealed on the ground that the Board had no authority to impose the additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On 3 October 1977, the 1961 Zoning Regulations were amended (1977 Zoning Regulations). As a result, commercial aircraft landing fields and airports were abolished as a special exception use. On 10 April 1978, at oral argument, the Circuit Court was advised of the existence of the 1977 Zoning Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In an opinion and order filed on 22 March 1979, the Circuit Court expressly noted that the 1961 Zoning Regulations \"are the ones applicable in this case.\u201d It held, among other things, that the Board did not have the authority to impose the additional conditions. The Circuit Court rejected the Board\u2019s contention that, under the circumstances, the case should be remanded in order to permit the Board to decide whether the special exception use permit should be granted without the additional conditions. Instead, the Circuit Court determined that the grant of the requested special exception use permit \"even without the conditions, would be supported by the evidence before the Board.\u201d Accordingly, the Circuit Court modified the Board\u2019s order by eliminating the additional conditions and affirmed the Board\u2019s order as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The protestants appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. There they contended that the Court of Special Appeals should apply the 1977 Zoning Regulations in effect at the time of the appeal rather than the 1961 Zoning Regulations in effect at the time the special exception use permit was granted. In addition, they contended that the Circuit Court had erred in modifying and affirming the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception use permit rather than remanding the case to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The Court of Special Appeals applied the 1977 Zoning Regulations without determining whether the owners had obtained a vested right in the granted special exception use permit. That Court pointed out that \u00a7 120A of the 1977 Zoning Regulations provided that lawfully existing uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>could be continued <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded that because the special exception use permit \"was validly granted under the 1961 Regulations,\u201d it could \"continue despite the 1977 amendment\u201d that abolished commercial aircraft landing fields as a special exception use. In addition, relying upon \u00a7 121D of the 1977 Zoning Regulations,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals determined that the Circuit Court did not err in modifying and affirming the Board\u2019s order rather than remanding the case to the Board. In an unreported opinion, that Court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Bassler, </em>No. 476, September Term, 1979, filed 8 January 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The protestants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari that we granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The central question presented is whether the law in effect at the time that a special exception use permit was granted or the law in effect at the time of the appeal is applicable. More particularly, the question presented is whether the law to be applied is the 1961 Zoning Regulations that permitted a commercial aircraft landing field at the time the special exception use permit was granted or the 1977 Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Regulations, in effect at the time of the appeal, that had abolished such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">An appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time a case is decided, provided that its application does not affect intervening vested rights. <em>County Council for Prince George\u2019s County v. Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc., </em>281 Md. 70, 76, 376 A.2d 860, 863-64 (1977); <em>Rockville Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>266 Md. 117, 127, 291 A.2d 672, 677 (1972). Generally, in order to obtain a vested right in an existing zoning use that will be protected against a subsequent change in a zoning ordinance prohibiting that use, the owner must initially obtain a valid permit. Additionally, in reliance upon the valid permit, the owner must make a substantial beginning in construction and in committing the land to the permitted use before the change in the zoning ordinance has occurred. <em>Steuart Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>276 Md. 435, 442-44, 347 A.2d 854, 859-60 (1975), <em>County Council for Montgomery County </em>v. <em>District Land Corp., </em>274 Md. 691, 707, 337 A.2d 712, 721 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The issuance of a permit that is invalidated upon direct judicial review, however, creates no vested right in an owner. <em>See City of Hagerstown </em>v. <em>Long Meadow Shopping Center, </em>264 Md. 481, 494-96, 287 A.2d 242, 248-50 (1972); <em>Ross v. Montgomery County, </em>252 Md. 497, 504-07, 250 A.2d 635, 639-41 (1969); <em>Town of Berwyn Heights v. Rogers, </em>228 Md. 271, 280, 179 A.2d 712, 716 (1962). Thus, an owner who obtains an invalid permit \"would derive no benefit, and whatever he might do in pursuance of this permission would be at his own risk and loss.. . .\u201d <em>Lipsitz v. Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, 227-28, 164 A. 743, 745-46 (1933). More particularly, an owner who obtains a permit and begins construction before the expiration of an appeal period proceeds at his own risk. <em>City of Hagerstown, </em>264 Md. at 496, 287 A.2d at 250; <em>Lipsitz, </em>164 Md. at 225-28, 164 A. at 745-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In order to determine whether the 1961 Zoning Regulations or the 1977 Zoning Regulations apply, we must initially decide whether the special exception use permit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the commercial aircraft landing field was valid. The record shows that the Board granted the owner a special exception use permit for a commercial aircraft landing field subject to eight conditions identical to those contained in its application and site development plan and five that were additional to those that it submitted. The Circuit Court held, and the parties concede, that the Board had no authority to impose the additional conditions. In view of the parties\u2019 concession, we shall assume, without deciding, that the special exception use permit granted by the Board was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Circuit Court, however, directed the elimination of the invalid additional conditions and affirmed the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception use permit as modified. Under these circumstances, we must next decide whether the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception, as modified by the Circuit Court, constituted a valid special exception use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It is a fundamental principle of administrative law that a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken. <em>Courtney v. Board of Trustees of the Md. State Retirement Systems, </em>285 Md. 356, 362, 402 A.2d 885, 889 (1979); <em>Mayor of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 394-96, 396 A.2d 1080, 1089 (1979); <em>Jobar Corp. </em>v. <em>Rodgers Forge Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>236 Md. 106, 120, 202 A.2d 612, 620 (1964); <em>Bernstein v.

This principle underlies the rule that if an administrative function remains to be performed after a reviewing court has determined that an administrative agency has made an error of law, the court ordinarily may not modify the agency order. Under such circumstances, the court should remand the matter to the administrative agency without modification, <em>South Prairie Constr. Co. v. Local No. 627, IUOE, </em>425 U.S. 800, 805-06, 96 S.

Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1081, 89 S. Ct. 860 (1969). Finally, if an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>administrative function remains to be performed, a reviewing court may not modify the administrative agency\u2019s action even when a statute provides that the court may \"affirm, modify or set aside\u201d because a court may not usurp administrative functions. <em>Food Employees Local 347, </em>417, U.S. at 3, 94 S. Ct. at 2077; <em>Idaho Power Co., </em>344 U.S. at 21, 73 S. Ct. at 87; <em>Pottsville Broadcasting Co., </em>309 U.S. at 144, 60 S. Ct. at 442; <em>Federal Radio Comm\u2019n v. General Electric Co., </em>281 U.S. 464, 467, 50 S. Ct. 389, 390 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Idaho Power Co., </em>344 U.S. 17, 73 S. Ct. 85 (1952), a case involving facts strikingly similar to those in the instant case, the United States Supreme Court clearly articulated the principles stated above. There, a privately owned public utility applied to the Federal Power Commission (FPC) for a license to construct and operate a hydroelectric project. After the FPC granted the requested license subject to certain conditions, the private utility appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the FPC had no authority to attach the conditions. It entered a judgment that the FPC\u2019s order \"be modified\u201d by striking the conditions and that the order, as thus modified, be affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\"It is the Commission\u2019s judgment on which Congress has placed its reliance for control of licenses. See \u00a7\u00a7 6, 10(a), 10(g). When the court decided that the license should issue without the conditions, it usurped an administrative function. There doubtless may be situations where the provision excised from the administrative order is separable from the remaining parts or so minor as to make remand inappropriate. <em>But the guiding principle, violated here, is that the function of the reviewing court ends when an error of law is laid bare. At that point the matter once more goes to the Commission for reconsideration. </em>See <em>Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., </em>309 U.S. 134; <em>Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., </em>334 U.S. 37.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The Court, it is true, has power 'to affirm, modify, or set aside\u2019 the order of the Commission 'in whole or in part.\u2019 \u00a7 313(b). But that authority is not power to exercise an essentially administrative function. See <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, </em>305 U.S. 364, 373-74; <em>Siegel Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>327 U.S. 608. The nature of the determination is emphasized by \u00a7 10(a) which specifies that the project adopted 'shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan ... for the improvement and utilization of water-power development, and for other beneficial public uses.\u2019 Whether that objective may be achieved if the contested conditions are stricken from the order is an administrative, not a judicial decision.\u201d <em>[Idaho Power Co., </em>344 U.S. at 20-21, 73 S. Ct. at 87 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Applying these principles to the instant case produces a clear result. Here the County Council of Howard County entrusted the determination of whether special exception use permits should be granted to the expertise and judgment of the Board. Under the 1961 Zoning Regulations, the Board was authorized to grant special exception use permits for commercial aircraft landing fields. In exercising this function, the Board was required to \"find that such use is essential or desirable to the public convenience and welfare,\u201d \u00a7 19.05 of the 1961 Zoning Regulations, and that it would not \"menace the .. . general welfare.\u201d \u00a7 31 of the 1961 Zoning Regulations. Thus, the grant of the special exception use permit was an administrative, not a judicial, function. Only the Board had authority to issue such permits; the Circuit Court did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The Circuit Court decided that the Board had exceeded its authority by imposing the additional conditions, and had, therefore, committed an error of law. However, the Circuit Court rejected the Board\u2019s contention that the case should be remanded in order to permit the Board to decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>special exception use permit should be granted without the additional conditions. Instead, the Circuit Court modified the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception use permit by eliminating the additional conditions that required, among other things, that the number of aircraft authorized to utilize the proposed facility be reduced from 60 to 15, that the number of flights be limited to 15 per day, and that the proposed facility\u2019s use be limited to aircraft stored at the facility. Although these conditions were integral and substantial factors in the Board\u2019s decision to grant the special exception use permit, the Circuit Court affirmed the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception use permit as modified rather than remanding the case to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">When the Circuit Court took this action, it, in essence, determined that based on the evidence of record, the special exception use permit should be granted for a facility to be utilized by 60 aircraft with unlimited flights per day and without the restriction that the proposed facility\u2019s use be limited to aircraft stored there. The record contained some evidence to support the grant of the special exception use permit as modified by the Circuit Court. However, the record also contained evidence to show that the then existing use of the airfield by 15 aircraft created sufficient noise and disturbance to constitute a nuisance that interfered substantially with the use and enjoyment of the protestants\u2019 property. Thus, the question whether the special exception use permit as modified by the Circuit Court should be granted was fairly debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It was the Board\u2019s function to use its expertise and judgment to determine whether the special exception use permit should have been granted for a facility to be utilized by 60 aircraft with unlimited flights per day and without the restriction that the proposed facility\u2019s use be limited to aircraft stored there. Making the requisite findings that such a proposed use was essential or desirable to the public convenience and welfare, and not a menace to the general welfare, was an administrative function. As a result, when the Circuit Court modified the Board\u2019s order, it deprived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Board of its right to exercise its expertise and judgment in determining whether the special exception use permit should have been granted without the additional conditions. In short, the Circuit Court substituted its judgment for that of the Board and usurped an administrative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court erred, notwithstanding the express provision of \u00a7 121D.6 of the 1977 Zoning Regulations that permits the Circuit Court to \"modify\u201d the Board\u2019s order. The Circuit Court\u2019s power was limited to determining whether the Board had exceeded its authority by imposing the additional conditions and to determining whether the Board had, therefore, committed an error of law. Once the Circuit Court determined that the Board had committed an error of law, the Circuit Court should have remanded the matter to the Board without modification because an administrative function remained. Because the Circuit Court violated fundamental principles of administrative law, the Board\u2019s order granting the special exception, as modified by the Circuit Court, did not constitute a valid special exception use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The special exception use permit obtained by the owner was not valid as originally granted by the Board or as modified by the Circuit Court. The owner derived no benefit at all from its invalid permit and proceeded at its own risk when it made the changes necessary to conform the aircraft landing field to the site development plan before the expiration of the appeal period. Therefore, the owner did not obtain a vested right in the special exception use permit granted under the 1961 Zoning Regulations. Under these circumstances, the 1977 Zoning Regulations are applicable. Because the special exception use permit was not validly granted, the existing commercial aircraft landing field was not a lawfully existing use that could be continued under the 1977 Zoning Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that because the special exception use permit \"was validly granted under the 1961 Regulations,\u201d it could continue as a lawfully existing use under the 1977 Zoning Regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>That Court further erred in determining that the Circuit Court had authority to modify and affirm the Board\u2019s order rather than remanding the case to the Board. However, because under the 1977 Zoning Regulations the Board no longer has the authority to grant special exception use permits for commercial aircraft landing fields, a remand to the Board at this time would be futile. Accordingly, we shall reverse without directions to remand the case to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>Case remanded to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County and to remand the case to that court with directions to reverse the decision of the Board of Appeals of Howard County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Respondents to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. \u00a7 19.05, then applicable, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\"The Board may approve in any District commercial aircraft landing fields and airports, provided the Board shall find that such use is essential or desirable to the public convenience and welfare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Additionally, \u00a7 31, then applicable, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\"However, the application for permit shall not be approved where the Board finds the proposed ... use ... would menace the public health, safety, security, morals or general welfare, or would result in dangerous traffic conditions, or would jeopardize the lives or property of people living in the neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">.
