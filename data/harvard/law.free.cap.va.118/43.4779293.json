Co. </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>113 Va. 622, 72 S. E. 110, this court, speaking through Buchanan, J., said: \u201cAs a general rule, the damages for negligently injuring standing timber ought to be ascertained as of the date of the fire.\u201d Citing, <em>Woodenware </em>v. <em>United States, </em>106 U. S. 432, 1 Sup. Ct. 398, 27 L. Ed. 230; Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 933; Notes to <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>C. M. &amp; St. Paul Ry. Co., </em>19 L. R. A. 653; Notes to <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Sims Lumber Co., </em>18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 244. In 112 Va. at p. 627, 72 S. E. at p. 112, Judge Buchanan observes: \u201cIn that case (referring to one of the cases in judgment) the plaintiffs were <em>sui juris, </em>and the evidence shows that the timber had a market value at the time of the fire. The measure of damages in that case was the difference between the market value of the injured timber immediately before the fire and its market value immediately after the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Most of the witnesses for the plaintiff were qualified to speak with respect to the condition and market value of the timber immediately before and immediately after the fire, while some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of his witnesses and all the defendant\u2019s witnesses examined the timber for the first time several months after the fire, and based their estimate of damages upon that examination. From that premise (it not appearing affirmatively that, in the interval, there had been any change in the market in that locality), it was objected that the effect of the instruction was to destroy the force of defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Obviously, the objection is without merit. All the evidence on both sides was admitted, and the jury, doubtless, gave to the testimony of each witness the weight to which they deemed it entitled. If the evidence for the defendant was not so cogent and convincing as that for the plaintiff, by reason, perchance, of the superior opportunity of his witnesses to reach a just conclusion with respect to the matter under investigation, surely that circumstance should in no way have influenced the trial court in giving an instruction to which the plaintiff clearly was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The instruction, in no proper sense, can be said to have had the effect of withdrawing the defendant\u2019s evidence on the <em>quantum </em>of damages from the consideration of the jury, and, if in the opinion of the defendant the situation demanded elucidation, it should have requested the court to make it plain to the jury. The evidence as to the amount of damages was conflicting, nevertheless that on behalf of the plaintiff was ample to sustain the jury\u2019s award of $475.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The judgment is without error and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
