S. Hansel in two counts. The first count charges that Hansel did feloniously forge a certain contract in writing which is set out in full in the indictment. The contract was one made by the Smith heirs with S. H. Robinett giving him authority to sell certain land at a stated price and on given terms. In the same count it is charged that S. H. Robinett \u201cbefore the said felony and forgery was committed\u201d did feloniously counsel, hire, procure, aid and abet the said R. S. Hansel to do and commit the said felony and forgery. The second count charges that Hansel having in his possession a certain forged contract in writing (setting it out in full) did then and there feloniously utter and attempt to employ the same as true with intent to injure and defraud, he then and there well knowing said contract in writing to be forged. The contract with its endorsement is set out in full in each count. It was not claimed that the signatures to the contract were forged, but that the contract was altered in several material particulars. It appears from the evidence that after Robinett had obtained the right to sell the land, he claimed to have found a purchaser ready, able and willing to buy the land on the terms given by the owners. They refused, however, to convey, and Robinett instituted an action of <em>assumpsit </em>against them to recover his commissions. The declaration in this action of <em>assumpsit </em>was filed March 23, 1914. Prior to that time, however, to-wit, on Pebruary 9, 1914, Robinett had transferred to Hansel and Griffith two-thirds of the amount that he claimed was due and payable to him from the said Smith heirs. The action, however, was brought in Robinett\u2019s name without noticing the assignment. On the trial of this action the defendant, Hansel, was examined as a witness-on behalf of the plaintiff, Robinett. On the trial of Hansel on the indictment charging him with forging and also with uttering as true the forged contract which the Smith heirs had executed to Robinett, there was offered in evidence, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>other things, the assignment made by Robinett to Hansel and Griffith. That assignment is in the words and figures following, to-wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b839-5\">\u201cThis contract made this 9th day of February, 1914, by and between S.

Griffith, parties of the second part, all of the State of Virginia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b839-6\">\u201cWitnesseth: That whereas, on the 5th day of July, 1913, the said party of the first part entered into a valid written contract with the heirs at law of J. H. Smith, deceased, for the sale of a certain boundary of land lying in the counties of Russell and Buchanan, in the State of Virginia, and containing 500 acres, more or less, or the finding of a purchaser for the said piece or parcel of land at the price of fifty ($50.00) dollars per acre upon terms of $5,000.00 cash, and the remainder in five equal annual payments; and also,</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b839-7\">\u201cThat, whereas, the said S. H. Robinett, party, of the first part hereto did procure a purchaser for said land under the terms of said written contract, and bound himself to convey or to cause to be conveyed the said tract of land to the prospective purchasers in accordance with the terms of the said written contract; and also,</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b839-8\">\u201cThat, whereas, the said S. H. Robinett did, in accordance with the provisions of said contract, give the said heirs at law of J. H. Smith, deceased, notice that he had procured a purchaser under the said contract, and did later bring his said prospective purchasers to the home of the said heirs of J. H. Smith, deceased, and demand a compliance with the said contract, offering to make cash payment of $5,000.00 as soon as deed was prepared for delivery in accordance with the terms of the said contract; and also,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b839-9\">\u201cThat, whereas, the said heirs at law of J. H. Smith, deceased, did forfeit said contract and refused to comply with the same, and demanded that the said prospective purchasers pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>cash sum of $16,000.00 down, in lieu of said $5,000.00, as provided in said contract, and demanded the remainder to be paid in two annual installments in lieu of five annual installments, and as a result of said default by the said heirs of said J. H. Smith, deceased, and refused to comply with said contract, and make conveyance in accordance to the same, the said S. H. Eobinett did become liable to his said prospective purchasers for the damage sustained by them for his failure to convey said property or cause same to be conveyed to his said prospective purchasers, in accordance to the terms of the said written contract;</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b840-4\">\u201cHow, therefore, in consideraion of the premises, and the further consideration of one dollar in hand paid by the said parties of the second part to the said party of the first part at and before the signing, sealing and delivering of this contract, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and the <em>further </em>consideration of the prospective purchaser releasing all damage done to him on account of the breach of the said contract made by said S. H. Eobinett with the said prospective purchaser; and the services heretofore rendered to the said party of the first part by the said A. T.

S. Hansel and S. H. Bobinett containing two counts. The first count charges Hansel with forging an option contract for the sale of certain coal land lying in the counties of Bussell and Buchanan, and Bobinett with counselling, hiring, procuring and aiding and abetting him in the.commission of the forgery; and the second count charges .Hansel with uttering and attempting to employ as true the forged instrument, with intent to defraud, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The jury found the accused, Hansel, guilty as charged in the indictment, and fixed his punishment at three years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary; and upon that verdict the judgment under review was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">1. The first assignment of error is to the admission in evidence of the contract of February 9, 1914, between Bobinett of the one part and Hansel and Griffith of the other part, whereby the former assigned to the two latter two-thirds of the amount claimed to be due to Bobinett from the Smith heirs as commissions for procuring a purchaser for land under the option contract. The grounds of objection to the admission of the paper were (1) that it was not sufficiently identified; and (2) that it was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">The execution of the paper was proved by the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Griffith, one of the parties, and also the lawyer who prepared it, and, when offered in evidence, its identity was established by that witness. The materiality of the paper is shown by the circumstances that Hansel, who was introduced as a witness for Eobinett in the suit for commissions, was entitled to one-third of the recovery; and, moreover, the execution of the contract of assignment, the institution of the suit by Griffith to recover commissions, and Hansel\u2019s testifying at the trial as plaintiff\u2019s witness were relevant occurrences tending to sustain the charge against him of uttering the forged instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">2. The ground of exception here relied on is not made an assignment of error in the petition; it is discussed for the first time in the reply brief. Waiving, however, that irregularity of procedure, the objection pressed upon us is to the admission by the trial court of the stenographic report of Hansel\u2019s testimony in the suit for commissions. It is said (1) that the stenographic report of the evidence, which the court allowed one of the prosecutors to read to the jury, was not properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The fact is that, in the absence of the jury, the admissibility of this evidence was fully discussed, and the court observed: \u201cThe court permits the evidence of the defendant (Hansel) given in the civil case, which is admitted to be correct, or about which there is no controversy, to be read in evidence upon the theory that everything said or done by the accused in a transaction of an attempt to utter a paper with knowledge of its forgery is admissible, which knowledge must be proven, and which is admissible under the rule laid down in <em>Sands\u2019 Case, </em>20 Gratt. (61 Va.) 800 and <em>Chahoon\u2019s Case, </em>20 Gratt. (61 Va.) <em>733, </em>and the West Virginia ease of <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>29 W. Va. <em>147 </em>(1 S. E. 225).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">If it had been the purpose of the defense to challenge the authenticity of the report of the evidence, the statement of the court that its genuineness was admitted ought then to have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Again it was insisted (2) that the admission of this evidence was contrary to section 3901 of the Code, which is as follows: '\u201cIn a criminal prosecution, other than for perjury, or in any action on a penal statute, evidence shall not be given against the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon \u2022a legal examination unless such statement was made when \u25a0examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">With respect to this objection, it is sufficient to say that though Hansel was called as a witness for the plaintiff, Bobinett, they had a joint interest in the recovery. So that in point of fact he was \u201cexamined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">3. The third assignment of error (and the only other assignment that demands our notice) involves the refusal of the court to grant instruction Ho. 4, as prayed by the accused, and giving it in its modified form.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The instruction, as offered, reads: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that before they can convict the defendant of uttering or attempting to employ as true the writing in controversy before them in this case, they must believe beyond all reasonable \u25a0doubt, first, that said paper is a forgery; and, second, that the defendant, B. S. Hansel, knew that fact at the time of the \u25a0trial of the civil action of S. H. Bobinett against the Smith heirs referred to in the evidence; <em>and third, that the paper introduced in evidence and purporting to be a contract between 8. II. Bobinett, A. T. Griffith and B. 8. Hansel is a genuine contract between the. said parties duly executed and delivered, \u2022and that said contract was in effect between said parties at the time of the trial of the said civil action referred to</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The instruction given omits the italicised language above. In other words, the modified instruction, in substance, told the jury that they should convict the accused if they believed from the evidence that the paper was a forgery, and that that fact was known to Hansel at the time of the trial of the civil .action.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>It is obvious that these circumstances, standing alone, were insufficient to warrant a conviction. In themselves, they do not show that the accused either uttered or assisted in uttering the supposed forged instrument. For that error the judgment must be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">'4. In this view of the case, it is not necessary, nor would it be proper, to consider the last assignment, namely, the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict on the ground that it was contrary to the evidence and without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
