Richard Turner died in 1829, having devised the eastern half of \u201cWaltsingham\u201d to his son, Richard Henry Turner, and the western half to his son, Albert Turner. The will directed the dividing line between these properties to be run from the river on the south to the public road on the north. Title to the western moiety, \u201cWaltsingham,\u201d by successive devises and conveyances, devolved upon appellees. Richard Henry Turner, grandfather of appellant, in the year 1893, cut off from the easterly moiety 200 acres on the north, and by deeds of even date conveyed that boundary, the \u201cPratt\u201d tract, to his daughter, Mrs. Eliza H. Pratt, and the residue, of \u201cWoodlawn,\u201d to his son, Henry Vivian Turner, father of appellant, who afterwards devised \u201cWoodlawn\u201d to his wife and appellant, who subsequently inherited his mother\u2019s portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Appellant claims a right of way from <em>necessity </em>and by <em>prescription </em>over the road in controversy, which claims are not altogether consistent, since the right to the former must have attached, if at all, at the time of the partition of \u201cWaltsingham,\u201d while the latter imports acquisition of the easement by exclusive, uninterrupted, continuous and adverse use and enjoyment for twenty \u25a0 years with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner. <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Merriman, </em>95 Va. 660, 666, 29 S. E. 738; <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>101 Va. 47, 48, 43 S. E. 182; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Green, </em>111 Va. 205, 68 S. E. 253; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dobyns, </em>112 Va. 586, 72 S. E. 139; <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Creasey, </em>117 Va. 872, 86 S. E. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>In the lifetime of Richard Turner there were a number of plantation roads and trails leading in various directions over \u201cWaltsingham,\u201d as the convenience of the owner dictated, including a road located in general course along the route of the way now in dispute. Obviously, no easement of way could have arisen at that time, because there cannot be an independent easement in the owner of the fee simple estate. When \u201cWaltsingham\u201d was divided the eastern half, as observed, was bounded on the north by a public road, and from that public road there is a private road leading directly to the \u201cWoodlawn\u201d mansion, which has existed \u201ctime out of mind,\u201d with a gate on the public road bearing the inscription \u201cWoodlawn Entrance.\u201d It is true the way afforded by that route from \u201cWoodlawn\u201d to the village of Port Conway is not as convenient as the private road over \u201cWaltsingham;\u201d still, it was in proof that the distance between the two points could be covered by a pony with a buggy driven at a jog-trot in half an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The doctrine of ways by necessity is succinctly stated in 1 Minor on Real Property, section 103, as follows: \u201cErom principle, it would seem that if there already be another mode of access to the land, though much less convenient, or more expensive to develop, the reason for the inference of a grant of a way by necessity ceases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">At the date of the partition of \u201cWaltsingham,\u201d Richard Henry Turner was the absolute owner of \u201cWoodlawn\u201d and the land to the north of it abutting on the public road, across which the private road extended. So, at that time no reason existed for a way by necessity over \u201cWaltsingham.\u201d And the record does not show that Richard Henry Turner\u2019s successors in title, including appellant, have in any manner lost or been deprived of that outlet. <em>Muse </em>v. <em>Gish, </em>114 Va. 90, 75 S. E. 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Of appellant\u2019s second contention, namely, that he has a right of way by prescription, the burden of proof rests upon him to establish it. <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Creasey, supra. </em>That he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>failed to sustain that burden the record plainly shows. George Turner, Sr., perhaps, knows more of the genesis of this claim than any living\u2019 witness. . He was a son of Richard Turner and brother of Albert and Richard Henry, and subsequently himself became the owner of \u201cWaltsingham,\u201d where he passed many years of his life. He was ninety-four years old when he gave his deposition, but, nevertheless, testified with such clearness and intelligence as to show that his mind was undimmed by age. He remembered his father and the ways in use in his time, and testified that he repeatedly had made partial changes of location in the road across \u201cWjaltsingham\u201d to accommodate his brother. In like manner, he used the private roads over \u201cWoodlawn,\u201d especially the road to his brother\u2019s mill, of which he was a customer; yet, neither claimed this user (which was in common with other neighbors) as a legal right. It was nothing more than an interchange of courtesies between brothers and friends. The same attitude with respect to those ways was maintained by their successors in title, including appellant. But aside from other evidence, the correspondence between appellant and appellees affords convincing proof that his claim is not well founded. By that correspondence appellant sought and obtained from appellees the privilege of using the private way, but with the distinct understanding that it was matter of favor, and conferred no permanent right of way upon appellant, and was revocable at the will and pleasure of appellees. In consequence of repeated trespasses by appellant\u2019s stock upon the premises of appellees, they were constrained to revoke the license, and notified appellant of their purpose to close the road against him. This litigation followed, and resulted in a decree dismissing the bill, which decree is plainly right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
