Testator died in the early part of 1881 and his will was probated in Tazewell county court, on May 10, 1881. He devised one-third of his lands to his son, W. L. Spracher, in fee simple. To Eliza M. McFarland, his only married daughter, he devised one-third of his land during her life, remainder to her heirs, and the provision made for his daughter, Julia Anne, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">\u25a0 \u201cAlso to my daughter, Julia Anne, I desire that she shall have her equal share laid off, also according to quality and quantity, and she shall have it forever, except she should marry, then at her death I desire that it shall revert to her legal heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">After the death of the testator his daughter, Julia Anne, on June 20, 1882, intermarried with one Thomas Hall, and after this marriage and after the death of her husband, Julia Anne Hall, by deed dated September 28, 1912, conveyed the land devised to her by the' above clause of her father\u2019s will to appellees, John D. Fox and Alexander St. Clair. After the marriage of Julia Anne, W. L. Spracher by deed dated December 15, 1885, conveyed his land to one Joseph Meek, and in this conveyance he included what he claimed to be his remainder in the land devised to Julia Anne by the clause of their father\u2019s will quoted above; so that in this litigation appellant claims the land in question under Joseph Meek, through the various conveyances and devises appearing in the record, while appellees claim the land under the conveyance to them from Julia Anne Hall, the contention of appellees being that a fee simple estate vested in Julia Anne Spracher under the will of her father; that the provision in said clause of his will above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>quoted created a condition subsequent in general restraint of marriage; that such condition is void in law; and that, therefore, the! subsequent marriage of the said Julia Anne did not divest her of-this fee simple estate, but same continued in her, and was passed from her to the appellees by her conveyance above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In discussing the intention of the testator, to be ascertained from the language employed in his will and the surrounding circumstances\u2014that is, the situation of the parties, the ties which connected the testator with the objects of his bounty, and the motives which probably influenced him in disposing of his property\u2014appellant takes the position that the purpose was to put his two daughters, Eliza M. and Julia Anne, upon at) equal footing, and to provide for them alike; while appellees contend that his purpose was to discourage and prevent the marriage of Julia Anne by placing a penalty upon her marrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In looking first to the language employed in the will to determine what estate in the land devised to Julia Anne was vested in her, it is to be borne in mind that it is too well-settled to require citation of authority that all devises and bequests are to be construed as vesting at the testator\u2019s death, unless the intention to postpone the vesting is clearly indicated in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">As it seems to us, it would have heen quite difficult, if not impossible, for the testator to have found language that would have served better to transfer a complete estate in fee simple than was used in the clause of his will making provision for his daughter, Julia Anne, which clause provides that she was to have one-third of the testator\u2019s land, \u201cand she shall have it forever, except she marry, then at her death I desire that it shall revert to her legal heirs.\u201d The first part of the language used plainly means that the estate devised to Julia Anne was to be hers forever\u2014that is, an estate in fee simple\u2014and the latter part of it in effect is, \u201cbut if she marries, then she shall have only a life estate.\u201d It is equally as clear to us that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>an unwarranted perversion of said language to make it read, as contended by appellant: \u201cI give a life estate in one-third of my lands to my daughter, Julia Anne, but if she does not marry, then she is to have a fee simple estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">ISTor can this provision in the will as to the marriage of the devisee be construed into a condition precedent or a limitation. It is not a condition precedent for the reason that the estate had already vested in the devisee, Julia Anne, at the time of her marriage, and the effect of the provision respecting her marriage, if valid at all, could only be to divest such estate, and not to prevent its vesting, which would be the result in the case of a condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">It is not a limitation, because it does not mark the extent of time for which the estate was to last, nor determine the duration of the estate. The testator does not say that Julia Anne shall have the estate <em>until </em>she marries, and thus make the time of her marrying mark the full limit of time for which the estate is given; but he gives to her an estate in fee simple, and then adds a provision, the effect of which is to cut down and destroy this larger estate and vest in her a lesser estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u201cThe only general rule, perhaps, in determining whether words are words of condition or of limitation, is that where they circumscribe the continuance of the estate, and mark the period which is to determine it, they are words of limitation; when they render the estate liable to be defeated in case the event expressed should arise before the determination of the estate, they are words of condition.\u201d <em>Atlanta, &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>108 Ga. 634, 34 S. E. 184, quoting from 2 Wash. Real Prop. (5th Ed.), p. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Accordingly in <em>Millan </em>v. <em>Kephart, </em>18 Gratt. (59 Va.) 1, it is said: \u201cWhile a limitation marks the boundary of an estate, and the utmost time of its continuance, the effect of a condition is to defeat the estate before it reaches the boundary or has completed the full space of time prescribed by the limitation. 1 Preston Est. 49.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>In Minor on Real Prop., vol. 1, sec. 540, this learned author says: \u201cLimitations differ from conditions in this: A limitation marks the <em>ultimate time of continuance </em>of an estate; a condition marks some event which, if it happens in the course of that time, is to <em>defeat the estate \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">And at p. 655, sec. 574, the same author illustrates as follows: \u201cThus a devise to <em>\u2018A until she marries, </em>and then the land to pass to Z,\u2019 is a <em>limitation, </em>and good; whilst a devise <em>\u2018to A for life, </em>on condition that if she marries the land <em>shall pass to Z,\u2019 </em>is a <em>condition, </em>and because it absolutely prohibits marriage <em>is void; </em>that is, the condition is void, and being a condition precedent to Z\u2019s estate, Z can take no interest, present or future, in the land conveyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The latter part of the illustration quoted, and which the author declares to be a condition subsequent, is wholly parallel with and similar to the case at bar, in that by the terms of the will under consideration there is given an estate to the devisee (Julia Anne) in fee simple, on condition that if she marries the land shall pass to her heirs, her sole heir, as it happens, being her brother, W. L. Spracher, under whose conveyance appellant claiins, and who, according to the rule of construction stated by. Professor Minor, <em>supra, </em>could take no interest, present or future, in the land devised, and therefore could convey none to the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Let us, however, revert to the language of the will itself and determine from it, if we can, the intention of the testator, and whether or not he,- after giving his daughter, Julia Anne, an estate in fee simple, and then adding a provision the effect of which is to cut down and destroy this larger estate and vest in her a lesser estate, intended to put a penalty upon the marriage of his said daughter\u2014that is, intended this latter provision as a condition in restraint of her marriage generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">As a matter of construction, it is impossible to see how the words in the will \u201cexcept she marry\u201d can be deemed identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>with \u201cuntil she marry,\u201d as contended by appellant. The word \u201cexcept\u201d as it appears to us, must be construed as a <em>condition </em>and not a limitation. Indeed, to construe \u201cexcept\u201d as \u2018\u2018until\u201d in the sentence where it is used in the devise, would involve a self-contradiction, in that the sentence would then read, that the testator gives the land \u201cto Julia Anne <em>forever until she marries, </em>then after her death (in the event of marriage) to her heirs. The language used can only make good sense by construing \u201cexcept\u201d as \u201cbut if\u201d or its equivalent, which would constitute it a condition subsequent.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">It may be conceded that a condition subsequent may usually be distorted into the form of a limitation, or <em>vice versa, </em>and apparently without materially affecting the meaning of the testator or grantor, but in law there is a wide difference between the two. It would doubtless be difficult to convince the ordinary man that he is not saying exactly the same thing in two different ways when he says \u201cI give this land to you until you marry and then to B,\u201d and \u201cI give this land to you for life, but if you marry then to B;\u201d and if he should say either, it would be easy enough to twist it around and say it is the same as if he had said the other. But in law they are by no means the same, since all the legal differences at once arise that are recognized as existing between estates upon <em>condition </em>and estates upon <em>limitation, </em>amongst others the possibility that in an estate upon condition the condition may be void, and the estate thus become absolute and free from condition, while if the- estate is upon <em>limitation, </em>the limitation marks the utmost duration of the estate under the devise or the agreement of the parties where created or conferred by deed or contract, which cannot be extended beyond that period without violating the terms of the devise in the one case, and without making a new contract for the parties in the other. Hence, while an estate limited \u201cto A in fee, but if he attempts to alien his estate then to B in fee,\u201d would give A an absolute estate and in fee, free from condition, because the condition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>an unreasonable restraint of alienation and void, yet a limitation \u201cto A until he attempts to alien, and then to 13,\u201d would be a perfectly good limitation, and upon A\u2019s attempt his estate would cease and go over to 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Upon reason and authority the foregoing conclusions are correct, and, therefore, in the instant case, the devise of the land in question to the testator\u2019s daughter, Julia Anne, \u201cand she shall have it forever,\u201d transferred upon the death of the testator to the daughter a fee' simple estate in the land, and the added provision to the devise, \u201cexcept she should marry, then at her death I desire that it (the land) shall revert to her legal heirs,\u201d both by the simple construction of the language and the intention of the testator to be gathered from the plain language used, is a condition subsequent and must be in restraint generally of his daughter\u2019s marriage; so that the only remaining question is as to the legality of such a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">It has, by numerous decisions of this court, been held that any contract or provision in general or total restraint of marriage is against the policy of the laws of this State, and this view, it appears, has been uniformly taken wherever the question has arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>11 Gratt. (52 Va.) 804, the will construed bequeathed to the testator\u2019s niece certain personal property during her life, and forever if she should remain a member of the Society of Friends, in order for her to do which it was necessary for her to marry one of the members of the society; but there being only a few male members of the society in that community, the court held that the provision was an unreasonable restraint on marriage, and therefore void, the court saying in its opinion: \u201cHence not only should all positive prohibitions of marriage be rendered nugatory, but all unjust and improper restrictions upon it should be removed, and all undue influence in determining the choice of the parties should be carefully suppressed. . . . But where a condition is in restraint of marriage generally, it is deemed to be contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>public policy, at war with sound morality, and directly violative of the true economy of social and domestic life. Hence such a condition will be held utterly void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The court again took the same view of the policy of the law in the case of <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Ferguson, 85 </em>Va. 509, 8 S. E. 241, 1 L. R. A. 837, 17 Am. St. Rep. 78, where it is said: \u201cThe law upon this whole subject is well summarized in a valuable treatise as follows (quoting from 2 Pom. Eq., sec. 933) : When a condition (in restraint of marriage) is subsequent and annexed to a gift of land (or of any interest arising out of land), if general, it is void, and although broken, the estate of the donee continues . . .\u201d To a report of this case in 1 L. R. A. 838, the following note is appended: \u201cnotwithstanding the confusion and uncertainty which surrounds the subject of contracts in restraint of marriage, the authorities recognize certain propositions which lie at the foundation, namely: that all conditions annexed to gifts which prohibit marriage generally and absolutely are void, unless it be a condition precedent annexed to a devise of land; and if not in absolute restraint, but in such form that it will probably operate as a general prohibition, it is void under like limitation, and this upon the ground of public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Smythe </em>v. <em>Smythe, </em>90 Va. 638, 19 S. E. 175, the clause of the will construed is as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath unto my two sisters, Kate A. and Mattie R. Smythe, all my estate of every kind, both real and personal, of which I may die seized, to be by them used and enjoyed during their natural lives. But the benefits of the bequest are to continue to my said two sisters upon the condition that they shall remain sole.\u201d Held null and void as placing a restraint upon marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The decisions in the cases cited are in harmony with the decisions in other jurisdictions, as well as with the text writers on the subject, which are clear and emphatic on the point that a condition subsequent in general restraint of marriage is void, and cannot have the effect to divest an estate which is already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>vested. Among the authorities adverted to are: <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Garesche, </em>229 Mo. 496, 129 S. W. 949, 49 L. R. A. (N. S.) 605; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>56 Md. 100, 40 Am. Rep. 409; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>137 N. C. 572, 50 S. E. 218; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Marble, </em>69 Me. 310, 31 Am. Rep. 281; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>21 Ap. D. C. 424; 2 Min. Inst. (2d Ed.), 245 <em>et </em>seq.; Tiedeman on Real Prop., secs. 275, 281; 1 Shep. Touch. Hilliard\u2019s Am., Ed. 132; 2 Redfield on Wills, p. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Counsel for appellant endeavor to draw a distinction between the effect of a condition subsequent in restraint of marriage when attached to a bequest and when attached to a devise, but the case of <em>Fifield </em>v. <em>Van Wyck, </em>94 Va. 557, 27 S. E. 446, 64 Am. St. Rep. 745, cited as authority for the proposition, clearly does not go to the extent that counsel would have it go. On the contrary, it specifically refers to the case of <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>which is authority for the proposition that conditions subsequent in restraint of marriage have the same effect in realty as in cases of personalty, and are both null and void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">FTo authority has been adduced by appellant\u2019s counsel to controvert the proposition that if an intention on the part of the testator to impose a general restraint upon the marriage of a devisee is established, then such restriction is void, and the devisee will take an absolute estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The two cases mainly relied on by appellant are <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>84 Me. 400, 24 Atl. 886, 16 L. R. A. 707, 30 Am. St. Rep. 358, and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>L. R. 1 Q. B. D. 279. A careful examination of those cases discloses that they are not authority for appellant\u2019s contention in this case. The process of reasoning applied in those cases is wholly different from that applied in the eases decided by this and other courts and the text writers cited above. FTot only so, but in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>the court makes this statement: \u201cIt is undoubtedly an established rule of law that, even with respect to a devise of real estate, a subsequent condition which is intended to operate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>general restraint of marriage, or the natural effect of which is to create undue restraint upon marriage and promote celibacy, must be held illegal and void, as contrary to the principles of said public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>Lust, J., says: \u201cAs I read the words, the testator only meant to provide for her while she was unmarried\u201d (a limitation), though the language of the will is, \u201cProvided, said Mary remains in her present state of single woman;\u201d otherwise, if she hinds herself in wedlock, she is liable to lose her share,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">It might have be^n possible and proper to distort the form of expression usecTby the testator (condition) into a different form (limitation) in accordance with his assumed intent, but it does not seem to us proper or even possible to do that in the case under consideration, for the obvious reason that it would involve the contradiction already mentioned of giving to the testator\u2019s daughter, Julia Anne, an estate <em>forever until she marries, </em>which is repugnant and plainly self-contradictory, and if this he true then the testator must he presumed to have intended a <em>condition subsequent </em>and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Appellant relies also upon the case of <em>Selden </em>v. <em>Keen, </em>27 Gratt. (68 Va.) 576, and in that case the court did arrive at the conclusion that the provision in the will in regard to the marriage of the legatee was not void, as in restraint of marriage, but that same was a <em>limitation, </em>limiting the estate to the legatee until her marriage, and in the event of her marriage the estate given to her until that time ceased; hut we deem it only necessary to say that a very different state of facts existed in that case from those of the case at bar; that the case was decided upon its own peculiar facts, and there is nothing in the court\u2019s opinion that disturbs the doctrine laid down in the case of <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Maddox, supra, </em>and followed in the other cases above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The groat weight of authority is to the effect that conditions annexed to a bequest or a devise, the tendency of which is iinduly to restrict or restrain marriage, are contrary to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>policy and void, and it must be conceded that the intention of the testator in making the condition is immaterial, however praiseworthy that intent may have been. He must carry out his intention in some other way than by impinging upon the policy of freedom of marriage. But even if it could be granted that the prohibition of the law is aimed at the testator\u2019s <em>intent </em>to restrict marriage, and not at the restriction itself, it would seem clear that an actual restraint or discouragement of marriage would carry with it the <em>prima facie </em>presumption that such restraint was <em>intended, </em>and the burden would be upon him alleging the contrary to prove the real intention. Upon this theory there is nothing in the will or the surrounding circumstances of the testator, as disclosed by the evidence in this case, that would satisfactorily establish an intent contrary to that to be gathered from the language of the will itself. Each side has its theory as to what the real purpose or intent of the testator was, and one seems just as plausible and as well supported as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Upon the whole case, therefore, we are of opinion that the decree of the circuit court complained of is right, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
