S. Robinson, filed his petition in this court asking the court to compel T. J. Christian to vacate the office of police justice of the city of Newport News, and to deliver to him all the records, hooks and papers pertaining to the office. The petition sets forth the passage of two acts of assembly referred to in the judgment of the court creating the office of civil and police justice for certain cities, including the city of Newport News, and transferring to it the jurisdiction and powers of the former police justice. He then sets forth the election held in pursuance of said acts of assembly and his qualification thereunder. After setting out other matters of detail, he avers he made formal demand on T. J. Christian, who had formerly acted as police justice of the city, to turn over and transfer to him, as civil and police justice, all warrants, proceedings and claims of whatever nature within the jurisdiction conferred by said acts upon civil and police justices, that were pending before him, in order that he might proceed to the determination of the cases as prescribed by said acts, and demanded that said Christian should forthwith vacate the office of police justice of said city, as it had terminated by operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>of law; but that Christian refused to comply with any of said demands, and still refuses to do so, and continues without legal authority to exercise the functions of police justice of the city. The petition concludes with a prayer that \u201cthis honorable court may issue a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>directed to the said T. J. Christian, commanding and compelling him to forthwith vacate the purported office of police justice of Newport News, Virginia; to deliver to this petitioner all records, books and papers pertaining to the said purported office; to desist from doing any act or attempting to do any act within the jurisdiction heretofore possessed by the police justice of the city of Newport News; that he, the said T. J. Christian, transfer and deliver to petitioner all warrants, proceedings and claims of whatever nature within the jurisdiction conferred by the act of March 20, 1914, and the act of February 11, 1915, upon petitioner as civil and police justice, that may be pending before him, the said T. J. Christian, under color of police justice of the city of Newport News; to the end that petitioner may conduct such further procedure and determination in accordance with the powers and duties of his office as may be necessary, and provided for by law. And petitioner further prays for all such other, further and general relief as the nature of his case may require.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b801-5\">The defendant filed his answer to this petition, and after making various admissions and sundry objections of a minor nature, rests his defense chiefly on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the two acts aforesaid.

The said journals for the session 1911 are asked to be read as a part hereof. The references to said bill are as follows: House Journal, pages 558, 566, 652, 783, 815, 987 and 1059, and in Senate Journal, pages 671, 688, 718, 800 and 811.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b802-7\">\u201c16.

This defendant says that by reason of the unconstitutionality of said pretended act of 1911, this defendant was properly elected, and upon his qualification became police justice of Newport News, Virginia, for the term of two years beginning January 1, 1915, and expiring December 31, 1916. The said defendant was such police justice when the legislature undertook to pass the pretended act of 1915, chapter 15, Acts of Assembly, 1915, page 69. The defendant says that the pretended act passed at the extra session of the General Assembly of Virginia, 1915, is unconstitutional and void for the same reasons assigned in the 15th and 16th paragraphs hereof, with the following exceptions, however: that this last act did receive a recorded vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house, and (b) that where Alexandria is mentioned in foregoing sections 16 b, e, i and m2, it is omitted when the objections are applied to this act; (c) that in foregoing sections 16 g and m3 when applied to this act Alexandria is to be omitted from the class with Newport News and transferred to the class including the other cities mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b805-8\">\u201cThe said defendant says that there was a committee on special, private and local legislation; that the law was not referred to said committee, as required by the Constitution, and the proceedings prescribed by said Constitution were not observed; that the act of 1915 is in the same language as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>act of 1914, except that Alexandria is included in the excepted class of cities, leaving the act applicable only to Newport News. Reference is here made to House Journal, 1915, pages 211, 214, 235, 274, and Senate Journal, 1915, pages 33, 197, 199, 200, 237, and to such pages of said journals immediately preceding and following said bill as pertain to said bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b806-4\">\u201c18. Said Christian claimed and claims that the said act of 1915 is unconstitutional and void for the further reason: That the act purported to amend and re-enact an act which was itself void, and could have no greater effect than the act of 1914.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b806-5\">\u201c19. Said defendant says that said act of 1915 if otherwise valid could not operate to divest him of the office to which he had been duly elected, and that to give it such force and effect would be in violation of subsection four of section sixty-three of article four of the Constitution of Virginia in decreasing and authorizing to be decreased the salaries, fees, percentages or allowances of said Christian during the term for which he was elected, to-wit, to January 1, 1917.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b806-6\"><em>S.
