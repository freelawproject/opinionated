J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amt\">We have carefully read the record on the present appeal, and conclude that the testimony was sufficient to require the submission of the case to the jury. The plaintiff proved that the defendant is a common carrier of passengers between Flat-bush avenue station in Brooklyn and Eockaway Beach; that the defendant issued to plaintiff an excursion ticket from Bedford station to Eockaway Beach, and that on her return to Bedford station she was injured by reason of negligence of the employes upon the train; that the cars of the train by which she returned had upon them the name of the Hew York &amp; Eockaway Beach Eailroad. The proof seems to bring the case within the authority of Wylde v. Railroad Co., 53 N. Y. 156. This case was reversed on the former appeal <em>(27 </em>N. Y. Supp. 132) on the ground that there was no proof that the defendant ran, or had the right to run, trains on Atlantic avenue, and that there was no proof that the train on which the plaintiff was injured was in charge of the employes of the defendant. This proof has now been supplied, and the plaintiff made out a prima facie case. Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
