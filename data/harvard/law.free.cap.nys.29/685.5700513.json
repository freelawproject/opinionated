The \"testimony even of the plaintiffs shows that they suffered no damage, because, on the 16th or 17th of February, when defendants declared that they were the purchasers, they also declared that they would pay the contract price for said teas upon their delivery to them. But plaintiffs refused to deliver, and elected to terminate the contract; and, if they suffered damage, they so suffer because of their own act, and therefore cannot complain, or claim against defendants any damage. For the reason assigned by the trial justice and the foregoing, the complaint was rightfully dismissed. Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">GONLAN, J., concurs.
