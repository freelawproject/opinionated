Ho answer has, as yet, been interposed. An order was entered herein, requiring plaintiff to furnish the defendant with a bill of particulars of the services rendered by the plaintiff, and from such order this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">This action is on a contract to recover 10 per cent., and not on a quantum meruit. The defendant ought to know whether she made a contract to pay the plaintiff 10 per cent, on all moneys collected by her on insurance, and how much she .collected on such policies. The facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, and plaintiff ought not to be required to furnish a bill of particulars. The order appealed from must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
