The goods were delivered to Van Gelder upon the defendant\u2019s original undertaking. Credit was given solely to the defendant, and the goods were charged to him. The goods were sold in the year 1891. The course of dealing between the parties was as follows: Upon the delivery of the goods to Van Gelder, the latter receipted therefor. A bill was then made out to Newton. This bill (accompanied with Van Gelder\u2019s receipt) was sent to Newton, who wrote across its face: \u2018Tayment guarantied. H. J. Newton.\u201d This course of dealing had continued for four years. It originated after the failure of Van Gelder Bros. That firm, in the year 1887, made an assignment to Newton, who was willing to help them. As they had no credit, and wanted goods, Newton told the plaintiff\u2019s agent, one Sharts, that he would guaranty sales made to them by the plaintiff. Accordingly, a sale was made. The first bill was charged to Van Gelder Bros., and the defendant, in execution of his guaranty, was required to and did give his note for the amount thereof, payable in two months. The bill read: \u201cTerms: 60 days\u2019 note of Henry J. New'ton.\u201d The cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>respondence with regard to this transaction settled all future questions as to whether the defendant was to be a guarantor or an original undertaker. Sharts wrote to Newton on the 25th of May, 1887, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\">\u201cMr. Henry J. Newton, 436 West 16th Street, New York\u2014Dear Sir: The writer (after seeing yon last Monday) called on Van Gelder Bros., and reported to them the result of our interview. They are anxious to get the skins from me with as little delay as possible, so if you will be kind enough to sign the inclosed note for $308.70, and return it to me, Van Gelder can obtain the goods at once. Please fill in on the note where you want the note made payable; i. e. at what bank. Your attention to the above will oblige,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">\u201cYours, very truly, B. W. Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">\u201cF. H. Sharts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">To this Newton, on the next day, sent the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-9\">\u201cMr. B. W. Jones\u2014Dear Sir: Yours with bill for goods to Van Gelder Bros, and note came to hand this morning. My understanding with the gentleman from your house who called on me was that the goods should be billed to me, and in future you will please bill all goods delivered to Van Gelder Bros, to me, and send me bill when delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-10\">\u201cVery respectfully yours, Henry J. Newton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Sharts replied May 27, 1887, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-12\">\u201cHenry J. Newton, Esq., 436 West 16th Street, New York\u2014Dear Sir: Your favor of 26th inst. received, with note at two months from the 26th of May (due July 29th), for three hundred and eight .70 dollars, in settlement of bill for salted skins, dated May 25th. I have made out the invoice in your name, instead of Van Gelder Bros., and inclose it herewith. The two casks of skins were delivered to Van Gelder Bros, this day. Thanking you for the note, I remain,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-13\">\u201cYours, very truly, B. W. Jones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-14\">\u201cF. H. Sharts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-15\">Thereafter all bills were made out directly to the defendant, and the goods, as delivered from time to time to Van Gelder Bros., were charged to him. Charles Van Gelder went out of the firm of Van Gelder Bros, on the 1st of February, 1888, and thereafter the same course of dealing proceeded with regard to Henry Van Gelder. This also is evidenced by the defendant\u2019s letters. Thus, in July, 1888, he wrote to the plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-16\">\u201cNew York, July 23rd, 1888.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-17\">\u201cMr. B. W. Jones\u2014Dear Sir: As I expect to be out of town most of the time until Sept. 1st next, you will please let Mr. Henry Van Gelder have such goods as he may require to successfully carry on his business during my absence, and I will be responsible for the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-18\">. \u201cYours, very respectfully, Henry J. Newton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-19\">And again in July, 1889:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-20\">\u201cNew York, July 17th, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-21\">\u201cB. W. Jones, Esq\u2014Dear Sir: This is to certify that, during my absence from the city, you are authorized to furnish Mr. Henry Van Gelder with goods in his line as heretofore, for which you may consider me responsible, as usual. On 'my return to the city, I will notify you, and then a return to the ordinary method will be in order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-22\">\u201cYours, respectfully, Henry J. Newton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-23\">Upon each of the 26 bills sold in 1891, which form the subject of this action, the \u201creturn to the ordinary method\u201d is evidenced by .these undisputed facts: That each bill was made out and rendered to H. J. Newton, was accompanied by Henry Van Gelder\u2019s receipt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>.and was identified and approved by the words, \u201cPayment guarantied. H. J. Newton,\u201d written across its face by the defendant. It is clear upon this state of facts that there was nothing to go to the jury, and that the defendant was liable upon his original undertaking. He chose to bind himself in that manner, rather than give his note each time that Van Gelder purchased a bill of goods. He knew that a guaranty meant the giving of his note before the plaintiff would trust Van Gelder with the goods. This was evidenced by Shart\u2019s letter with regard to the first purchase. To .avoid that inconvenience, he deliberately chose the obligation of a direct sale to himself, with 60 days\u2019 credit. His present claim, therefore, that he was a mere guarantor is both disingenuous and frivolous. He was clearly liable for every bill made out in his name which, when sent -to him, was accepted, such acceptance being evidenced by the words, \u201cpayment guarantied. H. J. Newton,\u201d written across the face thereof. The direction was therefore right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">As to the rulings upon evidence, we think the court committed no error. Van Gelder was asked whether he or Newton purchased the goods, whether they were purchased for him in his business or for Newton, whether Newton had any interest in his business, whether he was acting as Newton\u2019s agent, whether the goods were charged to him or to Newton, whether he was authorized to purchase for Newton, and a host of similar questions. Newton, too, was asked whether he ever purchased any goods of plaintiff, and whether he had any interest in Van Gelder\u2019s business. All these \u25a0questions were properly excluded. Many of them involved mere conclusions. The object could only have been to induce the witnesses to deny the legal effect of the documentary evidence. Not a -question was asked calling for any conversation, agreement, or actual transaction between the parties; nothing suggestive of a new or different arrangement from that evidenced by the defendant\u2019s own signature. It is clear that the defendant could not, in the way attempted by these questions, vary the conclusive effect of the real transaction. We are referred to a class of cases where the admission of what, upon the surface, might seem to be conclusions of witnesses, was sustained. Casper v. O\u2019Brien, 47 How. Pr. 80; Sweet v. Tuttle, 14 N. Y. 472; Knapp v. Smith, 27 N. Y. 281, 282. In these and similar cases, however, the question admitted had no \u25a0direct relation to the subject of the inquiry. Thus, in Casper v. O\u2019Brien, the question was as to the fact of naked ownership at a particular time, while, as the court said, \u201cthe issue to be determined by the jury involved the bona fides of the possession and \u2022ownership at the time of the loan made by the plaintiff.\u201d In each of the cases the witness was permitted to testify to some particular fact actually within his knowledge, not to his conclusion from such fact. The questions here attempted to be put \u201cwere,\u201d as Judge Freedman said in Casper v. O\u2019Brien, supra, \u201csubject to the criticism that they, or either of them, embraced the whole merits of the -case, and left nothing for either court or jury to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">As to certain other questions, not necessary to be enumerated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>they were either incompetent or immaterial. It was, for instance, quite immaterial whether Van Gelder was acting as Newton\u2019s agent, or acting for himself with Newton\u2019s support. The fact was that Newton lent Van Gelder his credit, and that he made himself responsible for the purchases. As to the question put to Van Gelder, \u201cWhat was your arrangement with Mr. Jones when you purchased the goods of him?\u201d it is enough to say that the witness testified that originally he made no arrangement with Jones; that he was ashamed to go to him; and that the arrangement was made directly between Jones and Newton. There was no suggestion of a different arrangement with regard to the goods in question, nor was it intimated that the inquiry related to a new arrangement. If the defendant, by any of these questions, intended to show any variation in the existing agreement, he should certainly have avowed his purpose, and put his questions accordingly; but, even if he had avowed such a purpose, we think the questions as put were still improper. We may add that the only time the defendant\u2019s counsel hinted at the possibility of a somewhat different arrangement, the court said: \u201cIf he [the defendant] can testify to a conversation with the plaintiff\u2019s agent, that is all very well. He may do so.\u201d But no such conversation was asked for. The use of the words \u201cPayment guarantied,\u201d upon the bills made out to the defendant, did not tend to vary the original undertaking, or to turn it into a guaranty. That was simply the form used to express approval of each particular transaction. It amounted to nothing more than the defendant\u2019s guaranty of his own debt, which, under the authorities, is not a collateral, but an original, undertaking. Fowler v. Clearwater, 35 Barb. 143; Brown v. Curtiss, 2 N. Y. 225; Cardell v. McNiel, 21 N. Y. 336; Johnson v. Gilbert, 4 Hill, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">There was nothing in the conversation between Van Gelder and the plaintiff, wherein the former asked advice as to whether he should continue in business, which affected the transaction. Jones then made no agreement to extend the existing credit or to change the existing relation of the parties. He neither said nor did anything which could prejudice the defendant. He was simply asked for his advice as to whether Van Gelder should go on. His answer was that Van Gelder ought to be the best judge of what he should do. Finally, when pressed, he asked Sharts what he thought; and when Sharts answered, \u201cI think he had better go on,\u201d the plaintiff added, \u201cWell, I do too.\u201d The contention that the defendant was entitled to notice of this conversation from Jones, and was in some way defrauded because such notice was not given him, is hardly worthy of consideration. The judgment appealed from and the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
