For this and the further reason that the specific grounds or reasons for the dismissal are not required to appear by the postea, the order appealed from was properly made. There is nothing in the postea declaring that the dismissal was \u201con the merits,\u201d nor does anything appear by the record which bars another action or in any manner prejudices the plaintiff. It follows that the order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
