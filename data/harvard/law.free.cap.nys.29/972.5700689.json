Upon this fact, without passing upon \u25a0the other charges, the court adjudges that the attorney was guilty \u2022of professional misconduct. As to the measure of punishment, while it is undoubtedly a case for discipline, it is not, in view of the attorney\u2019s youth and inexperience, a case for the extreme penalty \u2022of disbarment. That would wreck this young man\u2019s entire life. When he fell he had been admitted to the bar less than a year. He lias yet ample time to redeem himself, and he should be afforded the opportunity to do so. He will be sufficiently punished, and the honor of the profession vindicated, by judgment of suspension for \u25a0a substantial period. The court leaves him the hope of redemption, and an incentive to work for its realization. The judgment is that the attorney be suspended from practice for two years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
