Also, upon information and belief, that the plaintiffs allege that the said defendant Goldenberg, and the defendants Michael Larkin and James J.

Larkin &amp; Son, as aforesaid, the agents, servants, contractors, or employes of the said defendant Simon Goldenberg, and their agents, servants, contractors, and employes, wrongfully, negligently, and unlawfully, and although license to enter upon the aforesaid building or premises of these plaintiffs was duly tendered or given by these plaintiffs, on their part, to the said defendants Goldenberg and Larkin, said defendants, against the laws of this commonwealth, to wit, in-violation of section 474 of chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882 .of the state of New York, excavated the land adjacent to the plaintiffs\u2019 said land, and took away the soil therefrom to the depth of twenty-four feet or .thereabouts, without leaving proper and safe support for the said land and the building belonging to the plaintiffs, and wrongfully, negligently, and unlawfully entered upon the building or premises of these plaintiffs, and drove certain needles into the wall of said plaintiffs\u2019 building, without the permission, knowledge, or consent of the said plaintiffs; and the defendants, having wrongfully, negligently, and unlawfully committed the acts above named, failed to supply proper temporary and safe support to the plaintiffs\u2019 land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and building as aforesaid,\u2014and all in violation of the laws of this commonwealth, to wit, section 474 of chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">\u201cSeventh. The defendant Loftus D.

Larkin, copartners as aforesaid, and the agents, servants, and employes of the said defendant Goldenberg and the defendants Michael Larkin and James J.

Consisting only of a single count, still the complaint contains the elements of four different causes of action ,\u25a0\u2014two against Golden-berg and the Larkins, and two against Hatton. The causes of action, against Goldenberg and the Larkins are\u2014First, that, having a license to enter upon plaintiffs\u2019 premises, these defendants neglected duly to shore up and protect them; and, secondly, that, having, no license, they wrongfully and unlawfully entered upon the premises. The causes of action against Hatton are\u2014First, that he wrongfully refused a license to the other defendants; and, secondly, that he prevented the other defendants from shoring up and protecting the premises. Conceding, for argument, that these four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>causes of action comply with the other- requirements of the Code in order to their union in a single complaint, it is manifest that each does not affect all the defendants. For instance, the cause of action against Goldenberg and the Larkins for an unlawful entry upon the premises was not the legal effect of Hatton\u2019s refusal of a license, but their own voluntary and independent tort. Hatton\u2019s refusal, of the license, so far from being an invitation, was a prohibition, of the entry. For this trespass, therefore, Hatton is plainly not responsible. So, Hatton\u2019s refusal of the license was his own individual act, with which it is not suggested in the complaint that the other defendants had any connection or privity; the contrary, rather. Hence, the other defendants are plainly irresponsible for Hatton\u2019s wrong in refusing the license. Again, Hatton\u2019s hindrance of the other defendants in protecting the premises was, by the very terms of the proposition, against their will; was a wrong in which they did not concur, and to which they did not assent; was a wrong, therefore, for which, obviously, they are not answerable. The two substantive wrongs upon which the action proceeds are the refusal of Hatton to give the license, and the entry of the other defendants without the license. But Hatton, as already seen, is not responsible for the wrongful entry of the other defendants, nor the other defendants for the wrongful refusal of Hatton. Neither of the causes of action affects all the defendants, and hence they are improperly united in the complaint. Nichols v. Drew, 94 N. Y. 22; Chipman v. Palmer, 77 N. Y. 51; Jackson v. Brookins, 5 Hun, 530; Kelly v. Newman, 62 How. Pr. 156; Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327, 340; Malone v. Stilwell, 15 Abb. Pr. 421; Wells v. Jewett, 11 How. Pr. 242; Van Steenburgh v. Tobias, 17 Wend. 562. We concur with the learned trial judge in the conclusion that the complaint shows a cause of action against defendant Hatton. But for the misjoinder, the demurrer should have been sustained. Judgment reversed, and demurrer sustained, with costs; leave to plaintiff to amend or sever, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
