From the affidavit it appears that the information which persuaded the affiant to make it was obtained from \u2022one MacDonald, and an alleged copy of an agreement. The so-called \u201cagreement\u201d does not justify the belief expressed, and the remaining source of information is therefore MacDonald\u2019s statement to him. But he has failed to furnish to the court any part \u2022of the conversation with MacDonald. Whether MacDonald said anything to justify the impression made upon the affiant\u2019s mind, the court cannot know; and the authority to inquire into the private affairs of an alleged interested party to an action will not be granted by it until it has such knowledge of the facts as persuades it that the examination is desired solely for the purposes authorized by the Code. The order should be reversed, with $10 \u25a0costs and printing disbursements, \u25a0 and motion granted, with $10 \u25a0costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
