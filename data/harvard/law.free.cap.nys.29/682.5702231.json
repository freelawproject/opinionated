While the work was being done, the plaintiff was injured by striking her leg against a beam which was used,' in connection with other planking, to protect the newly-laid tile. She brings the action for the injuries sustained by her. The trial justice dismissed her complaint The tiling of the hallway by defendant was a lawful transaction. He had a right to give the work to another as contractor, and was not liable for the negligence of the contractor or his agents. The plaintiff had knowledge of the fact that a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tractor, and not defendant, was actually doing the work in question.. Her cause of action is against the contractor, and not the defendant. The complaint was therefore properly dismissed. See Maltbie v. Bolting, 6 Misc. Rep. 339, 26 N. Y. Supp. 903. Judgment is affirmed,, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
