The defense is that more than six years had elapsed after the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued before this action was commenced, and that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was therefore barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">On the 1st day of August, 1864, the trustees of the defendant organized by the election of a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, and then ordered that the sum of $2,500 be borrowed for the purpose of purchasing land for a cemetery, and improving the same, and that the president and treasurer be authorized to issue certificates of indebtedness to such individuals by whom the money, or any part thereof, may be loaned; specifying the amount loaned by such individuals, and containing an agreement on the part of the association to pay 7 per cent, interest for the use of \u25a0such money, and to apply one-half of the receipts from the sale of lots to repay the money. Thereupon, subscriptions for the loan were received, and certificates issued therefor to the amount of $2,200. Of that sum, the plaintiff\u2019s testator loaned $300, and received therefor the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201cNo. 25. We certify that Otis Thacher has this day loaned to Hope Cemetery Association three hundred dollars. It is agreed upon the part of said association that one-half of the receipts from the sale of lots shall be applied \u25a0exclusively to the payment of the sum of $2,500 loaned to said association by divers persons, of which the said sum of $300 forms a part, and for the payment of the interest thereon. Said interest to be paid annually, and the \u25a0receipt to be so applied shall he distributed on the first day of July and on the first day of January in each year, until said sum shall be fully paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u201cA.

Adsit, Treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">It further appears that the defendant, with the avails of the loan, purchased land, and improved the same, dividing it into lots for the burial of the dead, and that between\" the time of the issue of said certificates and the 1st day of'Julv, 1877, lots were sold for cash to the amount of $5,479.34, which amount was received by the defendant prior to that date, and that, during the same period, lots were sold to holders of the certificates of indebtedness, who were permitted to use their certificates in payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>therefor as cash; that the certificates so used in the purchase of lots, and which were surrendered up to the defendant and canceled, on and prior to the 1st day of July, 1877, amounted to the sum of $1,575, leaving outstanding and unpaid on that date, 'including the plaintiff\u2019s certificate, $625 in amount, only, of the-original loan of $2,200. The appellant contends that, of the amount of cash so received, he is entitled to but three twenty-fifths of one-half thereof, as shown by the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">Dates.

By treating these retired certificates as cash, and as reducing the loan in the amount of the certificates so retired, the amount on hand July 1, 1877, available for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s certificate, would be $1,129.25,\u2014nearly double the amount required to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The referee appears to have so treated these certificates. His right so to do must be determined from the provisions of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-35\">\u201cIt is agreed upon the part of the said association that one-half the receipts from the sale of lots shall be applied exclusively to the payment of the sum of $2,500 loaned to said association by divers persons, of which the said sum of $300 forms a part, and for the payment of the interest thereon.\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-36\">It does not appear to us that the $2,500 mentioned in the certificate affect the question. A loan of $2,500 had been ordered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the association, but it had succeeded in getting only $2,200. The certificates had been prepared under the supposition that the full loan would be obtained; and, if it had been, then Thacher, loaning $800 of the $2,500, would have been entitled to three twenty-fifths of one-half of the receipts of the association from the sale of lots to apply in the reduction of the amount loaned by him. But only $2,200 was loaned. One-half of the receipts from the sale of lots was required to be set apart exclusively for the payment of the loan. He thus would be entitled to three twenty-seconds of one-half of the receipts. One-half of the receipts from the sale of lots is to be applied upon the payment of the loan, whatever the amount thereof may be. If the plaintiff\u2019s testator had been the only subscriber to the loan, and the amount of such loan was the $300 loaned by him, would it be claimed that even though lots had been sold amounting to upwards of $5,000 he could not have recovered the amount of his loan, for the reason that it was not yet due? To so construe the contract would require the interpolation of a provision to the effect that three twenty-fifths of one-half of the receipts from the sales shall be applied to the payment of the loony instead of one-half of such receipts. It does not appear to us that such a construction should prevail. That adopted by the referee is more rational, and better in accord with the views expressed by the court on a former review of this case. 126 N. Y. 507, 2T N. E. 1040. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
