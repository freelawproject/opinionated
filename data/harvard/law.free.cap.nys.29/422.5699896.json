The complaint was dismissed upon the grounds\u2014First, that the assessment was void upon its face; and, second, that the remedy by injunction has been taken away by statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts appearing bring this case clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>within the authorities of Sixth Ave. R. Co. v. Mayor, etc., 63 Hun, 271, 17 N. Y. Supp. 903, and People ex rel. Consolidated Gas Co. v. Myers, 65 Hun, 14, 19 N. Y. Supp. 723, which are decisions of this court, and therefore controlling. It was suggested upon the argument that these cases were questioned or overruled by some later decisions in the court of appeals, and reference was made to the case of People ex rel. Martin v. Myers, 135 N. Y. 465, 32 N. E. 241. We are unable to understand how this contention can be sustained, in the face of the language of the opinion, which, among other cases, cites with approval People ex rel. Consolidated Gas Co. v. Myers, supra. The judgment should accordingly be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-16\"> Laws 1882, c. 410, \u00a7 897.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
