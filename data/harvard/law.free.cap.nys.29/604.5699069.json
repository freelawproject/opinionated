The answer of the defendants admits the contract and the arrival of the gambler, and alleges a willingness on their part to perform the contract according to its terms. Further answering, and by way of counterclaim, they allege a refusal on the part of the plaintiffs to perform their part of the contract by a delivery or an offer to deliver the merchandise contracted for, and claim damages generally therefor. Plaintiffs demur to said counterclaims on the ground that they do not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. In this we think the plaintiffs are in error. The breach of the contract by the plaintiffs, if established, is sufficient in itself to entitle the defendants to damages, but the nature, character, or measure of damages to which the defendants may be entitled is for the court and jury at trial term. If the plaintiffs desire to be more specifically advised as to the nature of defendants\u2019 claim for damages, they may move for a bill of the particular items composing such claim, but their remedy is not by demurrer. The order of June 11th, overruling the demurrers and the interlocutory judgment thereon, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
