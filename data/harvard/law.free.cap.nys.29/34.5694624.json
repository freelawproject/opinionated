But time does mot affect the substance of the defense. If good in an amended, it \u2022is good in a supplemental, answer; and, if good in a supplemental, \"it is good in an amended, answer. To incorporate in an answer sup\u25a0plemental matter, by way of amendment, violates only a technical rule of pleading, and is without effect upon the substantial rights of the parties. It is the distribution of substantial justice, however, \u00a1irrespective of formal rules of procedure, that is the function of -district courts, in disposing of the litigation before them. Were $they to be fettered by all the technical and recondite rules of practice with which judges and counselors in courts of record are pre: sumed to he conversant, they would surely miscarry in the attainment of that \u201ccheap and speedy justice\u201d which is the end of their institution. We are content to affirm the order on the opinion at special term. 28 N. Y. Supp. 9. Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
