The answer is virtually a \u00a1general denial. The defendant demands a bill of particulars stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>where the alleged sale was made. The complaint says, in terms, that \u201call plaintiff\u2019s firm was to do was to obtain a person or customer who was willing to purchase at the figures mentioned, but as to the terms and manner of payment, and all other terms and conditions of sale, they were to be arranged between the defendant and the purchaser.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff neither agreed to make a sale nor alleges a sale, but avers only an engagement to find a person willing to buy for a certain sum, on such terms as the defendant himself might negotiate. As no sale has been made, where it was made is not to be told.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Secondly. The defendant wants to know whether the sale was made by a member of plaintiff\u2019s firm, and, if not, by whom. Again the answer is that no sale was made or is alleged, and hence it is impossible to say who made the sale. If otherwise, it would be immaterial by what particular person the negotiation was conducted, and to compel his disclosure would only put defendant in possession of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which is never the office of a bill of particulars. Roberts v. Cullen (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 16 N. Y. Supp. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Thirdly. Defendant requires to be informed when, where, and how the purchaser was to pay for the property. It is an answer to this demand to say that the terms of payment were to be settled between the defendant and the purchaser; and that, the defendant having declined the sale, no time, place, or mode of payment has been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Fourthly. So as to the amount of capital stock of the proposed company, and the proportion defendant agreed to take in payment. This, too, was a detail of arrangement between the defendant and the purchaser, which, as the sale went off, was never adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">As to the option, our conclusion is different. Surely, its terms were understood between the parties, and it is due to the defendant that he be apprised of the particular option which the plain; tiff claims he was to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Order modified in conformity with the opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party as against the other. All \u2022concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
