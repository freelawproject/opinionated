A copy of the circular was set out in the indictment, and was marked \u201cEx. No. 2\u201d on the trial. The \u2022defendant interposed the plea of not guilty, but he offered no evidence, except he called seven witnesses who testified that he had previously borne a good reputation. The jury rendered a verdict \u2022of guilty, and thereupon it was adjudged that the defendant be imprisoned in a state prison, at hard labor, for one year, and pay a fine \u2022of $1,000, and stand committed until paid, not exceeding one day for each dollar of the fine imposed, from, and after the termination \u2022of the year\u2019s imprisonment. The undisputed evidence in this case, which is of the most satisfactory and convincing character, shows that the defendant had been engaged in printing the circular set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>out in the indictment, and many others similar thereto, for four years. When his place of business was entered by the officers of the law, on the 16th of December, 1892, the circular set out in the-indictment and similar ones, Exhibits Eos. 1 and 3, were being, printed. It was testified that during four years preceding December 16, 1892, millions of such circulars had been printed by the defendant, and a quantity of them so large was found in his place of business that it required three trucks to remove them to police headquarters. The defendant was not sworn, and, as before stated,, no evidence was offered in his behalf, except of previous good reputation. He made no attempt to explain why he was engaged in printing these circulars, or who his employers were, or what use he intended to make of them, or how he intended to dispose of them. The guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a shadow of doubt. He now seeks a reversal of the judgment upon the ground that the court erred in admitting certain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Anthony Comstock was called as a witness, and testified that he was the chief special agent of the Eew York Society for the Suppression of Vice, and an inspector of the post-office department of the United States. He testified that in his official capacity he had frequently raided the places of business of men engaged in dealing in \u201cgreen goods,\u201d or in advertising counterfeit money for sale, and had made many arrests, and in this way he had become familiar with their circulars, their literature, and the mode in which they conducted their business. He was allowed to testify, over the defendant\u2019s objection and exception, that the circular set out in the indictment (Exhibit Eo. 2) was like those usually used by persons engaged in advertising counterfeit money for sale. He was also allowed to testify, over a like objection, that printed circulars marked Exhibits Eos. 1, 3, and 8, inclusive, were of the kind and character in use by criminals engaged in such business. It seems-to us that this testimony added nothing to the force and effect of the circulars themselves, which, on their face, furnish the most conclusive evidence of the character of the business in which the defendant was engaged, and of his purpose. Section 527 of the Penal Code, under which the indictment was found, declares that such papers and circulars \u201cshall be deemed presumptive of proof of the fraudulent character of such scheme.\u201d As was said in People v. Chacon, 102 N. Y. 669, 6 N. E. 303:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cThe case against the defendant was so strong and his murderous intent and' his threats were so fully proven that evidence that Williams had heard of the threats, particularly after the court had just stricken out similar evidence as hearsay, could not have influenced the verdict; and the refusal to strike out the evidence, therefore, furnishes no reason for a reversal of the conviction.\" People v. Buddensieck, 103 N. Y. 487, 9 N. E. 44; People v. Dimick, 107 N. Y. 131, 14 N. E. 178.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In the last case cited, it was said, after referring to sections 542' and 684 of the Code of Criminal Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cThese are mandates of the lawmaking power, and the court should, with reason and discretion, give them full force and effect. Giving them the observance due in this case, we find no exception in the record showing that the defendant has been prejudiced in respect to any substantial right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>In case this testimony was incompetent,\u2014which we do not decide, \u2014it could not have been prejudicial to the defendant, or have affected his substantial rights. Mink, who had been employed by defendant as a printer for several years, and Frosch, who had been so employed for four or five years, and who were found engaged in printing circulars when defendant\u2019s place of business was entered, testified that they were then engaged in printing the circular set out in the indictment. Mink further testified that during the four years preceding December 16, 1892, he had printed millions of similar circulars. These two men were arrested, and the defendant, in protesting against it, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hold these men. * * * I am responsible for anything they did. What they did, they did by my orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Bateman and Wellman, two employes of the defendant in this business, testified that the defendant had long been engaged in this business, and described the extent of it. Ho attempt was made to contradict any of this evidence; and it is apparent that the defendant deliberately engaged in the printing of these circulars, and that he knew the purpose for which they were printed. Evidence that similar circulars have been found in the possession of persons engaged in the business of selling, or pretending to sell, counterfeit money, and that they had been convicted, bore on no issue, and could not, under the case made by the people, have harmed the defendant. As before stated, the defendant\u2019s place of business was searched December 16, 1892, and, among other printed matter, a circular known as \u201cEx. Ho. 8\u201d was found which concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cKeep This for Reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cWhen you are ready to come and see me, send me the following telegraph dispatch: A. Dupont, 304 Morris Avenue, Elizabeth, New Jersey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">In the defendant\u2019s place of business the following letter was found pinned to Exhibit Ho. 8:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">\u201cJersey City, December 12th, 1S92.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">\u201cFriend Marvin: Kindly print me an outfit of 10,000 same style as last,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">5.000, A. Dupont, Elizabeth, New Jersey, and 5,000, H. Durand, 262 West 116 street, New York City. I want same circular I had last ordered, 5 000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">5.000, send copying ink. 5,000, send magazine No. 1. I would like to have them this week, as I ran out entirely of material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">The defendant was arrested December 22,1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">Mr. Comstock was permitted to testify that between December 16 and 31, 1892 (the exact date he was unable to state), he visited Ho. 304 Morris avenue, Elizabeth, H. J., and found a new building with only one room on the first floor, which had a board partition and a chair in it, the upper story being occupied as a dwelling. It is difficult to see how this evidence could have prejudiced the defendant. The witness also testified that May 15, 1893, he visited Bridgeport; Conn., and that he there found circulars which were copies of those found in defendant\u2019s place of business, and a bill for work done, which was marked \u201cHo. 11\u201d for identification. The cashier of the defendant, Percy Wellman, testified that part of this bill was in defendant\u2019s handwriting. This bill the court refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to receive in evidence, and it was stricken from the record. In this there was certainly no error. No error was committed by the -court in receiving the evidence at folios 199 and 200, nor in permitting the cross-examination of the witness Tower by the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">After a careful examination of the whole record, we are unable to find any error which affected the substantial rights of the defendant, and this seems to be a case to which section 542 of the Code of \u25a0Criminal Procedure is particularly applicable: \u201cAfter hearing the appeal, the court must give judgment, without regard to technical \u25a0errors or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
