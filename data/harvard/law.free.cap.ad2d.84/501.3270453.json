In the second decretal paragraph, Special Term \u201cordered and adjudged that the [subject] escalation clauses contained in the lease agreements of [plaintiffs] * * * are not unconscionable\u201d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The stricken third paragraph, however, went on to dismiss the complaint. \u201cIt was error * * * to dismiss the complaint in this action for a declaratory judgment merely because the plaintiffs were not entitled to the declaration sought by them\u201d <em>(Lanza v Wagner, </em>11 NY2d 317, 334); and \u201cthe motion [to dismiss] should be taken as defendant\u2019s motion for a declaration in his favor and treated accordingly\u201d (Siegel, New York Practice, \u00a7440, p 584; see, also, 3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3001.13, p 30-97). Concur \u2014 Murphy, P. J., Markewich, Silverman and Fein, JJ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> We interpret this as meaning that the court so \u201cdeclared\u201d (CPLR art 30), though that word is not used, nor, indeed is it found in the complaint\u2019s prayer. Our interpretation of what Special Term meant by this is bolstered by the memorandum opinion, which grants summary judgment \u201cto the extent of declaring on the merits that Article 23 [of the leases] is not unconscionable\u201d. Though not such in form, this is a declaratory judgment action, incorrectly described in appellants\u2019 CPLR 5531 statement as one seeking \u201creformation of escalation clauses\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
