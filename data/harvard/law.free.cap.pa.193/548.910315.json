Morgan Silvey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-12\">At the time of the execution of the agreement the property was subject to a mortgage given by James Deniston to John Hays for the sum of $2,100. The plaintiffs plotted the land described in the agreement into twenty-two lots, and on or about February 25,1899, had sold lot No. 22 to A. O. Stewart for $423; and between that date and a few days subsequent to March 3, 1899, sold lot No. 21 to J. D. Craft for $441; lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>No. 14 to D. S. Barry for $450; lots Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, to Wilson &amp; Learn, for $3,300, and. lots Nos. 17 to 20, inclusive, to Charles T. Ebdy for $1,400, all these agreements of sale being oral agreements. Within a few days of the execution of the agreement, to wit: October 5, 1898, arrangements were made between the plaintiffs and James Hays, the mortgagee, by which the mortgagee agreed to accept $250 on the sale of each of the lots in the plan and release the lien of his mortgage from the lot so sold, and this agreement was renewed with his administrator some time during the winter of 1898 and 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">On February 27, 1899, the defendant executed a mortgage for $3,000 to Jessie A. Heasley, payable one year after date, and from the proceeds of that mortgage satisfied the Hays mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">On or about February 25, 1899, the plaintiff Stamets requested the defendant to acknowledge, for the purpose of record, the plan of lots prepared by Edeburn and Cooper for plaintiffs, in order that the same might be placed of record, which request she refused, stating that she was about to place another mortgage on the property and would not sell it for a year; and subsequently, on March 5,1899, she formally repudiated the contract of October 5, 1898, and refused to carry out the same on her part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">In the latter part of January, 1899, the plaintiffs received an offer for the lots Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, from one W. S. Robinson, for the price of $3,450, which price, after consultation with the defendant, Mrs. Deniston, was accepted orally, and the said plaintiffs refused to execute an agreement in writing for the sale of said lots, giving to the purchaser ten days in which to pay the money and receive his deeds, for the reason that the said Robinson refused to pay any hand money, and that the agreement provided for the. conveyance of lots 120 feet deep, whereas the lots in the plan were 110 feet deep.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">Arrangements have been made between the plaintiffs and Jessie A. Heasley, by which the latter agrees to satisfy her mortgage on the premises described on the payment of the face of the mortgage and one year\u2019s interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-9\">The sale to Wilson &amp; Learn of lots Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, was made after March 5, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\">By the terms of the article of agreement of October 5, 1898, the defendant binds herself to convey the remainder of the land described in the article of agreement to the plaintiffs on their performance of their part of the agreement, to wit: the sale of a sufficient number of lots to realize to her the sum of |5,500, and gives to the plaintiffs one year in which to perform their part of the agreement. This agreement, so far as the parties thereto are concerned, was for a consideration, and was irrevocable until after the expiration of the year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">The prayer in the bill for a decree directing the defendant to acknowledge and deliver deeds in fee simple to A. 0\u201e Stewart for lot No. 22, to D. S. Barry for lot No. 14, to J. D. Craft for lot No. 21, to Wilson &amp; Learn for lots Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, cannot be entered for the reason that as between the defendant and the proposed purchasers of the lots, she could rescind the power of sale given to the plaintiffs at any time, and there are no agreements in writing between her and her agents and the purchasers, on which a decree could be based. The case of Blackstone v. Buttermore, 58 Pa. 266, rules the question as to the power of a principal to revoke an agency for the sale of real estate at any time, which by its terms was irrevocable; but this does not affect the rights of the agents, the plaintiffs in this case, to enforce performance upon the part of their principal, the defendant, when they had performed their part of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">The land to be conveyed to the plaintiffs by the defendant is sufficiently designated in the agreement in writing to enable a chancellor to decree the execution of a deed therefor. By the terms of the agreement the land described in the agreement is to be divided into lots, and a plan thereof made, which was done, and the plan offered in evidence in the case. The agents, the plaintiffs in this case, were directed to sell a sufficient number of these lots to realize the sum of $5,500, and the defendant agreed to convey the remainder of the lots to the plaintiffs. It may always be shown by parol that the plaintiffs in a bill for specific performance of the conveyance of real estate has performed his part of the agreement; for instance, if the consideration of the sale were the payment of money, the tender of the money could be shown by parol; and in this case, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the consideration for the conveyance- of the land was the procuring of purchasers for a sufficient number of lots to aggregate the purchase price-of 15,500, it is competent to show by parol that the plaintiffs did so procure purchasers for certain lots at prices which aggregated $5,500 or more. That being shown, the agreement itself clearly points out what land remains, and the plaintiffs are not compelled to resort to parol testimony to show it; .in other words, the agreement points out the method by which the land to be conveyed to the plaintiffs can be ascertained and described; and our courts have always held, under such circumstances, that parol evidence may be admitted to so describe the land. This was clearly ruled in Peart v. Brice, 152 Pa. 277. The contract on the part of the plaintiffs is executed, and it does not matter, for the purposes of this case, if the contract in its inception was such that the defendant could not have enforced specific performance from the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">The plaintiffs used ordinary care and diligence in procuring the sales of this real estate, and the fact that they procured the assistance of other real estate agents to help them in finding purchasers cannot have worked any injury to the defendant, but was rather an advantage to her in expediting the sale of her property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">The court decrees: That the defendant, Laura L. Deniston, properly acknowledge the plan of lots offered in evidence in this case for the purpose of record in the recorder\u2019s office, of Allegheny county; and further that the said defendant, Laura L. Deniston, make, acknowledge and deliver to the plaintiffs, George T. E. Stamets and John J. Ebdy, as tenants in common, a deed in fee simple, free from all incumbrances, for lots Nos. 12, 13, 15 and 16 in the said plan, the costs to be paid by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-8\"><em>G.
