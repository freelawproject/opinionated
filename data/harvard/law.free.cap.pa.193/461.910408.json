The first statement of plaintiffs\u2019 demand against defendant was to recover on his indorsement the amount called for in two certain promissory notes drawn by W. W. Weston to the order of G. E. Ramsey, each of which were indorsed in the order hereinafter stated by the following named parties, viz : by G. E. Ramsey, W. H. and D. 0. Conklin, Pitts-burg Vehicle and Harness Co., D. O. Hutchinson, treasurer, and J. B. Forker, the last indorser of said notes. The defendant filed his affidavit of defense thereto, in which he alleged in substance that he indorsed and delivered the same to the plaintiffs on Sunday, September 10, 1893, and received a check of said plaintiffs, for the amount of said notes, less the discount at the rate of ten per cent per annum, which check was executed and delivered by the plaintiffs to Forker, the defendant, on September 10, 1893, but was dated on September 11, 1893; that he, Forker, was not liable on his indorsement because it was executed and delivered on Sunday, September 10, 1893, and by reason hereof his indorsement was invalid and void, and that no recovery could be had in said action. On plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment therein, in default of a sufficient affidavit of defense, a rule to show cause was granted and the rule was argued by counsel. On February 15, 1896, the opinion of the court was filed, in which the first rule was discharged without prejudice and the motion for judgment was refused. On April 13, 1896, the following motion and amended statement were presented to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">We quote apart thereof here, as follows, viz: \u201cAnd now, April 13, 1896, the plaintiffs, by J.

Filed in open court. By the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-17\">On April 18, 1896, defendant filed his affidavit of defense to said amended statement. The material part is as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-18\">1. The plaintiffs are not entitled to amend their statement of claim in this action at this time, and thus introduce a new cause of action, or to take a judgment by default for want of an affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-19\">2. The defendant denies that he had or received any money from the plaintiffs on September 15,1893, or at any other time, as claimed in plaintiffs\u2019 amended statement of claim, but avers that the check therein referred to, dated September 11, 1893, upon which plaintiffs now seek to recover, was executed and delivered to affiant on Sunday, September 10,1893, in exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>for the note of the Pittsburg Vehicle &amp; Harness Company, for whom he was acting merely as agent, for $1,975, less the discount of ten per cent charged by the plaintiffs, and that the check was part of the same transaction, and was all executed and completed on said Sunday, September 10, 1893, without any previous contract. And affiant, when he had received the check, as referred to in his affidavit of defense, filed in this case on February 20, 1894, and made part hereof, indorsed it and sent the same to the Pittsburg Vehicle &amp; Harness Company, the party entitled to receive the same, and for whom your affiant was acting as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">3. The money was not paid on said check for or in behalf of your affiant, and your affiant never received any benefit therefrom, nor any part of the money thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">4. Affiant is not liable on his indorsement on said cheek under and by virtue of which, the plaintiffs\u2019 amended statement of claim, this action is now sought to be maintained against him, in that it was an executed contract, of which the check was a part, and that the same was made and duly completed on Sunday, September 10, 1893, and by reason thereof is invalid and void, and no recovery in this case can be had thereon against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">On May 11, 1896, motion for judgment in default of a sufficient affidavit of defense to amended statement, was presented and filed in open court, and a rule to show cause was granted thereon the same day, returnable on the 1st Monday of June, 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">The question now before us is whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amounts of their claim or demand for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-9\">In our former opinion we decided there could be no recovery against the defendant by reason of his indorsements of the notes then declared on because of the contract having been fully made on a Sunday, by reason of which the contract was invalid and void. We then thought there might possibly be a recovery for the \u00abmoney had and received by virtue of the check given by plaintiffs to defendant, which had been paid by them through the bank, but we are obliged in the face of the facts alleged in defense to plaintiffs\u2019 claim to change our views in the premises, because the whole contract was made and executed on Sunday. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The test is whether the plaintiffs require the illegal transaction to establish their case. Public policy will not allow courts to aid one, grounding his action on an illegal or criminal act: Holt v. Green, 73 Pa. 198; Foreman v. Ahl, 55 Pa. 325. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">That the check in controversy and upon which the money was paid was dated on September 11,1893, being Monday of the week, will not avail the plaintiffs in this action. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">In the argument of counsel for plaintiffs, great stress was laid upon the fact that the money had and received on the check in question was received from plaintiffs through their bank on September 15, 1893, which was not on a Sunday, and therefore, there was an implied contract to repay the same to the plaintiffs with interest from the latter date. We cannot agree with counsel in such a proposition. The payment of a check to the payee is presumed to have been received on account of a debt due from the payer of the check to the payee, or for money or cash given for said check. A contract will not be implied when an express contract would for any reason be invalid. It is clear in the case at bar that there is no antecedent debt or contract upon which to base the action. All that was performed in regard thereto, so far as the plaintiffs and defendant are privies, was done and completed on Sunday. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">It is shown by the pleadings in this case that there was a voluntary payment of said check, and that the check was given on Sunday. It is a well settled rule of law in Pennsylvania that, where a party voluntarily pays a debt void as to its legal obligation, the amounts so paid cannot be recovered back, nor could his executor or administrator obtain it for the benefit of creditors, nor would an attachment lie at the suit of such creditors : Speide v. McCoy, 6 W. &amp; S. 485; Espy v. Allison, 9 Watts, 462; Mason\u2019s Appeal, 1 Pa. 29; Lackay v. Mercer, 9 Pa. 318. We are fully convinced that plaintiffs are not entitled to judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, on their amended statement of claim in the case before us. We, therefore, make the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">And now, August 31, 1898, after argument of counsel, and upon due consideration of the rule, the amended statement of claim and of the affidavits of defense, and for the reasons expressed in the foregoing opinion, the rule is discharged, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment in default of sufficient affidavit of defense is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\"><em>JError assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-6\"><em>J.

R. 276, cited by appellants, it was decided that: \u201c In Pennsylvania by reason of the statute of April 22, 1794, a contract made on Sunday is illegal, and therefore void and incapable of ratification.\u201d To the same effect are the rulings of this Court in Seylar v. Carson, 69 Pa. 81, Negley v. Lindsay, 67 Pa. 217, Chamberlain v. McClurg, 8 W. &amp; S. 31, and Ham v.

The defendant indorsed the check on the Sunday it was given, but the money was drawn on it by the indorsees on the following Wednesday. This is the money had and received which is the cause of action declared upon in the amended statement. The court properly held that there could be no recovery on the note, but the action for the money stands on different ground. As to it the contract was not complete or executed on Sunday. Its object on the part of the defendant was to obtain the money on the discounted notes before their maturity, and it was not carried out until the money was obtained. The check in the mean time was merely a part of the incomplete Sunday agreement, and as such either party could have refused to go further with it. But when the holder presented and the plaintiff paid it both parties ratified and reaffirmed the transaction with all its consequences. This was done on a legal day, and made a legal and binding loan of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The weight of the authorities is to this effect: Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, sec. 69; Adams v. Gay, 19 Vt. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Contracts made on Sunday are not void in the sense that they do not admit of ratification, though so long as they are executor}\u2019 the law will refuse to enforce them: Chestnut v. Harbaugh, 78 Pa. 473 ; and acts of ratification will make them new contracts which parties will be bound to perform : Uhler v. Applegate, 26 Pa. 140. It was accordingly held in the latter case that an agreement made on Sunday to extend the time of payment of a note, in consideration of the anticipation of part of the amount, became binding by the'agreed prepayment on a legal day, Chief Justice Lewis saying, \u201c It is not the intention of the law that its regard for the Sabbath day shall be made the means of perpetrating a fraud.\u201d So in Whitmire v. Montgomery, 165 Pa. 253, a note made. and delivered on Sunday was held to be ratified and made good by a subsequent payment of interest on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The other grounds of defense set out in the affidavits are equally insufficient. Defendant avers that the notes were not discounted for him, and that he received no part of the proceeds of the check. But the check was drawn to his order and in-L dorsed by him. Payment to his order was payment to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>If he had drawn the money himself and sent it to his principals he could not have denied the receipt of the money, and what he did was the same in substance and effect. The fact that he was acting as agent for other parties, and was so known by the plaintiffs, is not inconsistent with his assumption of individual liability. His indorsement of the notes and the check imported such liability, which could not be contradicted by mere assertion of agency (Ziegler v. McFarland, 147 Pa. 607), and there is no other denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The discount of the notes at the rate of ten per cent per annum was not usurious. They were the notes of one Weston discounted by plaintiffs for defendant, or, in the extreme view, for his principals, the Pittsburg Vehicle and Harness Company. Under such circumstances a banker may purchase the notes at any agreed rate: Gaul v. Willis, 26 Pa. 259; Moore v. Baird, 30 Pa. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The allegation that no notice of protest was received was not sufficient. The rule of commercial law in such cases is the exception in which the requirement is, not that notice shall be received, but only that it shall be sent: Weakly v. Bell, 9 Watts, 273, 279; Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, sec. 1021. The proper form of affidavit is, therefore, that the defendant is informed, believes and expects to be able to prove that no notice was sent, and, even if not in that form, it should at least in substance lay ground for inference that none was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The affidavits were insufficient, and judgment should have been entered for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Order refusing judgment reversed, and judgment directed to be entered for plaintiffs unless other legal or equitable ground be shown why such judgment should not be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
