Kline, Esq., reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-13\">Robert Pinkerton died at his home in Parnassus, Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, November 12, 1895, testate, leaving a widow, Margaret Pinkerton, and issue, eight children, viz: Robert, Agnes Sehwalm, Elizabeth Armstrong, Sarah E. McNeil, Matilda C. McWilliams, John, Margaret J. Armstrong, and Salina A. Charlton, and having for his executor, Robert A. Armstrong. The amount of the personal estate left in the hands of the executor after the payment of debts is $5,595.18; which sum was to be distributed according to said will among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the aforementioned heirs, except certain legacies, as will appear by reference thereto, and to the schedule of distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\">On October 80, 1897, on motion of Spiegel and McGeary, attorneys for accountant, the court appointed B. R. Kline, an auditor, to distribute said fund, who met the accountant and representatives of the \"heirs and others, in the court house in Greensburg, on December 22, 1897, when the accountant\u2019s report was submitted, afid the necessary testimony taken; and again on January 6, 1898, when the construction of the will of the testator was argued relative to said distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">By his will, the testator bequeathed to his wife, Margaret Pinkerton, the house in which they lived, together with the household effects, the rental of another house in Parnassus, and the interest of $1,000, with <em>the </em>privilege of drawing on the principal if necessary, during her natural life, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">\u201cItem 1. I bequeath to my beloved wife, Margaret, during her natural life the house and lot in the village of Parnassus, in which we now live, together with all household effects now in use in my house; I also bequeath to her the interest of $1,000, invested with her approval, said interest to be paid annually, she to have the privilege of drawing on the principal if necessary ; I also bequeath to her an equal share of the remainder of my estate share and share alike with each of my children who may be alive at the time of my decease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">On August 18,1897, Margaret Pinkerton died, testate, without having drawn any part of the principal of said $1,000, or even the interest. In her will she disposes or bequeaths all her worldly effects to her sister, Mrs. Jane Warren, of Allegheny, Pa., who is also named as her executor, which bequest includes the share of the testatrix in her late husband\u2019s, Robert Pinkerton\u2019s, estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">The learned counsel for the estate of Margaret Pinkerton argues that according to the construction of the will of Robert Pinkerton the estate of Margaret Pinkerton includes the $1,000 mentioned in the testator\u2019s will, principal and interest, and also the equal share with the testator\u2019s children, mentioned in said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">The interest on said $1,000, the auditor allows the estate of said Margaret Pinkerton, it not being a part of said estate at the time of the testator\u2019s death; and if the testator had made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>no further provision, after the above quoted passage of his will, the auditor holds that the $1,000, as well as the equal share with the children, should have vested absolutely in Margaret Pinkerton; but in the next paragraph of the will, we find the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\">\u201cI direct at her death all property bequeathed by me to her shall be divided equally between among such of my children as shall survive her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">Here there can be no doubt as to the testator\u2019s intention. In Krebs\u2019s Appeal, 184 Pa. 222, we find the following: \u201c If a testator in one part of his will gives to a person an estate of inheritance in land, or an absolute interest in personalty, and in subsequent passages unequivocally shows that he means the devisee or legatee to take a lesser interest only, the prior gift is restricted accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">Following this rule the learned judge quotes from a will a passage which is similar to item 1 in the will of Robert Pinkerton, except that in the Pinkerton will, the widow is given an estate for life only. See also Reek\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 432.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\">When Margaret Pinkerton was given $1,000, which he directed to be invested with her approval, a trust was created. As she was given the privilege of drawing on the principal if necessary, the auditor holds it to mean, if necessary for her maintenance, and in the following paragraph there was a gift over. Now, as Margaret Pinkerton never drew any part of said principal, and not even the interest while living, it was clearly not necessary, and while the auditor allows her estate the interest of said $1,000, it being no part of Robert Pinkerton\u2019s estate at his death, it appears clear that the testator did not intend her to dispose of said $1,000 at her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">As to Margaret Pinkerton\u2019s equal share and share alike with each of the testator\u2019s children living at his death, the auditor believes it was not at her disposal at her death any more than was the $1,000, owing to the bequest over above quoted. See Sheets\u2019s Estate, 52 Pa. 257, syllabus 3 : \u201c If a testator gives an absolute interest either in lands or personalty, and afterwards unequivocally shows that he means the donee to take a less estate, the prior gift will be so restricted;\u201d and syllabus 9: \u201c A bequest of personalty to one for life, remainder to his heirs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>may give the first taker an absolute interest; a remainder to issue will not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">Robert Pinkerton in his will does not use the word \u201cheirs.\u201d He says \u201cmy children,\u201d which term is construed to mean issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\"><em>Frror assigned </em>was the decree of the court dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-6\"><em>Edward B.

Dillon, 8 Phila. 31; Sproul\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 441; Penna.

Proctor, 48 Pa. 466; Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108; Follweiler\u2019s App., 102 Pa. 581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">An absolute gift, especially of personalty, is not to be cut down by a later clause in a will, unless the testator\u2019s intention to modify the gift is unequivocally expressed: Heck\u2019s Est., 170 Pa. 232; Engles\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 283.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-10\"><em>Paul H.
