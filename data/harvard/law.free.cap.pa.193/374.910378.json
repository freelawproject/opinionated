J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-12\">The note upon which judgment was originally entered to \u25a0 No. 142, January term, 1888, in this court, was executed by the defendants on November 3,1887, and the original judgment was entered thereon December 15,1887. Scire facias to the above No. 123, April term, 1893, issued March 2, 1893. The defendants were all duly served with writ, as they admit, and as shown by the return indorsed on the same. No defense was made, and judgment was entered against the defendants August 16,1893. Execution having issued to collect this judgment, November 16, 1896, William Filby, one of the defendants, then came in and obtained this rule, and is now asking that the judgment be opened and that the defendants be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>mitted to defend against the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, on the ground that they hold a written release executed by Burley, the plaintiff, on September 24,1889, and acknowledged the same day before J. M. White, a justice of the peace, wherein said Burley releases and discharges said Filby and his bail from any and all liability on his judgment, and agrees to look to one Beden Bebout for the payment of the same. The plaintiff alleges that the release presented by the defendant Filby \u201c is false and fraudulent,\u201d that he was not present at the time and place where it purports to have been executed, but was at his home in the state of West Virginia on September 24, 1889, engaged in the transaction of other business, with other parties. In the evidence submitted, Filby and his daughter detail the circumstances in connection with the execution and delivery of this release. J. M. White, the magistrate who is alleged to have written it, and before whom it purports to have been signed and acknowledged by Burley, has been dead since July 20, 1892. Some seventeen or more witnesses familiar with the handwriting of J. M. White, including members of his immediate family, have said that the release offered here is not in his writing, nor is the signature to the same his genuine signature. No testimony is offered in support of the genuineness of the paper as one prepared and signed by White, other than that of Filby and his daughter, who at the time this release is alleged to have been executed, was a mere girl of fourteen or fifteen. If this matter rested alone upon the conflict of testimony with respect to the genuineness of the release, we might feel warranted in awarding an issue to determine that question. But viewing the testimony in connection with other elements of the case, the fact that no consideration is alleged or shown as a basis for this release; that it was never placed on record; that it was not produced when the defendants had their day in court; that they suffered judgment to be entered against them with this paper in their possession, and it is now brought forth, seven years after its execution, four years after the death of White, who is alleged to have drawn and attested it, three years after the defendants stood by and permitted judgment to be taken against them, and only when execution is sought to be enforced on that judgment,\u2014all these facts taken into consideration show such remarkable and inexcusable laches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>on tbe part of the defendants that we have no hesitancy in holding that this defense is without merit, as it now stands before the court. \u201c Where a party has a release or other matter which he might have pleaded to the scire facias, in his discharge, and for want of pleading it execution is awarded upon a scire facias returned, he is estopped forever, and cannot by any means take advantage of it: \u201d Troubat &amp; Haly\u2019s Practice, sec. 1923. \u201c Where a party has had his day in court, he is concluded by the judgment as to facts he knew to exist before its entry:\u201d Goodwin v. Slusher, 5 Cent. Rep. 263; Maher\u2019s App., 2 Cent. Rep. 846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">And now October 31, 1898, it is ordered and directed that the rule to show cause why judgment should not be opened in this case be, and the same is, hereby discharged at the cost of the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-8\"><em>James Inghram, </em>with him <em>William E.
