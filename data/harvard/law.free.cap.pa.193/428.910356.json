There was therefore no error in dismissing appellant\u2019s exceptions and confirming the sheriff\u2019s special return. Neither of the specifications of error requires discussion. They are both overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant, Chas. J. Butterwick.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
