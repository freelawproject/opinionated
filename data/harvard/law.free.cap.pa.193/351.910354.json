Coal Company the Morgan-Gardner Electric Company shipped most of the machinery called for to Hackett, Pa., and caused the electric plant to be erected, when it was turned over to the coal company for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-11\">3. Shortly after the trial period of thirty days had expired, some time in September, 1896, the agent of the electric company came on from Chicago to learn the result of the trial and to settle with the coal company, if they accepted the machinery and plant as satisfactory. At that interview a contract was entered into and a settlement made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-12\">4. The contract was as follows (exhibit \u201c C \u201d), the Morgan-Gardner Electric Company being designated as party of the first part and the Boyle Bros. Coal Company as parly of the second part:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-13\">\u201c Whereas, the said party of the first part has this day delivered and leased to the party of the second part the following described goods and chattels: One (1) Union Iron Works No. 17, 72\" x 18 flange steel tubular boiler, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-14\">\u201c In consideration that the said party of the second part has this day executed and delivered to the party of the first part its certain promissory notes aggregating the sum of nine thousand and eighty-three dollars; therefore, it is hereby understood and agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201c First. That the title and ownership of said goods and chattels so delivered and leased shall be and remain in said party of the first part until the promissory notes so as aforesaid executed and delivered by the party of the second part shall be fully paid according to their tenor and effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-4\">\u201c Second. That the said party of the second part shall have the right to retain possession of said goods and chattels, unless such right shall be forfeited by the default of said second party, as hereinafter specified, and to use the same at its own risk; and the said party shall keep said goods and chattels in good order and repair at its own expense, and shall have the privilege of acquiring the absolute title and ownership of said goods and chattels on the terms and conditions hereinafter expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\">\u201c Third. In the event that said party of the second part shall make default in the performance of any of its agreements herein or in the payment of said notes, or either of them, then said party of the first part may, at its option, terminate this agreement of lease by giving the said party of the second part five (5) days\u2019 notice in writing of its intention so to do. (It being understood that the sending of such notice through the United States mail, addressed to said party, shall be sufficient service of the same), and thereupon said party of the first part shall have the right to enter upon and into the premises of the party of the second part, wherever said goods and chattels may be, and repossess itself of said goods and chattels and hold the same discharged of all further liability hereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">\u201c Fourth. If said party of second part shall faithfully perform all of its agreements herein, and shall fully pay all said notes according to their tenor and effect, then when said notes shall be fully paid, whether due by their terms or after extension, the said party of the first part shall execute a bill of sale conveying all its rights, title and interest in and to said goods and chattels to said party of the second part, and thereupon all obligation of both said parties under this agreement shall terminate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">\u201c Fifth. All the obligations hereby entered into by said parties shall hold and be binding on their respective successors and assigns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">5.

In other words, there was no evidence that the contract of sale contemplated in exhibit \u201c A \u201d was abandoned, except that found by implication in the contract made at the time of settlement in September, as evidenced by exhibits \u201cC\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d Do these exhibits show that the parties intended to substitute a contract of bailment for Irire for a contract of sale originally contemplated? We think not. They rather show a purpose on the part of the Morgan-Gardner Electric Company to hold on to the title to the property to secure the payment, not of rent, but of the purchase money. In exhibit \u201c B \u201d the electric company expressly says that the notes received from the coal company \u25a0 by it' \u201c is in full settlement for the mining plant furnished by us for their Hackett mine under our contract dated May 11, 1896,\u201d etc., and it also says in this exhibit that \u201c it is understood that this plant is to remain our property until the.above mentioned notes are paid.\u201d Clearly exhibit \u201cB \u201d does not evidence an intention of the parties to change the contemplated contract of sale found in exhibit \u201c A \u201d to a contract of bailment, but on the contrary shows that notes were given in full settlement of the purchase price provided for in exhibit \u201c A,\u201d and only adds that the title to the property shall not pass until the notes are paid. A condition, it is true, was added to the contract of sale, but surely not such a one as to create a bailment. Now, let us examine exhibit \u201c C.\u201d The word <em>\u201c </em>lease \u201d is used in this agreement, but we take it that that throws no light on the character of the contract. If the delivery of the property was made under such circumstances as to show it was a conditional sale, calling it a lease will not make it a contract of bail- \u25a0 ment for hire or use. The \u201c whereas \u201d of the agreement connects it with exhibit \u201c B,\u201d and shows that the notes which were therein receipted for were included in the consideration of this agreement. The first paragraph reiterates what was stated in exhibit \u201c B \u201d; that is, that the title and ownership of said goods should remain in the electric company until the notes are fully paid. No evidence here of a bailment, but, on the contrary, of a conditional sale, the retention of title to secure the purchase money. The converse of this paragraph is that if the notes are fully paid the title and ownership of the goods and chattels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>shall be unconditionally in the coal company. The second and third paragraphs simply provide that the coal company can \u201c acquire absolute title and ownership of said goods and chattels \u201d by paying said notes, and that if it does not pay said notes and take care of the machinery until the time of payment comes the electric company can enter and repossess itself of the goods and chattels. What is this but a provision for the enforcement of the payment of the purchase money as in a conditional sale. Surely we find in these paragraphs no earmarks of a bailment. The fourth paragraph simply provides that if the coal company pays the notes according to their tenor and effect it will be entitled to have a bill of sale from the electric company. In other words, when it performs the conditions of the sale its conditional title becomes \u201c absolute \u201d and it will be entitled to a paper showing that fact. Nowhere in this agreement can w.e see the least evidence of a bailment except in the word \u201clease.\u201d While, on the other hand, a sale of the property on condition that the vendor retain the title as security for the payment of the purchase money is evidenced by every paragraph in the agreement and by exhibit \u201c B,\u201d and is good between the parties, but void as to the creditors of the parties having possession of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-3\">We have pointed out some of the affirmative reasons why we think this agreement evidences a conditional sale; let us now consider for a moment the negative evidence that it is not a bailment. As said by Mr. Justice Williams, in Stephens v. Gifford, 137 Pa. 219, \u201c it is of the essence of a contract of bailment that the articles bailed be returned, in its own or some altered form, to the bailor, so that he may have his own again.\u201d This contract makes no provision either expressly or by implication for the return of the property to the electric company. The contract, if carried out according to its provisions, leaves the property in the possession of the coal company, and the only provision for its return is in case of a failure of the coal company to make its payments. This provision was not put in the contract to insure the return of the property to the electric company, \u201c so that it might have its own again,\u201d but to insure the payment of the notes, so that the property might remain in the possession of the coal company as its own. It was a contract remedy to enforce payment, not of hire, but of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>purchase money. The case of Farquhar v. McAlevy, 142 Pa. 233, is very similar in its facts to the one at bar; there the court held the contract was a conditional sale and not a bailment, notwithstanding the parties called their agreement \u201c a lease \u201d and the money that passed between them \u201c hire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">We are clearly of the opinion that we erred in not giving the jury binding instruction to find for the defendant for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s title to the goods in question was under a contract of conditional sale and not a contract of bailment, and that this contract was void as to the creditors of the Boyle Bros. Coal Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">And now, January 27, 1899, judgment entered in favor of the defendants for the property described in the plaintiff\u2019s statement and the money realized from the sale of the same, on the questions of law reserved at the trial, non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-7\"><em>M.

Billington, 163 Pa. 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-9\">To constitute a bailment, neither payment for the use of the goods, nor a promise to return them, is essential: Enlow v.
