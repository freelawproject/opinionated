Stigers during his life, and to his heirs to the third generation the same use, then the property to be sold and divided equal among the heirs of Charles W. Stigers, .... the farm,\u201d etc. Notwithstanding the awkwardness of the wording the testator\u2019s intent is perfectly clear to give the farm to Charles and his heirs. No other beneficiary is mentioned, and it is plain that the omission is not accidental, but because the testator\u2019s intent did not contemplate that there should be room for any other. The devise is to Charles and his heirs, and after the third generation there is to be a distribution to his heirs. Whether the phrase \u201c then the property to be sold and divided equal \u201d means that the land is to be sold \u201c or \u201d divided, or that it be sold and the \u201cproceeds\u201d divided is not material. The intent was to give the rem in one form or the other to Charles and his heirs, and this carried a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The restriction to the third generation was merely an attempted restraint on alienation for that period. This is clear enough from the general tenor of the will, but the effort to continue the testator\u2019s control after his death is seen also in the direction that Charles \u201c is to farm the same as I have farmed,\u201d and among the personal property given, the blacksmith\u2019s tools are \u201c to be used in shop,\u201d and the old clock \u201c to stand where it now stands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The fact that the testator in terms gave only \u201c the use \u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the farm does not prevent the gift being a fee where that was his intent: Armstrong v. Michener, 160 Pa. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
