I felt the car give a jump, and then received three bells from the conductor, which is a signal to stop, and I did so without any difficulty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">There was some difference in the testimony as to the boy\u2019s position, some of the witnesses saying that the boy ran directly in front of the car, others saying that he ran into the side of the car, and fell down, and that his foot was crushed by being run over by the hind wheel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">Other facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">Defendant asked for binding instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">The court submitted the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-10\">Verdict and judgment for William T.

The actions were brought to recover damages for injuries to the boy, Alexander H. Thompson, while crossing the street at a public crossing. Several witnesses testified that when the boy started to cross the street he was but eight feet from the track and was in full view of the motorman on the car, and also that the car was then sixty-five to seventy feet distant from the crossing. The question of the negligence of the motorman in not stopping or slacking his car sufficiently to avoid a collision was necessarily submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiffs. There was no error in the charge and answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
