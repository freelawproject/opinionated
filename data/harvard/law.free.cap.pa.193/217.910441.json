In such a ease evidence as to defendant\u2019s presence in decedent\u2019s house and of threats which he made in decedent\u2019s lifetime to \u201cget even with him\u201d are insufficient to rebut the presumption that defendant\u2019s possession of the note was lawful.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b239-7\">Argued May 17, 1899.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APa\">Appeal, No. 133, Jan T., 1899, by plaintiff, from judgment of C.

Miller, Esq., one of his counsel, in whose possession it remained up to the time of the trial. In this he was corroborated by Mr. Miller, who testified that the defendant brought it to his office on May 12, four days after the death of the decedent. It was further shown that the note*was canceled after that date by the direction of the defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">Plaintiff proposed to prove by herself and others, first that defendant in the lifetime of Melchoir Helzer threatened that if he could get hold of anything that belonged to the old man, he would keep it, or words to that effect; and also to prove that on Friday morning shortly after the suicide of Mel-choir Helzer, the defendant was in the room in which the body lay, and in which the chest was, in which Melchoir Helzer\u2019s papers were kept, for a half hour or more; that on the Monday following he was also in the house, and that on the Tuesday following he made a complete search of the house from cellar to garret; for the purpose of showing the animus of the defendant towards his father and the expressed determination to keep what he might get of his, and to show the opportunity which he had for getting the note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-9\">This is offered in connection with the other evidence, of the loss of the instrument, and to show the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Objected to by Mr. Niles, of counsel for defendant, as not proper legal evidence for the purpose offered, or for any purpose for the plaintiff in this stage of the proof; that there being no proper legal evidence in the case of the cause of action, this evidence is irrelevant and immaterial; that the plaintiff having refused to offer in evidence the note in suit, proved by her witnesses to be such, which is here and in her power to offer, the evidence in regard thereto, or the possession thereof, is irrelevant and immaterial, misleading and improper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">The Court: I will overrule the offer as not evidence in chief. If evidence at all, it will be evidence in rebuttal, after note is offered by defendant, if that should be done. Exception for the plaintiff, and bill sealed by order of the court. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">Defendant offered in evidence paper marked \u201cA\u201d which was produced by him, and identified by the plaintiff\u2019s subscribing witness, C. F. Keech, as the note upon which this suit is brought; for the purpose of sustaining the issue on the part of the defendant, and showing the discharge of the indebtedness evidenced by that note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">Mr. Wanner, of counsel for plaintiff: The offer is objected to as inadmissible for the purpose stated, or for any purpose. The instrument offered has not been properly or sufficiently proved to be the one in suit; and it has been specifically proved that it contains material alterations to the prejudice of the plaintiff, and to the benefit and advantage of the defendant, which have been put upon it since it was delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and which, under all the evidence, appear to have been placed upon it while it was in the defendant\u2019s own possession ; that the evidence already admitted shows that the payee. in this note died on May 8, 1896, and the note itself did not fall due for a year from its date. The evidence also shows that no payment has been made to the administratrix of this note, nor has she delivered it to the defendant or any one else. The evidence does not disclose the fact that this paper to-day comes from the legal possession of the defendant, William P. Helzer, who is competent to prove the present possession; and it is therefore not admissible as a paper coming from him to raise any presumption of payment, or extinguishment of the debt in any form. Inadmissible for any purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">The Court: Do you offer more than the face of the note, Mr. Niles?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Mr. Niles: No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">Mr. Wanner: It is specially objected to tbe offering of the face of the note, because on the back of it is an indorsement prejudicial to the plaintiff, and which would necessarily go to the jury, if the face of it were offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">The Court: I will admit the offer of the face of the note. The indorsement on the back of it is not offered or admitted, and cannot he considered by the jury as evidence for the defendant. Exception for the plaintiff, and bill sealed by order of court. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">Mr. Niles proposed to prove by the witness on the stand, William A. Miller, Esq., that this note, \u201cA,\u201d was delivered to him by his client, William P. Helzer, some time shortly after the death of Melchoir Helzer, and that it has been in his possession ever since; that on or about May 12, William P. Helzer delivered to him this note, \u201cA,\u201d and that it has been in his, the witness\u2019s, possession up to the time of this trial, when he handed it to the defendant, who produced it in court; that it has been in the possession of the witness or of the defendant ever since; and, further, that shortly after the institution of this suit, and before the first trial, the witness, with the defendant, produced this note in Mr. Niles\u2019s office, and that upon the instruction of Mr. Miller and Mr. Niles, as his counsel, William P. Helzer ran his pen through the name, for the reason that he was instructed that he could not destroy the note, as it might be required for evidence, and that he should cancel his name, as it might be lost, or get out of his possession and he used against him; for the purpose of showing the possession of the note by the defendant as here produced, and the circumstances of the cancelation of the signature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">Objected to by Mr. Wanner as not the best evidence of possession, or proper evidence of possession, the defendant himself being in court, and a competent witness to prove possession at the time it was offered, and to prove possession by his counsel; and the offer as made does not establish legal possession on the part of William P. Helzer of that paper. Objected to as inadmissible for the purpose offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-10\">The Court: I will admit the offer and give the plaintiff an exception. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-11\">Mr. Niles: We offer to prove by the defendant that at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>time of his father\u2019s death he had in his possession at his house \u2014the witness\u2019s house\u2014this paper, \u201c A,\u201d and has had it continually in his possession, or in the possession of his counsel for him up to the present time; for the purpose of sustaining the issue on the part of the defendant, and showing that the obligation evidenced thereby is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">Objected to by Mr. Wanner as inadmissible for two reasons: first, because the witness is incompetent to testify to anything except what occurred immediately after and since his father\u2019s death; and, second, because the paper itself and the other evidence offered here by the defendant so far is not evidence of payment; it raises no presumption of payment, and this offer is therefore inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">The Court: The question is whether or not you can prove what occurred at the time of the death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-8\">Mr. Wanner: Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-9\">The Court: It certainly does not mean before. I will admit the offer. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-10\">Mr. Wanner proposed to prove by Ella Faust, the witness on the stand, that about the beginning of 1895, in a conversation with the witness, William Helzer made use of the following language, in the presence of the husband of the witness also. He said, \u201c Smalls had given a raise of a cent on a barrel; because his father did not give him the benefit of that cent right away, he was mad at his father, and said, \u2018 He won\u2019t make anything off me by being so damned' stingy, because,\u2019 he said, \u2018 many a crooked piece I could use, and many a cracked hoop I can put in a barrel; and, if it don\u2019t suit me, I will chop it up.\u2019 And he did say, \u2018 I will get even some day; \u2019 and he said, \u2018 Never mind, I will get my hands on him some day; and what I get my hands on it will be mine, then I will fool him,\u2019 or words to that effect; \u201d for the purpose of showing the animus of the defendant toward his father, and his intention to obtain and keep anything that he might be able to .get.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-11\">This is offered in rebuttal of the testimony of the defendant, which was offered to show payment and satisfaction of the note, and to show rightful legal possession of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-12\">Objected to by Mr. Niles as not proper legal evidence for the purposes offered, or any of them; that the purpose to show animus is an illegal one; and that the whole offer is too remote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and indefinite to be admissible, and is irrelevant, immaterial and misleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">Mr. Wanner: Plaintiff also offers to follow this testimony by evidence that the defendant on the day of his father\u2019s death, and on the second day following it, was on the premises in the room where the chest was kept in which Melchoir Helzer\u2019s papers were contained, and that on Tuesday following his death he made an extended search throughout the entire house; to show his opportunities for obtaining possession of this note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">Mr. Niles: The same objections are renewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">The Court: I will overrule this offer, and give the plaintiff an exception. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (3-7) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-10\"><em>Nevin M. Wanner, </em>with him <em>Eli Z. Strine, </em>for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANg\">That the defendant\u2019s possession of this note, acquired before its maturity, is not a good defense in this case is apparent from the following authorities: Eckert v. Cameron, 43 Pa. 120; Burbridge v. Manners, 3 Camp. 193; Mishler v. Reed, 76 Pa. 76; Patton\u2019s Admrs. v. Ash, 7 S. &amp; R. 116; McIntyre v. Kennedy, 29 Pa. 454; Weakly v. Bell, 9 Watts, 278; Gorgerat v. McCarty, 1 Yeates, 95-100; Connelly v. McKean, 64 Pa. 118; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 527.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-11\">The fourth assignment of error is based on objections to the admission of the note when it was offered in evidence by the defendant. It was defaced and materially altered by the cancelation of the maker\u2019s name and an indorsement on the back of it of the words, \u201c Given to me April 2,1896.\u201d The defendant has elicited the fact, under cross-examination of the subscribing witness, that these things were not on the note when it was delivered by the defendant to his father. It was admitted without explanation, though discredited by its condition, and by the testimony of the subscribing witness. This was manifest error under familiar rules of evidence: Hartley &amp; Co. v. Corboy, 150 Pa. 23; Gettysburg Nat. Bank v. Chisolm, 169 Pa. 564; Citizens Nat. Bank v. Williams, 174 Pa. 66; Roth\u2019s Est., 150 Pa. 261.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>H. C. Niles, </em>with him <em>W. A. Miller </em>and <em>George K Neff, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aza\">This action was clearly wrong. The exact situation supposed by Justice Mitchell in his opinion when this case was in this Court before had arisen. Parol evidence had been admitted on the supposition that it was the best attainable, and it subsequently had indubitably appeared that the higher grade of evidence was within the reach of the plaintiff. It was the duty of the court to strike out the secondary and compel the plaintiff to produce the original with all its legal effects, which was within her power, upon pain of entire failure of proof and the direction of a verdict against her: Malson v. Fry, 1 Watts, 433.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2_\">October 6, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ABQ\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">At the former trial a note was produced by the defendant, but plaintiff declined to accept it as the note sued on, and nothing further was done in the way of establishing that fact. We were therefore obliged to reverse the judgment, 187 Pa. 243. On the second trial the defendant not only produced the note again, but had it clearly identified on the cross-examination of the subscribing witness. The court therefore had before it the case of a narr. on a note assumed to be lost and evidence given of its contents, followed by the production of the note and its identification by plaintiff\u2019s own witness. The evidence previously received on the theory of loss should then have been struck out on defendant\u2019s motion, and plaintiff declining to offer the note, there was nothing before the court on which she could recover. The defendant himself, however, put the note in evidence, accompanied by testimony that it was in his possession at the time of his father\u2019s death and had been ever since. There was no evidence either of payment or nonpayment of the note, the plaintiff offering none and the defendant being rendered incompetent to testify by the death of the payee. We have the question, therefore, on the legal presumption alone, whether the payee can recover on a judgment note which is in the hands of the maker, with no explanation how it got there after delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Appellant argues that the circumstances are not sufficient to raise a presumption of payment, and cites a number of cases, beginning with Eckert v. Cameron, 43 Pa. 120. All of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cases, however, refer to commercial paper, and the rale is thus stated by Greenleaf: \u201c Where in the ordinary course of dealing, a security when paid is given up to the party who pays it, the possession of the security by the debtor after the date of payment is prima facie evidence that he has paid it. But the mere production of a bill of exchange from the custody of the acceptor affords no presumption that he has paid it, without proof that it was once in circulation after he accepted it:\u201d 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 527. Commercial paper, therefore, is the exceptional case, and the reason for it is found in Eckert v. Cameron, supra, where it was held that a note discounted for the maker before maturity, but after an indorsement, raised a presumption in favor of the holder, not that it had been paid by the maker and reissued, but rather that the indorsement was for Ms accommodation. Greenleaf in support of the text above quoted cites the ruling of Lord Elbenborough in Pfiel v. Vanbatenberg, 2 Camp. 439, and in Connelly v. McKean, 64 Pa. 113, Sharswood, J., commenting on that case, says, having proved that the bills were originally lent, \u201c Why should not the possession of them by the acceptor after maturity raise the presumption that he had paid them? With the highest respect for so great an authority upon nisi prius law, I may be allowed to express a doubt as to the sufficiency of the reason. Contrary to established principle it presumes a fraud to have been perpetrated, when the natural presumption is that which consists with honesty.\u201d This is the precise ground on which the learned judge below ruled the present case. Whether there was a legal presumption of payment it was not necessary for him or for us to consider. What he held was that there could be no presumption from the bare fact of possession that it was unlawful, and therefore without some further evidence the plaintiff could not recover. In this he was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The evidence as to defendant\u2019s presence in his father\u2019s house, and also that offered as to his threats in his father\u2019s lifetime \u201c to get even with him,\u201d etc., amounted to no more than a basis for suspicion in an unfriendly mind that defendant had wrongfully taken the note out of his father\u2019s room after death. The learned judge rightly held that it fell short of the proof necessary to permit the jury to find such wrongful taking as a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The note was properly admitted in evidence. The cancelation of the signature was fully explained by disinterested testimony, and the writing on the back was not admitted. Had the case gone to the jury it would have been proper to cover the back of the note so as effectually to conceal the writing, or to have submitted to them a verified copy in place of the original with the objectionable indorsements. But as the judge directed the verdict on the absence of evidence on which the jury could properly find for plaintiff there was no error in admitting the face of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
