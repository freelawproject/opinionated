J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">By this appeal plaintiff challenges the propriety of an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s suit. The dismissal followed the court\u2019s refusal to permit plaintiff, after his alleged cause of action had been barred by the applicable section of - the statute of limitations <em>(N. J. S. </em>2A:l-L-2), to amend the complaint by inserting the name of \u201cEconomy Brake Service, a partnership,\u201d in place of the name \u201cEconomy Brake Service, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of New Jersey.\u201d The corporation (the correct name of which was Economy Brake Service) had been dissolved prior to March 28, 1960, the date plaintiff instituted his suit. In fact, the corporation had been dissolved by unanimous consent of the stockholders prior to the time when plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action arose on April 8, 1958. .Plaintiff\u2019s reason for initially denominating Economy Brake Service as a corporation is not disclosed by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">By said suit plaintiff sought recovery of damages for personal injuries resulting from an automobile collision occurring on said last mentioned date. Plaintiff alleged that said accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligent inspection and repair of a motor vehicle owned by one Wasserman and operated by plaintiff at the time of the accident. The complaint charged that defendant \u201cwas engaged in the business of auto repairs and more particularly in the installation service and repair of automotive brake and braking parts and devices,\u201d and that its alleged negligent inspection and repair of the motor vehicle\u2019s braking equipment, performed a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>days prior to the date of the aforesaid accident, was the proximate cause thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s action was based on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the aforesaid partnership entity had not been legally served with process; had not properly been denominated as the defendant in the complaint; and that, as the two-year statutory period within which plaintiff\u2019s action might be instituted had expired long before the application to amend the complaint had been made, the action was no longer maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The sheriff\u2019s return showed service of the summons and complaint on March 31, 1960 upon \u201cEconomy Brake Service Incorporated * * * at its usual place of business 225 Elizabeth Ave., Newark, N. J.\u201d by serving \u201cMeyer Bromberg, partner.\u201d Although it was conceded that the corporation had been dissolved by unanimous consent of its stockholders on August 20, 1957, an answer was filed on behalf of \u201cEconomy Brake Service, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of New Jersey, of 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark, New Jersey.\u201d Such answer was not filed until May 20, 1960 as a result of a written stipulation dated April 19, 1960, extending the time. The stipulation was entered into between the attorneys for plaintiff and the attorneys for defendant describing themselves therein as attorneys for \u201cEconomy Brake Service.\u201d The answer denied the allegations of negligence contained in the complaint, set .forth certain affirmative defenses, but made no mention of the fact that the corporation had been dissolved in 1957. That information was disclosed to plaintiff on September 28, 1961 during the course of a deposition by Mr. Bromberg. The deposition was taken pursuant to a written notice given by plaintiff requiring the attendance for that purpose of the \u201cGeneral manager or person in charge of the brake repair service of said corporation on April 8, 1958.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The record before us reveals that following the dissolution of the corporation by action of its stockholders the same type of business had been continued at the same address, 225 Elizabeth Avenue. Newark, New Jersey, and under the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>name \u201cEconomy Brake Service\u201d by a partnership formed by Bromberg and one Allen Cross, two of the three former stockholders of the dissolved corporation. The third stockholder, one Prank Barton, wais described in Bromberg\u2019s deposition as \u201cInactive at all times. Just a silent stockholder.\u201d It was conceded that the partnership was conducting a \u201cmotor vehicle brake business, with related services,\u201d at the above address at the time when the allegedly defective work was performed, as well as when the accident occurred, and also at the time of the service of the summons and complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">At the pretrial conference held October d, 1961, the court granted plaintiff\u2019s application to amend his complaint \u201cto assert the correct name of the defendant\u201d Economy Brake Service, a partnership. The aforesaid action of the trial court was reflected in paragraph 6 of the pretrial order as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201c6. The plaintiff seeks to- amend his complaint to assert the correct name of the defendant from Economy Brake Service Inc. to Economy Brake Service, process having been made on Economy Brake Service, Inc.; services [sic] was effectuated upon one Meyer Bromberg, and the sheriff indicates -that said Meyer Bromberg was a partner. The amendment is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">The defendant is given leave to file such appropriate motions as is felt are applicable to the Amendment for the change of name of this defendant. This also applies to Economy Brake Service, a partnership. It is also represented -that the attorneys for defendant <em>Economy </em>Brake Service, Inc. do not appear for Economy Brake Service, a partnership, and that the ruling of the Court to amend the name of the defendant is over objection. Bight is also reserved to Economy Brake Service, a partnership, to object to the Court\u2019s order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The pretrial order also contained plaintiff\u2019s -allegations as to the circumstances surrounding the happening of the aforesaid accident, and plaintiff\u2019s assertion that due to the defective work of the defendant the vehicle he was operating on the public highway \u201cwas caused to veer suddenly into the opposite lane of traffic\u201d and the ensuing accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The pretrial order, in addition to expressing defendant\u2019s denial of any claim of negligence and setting forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>separate defenses to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, specifically asserted that the defendant corporation had been dissolved as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Under date of November 29, 1961 defendant applied to the court for an order, returnable December 8, 1961, \u201cto amend paragraph 6 of the Pretrial Order, heretofore entered on October 4, 1961, which paragraph substituted Economy Brake Service, a partnership, for the defendant Economy Brake Service, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of New Jersey.\u201d The trial court resowed decision on the motion and under date of January 16, 1962 rendered an opinion which, after reciting the aforesaid amendment and the action at the pretrial conference, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cIt further appears from the briefs, and from the arguments of counsel, that the first opportunity that the plaintiff had to discover that Economy Brake Service was not a corporation was on September 28, 1961 when depositions were taken. It appears from the pleadings and the briefs of counsel that Economy Brake Service, a Corporation, did not exist at the time of the filing of the action, or even at the time when the institution of the action commenced, to wit, April 8, 3958, and that prior to 1958, to wit, in 1957, Economy Brake Service, a Corporation, was changed to a Partnership known as Economy Brake Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">The basic question before the Court is whether the plaintiff can at this time defeat the vested rights of the defendant in the bar of the Statute of Limitations by substituting the name of a partnership for the name of a Corporation. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The court\u2019s opinion then noted that the \u201cpresent suit was instituted approximately one week before the right of the cause of action would have been barred by the Statute of Limitations\u201d and concluded its opinion with the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cInasmuch as the amendment would [a]ffeet the substantial and vested rights of the defendant the motion to substitute Economy Brake Service, a Partnership for the named defendant, Economy Brake Service Incorporated, is denied, the court feeling that it is bound by the decisions cited in this opinion to deny the amendment since it would have the effect of bringing in a new party after the Statute of Limitations had tolled, rather than merely correcting the name of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In accordance with, the trial court\u2019s conclusions the aforesaid order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint was entered on February 16, 1962. The present appeal followed. The challenged order, after reciting the appearances for the respective parties, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">\u201c* * * and appearing that the complaint originally filed in this action having denominated Economy Brake Service, Inc., a corporation, as the defendant, and it appearing that process in this action was served upon one Meyer Bromberg, the Sheriff\u2019s return indicating that process was served on \u2018Meyer Bromberg, partner,\u2019 and it appearing that on October 4, 1961, on motion of the plaintiff and over the defendant\u2019s objection, the pretrial order, in paragraph \u20186\u2019 thereof, amended the complaint so as \u2018to assert the correct name of the defendant from Economy Brake Service, Inc. to Economy Brake Service,\u2019 and the defendant having reserved the right to move for reconsideration of said amendment, and having now moved to amend said paragraph \u20186\u2019 of the pretrial order by deleting said amendment, and the Court having considered the pleadings, the briefs and arguments of counsel, and the Court having concluded that the defendant\u2019s motion should be granted because the statute of limitations had then run for the addition or substitution of new parties, as more fully set forth in the Court\u2019s letter opinion dated January 16, 1962, which letter opinion is hereby incorporated by reference, and it further appearing that the granting of said motion is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as against Economy Brake Service, a partnership, and good cause appearing,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">It is, on the 16th day of February, 1962,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that paragraph \u20186\u2019 of the pretrial order is amended so as to delete any reference to Economy Brake Service, a partnership, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the action be dismissed as against Economy Brake Service, a partnership, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUx\">Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that there being no just reason for delay, the foregoing judgment be entered as a final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">We turn to the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201c[I]n order to facilitate the determination\u201d of the legal issue projected bjr the appeal the parties* by their respective attorneys, on May 24* 1962 filed a written stipulation in this court. The stipulation recited that it was made \u201conly for purposes of appeal and without any concession as to the relevancy or admissibility of the matters contained therein.\u201d The stipulation presented the following agreed statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201c.1. The firm of Mead, Gleeson, Hansen &amp; Pantages represents the defendant, Economy Brake Service, in the above action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">2. Prior to the arising of the cause of action set forth in the complaint, there had been a corporation of the State of New Jersey known as \u2018Economy Brake Service,\u2019 which was dissolved by action of the stockholders on August 20, 1957.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">3. Economy Brake Service, a corporation, operated a motor vehicle brake business, with related services at 225 Elizabeth Avenue (Milford Avenue), Newark, New Jersey, and also owned real property, commonly designated as 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">4. The stockholders of said corporation were Allen Cross, Frank Barton and Meyer Bromberg, who were respectively the president, vice-president and secretary-treasurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">5. After dissolution of the corporation, Allen Cross and Meyer Bromberg formed a partnership, of which Frank Barton was not a part, and the partnership was engaged in the motor vehicle brake business and related lines at 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark, New Jersey, and this partnership was doing business under the name of Economy Brake Service in April 1958.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">6. The real property owned by the corporation at 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark, New Jersey, was conveyed by the corporation to Meyer Bromberg and Allen Cross on July 9, 1957, and by them to 225 Elizabeth Ave. Corp., a corporation of the State of New Jersey on September 3, 1957.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">7. The Hardware Mutual Insurance Company is the liability insurance carrier who forwarded the matter to the attorneys for the defendant. The insured under their policy at the time of the accident is described as \u2018Allen Cross &amp; Meyer Bromberg D/B/A Economy Brake Service Co., 225 Milford Ave., Newark, N. J.\u2019 An inspection of the files of the Hardware Mutual Insurance Company discloses no record of insurance of a corporation named \u2018Economy Brake Service\u2019 at the time of the accident or prior thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">It is further stipulated on the same terms and conditions as stated above, that the plaintiff may file the following affidavit of Thomas J. Murphy, Special Deputy Sheriff, dated March 20, 1962. The defendant does not dispute the statements contained therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The aforesaid affidavit by Mr. Murphy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">\u201c1. I am a Special Deputy Sheriff and was a Special Deputy Sheriff on March 31, 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">2. On March 31, 1960, I made service in the above-entitled action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">3. On March 31, 1960 I proceeded to 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark, New Jersey where the Economy Brake Service had its place of business and was then directed to one Meyer Bromberg as the owner or boss of this establishment. I identified myself and stated my purpose and then inquired of him as to his relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>to the firm in question. He responded by stating that he was a partner, and I thereupon made service upon him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">4. My personal records of service indicate exactly the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeS\">\u2018Economy Brake Service</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A77\">225 Elizabeth Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeW\">Served</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Meyer Bromberg, partner.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">My return to the court indicates service on Meyer Bromberg, as a partner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The trial court, relying on <em>Coventry v. Barrington, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>217 <em>(E. A. </em>1936); <em>Markey v. Robt. Hall Clothes of Paterson, </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>417 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1953), and <em>Eskon v. Four Star Realty Co., </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>202 <em>(Law Div. </em>1961), held, as above noted, that permitting the amendment requested by plaintiff would \u201chave the effect of bringing in a new party after the Statute of Limitations had tolled, rather than merely correcting the name of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Respondent, supporting the trial court\u2019s action, relies upon the above-cited decisions, among others. It contends, as expressed in its brief, that \u201cif a verdict and judgment were obtained against the original defendant, execution could be had against the corporation, but no levy or execution could be made on the partnership. If the amendment is allowed, the assets of a totally different entity can be taken.\u201d It adds: \u201c[I]n the instant case the improper party was named in the complaint, served and responded. * * * The corporation had been dissolved before the plaintiff instituted suit and the situation was readily ascertainable by the plaintiff through the Secretary of State.\u201d It further contends that the sheriff\u2019s return, dated March 31, 1960, should have put the plaintiff on notice that the corporation was the wrong defendant, with sufficient time for the plaintiff to amend. Asserting that neither it (Economy Brake Service) nor its attorneys \u201cmisled the plaintiff as to the identity of the defendant,\u201d the latter contends that although the trial court initially permitted the aforesaid amendment, its subsequent reversal of such action was warranted and its final judgment dismissing the suit against Economy Brake Service, a partnership, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>justified. As heretofore noted, defendant\u2019s right to challenge the aforesaid amendment of the complaint at the pretrial conference on October 4, 1961 was reserved at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In resolving this appeal, we preliminarily deem it appropriate to refer to certain general legal principles applicable to the resolution of the problem posed. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">(1) 'Where a defendant is brought into an action for the first time upon the filing of an amended or supplemental complaint, the filing of such additional pleading constitutes the commencement of the action in so far as such new defendant is concerned. If at that time the action is barred by the statute of limitations, a party thus brought in may plead the statute in bar of his alleged liability. '</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">(2) The correct designation of a defendant may be accomplished by amendment after the period defined by the statute of limitations has elapsed in certain instances, including those in which the amendment merely corrects a defect in the original proceeding or if the effect of the amendment is simply corrective of the name under which the proper party, already sued, is in court. <em>Schnitzer &amp; Wild-stein, </em>2 <em>N. J. Rules Serv. </em>A IV-403 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">(3) In many jurisdictions \u201cthe question whether an amendment which makes an addition to, change in, or substitution of, parties relates back to the commencement of the action or proceeding so far as the operation of the statute of limitations is concerned is one dependent to a great extent upon the provisions of the statutes relating thereto, which statutes differ to a marked degree in scope, contents, and language.\u201d Annotation, \u201cChange in party after statute of limitations has run,\u201d 8 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>6, 13 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">In resolving an issue of the type here presented (whether the proposed amendment of process or pleading or both involves the correction of a mere misnomer or the substitution of a new party), it is essential that the facts of each case be scrutinized and assessed with care, because no general rule may properly be deemed controlling in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>As heretofore noted, the trial court as well as respondent on this appeal relied heavily on the <em>Markey, Eslcon </em>and <em>Coventry </em>cases, <em>supra. </em>However, there exist in the case at bar certain important factors which we deem control the resolution of the issue here presented. We hereinafter discuss those controlling factors in detail but, preliminarily, certain factual differences between the instant case and the cited cases are to be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Although this court is not bound, by the County Court\u2019s decision in <em>Markey </em>and it is not to be considered that we are in accord therewith, it is noted that the trial judge in that case (in holding that after \u201cthe statute of limitations * * * had tolled\u201d an amendment substituting one corporation for another would not be authorized) placed emphasis, <em>inter alia, </em>on the difference in the names of the corporations involved. 27 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>421. In contrast, however, in the case at bar the partnership and the former corporation had the same name, Economy Brake Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In <em>Eskon </em>the opinion states (71 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>205) that \u201cWilliam Loeffler the party upon whom service of the summons was made, is in no way associated with the partnership Tour Star Realty Company,\u2019 \u201d the defendant against whom plaintiff\u2019s claim of injury was intended to be asserted. In the matter under review, Bromberg, at the time of the performance of the allegedly defective repair work and at the time of the service of the summons and complaint on him, was one of the two partners comprising the partnership, Economy Brake Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In <em>Coventry </em>service was attempted to be made upon a nonexistent corporation by serving one Benjamin Hadelberg, denominated in the sheriff\u2019s return as \u201cregistered agent\u201d for the corporation. Hot only was the corporation then nonexistent but, as a matter of fact, contrary to the situation in the case at bar, it never existed. The court noted (117 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>218) that Hadelberg could not be \u201ca registered agent\u201d for a principal which had \u201cno legal being.\u201d In the cited case plaintiff\u2019s application to amend the pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>and process, after the running of the statute of limitations, sought to substitute named individuals, Nadelberg and one Albert Eieliman, trading as a partnership, in place of the \u201ccorporation.\u201d Mr. Chief Justice Brogan, writing the opinion for the court, found no error in the trial court\u2019s holding that the effect of such an amendment \u201cwould be to add a new party after the statute of limitations had run.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the instant case the proposed amendment designated the partnership by its name, Economy Brake Service, and did not name the individual partners as defendants. It is significant to note that at the time of the decision in <em>Coventry </em>(1936) a partnership was not suable in the firm name but only in the respective names of its individual members. <em>X-L Liquors v. Taylor, 17 N. J. </em>444, 454-458 (1955). That restriction did not obtain under the practice existing at the time of the application to amend in the case at bar. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In summary, the following factors (although varying in their importance and significance in our assessment of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment) have a direct bearing on the issue projected by this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">1. Bromberg, the member of the partnership served with the summons and complaint, was, by such service, accomplished prior to the running of the statute of limitations, toiade aware (a) of plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he had been injured; (b) that plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries had been proximately caused by allegedly defective repair work performed on the Wasserman automobile which was driven by plaintiff on April 8, 1958; and (c) that the criticized work was performed during the \u201cfirst week of April, 1958,\u201d a period when, to the knowledge of Bromberg, the partnership of which he was a member was the operator of the auto repair shop under the partnership name of Economy Brake Service at 225 Elizabeth Avenue, Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">2. The error made in the complaint and process was simply in the descriptive designation of the entity with which Bromberg\u2019s relationship existed on April 8, 1958. The business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the partnership and that of the former corporation was the same and was conducted under the same name and at the same location.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">3. The situation in the instant case is totally dissimilar from those in which a new party is sought to be named by amendment after the running of the statute. Here the right person was served; he (Bromberg) knew that such service was made within the statutory period; he had correctly informed the deputy sheriff that he was a \u201cpartner\u201d in Economy Brake Service, and a reading of the complaint demonstrated that the allegedly negligent work was performed during the partnership operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">4. Bromberg forwarded the summons and complaint to the partnership\u2019s insurance carrier which, in turn, transmitted the documents to its attorneys. As noted, the latter, on behalf of Economy Brake Service, executed the aforesaid stipulation extending the time to file answer and thereafter filed answer on behalf of the \u201ccorporation.\u201d Still later the law firm appeared at the pretrial conference on 'October 4, 1961 on behalf of the \u201ccorporation,\u201d specifically noting in the subsequently executed pretrial order that the firm did \u201cnot appear for Economy Brake Service, a partnership.\u201d However, it is recorded in paragraph 6 of that order that \u201cthe ruling of the Court to amend the name of the defendant is over objection,\u201d and the right was therein \u201creserved to Economy Brake Service, a partnership, to object to the Court\u2019s order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We note that the entry into the aforesaid written stipulation, between attorneys, filed on this appeal was made \u201cwithout any concession as to the relevancy or admissibility of the matters contained therein.\u201d We emphasize the attorneys\u2019 reservation at this point simply to record the fact that we deem irrelevant (a) that the Hardware Mutual Insurance Company was the public liability insurance carrier for the partnership, the policy describing the assured as \u201cAll[e]n Cross and Meyer Bromberg D/B/A Economy Brake Service Co. * * and (b) that the said insurance company\u2019s files \u201cdisclose no record of insurance of a corporation named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>'Economy Brake Service\u2019 at the time of the accident or prior thereto.\u201d Although we consider immaterial the existence or nonexistence of liability insurance as to the partnership and former corporation respectively, we deem it of some significance that Bromberg promptly forwarded the summons and complaint to the partnership\u2019s liability insurance carrier. That act demonstrates the partnership\u2019s recognition (through the medium of its partner Bromberg) that <em>it </em>was the defendant against whom relief was sought. <em>li </em>had notice of the nature of plaintiff\u2019s claim and clearly was not misled by the misdescription in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We hold that the aforesaid amendment should have been allowed as there is not the slightest doubt that plaintiff intended to assert his claim against the operator of the business at the site in question; that the partnership was such operator; that the real party in interest was the entity operating the business under the trade identification \u201cEconomy Brake Service\u201d; and that its member (Bromberg) was served within the statutory period and became aware of plaintiff\u2019s claim within that period. Service on Bromberg, a partner, constituted legal service on the partnership entity <em>(B. R. </em>4:4\u20144(e)) named in the proposed amendment. Those factors, in our opinion, are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Under all of the circumstances revealed by the record before us we consider that plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment was in essence the correction of a misnomer only. The subject matter of plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action should be resolved on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The aforesaid summary judgment is reversed and the ease remanded to the Law Division for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b247-8\">Sullivan, J.

I am in complete agreement with the conclusion of my brethren that the partnership was in court as a defendant from the commencement of suit, and that plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment sought to do no more than correct a misnomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>As pointed out in the majority opinion, when the <em>Coventry </em>case was decided, a partnership could only be sued by naming the individual' partners as defendants. The failure to name the individual partners in the original suit was the basis on which <em>Coventry </em>turned. This is no longer the law in this State and was not the law when the instant suit was commenced. A partnership may now be sued in the partnership name. Therefore, <em>Coventry </em>is not to be followed in the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">I concur in the reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
