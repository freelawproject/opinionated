J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9h\">By this appeal plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the \u201ccharitable immunity statute\u201d <em>(N. J. 8. </em>2A:53A-7 to 10), contending that, to the extent that its provisions \u201crelate to religious organizations,\u201d it contravenes \u201cthe religious freedom provision\u201d of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and certain paragraphs of <em>Article </em>I of the <em>New Jersey Constitution </em>(1947). They also assert that the 'aforesaid statutory provisions violate \u201cthe equal protection, due process, and privileges and immunities doctrines of the Federal and New Jersey Constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions were rejected by the Law Division, which granted defendant\u2019s motion for a summary judgment in an action instituted by plaintiffs for the recovery of damages for injuries sustained on April 1, 1961 by Mrs. Makar, a parishioner of defendant. Her husband sued <em>per quod. </em>The complaint charged that \u201cdue to defendant\u2019s negligence\u201d Mrs. Makar was \u201ccaused to fall\u201d on the steps of its church while she was \u201cat the church for prayer and for the purpose of having her Easter basket blessed in accordance with the church tenets and pursuant to her religious beliefs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">Defendant\u2019s answer, in addition to asserting its freedom from negligence, alleged as a separate defense that defendant at \u201cthe time of the alleged accident, was a non-profit corporation, organized exclusively for religious purposes and as such is immune from actions for negligence.\u201d Plaintiffs moved to strike the pleaded immunity defense, assigning the following grounds therefor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-8\">\u201c[S]uch defense is insufficient in law in that said defense is not available to defendant under the common law in New Jersey, and that the statutes upon which said defense must therefore depend <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:53A-7, 8, <em>9 </em>and 10) are in contravention of the TJ. S. Constitution, 1st and 14th amendments, as they relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>establishment of religion, equal protection, due process, and privileges or immunities, and also exceeding the police power of the state; and in contravention of the <em>N. J. Constitution </em>(1947) <em>Art. </em>1, <em>par </em>1, 3, 4, 5, 20, and 21; and <em>Art. </em>4, <em>Sect. </em>VII, <em>par </em>9, as it relates to equal protection, and the granting of exclusive privileges and immunities; and also as exceeding the police power of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The trial court, noting that by plaintiffs\u2019 aforesaid motion the constitutionality of the statutory provisions was \u201cdrawn in question\u201d <em>(B. B. </em>4:37-2), ordered that the Attorney General be notified thereof and that he be served with copies of the complaint, answer and motion to strike the aforesaid \u201cimmunitjr\u201d defense, to the end that if he desired to intervene in the action he might do so within the time defined in the order. The order further provided that, in default of such intervention, \u201cthe action shall proceed between the parties as though no intervention [had] been authorized.\u201d The Attorney General did not intervene and took no part in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Defendant countered with a motion for summary judgment in its favor \u201con the ground that the action set forth in the said Complaint is barred\u201d by the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A :53A-7. In support thereof defendant\u2019s pastor submitted an affidavit that the church had been \u201cincorporated as a nonprofit corporation, organized exclusively for religious purposes on the 30th day of September, 1910\u201d and was operating as such on \u201cthe date of the alleged accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The statutory provision <em>(N. J. 8. </em>2A:53A-7), on which defendant relies, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">\u201cNo nonprofit corporation, society or association organized exclusively for religious, charitable, educational or hospital purposes shall, except as is hereinafter set forth, be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation, society or association, where such person is a beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works of such nonprofit corporation, society or association; provided, however, that such immunity from liability shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of such corporation, society, or association or of its agents or servants where such person is one unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tions of such corporation, society or association; but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to exempt the said agent or servant individually from their liability for any such negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike the aforesaid separate defense pleaded by defendant and, as stated, granted defendant\u2019s cross-motion for a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">In resolving this appeal we find it unnecessary to discuss in detail the numerous reasons, as well as the extensive legal and historical arguments, advanced by plaintiffs in contending that the Federal and New Jersey Constitutions are violated by the sections of the \u201ccharitable immunity statute\u201d here challenged. They include assertions that the statute in question</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">(a) is violative of the constitutional prohibition against legislation respecting the \u201cestablishment of religion\u201d because of the \u201cState\u2019s gift [of no liability] to the church organization\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-8\">(b) contravenes the \u201c \u2018free exercise\u2019 clause of the 1st amendment\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-9\">(c) in denying \u201cplaintiffs a civil remedy, * * * exceeds the police power since the freedom of worship exercised by plaintiff Anna Makar does not bring her into conflict with rights asserted by others\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-10\">(d) deprives \u201cplaintiff, Anna Makar, * * * of a civil remedy because she was in church for prayer,\u201d thereby relegating her \u201cto an inferior status because she exercised her precious right of religious freedom.\u201d (In this connection plaintiffs emphasize that \u201cif Mrs. Makar had been injured in a similar fall\u201d suffered in a \u201csupermarket, theatre, etc., she would have a cause of action,\u201d and that consequently if under the circumstances here existing she is required to \u201cforego compensation,\u201d she is being required \u201cto make an unreasonable contribution to the church against her will and this forced contribution violates her individual freedom of religion.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-12\">Plaintiffs further urge that, not only are the challenged statutory provisions \u201cunconstitutional on their face,\u201d but are also unconstitutional \u201cas construed and applied in this case and in the case of <em>Anasiewicz v. Sacred Heart Church,\u2019\u2019 </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>532 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962), certif. den. 38 <em>N. J. </em>305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(1962), \u201cbecause they classify a -worshipper as a \u2018beneficiary to whatever degree.\u2019\u201d Plaintiffs state that \u201cby reason of this classification the statutes deny a religious worshipper a common civil remedy and thereby violate the \u2018free exercise\u2019 clause of the 1st amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">In rejecting appellants\u2019 aforesaid contentions, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-5\">\u201cX cannot conceive that immunity from suit granted to a church could possibly constitute an interference with the free practice of religion by a person who attends that church, nor do I find that the legislation granting this immunity is a law respecting the establishment of religion, in contravention of the provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">We are iu complete accord with that observation. (In passing, it is to be noted that in the opinion for this court in <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>Judge Foley, emphasizing that the \u201c[c]onstruction of the statute [the court was there dealing with the predecessor statute <em>(L. </em>1958, c. 131)] necessarily requires a determination of the purposes it was designed to serve,\u201d expressed those purposes in detail, at <em>pp. </em>535-538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The trial court found no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 aforesaid further contention that the statute in question violated the \u201cequal protection, due process, and privileges and immunities doctrines of the Eederal and New Jersey Constitutions.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel cites no case in this jurisdiction (and our research fails to disclose any) dealing with the foregoing contention. A similar attack on a comparable statute, however, has recently been rejected by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in <em>Fournier v. Miriam Hospital, </em>175 <em>A. 2d </em>298 (1961), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s contention that <em>art. </em>XIV, \u00a7 1, of amendments to the federal constitution renders the immunity statute invalid is likewise without merit. Her argument is that the statute is a denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>due process and constitutes discrimination in violation of the equal privilege and protection clauses. This court in In the Matter of Nichols, <em>supra, </em>8 <em>R. I. </em>50, at <em>page </em>54, observed that, \u2018Although, in a free government, every man is entitled to an adequate legal remedy for every injury done to him, yet the form and extent of it is necessarily subject to the legislative power * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">Nor is an act of the legislature adopted pursuant to its power to declare public policy in violation of <em>art. </em>XIY of the amendments, if the act in question is neither capricious nor arbitrary in the sense that it does not discriminate between persons, groups or corporations falling within the same classification. See <em>Doherty v. Town Council, </em>61 <em>R. I. </em>248, 200 <em>A. </em>964.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>301)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">It is to be noted that the statutory \"verbiage\" here challenged (as noted in <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>535) \"closely parallels\u201d the language of the cases in which the immunity rule was formerly enunciated by our courts. See, <em>e. g., Lindroth v. Christ Hospital, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>588 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The earlier judicial recognition of the immunity doctrine was overturned in <em>Collopy v. Newark Eye and Ear Infirmary, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>29 (1958). In doing so, Mr. Justice Jacobs, writing for the majority (at <em>p. </em>36), quoted the following pertinent statement from <em>Haynes v. Presbyterian Hospital Ass\u2019n., </em>241 <em>Iowa </em>1269, 45 <em>N. W. 2d </em>151, 154 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-8\">\u201cThe law\u2019s emphasis generally is on liability, rather than immunity, for wrongdoing. Charity is generally no defense. It is for the legislature, not the courts, to create and grant immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">and added (at <em>p. </em>41):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-10\">\u201cThere is no doubt that within constitutional limits the Legislature may at any time, if it so chooses, explicitly fix the State\u2019s policy as to the immunity of charitable institutions from tort responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-11\"><em>Cf. Egan v. Erie R. Co., </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>243, 252 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">As noted in <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>535, the impact of <em>Collopy </em>upon the tort liability of charitable institutions \u201cled to the enactment of <em>L. </em>1958, <em>c. </em>131,\u201d the forerunner of the statute now under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s above-quoted pronouncement that the creation \u00bfnd granting of charitable immunity is within the province of the Legislature, we perceive no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s action in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The summary judgment in favor of defendant is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
