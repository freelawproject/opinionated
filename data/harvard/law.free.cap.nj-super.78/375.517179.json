J. <em>A. </em>D.</author>\n<p id=\"AU8\">Pursuant to leave to appeal granted by this court <em>(B. B. </em>2:2-3), plaintiffs seek the reversal of an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, setting aside jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>verdicts in favor of plaintiffs and granting \u201cdefendant\u2019s application for a new trial as to all issues.\u201d The verdicts, as returned by the jury, were in the sum of $30,000 in favor of Joseph Pisano, Jr., a minor, and in the amount of $3,000 for his parents, Joseph Pisano, Sr. and Ann Pisano, who sued <em>per quod. </em>The verdicts were based on injuries, suffered by the minor on March 25, 1959, while he was on an escalator descending from the second floor to the first floor in defendant\u2019s store. At the time of the accident the infant plaintiff, then five years of age, was accompanied by his father and by a younger brother Robert. It was conceded that they occupied the status of invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Plaintiffs contended that as the father and the children were riding on the descending escalator, the father held each child by the hand, Robert occupying the escalator step in front of him and Joseph occupying the one immediately behind his father, the latter holding Joseph\u2019s right hand and Robert\u2019s left hand. Plaintiffs contended that the descending escalator, as it neared the first floor level, gave such \u201ca violent jerk\u201d as to cause Joseph\u2019s hand to slip from his father\u2019s grasp, the boy fell to the moving escalator steps, his left hand was \u201ccaught\u201d in the space between the moving step and the stationary comb plate at the foot of the escalator and was severely mangled before the escalator could be stopped and his hand released. (The record does not disclose who turned the electric switch which caused the escalator to cease operation following the accident.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The appeal focuses attention on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s aforesaid action, which defendant primarily seeks to sustain on the authority of <em>Hartpence v. Grouleff, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>545 (1954). Plaintiffs in the instant case contend that the trial court\u2019s challenged order, setting aside both verdicts and directing that a new. trial be had as to all issues <em>(R. R. </em>4:61-1 (a)), was so clearly without factual and legal support as to constitute an abuse of its \u201clegal discretion\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as stated in <em>Kavanaugh v. </em>Quigley, 63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>153, 157-158 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960). The basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>issue for resolution by us is whether the action of the trial court was such as to constitute \u201ca denial of justice under the law\u201d (Hartpence, 15 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>548).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In resolving this appeal we have considered and shall later comment on the content and pertinence of the opinions rendered in <em>Kulbacki v. Sobchinsky, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>435 (1962), decided since the argument of the appeal in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">To properly assess the merits of this appeal it is necessary to detail the proofs which were presented by the respective parties, as defendant contends that justification for the court\u2019s action in setting aside the verdicts and granting a new trial as to all issues is not limited to the reason assigned by the trial judge, to which hereinafter we specifically allude. Defendant not only asserts that errors were committed by the trial court in its charge to the jury warranting the reversal of the verdicts but urges that the proofs afford no justification for a finding that defendant was guilty of negligence proximately causing the injuries suffered by the minor plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We turn to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Plaintiff Joseph Pisano, Sr. testified that during the aforesaid descent from the second to the first floor of defendant\u2019s store the escalator\u2019s movement was \u201crickety\u201d; that it \u201cmade different types of noises going down, a shaky, rickety ride.\u201d He described the escalator as \u201cold\u201d and contrasted it with other escalators, which he and the children had used immediately prior thereto in descending from the fourth floor of defendant\u2019s store, and which, he said, operated \u201cmore evenly\u201d and \u201csmoother.\u201d Amplifying his description of the accident, the father characterized the \u201cviolent jerk\u201d as a \u201cforward-backward movement.\u201d He stated that it occurred as they approached the \u201cbase of the steps\u201d and was so' severe as to make \u201cme lose the balance of Joseph\u2019s hand, knocked him loose from me, and Joseph fell to the floor.\u201d His left hand \u201cgot caught between the plate and the steps.\u201d The father added that the boy\u2019s hand was caught up to \u201cthe knuckles\u201d; that he tried to \u201chold the rest\u201d of the boy\u2019s \u201chand back,\u201d but \u201cthe steps kept coming at him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Two women who were standing behind plaintiffs on the escalator witnessed the accident. One of them described the moving escalator as \u201crickety\u201d and operating with \u201ca juggling motion.\u201d She testified that just prior to the accident she observed Mr. Pisano and the two children standing on the escalator steps; that the father was holding each child by the hand; that she saw the boy Joseph \u201close his balance\u201d and fall; that he \u201cput his hand down to get himself up\u201d and \u201chis hand just went into the bottom of the escalator.\u201d She stated that as \u201chis hand was pulled in he was in a prone position.\u201d She testified that she was unable to state \u201cat what moment [the boy] lost his balance,\u201d but that \u201che seemed to put his hand down quick, and in seconds his hand was in.\u201d A sister of the aforesaid witness, who was standing behind her on the descending escalator, testified that she, too, saw the child \u201close his balance\u201d and fall. She said that his hand \u201cinstantly was caught in the grooves.\u201d She stated that the escalator was \u201cjerky\u201d and that she \u201cexperienced a side to side motion, a jerking feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Both of the aforesaid witnesses testified with reference to the extent of the space between the comb plate and the escalator step, the first stating that it was \u201cpossibly three-quarters of an inch wide.\u201d She described the space where the boy\u2019s hand had entered and was caught as \u201cjust about big enough for my hand to possibly go in, but a little boy\u2019s, it just ripped it right through.\u201d The second witness testified that at the place where the boy\u2019s hand \u201cwas caught in the grooves\u201d there \u201cwere very wide spaces * \u25a0 * * which immediately caught\u201d the boy\u2019s hand. His father, she said, tried to \u201cextricate the hand, but it kept being caught because the escalator was in motion constantly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Photographs of the escalator showing the physical location of the comb plate in its relationship to the escalator steps, were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">A consulting engineer, Isaac Stewart (specializing in \u201caccident and material failure evaluation\u201d and who had made \u201ca detailed study of escalator construction\u201d and had examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the escalator in question), testified as an expert witness on behalf of plaintiffs. Responding to a hypothetical question, which included a resume of the aforesaid testimony, Mr. Stewart testified on direct examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201cIt is my opinion that the escalator was not operating properly, to permit the jolt you mentioned, to permit the side sway and the rickety operation, and furthermore, to permit the hand to become lodged between the comb plate and the cleats of the steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Such conditions result from the flattening of the wheels that the steps ride upon; result from, in addition to that, the wearing of the <em>rails\u2014both of whleh are the main controlling element for the position of the steps in relation to the comb plate. </em>The fact that the escalator moved sideways, as you indicated, indicates to me that there was excessive play in the locating of the wheels upon which the steps rode * * *. The rickety, uneven operation results from worn wheels on the step and the track. * * * The jerk condition that you mentioned develops due to extensive usage without complete maintenance, and in some instances results from electrical problems.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The witness gave the following further testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cQ. In an escalator that is properly maintained and kept in good operating condition, do you have a situation where there would he enough space between the last step and the comb plate for a child\u2019s hand to be caught? * * * A. No, sir, there would not be enough space.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">He answered affirmatively an inquiry as to whether, if the space at the place in question were such that the \u201cinfant\u2019s finger got caught, that alone would tell you that the escalator was not operating properly.\u201d On further interrogation he emphasized that if a \u201cchild\u2019s finger gets caught\u201d in the indicated area, it means that the escalator is \u201cnot running properly, because of excessive clearance between the comb plate parts and the step tread\u201d; that such a happening would indicate that the escalator was not running \u201cwith the proper clearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Mr. Stewart further testified that at the time of the happening of the accident in question the \u201cstandard for the space between the edge of the comb plate and the bottom or the rim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>or valley on the step as it passes underneath the comb plate\u201d was \u201cone-eighth of an inch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The medical proofs showed that the injuries suffered by the Pisano boy in the aforesaid accident consisted of a \u201ctraumatic amputation of the left first and second fingers and a severely compound, comminuted fracture, of the middle phalanx of the third finger,\u201d resulting in \u201ca deformity\u201d of that digit.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On behalf of defendant one John M. Smith, an elevator and escalator inspector of the City of Newark, testified that, accompanied by a maintenance employee of defendant, he had made his annual inspection of the escalators in defendant\u2019s store the day before the aforesaid accident. He described the inspection as \u201croutine.\u201d He said that the escalator was then \u201crunning all right\u201d; that it was \u201crunning smoothly.\u201d He testified that during the course of the inspection he rode on the escalator and looked it over. He examined the \u201ccomb plate\u201d at the floor level, during the course of which examination defendant\u2019s mechanic, the witness said, \u201cwas showing me the comb plate, where he had put some rubber plugs, and I was asking him what\u2019s the plugs for, and he told me, \u2018That\u2019s just an added protection we take.\u2019 * * * \u2018I make the rubber plugs for that.\u2019\u201d The witness added: \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily part of the escalator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Harry Gebhardt, an electrician .employed by defendant and its predecessor-operator of the store for over 30 years, testified that his job was to do the electrical work and minor repairs on the elevators and escalators in the store; that he oiled and greased \u201cevery escalator every week,\u201d and rode on them every day to determine whether \u201cthere\u2019s any jerk or anything.\u201d He added: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t ride smooth or there\u2019s a bump, you can hear a bump * * * whether there\u2019s something wrong, whether its running unusual.\u201d He testified that he rode the escalator in question on the morning of March 35, 1959 and that it seemed \u201call right\u201d to him. He acknowledged that at the time of the accident the escalator in question was \u201ctwenty-two years old.\u201d He added that two of the ten escalators in the store were ten years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Timothy Hefferson, who was a maintenance employee of defendant and Gebhardt\u2019s assistant, checked the escalators on Mondays when Gebhardt had a day off and also, in connection with his general work, rode on the escalators on other days of the week. He testified that the escalator ran smoothly on March 23, the Monday preceding the date of the accident, and also that he did not notice any jolting, jerking or unevenness of operation before or after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">James E. \"Whillis, a safety engineer, testified that because of the accident he inspected the exterior of the escalator \u201con behalf of the defendant\u201d on March 26, the day following the accident. He said that he found \u201cthat it was operating in a normal and smooth manner.\u201d He made the inspection and the ensuing report of the results thereof jointly with another engineer (Mr. Langel) and because of its cumulative nature it was stipulated that Mr. Langel\u2019s testimony, if given, would be the same as that of Mr. \"Whillis.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">William C. Holmes, who had been store manager of defendant for a few months preceding November 29, 1961, the commencement of the trial, and prior to that had been defendants personnel director, testified that he rode the escalators several times each day and that between March 25, 1959 and April 13, 1959 (the date when an expert examined them on behalf of defendant) there were no \u201cphysical changes\u201d made in the escalators. He specifically stated that on March 25 the escalator in question was \u201crunning smoothly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Henry Clifford, a safety engineer, whose staff included the aforesaid witnesses Whillis and Langel, testified that he examined the escalator and measured various parts of it on April 13, 1959. He testified that he found that the escalator was \u201cproperly\u201d maintained. He testified that violent jerking would immediate^ allow the tension frame or slack chain switch to operate and would stop the escalator. On cross-examination he conceded that if the action of the escalator was as described by plaintiff and his witnesses, the escalator \u201cwould be defective,\u201d and that his explanation of the aforesaid stoppage of the escalator in the event of \u201ca violent jerk\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>or \u201cjump\u201d was predicated on the assumption that the stoppage mechanism was in \u201cgood working order\u201d on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Under cross-examination Mr. Clifford testified that he was of the opinion that an escalator was \u201cproperly maintained\u201d even though the space at the comb plate was such that a child\u2019s hand could \u201cget caught\u201d therein. He said \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t have their hand on an escalator tread.\u201d He amplified this viewpoint under, examination by defendant\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cQ. Explain why. A. Eor the simple reason a child\u2019s finger is compressible. The tread is moving against an immovable object and would be drawn in. ' If it had contact with the movable part, which would be the valley of the tread, which enters in underneath the finger or the tines of the comb plate, and it would be drawn in such a way that it couldn\u2019t be pulled out due to the fact that the friction of the tread of the escalator would constantly tend to pull the finger in and the child trying to pull the finger out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Q. Mr. Clifford, whether it was a child\u2019s finger that could be depressed to the size of the % space or the 3/16 space that you mentioned. A. Xes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">Q. Or if I may be so bold as to say the tip end of a lady\u2019s heel that would be that small or the tip end of an umbrella or a pencil or a pit, it would still get caught in the space, wouldn\u2019t it, because of the fact that the size is there and it just would get in there? Isn\u2019t that so? A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Q. And that doesn\u2019t take away from the effectiveness of the operation of the escalator, does it? A. No, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">One Diane Beacher, a customer of defendant, testified that she was in the store on March 25 and, after the accident happened, she heard one of the two sisters who testified for plaintiff as aforesaid (she was unable to state whether it was Mrs. Sehwester or Mrs. Kavanagh) talking about the accident. The witness stated that she heard the speaker remark to another woman (also unidentified) that \u201cshe was standing behind the boy when the accident occurred, and that she heard his father say to him, \u2018Take your hands off the step.\u2019 \u201d (Both Mrs. Sehwester and Mrs. Kavanagh had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>previously denied, under cross-examination by defendant\u2019s attorney, that they had made any such remark to anyone.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">One Joyce Long, a customer of defendant, testified that on the afternoon of March 25, as she was riding on the \u201cup\u201d escalator from the first to the second floor of the store she saw the Pisano boy \u201csitting on the floor\u201d of the escalator. On cross-examination she stated that as she was riding on the \u201cup\u201d escalator she did not see the boy \u201cwhen he passed me\u201d: that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see him going down the escalator\u201d and that when she saw him he was \u201con the foot of the escalator; * * * at the bottom.\u201d She said she saw the boy\u2019s hand \u201cget caught\u201d and on redirect examination she answered affirmatively a question as to whether she saw \u201cthe boy sitting on the escalator before his hand got caught.\u201d (Mrs. Schwester had previously denied under cross-examination by defendant\u2019s attorney that the boy had sat on the step of the descending escalator, and Mrs. Kavanagh had specifically stated that the father and the boys were \u201calmost to the foot of the escalator\u201d when she saw \u201cthe boy lose his balance\u201d and \u201cput his hand behind him\u201d and \u201cinstantly was caught on the grooves.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In assessing the propriety of the action of the trial judge, setting aside the aforesaid verdicts of $30,000 and $3,000 returned by the jury and granting a new trial as to all issues,'our attention is primarily directed to the sole reason which he assigned therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">During the trial the attorneys for the respective parties stipulated that if the jury determined that the parents of the injured minor were entitled to a verdict, the amount thereof should be $028.25, the sum shown by the unchallenged proofs to have been expended by them for medical, surgical and hospital services rendered on behalf of the minor. The trial court charged the jury in conformity with that stipulation. The jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>parents was initially stated to be $1,500 in favor of each parent. The trial court molded it into a joint verdict of $3,000 in favor of the adult plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Thereafter defendant moved (a) to set aside the verdicts and grant a new trial as to all issues, or, in the alternative, (b) for an order, pursuant to <em>B. B. </em>4:51-2, for the entry of a judgment in favor of defendant \u201cnotwithstanding said verdicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The trial judge dealt initially with the alternative motion and, in denying it, stated that the case was one for jury resolution and that he found no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that its motion for a judgment of dismissal made at the end of the entire case should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">However, in voiding the entire verdict, the trial court assigned the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201cNow, the only completely simple thing that anyone should understand\u2014even the young child involved I think would understand it\u2014 it was stated more than once that all the parents sought was one lump sum and it was to cover two items; and I not only sent out the sheet, but I read it in explanation to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">The sheet approved by both attorneys read: \u2018On the claim of the plaintiffs Joseph Pisano, Sr., and Ann Pisano, individually, these plaintiffs have put in testimony that they paid or incurred the following bills as a result of injuries suffered by their son Joseph Pisano, Jr.: hospital bill $278.25, doctor\u2019s bill $650, total $928.25.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">I said in charging what they are entitled to recover, that they are only entitled to recover and they only seek to recover monies expended or incurred, stating again the two amounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">I do not know of any stronger evidence that you can have of a jury either disregarding a very, very simple part of the charge, a part in which\u2014I cannot understand how there could be any misunderstanding about it; and if a jury either failed to understand such a simple part of the charge or, on the other hand, if it understood it but disregarded it, I don\u2019t see how the verdicts can stand on liability or on damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Finding such an obvious either disregard of the Court\u2019s charge in a very simple matter or, if not disregard, failure to comprehend or understand, the certainly could not comprehend <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>or even the other charge on the negligence part, in my opinion; and if it was not failure to comprehend, it shows a disregard which certainly must be said to taint not only the verdict that is obviously opposite to the charge of the Court, but in my opinion there is nothing this Court can do, because the Court does not believe substantial justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>will be accomplished by supporting the findings of the jury on other phases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Ill assessing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s aforesaid challenged order we note this court\u2019s limited scope of review as expressed in <em>Kulbacki v. Sobchinsky, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>446, reaffirming the principle pronounced in <em>Hartpence v. Grouleff, supra, </em>15 <em>N. J., at pp. </em>548-549. See also <em>Gallichio v. Gumina, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>442, 447 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>Ruth v. Fenchel, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>295, 304-305 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), affirmed 21 <em>N. J. </em>171, 173, 60 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>71 (1956); <em>Dahle v. Goodheer, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>210, 220-221 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), certification denied 20 <em>N. J. </em>534 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is of equal importance however to recognize that, if within the limitations of such review, it \u201cclearly and unequivocally appears\u201d that the action of the trial court constituted \u201ca manifest denial of justice under the law,\u201d it is our duty to reverse that action. <em>Hartpence, supra, </em>15 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>549. We observed in <em>Dahle v. Goodheer, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>221, that we consider the rule enunciated in <em>Hager v. Weber, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>201, 210 (1951) as \u201cstill possessing viability and pertinence\u201d and \u201cwe view <em>Hartpence </em>as supplementing the <em>Hager </em>rule and as lending emphasis to the considerations which must attend our review of the action of a trial judge * *</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Although in some instances, where we are called upon to review the action of the trial judge in a situation comparable to the one here presented, his opinion throws \u201clittle light upon the basic and operative reasons which motivated him in granting a full new trial\u201d <em>(Dahle, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>220), no such obscurity exists in the instant case. The trial judge assigned a single unequivocal reason for his action. We have quoted it above in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">There is no doubt that if the jury determined that the parents were entitled to a verdict against defendant, the amount thereof should have been $928.25. Plaintiffs, citing the nature and the \u201cpermanency of the injury suffered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the infant plaintiff,\u201d- seek to justify the $3,000 award because of the probability of some resultant loss of services, even though there was an \u201cabsence of proof as to the nature of the services lost\u201d or the \u201cextent\u201d thereof, or \u201ceven in the absence of testimony-that there probably would be some loss. They cite <em>Simmel v. New Jersey Coop Co., </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1958), and <em>Mathias v. Luke, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>241 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), but in neither of the cited cases was there a limiting stipulation such as existed in the case at bar. In fact, with the consent of both counsel, the trial court in the instant case submitted in written form to the jury the various possible verdicts which it might return, including one for the parents in the sum of $928.25. Purthermore, it charged the jury (without any challenge by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel) that a verdict, if rendered in favor of the parents, should be limited to that amount. Under such circumstances the fact that a claim for alleged loss of services was asserted in the complaint, or that such loss might be inferable from the nature of the injury, is of no moment. The stipulated limitation at trial, and the reliance of the court and counsel thereon, precluded any variance therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">However, we are convinced that the trial judge erred in ascribing to the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the parents the devastating and destructive implications he voiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Although the area in which this Division may exercise its appellate review is sharply circumscribed, <em>Kulbacki, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>446, its supervisory power exists and is to be utilized in an appropriate case, <em>Ibid, </em>at <em>pp. </em>451-2. The vitality of that, power was specifically emphasized in the dissenting opinion in <em>Kulbacki, </em>at <em>p. </em>462.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u25a0 Initially assaying the trial court\u2019s challenged action solely on the basis of an examination of the single foundation on which, as aforesaid, it was rested by that court, we determine that it \u201cclearly and unequivocally appears\u201d that the sweeping order under scrutiny was wholly unjustified and \u201cconstituted a manifest denial of justice under the law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Cf. Dahle v. Goodheer, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. 221; Randazzo v. Bacque, 37 N. J. Super. </em>548, 550 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), and <em>Gallichio v. Gumina, supra, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>441. In rejecting as -unsound the alleged effect of the single reason advanced by the trial court as the foundation for its complete reversal of the jury\u2019s action, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court by an evaluation of \u201cthe evidence in a light that would justify the jury verdict,\u201d a procedure rejected in <em>Hartpence v. Groulef, supra, </em>15 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>549. No such evaluation of evidence is here involved. The trial court made no finding that the $30,000 verdict in favor of the minor was excessive. It made no adjudication that the proofs referable to defendant\u2019s liability would not support the verdict on that phase of the case. It simply labeled the $3,000 verdict as the product of defiance or ignorance because of its excessiveness and, having so reasoned, concluded that such defiance or ignorance must have dominated and controlled the jury\u2019s entire deliberation and its ultimate determination in all areas entrusted to it for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The aforesaid motion for a new trial was grounded in the contention that the verdicts were (1) \u201cexcessive,\u201d (2) \u201cagainst the weight of evidence,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe result of mistake, passion, bias and prejudice.\u201d The trial court, seizing upon the excessiveness of the verdict in favor of the parents, and finding that such verdict in the sum of $3,000 was the result of the jury\u2019s \u201cdisregard\u201d of or \u201cfailure to comprehend\u201d the court\u2019s charge, held that such award automatically tainted the entire verdict. While specifically eschewing a finding that the jury was actuated by \u201csympathy\u201d in the rendition of its verdict, the trial court noted that such an element was unavoidably present in a case of this type and expressed the belief that substantial justice would not be accomplished by \u201csupporting the findings of the jury on other phases.\u201d We disagree. The jury\u2019s erroneous action was neither so clearly taken in willful disregard of the court\u2019s charge nor was it so evidently the product of stupidity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>as to justify either characterization by the trial court. Equally unwarranted was the conclusion that it polluted the entire verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Defendant relies on <em>Kress v. City of Newark, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>562 (1952), and <em>Purpura v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>475 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), certification denied 29 <em>N. J. </em>278 (1959), as supportive of its contention that the \"jury\u2019s grossly unjust award to the plaintiff-parents\u201d tainted the entire proceedings. Neither of the cited cases is pertinent to the circumstances revealed by the record in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In <em>Kress </em>the Supreme Court not only found that a verdict of $90,000 in favor of plaintiff was \"unquestionably excessive,\u201d but stated that the amount thereof \"clearly and convincingly\u201d indicated that it was the \"result of passion or prejudice aroused by the mysterious and dreaded connotation that the term cancer implies to the average layman, which undoubtedly led to sheer speculation b3r the jury.\u201d 8 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>576. ETo comparable basic analysis entered into the conclusion of the trial court in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In <em>Purpura, supra, </em>we held (53 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>478), that in cases where a jury verdict is challenged as being \"too high\u201d the trial court is called upon to consider \"whether the verdict is so excessive in amount as to show that the jury was so moved by passion or prejudice that its verdict as to liability must be equally tainted.\u201d In the case at bar no such situation is revealed. Defendant asserts in its brief that \"an error in excess of $2,000 on an agreed amount of damages totaling $928.25 clearly shows that the jury fwas moved by passion or prejudice\u2019 and therefore the verdict as to liability was equally tainted.\u201d It adds: \u201cThis was the direct holding of the trial judge herein.\u201d We perceive no such adjudication in the foregoing quoted pronouncement of the trial court. Moreover, we do not agree, as defendant also contends, that the trial coart\u2019s \u201cholding\u201d was <em>\"equivalent </em>to a finding that the verdict was either the result of passion or mistake.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>We next consider the first of the additional reasons advanced by defendant for affirmance of the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Defendant asserts that although it made no objection to that portion of the court\u2019s charge concerning the relation of the issue of proximate cause to the facts of the case, an examination of the charge reveals its deficiency in that regard. Amplifying that contention, defendant states that it \u201chad a right to expect a proper charge on so basic an issue\u201d and that \u201cfailure to properly charge (although no objection was taken) was plain error which would have justified reversal of the judgment below, if defendant was the aggrieved party herein.\u201d Our analysis of the court\u2019s charge convinces us that defendant\u2019s criticism thereof is unwarranted. Defendant cites <em>Kreis v. Owens, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>148 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), and <em>Barr v. Francks, </em>70 <em>N. J. Super. </em>565 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), in support of its contention. They are clearly distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In <em>Kreis </em>the trial court\u2019s charge merely incorporated reference to proximate cause with no attempt at adequate definition thereof and without explaining the definition in relation to the facts. Moreover, in <em>Kreis, </em>potential liability involved more than one party, rendering a complete elucidation of the words of vital importance. Despite that fact, the court in <em>Kreis </em>ignored defense counsel\u2019s request to amplify its charge in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In <em>Barr, </em>also, multiple defendants were involved. We noted (70 N. <em>J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>570) that the trial judge, after defining \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cproximate cause,\u201d failed to \u201cinstruct the jury that to find liability it must determine that the negligence of either or both defendants was the proximate cause of the collision.\u201d We specifically noted (at <em>p. </em>570) that the \u201cfunction of the doctrine of proximate cause as a limitation upon legal liability for effects traceable to the defendant was never touched upon, let alone explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>* * * even after defense counsel had protested the deficiency in the charge.\u201d In <em>Barr </em>(at <em>p. </em>570), as well as in <em>Kreis </em>(38 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>155), \u201cthe factual setting of the ease made the problem of causation of great importance.\u201d In <em>Kreis </em>we stressed (at p. 155) not only must each case \u201cbe considered on its own facts\u201d but, under the circumstances there present, when the attention of the court was called to the deficiency in the charge, it should have \u201cproceeded to define and explain proximate cause.\u201d In the instant case we find that the trial court\u2019s instruction with reference to the proximate cause was adequate under the circumstances. It correctly defined \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cproximate cause\u201d; emphasized that \u201cthe mere happening of the accident * * * without considering the question of fault\u201d would not justify the rendition of \u201ca verdict in favor of any plaintiff * *' * against the defendant\u201d; and, with reference to the sole defendant involved, stated in explicit terms that in order for plaintiffs to recover they had the burden of proving \u201cby the greater weight of the evidence\u201d that \u201cdefendant was negligent\u201d and that its \u201cnegligence was a proximate cause of this accident.\u201d We observe that not only did defendant\u2019s counsel at trial register no objection to the foregoing phase of the court\u2019s charge but he made no mention of it whatever in his motion to set aside the verdicts. We find the contention, advanced for the first time before us in support of the trial court\u2019s action in setting aside the verdicts, to be devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Defendant also seeks to support the trial court\u2019s order, setting aside the verdicts and directing a new trial as to all issues, on another ground not mentioned by the court in justification for its action. Defendant contends that the court\u2019s reference to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in its charge to the jury was erroneous since that doctrine, defendant asserts, had no application to the factual situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>existing in the case at bar. In support of its contention defendant advances several reasons to which we next direct our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Defendant asserts in its brief that (1) the \u201capplication of the rule embodied in the maxim <em>[res ipsa, </em>loquitur] * * * requires that the proofs show that there was no indication in the circumstances that the injury was the result of the plaintiff\u2019s own voluntary act or neglect,\u201d and that element, defendant states, was \u201clacking in the case <em>sub judice\u201d; </em>and (2) \u201cthe inherent nature of the escalator being what it is,\u201d a key requirement necessary for the invocation of the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur \u201ci. e., </em>the occurrence itself ordinarily bespeaks negligence,\u201d was \u201cnot met herein, at least insofar as that rule was applied to the total situation presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In support of its first above-mentioned point defendant states in its brief that its \u201cproofs indicate the contrary situation, <em>i. e., </em>the infant plaintiff sitting on the steps of the escalator as it was moving down to the first floor.\u201d It then adds: \u201ceven though the child\u2019s negligence is not available as a defense because of his ago, nevertheless, this fact should be available for the purpose of precluding reliance on the <em>res ipsa </em>[loquitur] doctrine.\u201d Apart from the fact that it is questionable whether the testimony in the record supports defendant\u2019s aforesaid version of the proofs, no authority for the proposition here advanced is cited by defendant. The trial judge specifically rejected such proposition. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">With reference to the second point above urged, defendant initially takes the position that it is apparent from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Overby v. Union Laundry Co., </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>100, 107-8 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed 14 <em>N. J. </em>526 (1954), that plaintiffs in the instant case \u201cshould not be permitted to rely on the procedural device of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>since one of the basic elements is lacking.\u201d Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>argues that iu <em>Overby </em>it was stated that the \u201chazards\u201d of an escalator\u2019s \u201cuse have become generally known,\u201d indicating (states defendant) an acceptance of \u201cthe commonly known hazards inherent in escalators as the norm against which to compare other activities.\u201d From this, defendant categorically urges that it is clear that when an escalator accident happens, \u201cthe occurrence itself <em>does not </em>ordinarily bespeak negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Defendant\u2019s premise affords no support for such conclusion. Certainly no such blanket statement with reference to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>can be applied to escalator operation and to untoward or unusual occurrences in connection therewith. As was said in <em>Lorenc v. Chemirad Corp., </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>56, 70 (1962), <em>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur * * * </em>is simply an emanation of the basic legal doctrine that a verdict in a negligence case may rest on circumstantial evidence.\u201d Its utilization results in presenting the issue for determination \u201cin terms of permissible inferences of negligence from the facts proved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Stressing that the application of the principle of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>at the trial of cases \u201cmust be engaged in with regard for the nature of its impact on the facts,\u201d the court (at <em>p. </em>71) added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201cWhere the facts of a particular situation warrant its invocation, an inference of negligence may be drawn; it is not compelled. The facts are said to provide circumstantial evidence of negligence to be weighed, but not necessarily to be accepted as sufficient; they afford a basis for an inference of want of due care which the jury may, but need not, draw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In passing, we note that in a supplemental brief defendant stated that \u201cit is clear that the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not apply to escalator cases in Uew Jersey <em>unless there is proof of a factual aberration from the normal operation of the </em>escalator.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) In the instant case, however, plaintiffs presented proofs, as above set forth, from which the jury could have found that such \u201caberration\u201d was present in the operation of the escalator in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tion. The quality and significance of such evidence were for jury assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Our examination of the court\u2019s charge to the jury in the ease at bar shows that the court fully analyzed the issue of negligence and also made specific reference to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and correctly delineated the principles controlling its invocation, substantially as set forth in <em>Lorenc v. Chemirad Corp., supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>70-71. We have no doubt that the trial court was justified in holding that the principle inherent in the maxim was available to plaintiffs on the proofs which we have hereinbefore set forth in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We further note that in the absence of \u201cevidence\u201d showing \u201cthe precise cause of the accident\u201d <em>(Cassady v. Old Colony St. Ry. Co., </em>184 <em>Mass. </em>156, 68 N. <em>E. </em>10, at <em>p. </em>12, 63 <em>L. R. A. </em>285 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1903); <em>Cleary v. Camden, </em>118 N. <em>J. L. </em>215, 219 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed 119 N. <em>J. L. </em>387 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1937); <em>Shaw v. Calgon, Inc., </em>35 N. <em>J. Super. </em>319, 326 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955)), \u201callegations of specific acts of negligence in pleadings or pretrial orders, or efforts to prove such acts at trial, do not preclude reliance upon <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>where the facts warrant its application.\u201d <em>Lorenc, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>62. In this connection the following statement in <em>Reiter v. Max Marx Color &amp; Chemical Co., </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>37, 41 (1961) is equally pertinent in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201cOn these facts in our view an inference of want of due care in the maintenance of the ladder can be drawn by a jury whether the legal issue is dealt with in terms of inference of negligence or as one where the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In concluding its foregoing contention, defendant states that \u201cassuming <em>arguendo\u201d </em>the aforesaid rule might properly be invoked by the trial court, error was committed by that tribunal in failing \u201cto properly relate the <em>res ipsa </em>[loquitur] rule * * * to the evidence of the \u2018violent jerk\u2019 as opposed to the bare fact of the accident and the infant plaintiff being enmeshed in the comb plate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>A fair reading of the court\u2019s charge to the jury on the subject of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>demonstrates that implicit therein is the fact that the judge was referring to the actual escalator operation and plaintiffs\u2019 aforesaid proofs of the unusual occurrence during the escalator\u2019s descent to the ground floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Defendant citing our decision in <em>Dombrowska v. Kresge-Newark, Inc., 75 N. J. Super. 271 (App. Div. </em>1962), states in its brief that the cited case \u201cis on all fours with that at bar and completely supports the action of the trial court below.\u201d Not so. Apart .from our statement in <em>Dombrowsha </em>that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>had no applicability to the evidence there adduced (at <em>pp. </em>274r-275), to which statement we shall presently allude, the wide variance of the proofs in the respective cases demonstrates the inaccuracy of defendant\u2019s assertion that our decision in <em>Dombrowsha </em>compels a decision in its favor on the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Dombrowsha </em>no charge of negligence stemmed from the alleged existence of an unduly large space between the moving escalator steps and the comb plate at the floor level (as claimed in the instant case). In contrast with the case at bar, where detailed expert testimony presented on behalf of plaintiffs supported their charge that the unusual operation of the escalator bespoke its malfunction and also accounted for the aforesaid unduly enlarged opening at the comb plate site, no such proof of malfunction was presented in <em>Dombrowsha.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">In the latter case we affirmed the trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment of dismissal following the court\u2019s reservation of decision on defendant\u2019s motion therefor pursuant to <em>B. B. </em>4:51-2(a). The trial court found no evidence from which a legitimate inference of defendant\u2019s negligence could be drawn in favor of plaintiff. We agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Moreover, although in <em>Dombrowsha </em>there had been only oblique reference to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>considered that factor also in resolving the appeal. We concluded that the proofs contained no basis for invoking that doctrine becattse the escalator\u2019s operation therein described, on which operation plaintiff\u2019s claim was based, was not such as in \u201citself ordinarily bespeaks negligence.\u201d We emphasized that the only evidence descriptive of the happening of the accident was plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that as she was riding on a descending escalator she felt \u201ca jerk and a vibration of some sort,\u201d to which she ascribed her fall. In affirming the trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment of dismissal we held that any operating escalator of necessity \u201cinvolves motion\u201d and that a \u201cjerk\u201d or \u201cvibration\u201d of such instrumentality while in operation, <em>\u201cabsent some evidence that such jerk or vibration was unusual \u201d </em>was not \u201cproof of malfunction.\u201d (At <em>p. </em>274, emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">By way of additional contrast, in the case at bar plaintiffs\u2019 aforesaid proofs were that the violent jerk and unusual movement of the escalator on which the Pisanos were riding were of such severity as to cause the Pisano boy to \u201close his balance,\u201d break from the grasp of his father\u2019s hand and fall to the level of the escalator step where his hand was drawn into the open space at the comb plate. That contrast between the evidence of the escalator\u2019s movement in <em>Dombrowska, </em>described simply as \u201ca jerk and a vibration of some sort,\u201d and the escalator\u2019s violent jerk and unusual movements revealed by plaintiffs\u2019 proofs in the instant case, together with the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert that such movements demonstrated malfunction, shows the fallacy of defendant\u2019s contention that the cases were factually the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Defendant next asserts the existence of further trial error, which, it contends, was sufficiently prejudicial to support the court\u2019s aforesaid action directing a new trial as to all issues. The situation to which defendant alludes stemmed from the fact that during the trial testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>behalf of plaintiffs and defendant was presented as to whether at the time of the happening of the accident the first floor of defendant\u2019s store was \u201ccrowded,\u201d particularly in the area of the first floor escalator; also whether the customers were sufficiently numerous in that area to require that a guard be in attendance at the escalator in question. Defendant\u2019s proofs described the store\u2019s policy that guards were assigned at the escalators when in the judgment of management the customers were present in sufficient numbers to warrant such precaution, a condition which defendant alleged <em>did not </em>exist at the time of the accident in question. At the close of the case defendant\u2019s counsel (out of the presence of the jury) moved that the aforesaid proofs be stricken as irrelevant to the issue of proximate cause. The court agreed with defendant\u2019s contention and ruled that the absence of guards would \u201cnot be a factor\u201d in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">On the completion of the argument of the aforesaid motion and of a subsequent motion by defendant for dismissal of the case, the jury returned to the courtroom. The record before us contains no evidence that the court advised the jury of its aforesaid ruling, and its omission to do so was not called to its attention by counsel. The summations by counsel and the court\u2019s charge followed. On appeal the statement of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to us that no reference to the aforesaid testimon3r was made b3r either attorney during the respective summations is not challenged by defendant\u2019s counsel. <em>No </em>requested charge with reference to the proofs in question was submitted; the court made no allusion whatever to the subject in its charge; and no issue referable thereto was presented to the jury for resolution. Defendant\u2019s notice of motion for a new trial contained no mention thereof, but during the argument of the motion defendant\u2019s counsel alluded to the subject. In granting the motion the court did not assign its aforesaid omission as an error justifying its action setting aside the verdicts. Moreover, on appeal defendant, in its initial brief and in a subsequent brief filed before oral argument, made no reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>matter whatever. During the course o\u00ed the oral argument before us defendant\u2019s counsel sought to revive the point as an additional basis for sustaining the trial court\u2019s action in setting aside the verdicts. Prom our examination of the entire record we are persuaded that the court\u2019s omission was not prejudicial and did not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and that defendant\u2019s belated move to claim the existence of prejudicial error is unwarranted. <em>11. R. </em>4:63-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Defendant finally argues that plaintiffs failed to sustain their allegation of negligence by their failure to prove that it had notice of any alleged defect in the escalator operation. Whether the alleged defects in the escalator were of such a nature that defendant should have had constructive notice thereof was a factual question and was specifically submitted to the jury under an appropriate charge by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The challenged order of the trial court is reversed. The verdict in favor of Joseph Pisano, Sr. and Ann Pisano, in view of the aforesaid stipulation, is to be reduced to $928.25 and entered in that sum. The verdict in favor of Joseph Pisano, Jr., an infant, by his guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Joseph Pisano, Sr., is reinstated in the sum of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The case is remanded to the trial court for entry of judgments in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
