A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AEq\">Intervenors-appellants appeal from a ruling of the trial court which granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declared null and void a resolution adopted by the mayor and council of the Borough of Ciiffside Park (borough) purporting to involuntarily retire plaintiff as chief of police of said borough. The ruling reinstated plaintiff as chief of police \u201cwith full tenure protection until he shall reach the age of seventy.\u201d Ancillary to its ruling upholding plaintiff\u2019s status as chief of police, the trial court also nullified the consequential appointments in the borough\u2019s police department of intervenors-appellants as chief, captain, lieutenant, sergeant and patrolman, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Basically the question involved is whether or not plaintiff, having been retained in service by the governing body of the Borough of Ciiffside Park after he became 65 years of age, may be involuntarily retired before he attains the age of 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The facts are undisputed. Plaintiff was appointed a member of the police department of the borough in 1920 and was duly appointed chief of police in May 1955. On October 19, 1960 plaintiff became 65 years of age. Shortly prior thereto plaintiff attended a conference meeting of the borough mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and council, expressed a desire to continue in service, and was \u201cgranted an extension to serve as Chief of Police of the Borough of Cliffside Park, over and above the compulsory retirement age of sixty-\u00f1ve years.\u201d On October 20, 1960 the borough clerk sent the following letter to the Consolidated Police and Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund Commission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">\u201cConsolidated Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIX\">P. O. Box 1416</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">Trenton 25, New Jersey</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A34u\">Re: John J. McEvoy Police Department Birthdate 10-19-1895</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad7\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">The Mayor and Council wish me to advise you that Police Chief John J. McEvoy is to be retained in service by the governing body for an indefinite period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEV\">Nicholas Oastbonuovo Borough Clerk</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">NO/B\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Plaintiff continued in service as chief of police until December 3, 1961, at which time, by resolution adopted by the mayor and council, he was involuntarily retired \u201cfrom said post, effective immediately,\u201d and granted accumulated sick leave of $6,461.20, to be paid weekly until said amount was exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The sick leave benefits were paid for 11 weeks and then discontinued. After considerable negotiations plaintiff formally demanded reinstatement, or payment of the balance of his sick leave. The council, however, did not take any action on the demand for reinstatement and refused to continue the sick leave payments on the ground that the part of the resolution authorizing them was illegal. The instant suit was then filed against the mayor and council seeking plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement,'or in the alternative, payment to plaintiff of the sick leave benefits granted to him by the resolution of December 3, 1961. Thereafter intervenors-appellants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>permitted to intervene in the suit so that their rights and status might be adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Cross-motions lor summary judgment were made by plaintiff, defendants and intervenors respectively. Plaintiff\u2019s motion was supported by his affidavit setting forth his version of the events immediately preceding the retirement resolution of December 3, 1961, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cMayor Calabrese arrived at my office at approximately 4:30 and advised me that at the meeting of the Mayor and Council to be held that evening a resolution would be introduced effecting my immediate \u2018retirement\u2019 from office. He told me that he was personally sorry that this step had to be taken but that he was forced to do it by political pressures within his own party. He advised me further, however, that my \u2018retirement\u2019 was being arranged in such a way that it would be accompanied by the granting to me of an accumulated 40 week sick leave allowance based upon my full weekly pay. I clearly stated to him that this \u2018retirement\u2019 was contrary to my wishes and without my consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">These factual allegations were not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The affidavit of Mayor Calabrese submitted on intervenors\u2019 cross-motion stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\u201cSubsequent to the said John J. McEvoy having attained the compulsory retirement age of 65 years and in response to his indicated desire to remain in said office, permission was given for him to do so; however, it being the clearly understood intent that same could be terminated at the will of the Mayor and Council and in accordance with such intent a certain letter dated October 20, I9601 and signed by the then Borough Clerk, Nicholas Oastronuovo, was sent to the Consolidated Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s reply affidavit thereto asserted that \u201cit was never my understanding, nor was it ever explained to me, that my continuance in office beyond the age of 65 could he terminated at any time at the will of the Mayor and Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">As heretofore noted, the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion, holding that plaintiff had full tenure protection until he reached the age of 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s basic position, which was adopted by the trial court, is that he cannot be involuntarily retired until the age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of 70 because of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:47-6, the pertinent provisions of which follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cNo person shall be removed from office or employment in any such police department * * * for political reasons, or for any other cause than incapacity, misconduct, nonresidence, or disobedience of rules and regulations established for the government of the police force and department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Plaintiff concedes that his right to tenure under the above statute is modified by his membership in the Consolidated Police and Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund, established under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16-1 <em>et seq., </em>and that he is bound by the compulsory retirement provisions of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We need consider only <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :16\u20141 and <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16-1.1. The first of these sections provides that an active member of a police department who has served honorably in such department for a period of <em>25 </em>years, and has reached the age of 51 years \u201cshall, on his own application, be retired.\u201d It further provides that an active member with <em>25 </em>years of service and who has reached the age of 65, \u201cshall be retired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16\u20141.1, first enacted in 1947, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 43:16-1 of the Revised Statutes, any member who holds office, position, or employment as chief of a police department * * * may be retained in service by the governing body of the municipality, or by the director of public safety if the municipality has such a director, until such member attains the age of seventy years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Plaintiff contends that this latter section must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the Tenure Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:47-6, so that while plaintiff could have been retired at age 65 under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16-1, having been retained in service past that age under the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :16-1.1, he cannot be involuntarily retired until he attains the age of 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The trial judge held that plaintiff, having been retained in service past the age of 65, \u201ccould not be removed from office without cause and under the Police Tenure Act as Chief of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Police of the municipality he was fully protected in that office until the end of his term which, after being continued after age 65, could not be terminated before he would attain age 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"> We do not agree. Plaintiff was subject to retirement at age 65. We read <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:16-1.3 to do no more than enable the municipality to retain plaintiff in service beyond plaintiff\u2019s sixty-fifth birthday, at the municipality\u2019s discretion or pleasure, but not beyond his attaining the age of 70 years. Section 1.1 merely suspends operation of the mandatory retirement provision of section 1 for such period of time as the municipality considers it advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">There are many reasons why a municipality may want to retain a police chief in sendee for a limited period of time past his normal retirement date. However, the advantages to be had by such retention would be nullified if any retention were held to confer tenure in office for an additional five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The provisions of the Police Tenure Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :47-6, dealing with removal from office or employment, are not applicable to the involuntary retirement of a police chief Avho is retained in service past the normal retirement age of 65, <em>i. </em>e., the Tenure Act does not protect against involuntary retirement. Plaintiff could have been retained in service for a specified period of time, provided it did not extend beyond his seventieth birthday. The undisputed evidence, however, indicates that plaintiff\u2019s retention was for \u201can indefinite period.\u201d The borough, therefore, had the power to involuntarily retire plaintiff at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Plaintiff argues that the phrase \u201cfor an indefinite period,\u201d as contained in the borough clerk\u2019s letter of October 20, 1960, has a special meaning in law. Plaintiff cites numerous eases holding that appointment for an indefinite period to a position of tenure means appointment until removal for cause. Suffice it to note that the cases referred to deal with original appointment to office rather than retention in service past normal retirement age.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The trial court, since it held that the involuntary retirement of plaintiff was null and void, found it unnecessary to rule on plaintiff\u2019s alternative demand for payment of sick leave benefits granted to him by the resolution of December 3, 1961. This issue must now be resolved at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The judgment herein is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment upholding the involuntary retirement of plaintiff, reinstating the consequential appointments of intervenors-appellants to the offices enumerated, and adjudicating plaintiff\u2019s alternative demand for payment of sick leave benefits. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b556-5\">Lewis, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">(dissenting). I find it necessary to respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by my colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Plaintiff had been employed in the police department of the Borough of Cliffside Park for over 40 years, and for the last five years of that period was its chief of police. Upon his 65th birthday (October 19, 1960) he was eligible for compulsory retirement pursuant to the Consolidated Police and Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16\u20141. However, by reason of his \u201cemployment as chief of a police department,\u201d the municipality had the option, under a 1947 amendatory act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:16\u20141.1, to extend the retirement \u201cuntil such member attains the age of seventy years.\u201d Neither of said statutory enactments purports to alter or modify in any wajr the provisions of the Police Tenure Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:47-6, except only to fix and determine the permissive and mandatory age requirements for retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Our deliberations must consider those three acts of the Legislature <em>in pari materia </em>from the aspect of a comparison and interpretation of related provisions in their contextual setting of the declared legislative policy. They should be construed as a unitary whole so as to harmonize with and to give effectiveness to the intention of the lawmakers. \u201cThe reconciliation of apparently conflicting statutes to conform to the spirit of the legislation as a whole is a common exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>of the judicial interpretive function.\u201d <em>Clifton v. Passaic County Board of Taxation, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>411, 421 (1958). 2 <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction (3rd ed. </em>1943), \u00a7 5201, <em>note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Whether the police chief was properly or improperly \u201cremoved from office\u201d is an important issue in the pending litigation, but the more serious or grave proposition involved is the fractionization or nullification <em>pro tanto </em>of our tenure laws, the avowed purpose of which is to insulate public employees against considerations of politics, personal favoritism or partisanship in any form.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The governing body did not retire the chief when he had attained 65 years of age. His employment was continued, regular salary was paid to him, and the municipal clerk notified the Consolidated Police and Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund Commission that \u201che [McEvoy] is to be retained in service * * * for an indefinite period * * thereby further evidencing the borough\u2019s election to adopt the retirement age limit as prescribed in the 1947 amendment. A year and nearly two months later, on December 3, 1961, he was unilaterally and summarily removed from office. McEvoy, in his affidavit, referred to the events of that day in the following significant language quoted in the majority opiifion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201c* * * Mayor Calabrese arrived at my office at approximately 4 :30 and advised me that at the meeting of the Mayor and Council to be held that evening a resolution would be introduced effecting my immediate \u2018retirement\u2019 from office. <em>He told me that he was personally sorry that this step had to he taken hut that he was forced to do it hy political pressures within his own party. </em>He advised me further, however, that my \u2018retirement\u2019 was being arranged in such a way that it would be accompanied by the granting to me of an accumulated 40 week sick leave allowance based upon my full weekly pay. I clearly stated to him that this \u2018retirement\u2019 was contrary to my wishes and without my consent.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Those factual allegations were not refuted. The sworn statement of ex-Mayor Calabrese was to the effect that it was not the intention of council to continue McEvoy \u201cfor a term of 5 years until his having reached the age of 70 years\u201d and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>accordingly, such continued employment was at the pleasure of the borough and terminable at will. On the other hand, plaintiff contends it had never been explained to him \u201cthat my continuance in office beyond the age of 65 could be terminated at any time at the will of the Mayor and Council.\u201d In any event, the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:47-6 inhibit the removal of an officer or employee \u201cfor political reasons\u201d and specifically encompass in their protective intendment one \u201cwho is permanently employed by the municipality at a fixed annual salary.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s employment had been continuous from 1920 to December 3, 1961, and was at a fixed annual salary. Its permanency had never been interrupted and there is nothing in the record to indicate any engagement on a temporary basis or for a specified limited period. The record does not reveal any appointment or extension thereof other than \u201cfor an indefinite period.\u201d Such an employment under our decisional tenure cases is only terminable for cause. See <em>Moore v. Borough of Bradley </em>Beach, 87 <em>N. J. L. </em>391 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1915); <em>DeMarco v. Board of Chosen </em>Freeholders, <em>Bergen </em>County, 36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>382, 384 <em>(Law Div. </em>1955), affirmed 21 <em>N. J. </em>136 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Notwithstanding and in disregard of the applicable basic laws of tenure and the 1947 amendment of the Police Pension Act, the borough council, on the aforesaid night of December 3, 1961, adopted a resolution which (1) acknowledged Mc-Evoy\u2019s 42 years of services rendered \u201cconscientiously and diligently,\u201d (2) recited the fact that he had been \u201cgranted an extension to serve as Chief of Police of the Borough of Cliff-side Park, over and above the compulsory retirement age of sixty-five years,\u201d (3) retired him from his \u201cpost, effective immediately,\u201d and (4) provided for an accumulated sick leave benefit in the amount of $6,461.20, payable to McEvoy in weekly installments. In February 1962, however, the installment payments were discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Plaintiff and his attorney appeared at the municipal meeting on April 3, 1962. The minutes of that session reveal that the borough council refused to reinstate McEvoy as chief of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>police. They also indicate an abrogation of any obligation to make further payments under the resolution of December 3, 1961, and a notation states that, \u201cIn casting their negative vote the Councilmen clarified their votes by saying they were advised that the resolution was illegal.\u201d We also observe Mayor Madden\u2019s comment that \u201cthe granting of the sick leave pay in the resolution was a cover up of an unpopular act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s suit was commenced May 7, 1962, and cross-motions for summary judgment were heard by the trial court on July 12, 1962. All parties at that time urged that no genuine dispute as to any material fact existed. The issues of laches, estoppel and the applicability of <em>B. B. </em>4:88-15 (a) were neither pleaded <em>(B. B. </em>4:8-3) nor raised on the trial level. In rendering summary judgment for the plaintiff, the trial judge found that the resolution of December 3, 1961, summarily retiring MeEvoy as chief of police, was null and void. With that conclusion I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is not the function of the judiciary to augment legislation or to supply terms and conditions not adopted by the Legislature. <em>Dixon v. Gassert, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>1, 9 (1958). We cannot impute to the lawmakers an intention to change the fundaments of an established tenure policy and to relegate chiefs of police between the ages of 65 and 70 to a non-tenure status unless the law so provides\u2014clearly and unmistakenly. It is highly essential that law enforcement officers be protected to the fullest extent possible from partisan influence and pressures. For that obvious reason <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:47-6 specifically provides that no person shall be removed from office or employment \u201c* * * in any such police department * * * for political reasons, * * Society demands freedom from the deleterious consequences which may ensue if the objectives of the Police Tenure Act are not faithfully pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">If the Legislature had intended to vest in a municipality a discretion other than an election to retire a member of the police force at the age of 65 under the general act <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>43 :16-1), or to adhere to the provisions of the 1947 amendment <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>43 :16-1.1) applicable to police chiefs, and thereby adopt the alternate mandatory retirement age of 70, it could have employed adequate and appropriate language to clearly manifest that intention. Moreover, any such discretion beyond the exercise of such a choice would necessitate suitable guiding standards. See and compare, for example, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 \u00a110-18.26, applicable to certain members of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System <em>(Harvey v. Essex County Board of Freeholders, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>381 (1959)), and <em>R. S. </em>18:13-50 and 18:13-53 (subsequently repealed, <em>L. </em>1955, <em>c. </em>37) relating to the Teachers\u2019 Superannuation Retirement Act <em>(Bd. Education, Beach Haven v. State Bd. Education, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>364 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935)). Note also <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18:13-112.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The majority opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cThere are mauy reasons why a municipality may want to retain a police chief in service for a limited period of time past his normal retirement date. However, the advantages to be had by such retention would be nullified if any retention were held to confer tenure in office for an additional five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">It seems clear to me that such a conclusion is a <em>non sequihir. </em>It is within the province of a municipality to retire a chief of police under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :16\u20141 when he attains the age of 65 and thereafter, if it be deemed necessary or advisable, to reemploy him on a temporary basis for any specific purpose or stated time mutually agreed upon within the limits of the statute. This, however, was not done in the instant case, as MeEvoy was not retired nor his official position terminated when he reached the age of 65. To interpret <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :16\u20141.1 to mean that the continuation of a police chief in office after age 65 and before 70 is to be at the unfettered will and sufferance of the governing body would effectively nullify, for such a period of time, the established policy of our State as reflected in a constant course of tenure legislation. Indeed, for such a period, albeit only five years, we would hark back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>to tlie \u201csystem\u201d of spoils that so extensively prevailed before 1885. See generally, <em>Van </em>Riper, <em>History of the United States Civil </em>Service, <em>p. </em>44 (1958). The municipality owed McEvov, at the very least, an honest, straightforward decision and the opportunity to be heard on any protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">To reverse the trial judge and remand the case for an adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s demand for payment of benefits under an alleged illegal and <em>ultra vires </em>resolution, already negated by the borough council, would afford little consolation to the plaintiff and would sanction municipal action which I perceive to be unlawful. Accordingly, I vote to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
