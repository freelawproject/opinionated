We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in his opinion. We add the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">As an intermediate appellate court, we are bound by the decisions of our Supreme Court in <em>State in the Interest of J.W., </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>144, 145-46, 270 A.2d 273 (1970), and <em>In Re Registrant J.G., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>304, 338-39, 777 A.2d 891 (2001), and by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>528, 545, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1976, 1986, 29 L.Ed.2d 647, 661 (1971), all of which hold that juveniles are not constitutionally entitled to a jury trial \u201cin the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicative stage.\u201d <em>Ibid.; J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 777 A.2d 891 (quoting <em>McKeiver). See also State ex rel P.M.P., </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>166, 174, 975 A.2d 441 (2009). In <em>J.G., </em>the Court specifically reaffirmed that there are fundamental differences between this State\u2019s adult and juvenile adjudication systems. <em>J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 321-25, 777 A.2d 891. In fact, those differences underlay the <em>J.G. </em>Court\u2019s decision to limit Megan\u2019s Law registration as it applied to juveniles younger than fourteen, as a matter of statutory interpretation harmonizing Megan\u2019s Law with the New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice (Juvenile Code).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 334-37, 777 A.2d 891. <em>See also State in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>the Interest of C.V., </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>281, 294-97, 990 A.2d 640 (2010) (discussing the \u201cstated rehabilitative goals\u201d of the Juvenile Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Significantly, in his reply brief, AC. eschews the statutory right that he does have to elect waiver of his case to adult court, where he would have the right to a jury trial. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-27, -28. As he phrases it, choosing trial as an adult would \u201cup the stakes\u201d from four years in a juvenile facility to twenty years in prison. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44d(1)(e); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(l). That starkly illustrates an important distinction between the adult and juvenile justice systems. <em>See R. </em>5:24-5(a) (at any time during a juvenile\u2019s term of incarceration, the Family Part judge may reconsider and \u201csubstitute any other\u201d available disposition); <em>R. </em>3:21-10(a) and (b) (severely limiting the criminal court\u2019s authority to reduce an adult sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Athough AC. argues that the Juvenile Code is now so similar to the adult Criminal Code as to require jury trials for juveniles, a contention we reject, he also argues that the application of Megan\u2019s Law to juvenile offenders triggers a constitutional jury trial right for juveniles charged with sex offenses. AC.\u2019s constitutional arguments, however, are at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12-13, 662 A.2d 367 (1995), that Megan\u2019s Law is not a criminal statute and sex offender registration is not \u201cpunishment.\u201d In <em>J.G., </em>the Court extended that holding to Megan\u2019s Law as applied to juvenile offenders, although it limited the registration requirement somewhat as a matter of statutory construction. <em>J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 334-35, 338-39, 777 A.2d 891. Again, we are bound by the Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Doe </em>and <em>J.G.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In his brief, AC. cites several scholarly articles documenting what A.C. contends are unintended, counterproductive results of applying Megan\u2019s Law to juvenile offenders. In particular, these articles discuss the barriers that lifetime registration may pose to a juvenile\u2019s chances at rehabilitation and a normal fife. <em>See, e.g., </em>Timothy E. Wind, <em>The Quandary of Megan\u2019s Law: When the Child Sex Offender is a Child, </em>37 <em>J. Marshall L.Rev. </em>73 (2003); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Patricia Coffey, <em>The Public Registration of Juvenile Sex Offenders, Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers Forum, </em>Vol. XIX, No. 1 (Winter 2007). These concerns may well merit the Legislature\u2019s further consideration. However, whether Megan\u2019s Law should apply to juveniles, either at all or in the manner that it currently does, is a policy decision to be addressed by the Legislature. <em>See J.G., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>at 327-30, 777 A2d 891 (reviewing the different ways in which other states apply registration requirements to juvenile offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-15\"> We initially denied A.C.\u2019s motion for leave to appeal. However, by order filed June 30, 2011, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and remanded the case to this court for consideration on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> A.C.\u2019s constitutional claims are rooted in the Sixth Amendment of the Unites States Constitution and Article 1, \u00a7 10 of the New Jersey Constitution, both of which guarantee the right to a jury trial in \"criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. 1. By statute, juvenile dispositions are not criminal convictions and a juvenile adjudicated delinquent is not \"deemed a criminal.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> Megan\u2019s Law is codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -23. In addition to sex offender registration and public notification, the statute provides for public internet access to information about sex offenders. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-12. However the internet information excludes juveniles unless they are repeat or high-risk offenders. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-12, -13(b), (d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
