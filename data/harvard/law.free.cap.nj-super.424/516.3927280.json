Defendant 66 East Allendale, LLC (defendant) cross-appeals from that portion of the final judgment awarding simple interest. We affirm on the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This appeal requires us to determine if the trial judge correctly made his threshold determination that \u201cthe record contains sufficient evidence of a probability of a zoning change to warrant consideration by the jury,\u201d as required by <em>State by Commissioner of Transportation v. Caoili, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>252, 261-62, 639 A.2d 275 (1994). We are also called upon to address whether the judge erred by making his threshold determination before summations, rather than before the commencement of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We conclude that the judge did not err in finding that there was sufficient evidence of a reasonable probability of a zoning variance to allow the jury to consider that probability in its assessment of the fair market value of the property. Although it is preferable to make the threshold determination before the trial begins, we hold that, given the estimated seven-day evidentiary hearing needed to perform his gatekeeping role, the judge did not abuse his discretion by making his findings before summations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In December 2002, defendant purchased a 2.13 acre vacant parcel located at 66 East Allendale Road, the corner intersection of East Allendale Road and West Saddle River Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Exxon Mobil leased the property and sublet for operation of a gas station. In 2005, Exxon removed the gas station, cleaned up existing contamination, and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Under the Borough\u2019s current zoning ordinance, the subject property is \u201csplit-zoned\u201d with approximately 31,799 sq. ft. in the office zone (0-1) and approximately 60,984 sq. ft. in the residential zone (R-l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the 0-1 zone, the ordinance restricts improved lot coverage to 30% of the lot\u2019s total area, and imposes parking requirements of one parking space for every 75 sq. ft. of space.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In October 2004, defendant sought a construction permit for use of the R-l portion of the property as a parking lot of a proposed 10,000 sq. ft. bank building. The application relied on a site plan prepared by defendant\u2019s planning expert David A, Hals. The permit was denied, noting that the \u201cproposed improved lot coverage exceeds the maximum allowed of 30%.\u201d Defendant appealed to the zoning board to seek a \u201cuse\u201d variance based on the same site plan. After a zoning board hearing at which several people voiced opposition to the proposed 10,000 sq. ft. building, defendant withdrew the application without any action by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On November 8, 2006, Saddle River filed a verified complaint to acquire defendant\u2019s property by authority of eminent domain to use as a public park. After unsuccessful mediation pertaining to the legality of the taking, the court entered a consent order for judgment and appointed three commissioners, who subsequently appraised the property at $1,593,625. The court then entered an order memorializing this valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The parties appealed, demanded a jury trial, and filed motions in limine to bar expert opinions. Saddle River contended that the court should strike the reports and testimony at trial of defendant\u2019s four proposed expert witnesses as \u201cnet opinion\u201d or, in the alternative, \u201cconduct a plenary hearing in advance of trial pursuant to ... <em>Caoili, [supra,] </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>252 [639 A.2d 275].\u201d Similarly, defendant argued that the court should bar the report and testimony of Saddle River\u2019s appraisal expert as \u201cnet opinion.\u201d On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>6, 2010, Judge Robert L. Polifroni conducted oral argument and issued an oral opinion denying the motions. On July 26, 2010, the judge entered an order memorializing his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Thereafter, in October and November 2010, Judge Polifroni conducted a ten-day jury trial, during which time the parties presented testimony from eleven witnesses and introduced 117 documentary exhibits. The central dispute at trial, and now on appeal, was whether a willing purchaser utilizing the property for its \u201chighest and best use\u201d would have considered that there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the local zoning board would grant a variance from the 30% improved lot coverage restriction to allow construction of a 10,000 sq. ft. bank building. Such a building would have substantially increased the fair market value of the property and, therefore, the amount of just compensation due for the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">At trial, defendant relied on the expert opinion of Hals, who produced a 2010 planning and engineering report. Hals opined that if parking were provided underneath the building, a prospective purchaser could construct the 10,000 sq. ft. building within the O-l area without seeking variance from the 30% coverage restriction. However, Hals further opined that a better use would be to position the 10,000 sq. ft. building within the O-l area and provide parking in the R-l area. This plan would have required a \u201cuse\u201d variance for the parking<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a \u201cbulk\u201d variance for 42% improved lot coverage. Hals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">It would be likely that the ... variance for the improved lot coverage would be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The proposed building size and development layout is an appropriate sized development for the property. The proposal is not over[-]building of the property. The proposed building coverage is 7.11% which is consistent to the 7% residential building coverage____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Defendant also presented testimony from appraiser Jon Brody, who performed an analysis of market data from comparable properties whose highest and best use was a bank site. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>this \u201cmarket approach\u201d and his review of Hals\u2019 2010 planning report, Brody determined that the property had a value of $5,250,000. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">We have considered the facts demonstrating the probability of a variance as they would be considered by a buyer and seller and conclude that the parties would anticipate the variance to develop the property as a bank/office facility consistent with the physical characteristics of the pi\u2019operty and densities derived from the market!,] which ... would accommodate and permit a two (2) story 10,000 square foot bank/office with adequate on-site parking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In his report, Brody accounted for \u201cthe factors indicative of an impending variance, neighborhood development trends, and conclusions discussed in [Hals\u2019 2010] planning report.\u201d Additionally, he stated that he had not valued the subject property \u201con the assumption that the variance is an accomplished fact[,J but rather the valuation represents the value of the unapproved land, taking into account as a factor in valuation, its probable variance, which we believe to be reasonably probable.\u201d Finally, defendant also presented the testimony of Shergoh Alkilani, a real estate and bank development expert, who opined that the high-income demographics of the area would have made the property particularly valuable for a bank site.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Saddle River relied on the opinion of planning expert Richard Preiss, who agreed that the highest and best use of the property was for a bank building. However, Preiss opined that the zoning board would not have granted the bulk variance needed for a 10,000 sq. ft. bank building because a smaller building could have been constructed. Preiss relied, in part, on a conceptual site plan prepared by Saddle River\u2019s engineer, Martin K. Spence, showing a 3,312 sq. ft. bank building meeting the existing lot coverage requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying in part on Preiss\u2019 planning report, Saddle River\u2019s appraiser, Hugh A. McGuire, Jr., testified that the property had a market value of $1,325,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">On November 3, 2010, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant in the amount of $5,250,000. On January 7,2011, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Polifroni denied Saddle River\u2019s request for a new trial, issued an oral opinion, and entered an order for final judgment. Thereafter, Saddle River appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On appeal, Saddle River contends that the judge wrongly denied its motion for a new trial. As at the time of its motion, Saddle River\u2019s primary contention is that the judge erred by not determining, prior to the commencement of trial, whether there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the local zoning board would have approved a variance from the existing lot coverage restriction. Saddle River argues that the judge did not adequately \u201cserve as a \u2018gate-keeper\u2019 and determine, in advance of the trial, as an issue of law, if there existfed] a \u2018reasonable probability' that all essential statutory criteria required to approve a \u2018bulk\u2019 variance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ha[d] been established by competent evidence.\u201d Thus, Saddle River contends that the judge \u201cimproperly and prejudicially allowed [defendant\u2019s experts] to testify on issues of law before the jury and permitted the jury to decide those issues of law as a matter of witness credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We address the governing legal principles regarding new trial motions and condemnation actions. Generally speaking, granting or denying a motion for a new trial rests with the sound discretion of the trial court and should only be granted if, \u201c \u2018having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, it clearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Risko v. Thompson Muller Auto. Grp., Inc., </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>506, 521, 20 A.3d 1123 (2011) (quoting <em>R. </em>4:49-l(a)). \u201cA jury verdict is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>considerable deference and \u2018should not be overthrown except upon the basis of a carefully reasoned and factually supported (and articulated) determination, after canvassing the record and weighing the evidence, that the continued viability of the judgment would constitute a manifest denial of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 597-98, 379 A.2d 225 (1977)). Furthermore, trial courts cannot substitute their own judgment merely because they would have reached a different conclusion. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We apply to the new trial motion the same review standard that the trial judge applied, i.e., \u201cwhether there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>Risko, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 20 A.3d 1123 (citing <em>Bender v. Adelson, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>411, 435, 901 A.2d 907 (2006)). At the same time, we give \u201c \u2018due deference\u2019 to the trial court\u2019s \u2018feel of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Jastram v. Kruse, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>216, 230, 962 A.2d 503 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Pursuant to the Eminent Domain Act of 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 to -50, to take private property, the State must pay the property owner \u201cjust compensation.\u201d <em>Caoili, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 639 A.2d 275 (citing <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 20). \u201cJust compensation\u201d means \u201c \u2018the fair market value of the property as of the date of the taking, determined by what a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to, neither being under any compulsion to act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513, 457 A.2d 463 (1983)). In other words, it is the amount that \u201c\u2018knowledgeable parties freely negotiating for its sale under normal market conditions based on all surrounding circumstances at the time of the taking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Silver, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 457 A.2d 463).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Furthermore, the property owner \u201cshall receive the fair market value of the land for any use for which it has a commercial value in the immediate present or in reasonable anticipation in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. Gorga, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>113, 116, 138 A.2d 833 (1958). Thus, the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d is \u201cmost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>relevant in ascertaining fair market value,\u201d and any applicable zoning restrictions constitute \u201cmaterial factors.\u201d <em>Caoili, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 639 A.2d 275. The Court has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Because the inquiry into the uses of property is usually wide-ranging, \u201ccourts in [New Jersey] have shown considerable liberality in admitting evidence of market value, particularly in terms of the highest and best use of the subject property.\u201d That evidence encompasses all \u201crelevant facts at the time of the taking], which] may include those that have a bearing on an available future use of the property.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 260-61, 639 A.2d 275 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Silver, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 515,457 A.2d 463).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Nonetheless, \u201callowing consideration of all zoning changes that [are] merely possible could lead to \u2018unbridled speculation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 639 A.2d 275 (quoting <em>Gorga, supra, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>at 116, 138 A.2d 833). Thus, the Court has developed \u201ca two-step standard governing the consideration of evidence of zoning changes affecting the future use of property\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201c[I]f as of the date of taking there is a reasonable probability of a change in the zoning ordinance in the near future, the influence of that circumstance upon the market value as of that date may be shown,\u201d but ... before allowing a jury to consider the issue, the trial court should first decide whether the record contains sufficient evidence of a probability of a zoning change to warrant consideration by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\"><em>[Id, </em>at 261-62, 639 A.2d 275 (quoting <em>Gorga, supra, </em>at 116-17,138 A.2d 833).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\"><em>As </em>such, the judge must be \u201csatisfied that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a determination that such a [zoning] change is reasonably probable,\u201d and then the jury may consider the change \u201cin fixing just compensation in light of the weight and effect that reasonable buyers and sellers would give to such evidence in their determination of the fair market value of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 639 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\"><em>Caoili </em>defines the role of the trial judge as that of a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d who \u201cscreen[s] out potentially unreliable evidence and admit[s] only evidence that would warrant or support a finding that a zoning change is probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 639 A.2d 275. This gatekeeping function assures that the jury bases its fair market valuation upon \u201ccogent evidence indicating beyond a mere possibility that a change of use is likely and ... would be an important factor in the valuation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>However, the jury \u201cneed not be required to find that the zoning change is probable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Caoili </em>the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">[I]n the jury\u2019s consideration of evidence of a zoning change, the critical inquiry is the reasonable belief by a buyer and seller engaged in voluntary negotiations over the fair market value of property that a change may occur and will have an impact on the value of the property regardless of the degree of probability____[E]ven though the parties to a voluntary transaction may not believe that a zoning change is more likely than not, their belief that there may be a change should be taken into account if that belief is reasonable and it affects their assessment of the property\u2019s value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 264-65, 639 A.2d 275 (internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">We have had numerous opportunities to consider the guidance of <em>Gorga </em>and <em>Caoili.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this ease, Saddle River relies extensively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>upon <em>County of Monmouth v. Hilton, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 760 A.2d 786 (App.Div.2000), and <em>State ex ret. Commissioner of Transportation v. 200 Route 17, L.L.C., </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 22 A.3d 1012 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>601, 34 A.3d 782 (2011). We are not convinced, however, that these eases heighten the standard of proof by which the trial judge, in his or her gatekeeping role, must screen out unreliable evidence and assure that proofs are sufficient to warrant a determination that a zoning change is reasonably probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In <em>Hilton, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 591, 760 A.2d 786, we considered \u201cthe effect on market value of a prospective assemblage of disparately owned parcels,\u201d an issue that the court found \u201cconceptually no different from the effect on market value of a prospective zoning change.\u201d The court held that \u201cappraising the value of defendant\u2019s property as if a four-lot assemblage had already taken place as of the date of taking and then basing highest and best use on such an assemblage constituted a fundamentally untenable and legally unsupportable approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 760 A.2d 786. Thus, \u201cthe reasonable probability of an assemblage \u2014 not merely a future assemblage that is hypothetical or speculative \u2014 may enhance the fair market value ... [b]ut it cannot be the basis for determining market value as if the assemblage had already taken place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 760 A.2d 786. The court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">a jury would have to determine the degree of probability of the assemblage since ... the more probable the desired event is, the more valuable that probability is to a buyer and the greater the premium he would therefore be willing to pay. In this regard, we understand that what <em>Caoili </em>[, <em>supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 264-65, 639 A.2d 275,] meant ... respecting \u2018\u2018an impact on the value of the property regardless of the degree of probability\u201d was addressed to the court\u2019s gatekeeping function and not to the jury\u2019s determination. That is to say, the judge, in determining probability, need not determine degree of probability so long as there is reasonable probability, but the juiy may consider the degree of probability, as indeed it must, in determining the extent of the premium the buyer would be willing to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 594, 760 A.2d 786.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Similarly, in <em>200 Route 17, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 172,22 A.3d 1012, we considered whether an expert could testify as to the property\u2019s value as a commercial retail use based on a speculative renovation, instead of the existing physical condition. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Ultimately, the issue can be restated as follows: What would a willing buyer pay a willing seller, without compulsion, for a substandard building, knowing that the buyer would be obligated to obtain appropriate land use and building approvals, as well as spend 1.5 million dollars for the property to achieve its highest and best use? This is different from defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s approach, which entailed simply assuming that the building was already improved and then deducting the costs of improvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 175, 22 A3d 1012.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">We held that \u201c[s]peculative improvements to the property, that do not exist on the valuation date, cannot be considered in valuing this property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 22 A.3d 1012. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">[T]he State is required to pay for the building \u201cas is,\u201d considering the reasonable probability of future renovations and approvals required to improve the property to its highest and best use, discounted by the risks and costs of such venture, just as a buyer would pay for the building in its current condition, then make any improvements necessary to bring the building to the buyer\u2019s desired use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 179, 22 A3d 1012.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Under the facts of this case, we reject Saddle River\u2019s contention that Judge Polifroni erred by making his <em>Caoili </em>threshold determination after the trial began. When Saddle River initially moved to bar defendant\u2019s experts, the judge denied the motion and issued an oral decision expressing the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">DOt\u2019s clear to me, as I\u2019m reviewing these documents, that I am not in a position at this point to rely upon cross-examinations and examinations of witnesses at depositions in order to rule as a matter of law that the opinions ... are of insufficient foundation to allow it to get to the jury. It\u2019s not that type of case and I think it requires a full exposition of the facts at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">Now I do not believe that <em>[Caoili supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>252, 639 A.2d 275] or any other case that I\u2019ve seen requires me, as the gatekeeper, to have an expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>hearing [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] prior to trial in order to fully vet these issues. My authority as a trial Oludge under [N.J.R.A.] 611 is [that] I can determine what\u2019s the most efficient use of my time, the [c]ourt\u2019s time, counsel\u2019s time, the parties\u2019 time, and the jury\u2019s time in terms of time and expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">I do not think it serves the proper administration of justice to have a dry run, to have all of these issues vetted outside the presence of the jury so that the [c]ourt would be in a better position to decide whether or not the opinions are viable or not viable at least in terms of the issues raised in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">[T]his is not the type of case where the jury hears information and it\u2019s of such a nature that they\u2019re incapable of putting it aside, that they\u2019ll be so shocked by what they hear that it\u2019s not reasonable for them to follow instructions of the [court] as to what they consider and [do] not consider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">At the close of evidence, before summations, Saddle River renewed its motion to strike the testimony of Hals and Steck on the issue of the reasonable probability of a zoning change. Judge Polifroni denied the motion and found that \u201cthere\u2019s enough ... of a finding of a reasonable probability of a potential zoning change, as I understand the law in <em>Caoili.\u201d </em>The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">I simply point briefly to the prior ... zoning change that was proffered. The weight of that, the political issues behind that by the planner is [sic] well before this jury. Nevertheless, ... this potential zoning change was considered by the Borough [of Saddle River] at least once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Secondly, the [c]ourt also points out[,] as I\u2019m permitted to do[,] that ... the evidence as to other zoning changes during the pendency of the issues involving [Saddle River] and defendant were brought before the town officials and they considered zoning changes____ I can consider those type of non[-]evidentiary issues from my gate \u2014 my threshold findings, as I do in any rulings on evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">[T]here are also indications that this Borough has made zoning changes to office portions of their zoning and the issues of ... the commercial zone and the office zone and the preexisting use and the difficulties of the split[-]zoning[,] and for all those issues I reject [Saddle River]\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of those various experts and that issue will be presented to the jury for their consideration. That is, they may consider the possibility of a zoning change, that would, therefore, impact the value of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Accordingly, Judge Polifroni charged the jury that \u201cto determine fair market value, you should consider the legal use or development of the property, which is reasonably probable, which might prompt a buyer to pay and what an owner might reasonably expect to receive from selling the property knowing the legal limitations [ajffecting the property.\u201d He instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Zoning, planning, and building laws and regulations limit \u2014 do limit the way a property may be used[;] however, you must consider whether the zoning restrictions may be changed or a variance obtained in order for the highest and best use to be realized. Now suppose there were indications that the law regulating the properties] use might change so as to permit a use or limit a use for the development of the property in the future which would make the property more or less valuable. Parties negotiating a price for the property\u2019s sale on the date of taking would not simply ignore the probabilities of that change, and neither should you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">It is for you the jury to evaluate the evidence to determine what a reasonable buyer and seller would anticipate a reasonable zoning board would do and how that prospect of a zoning change in the near future would impact on the properties market value on the date of the taking____Your finding as to the value of the property should reflect the remoteness or likelihood of approval of the proposed zoning changes to the same extent that a reasonable buyer and seller would consider them in determining the value of the property on November 8[ ], 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Following the verdict, upon Saddle River\u2019s motion for a new trial, Judge Polifroni addressed whether he had erred \u201cin [his] initial determination that adequate competent evidence existed to support the finding of a reasonable probability of a zoning change----\u201d The judge reviewed the relevant case law, including <em>Gorga </em>and <em>Caoili, </em>denied the motion, and issued an oral opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-13\">In performing the gate[-]keeping function[,] this [e]ourt determined [before the final jury charge] that there was sufficient evidence to establish that relief from the zoning restrictions [was] probable. And that the evidence was such that a jury could reasonably conclude that a zoning change may occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">For example, the only other time the 30[%] lot coverage was \u2014 was considered for office space in the PUD Zone, the Borough [of Saddle River] changed the regulation back \u2014 to the 65[%] coverage regulation in order to make the project economically feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-15\">The [cjourt further notes [Hals]\u2019s opinion that the proposed 10,000-square-foot building could have been constructed solely on the 01-Zone portion of the property. But he opined that the proposed site plan was a more prudent plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-16\">Additionally, there are other circumstances supporting defendant\u2019s view, that reasonable buyers would anticipate zoning changes. As noted by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>there\u2019s no property governed by the 01-Zone that complied with the maximum improved lot coverage limitation of 30[%]. Further, the properties surrounding the subject property contained deficiencies in the improved lot restriction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">And additionally, there was sufficient evidentiary support based upon the location of the subject property that prior rulings of the Borough [of Saddle River] with respect to allowing the deviation from the 30[%] coverage requirement demonstrated that both positive and negative criteria mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c(2) would have been met. Therefore there was nothing in the record to indicate that the expert opinions were wrongfully presented to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Further, there is evidence to demonstrate that the proposed plan conforms to the physical properties. And do[es] not unduly impact upon the residential properties that abut it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">Based upon this information the potential purchaser would likely believe that the Borough [of Saddle River] would grant requested relief in form of a variance or zoning change. Specificallyt,] as noted by defendant!,] the prior development of [the] district was all between 65[%] and 80[%] of the buildable area of all of the properties in the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">Further],] the evidence in the record reflecting opposition to zoning changes under the political circumstances existing at one point in time in the past is not dispositive of this issue as it relates to future zoning changes. The juiy was exposed to extensive evidence about the political machinations. And clearly found that the Borough [of Saddle River]\u2019s resistance to zoning changes at that time did not settle the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">The [c]ourt finds that there was cogent evidence to warrant a determination that the zoning change was reasonably probable. And based upon the aforementioned facts ... the [c]ourt reiterates its ruling that it was reasonable for a jury to conclude that the zoning change ... may occur, which was the directive of <em>Caoili </em>[, <em>supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at] 264 [639 A.2d 275].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">And the negative criteria was demonstrated by the fact that there were no residences within a half of [a] mile on the south-side. And that the distance ... homes to the north were protected by a substantial stand of evergreen trees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a determination by the jury that a zoning change was reasonably probable. <em>Caoili </em>simply requires that the judge be satisfied that the evidence is not unduly speculative by \u201cscreening out potentially unreliable evidence and admitting only evidence that would warrant or support a finding that a zoning change is probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 639 A.2d 275. Here, the judge found sufficient credible evidence indicating that a buyer and seller at the time of the taking would have considered the probability of a zoning change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>affecting the value of the property. The evidence therefore was not unduly speculative or potentially unreliable. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">This is not a case such as <em>Hilton </em>or <em>200 Route 17, </em>where evidence of the reasonable probability of a particular change was patently speculative. In <em>Hilton, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 591, 760 A.2d 786, for example, the expert appraised the property as if a future hypothetical assemblage had already taken place at the time of the taking. Likewise, in <em>200 Route 17, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 178-79, 22 A.3d 1012, the expert valued the property based on speculative improvements to the existing building that had not yet occurred, a potential \u201cwindfall\u201d for the defendant at the expense of the State. In those cases, the courts were justifiably concerned that valuation was based on an assumption that the potential change had already occurred, rather than what a buyer and seller would pay for a potential change that was at least reasonably probable as of the time of the taking. We too recognize that \u201c[t]he distinction between enhancing market value and constituting the basis of market value is ... critical[.]\u201d <em>Hilton, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 591, 760 A.2d 786; <em>200 Route 17, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 175, 22 A.3d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Here, in contrast to the facts of <em>Hilton </em>and <em>200 Route 17, </em>there was a sufficient basis to determine there existed a reasonable probability that the zoning board would have granted the variance. For example, Judge Polifroni found that no other property in the O-l zone complied with the improved lot coverage restriction; that a 10,000 sq. ft. building would not unduly affect the residential area; that such a building could have been constructed solely within the O-l zone, notwithstanding that a better use would have required the bulk variance; that the property\u2019s location could have supported the statutory positive and negative criteria; and that Saddle River had previously increased maximum improved lot coverage in the O-l zone. Thus, the judge sufficiently fulfilled his gatekeeping function before permitting the jury to consider in deliberations Brody\u2019s valuation of the property with the probability of a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We note also that because the jury was not bound by any particular degree of probability, <em>Caoili, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 264-65, 639 A.2d 275, it was equally free to consider the property value proposed by Saddle River\u2019s expert. That the jury ultimately did not accept that valuation is neither for us nor the trial judge to second-guess. <em>See Risko, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 521-22, 20 A.3d 1123. We conclude that the judge correctly instructed the jury that in determining the appropriate fair market value to represent just compensation, it could consider the reasonable probability that the zoning board may have approved a bulk variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Although it is preferable for a judge to make the threshold determination prior to the commencement of the tidal, we do not read <em>Caoili </em>to require that the judge must, in every case, conduct a plenary hearing before the trial begins. We recognize that in <em>Hilton </em>we stated in dicta that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">[t]he rule as enunciated by <em>Caoili </em>requires that the judge make a threshold determination as to whether the prospective zoning change is reasonably probable in the near future. If the judge is satisfied that the preliminary showing has been made, the evidence of probable change is admitted [into evidence.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\"><em>[Hilton, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592, 760 A.2d 786.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Here, the parties moved pretrial to have the court make the probability determination based on testimony and reports from five proposed experts. The judge estimated that resolution of the issue would potentially require a seven-day evidential hearing, constituting an inefficient use of time. Under the facts presented, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion by performing his gatekeeping function before summations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">As with any other evidence inappropriate for the jury room, the judge may instruct the jury to disregard proofs that fail to meet the threshold standard of sufficiency. <em>See Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 98, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984) (stating that \u201cjuries frequently are instructed to disregard certain evidence they have heard\u201d); <em>cf. Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 36, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004) (finding no reason to believe that the jury disregarded the trial court\u2019s instructions not to consider improper statements). \u201c[Jjuries routinely demonstrate their ability to successfully per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>form difficult intellectual exercises requiring shifts of perspective in the course of their deliberations.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 98, 477 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Next, Saddle River argues that the judge erred by denying its motion in limine to bar the opinions of defendant\u2019s experts. Saddle River contends that defendant\u2019s planning experts, Hals and Steck, offered net opinion and failed to support the conclusion that a 10,000 sq. ft. bank building would be \u201ca better zoning alternative.\u201d Saddle River also argues that the judge should have excluded Brody\u2019s appraisal opinion because it was based on Hals\u2019 net opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\u201cThe net opinion rule is a prohibition against speculative testimony.\u201d <em>Grzanka v.

Hals reviewed Saddle River\u2019s zoning ordinance, the history of the ordinance, the 1990 master plan, the 2003 master plan reexamination report, the planning report prepared by Preiss, and Hals\u2019 2004 site plan. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">It can be expected that variance relief can be granted for the improved lot coverage as a <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70]c(2) variance. 1) the application would relate to the specific property at 66 East Allendale Road[;] 2) the purposes of the [MLUL] would be advanced by the deviation of the zoning ordinance requirement^] specifically it would encourage the appropriate use or development of land; promote adequate light air and open space; the development of the site would not conflict with the development of the State; [and] would promote a desirable visual environment through good civic design; 3) the variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good; the proposed improved lot coverage is consistent with the Saddle River commercial district; 4) the benefits out[weigh] any detriment; the improved lot coverage will provide the area needed ... for the building and adequate parking while preserving 58% of the lot for landscaping, greenery and wooded areas; 5) the variance will not substantially impair the intent and purposes of the zone plan and zoning ordinance; the past ordinances were 30% building coverage and 75% improved lot <em>coverage. </em>The proposal of 42% would be in substantial compliance with the original ordinance, would meet the requirements of the current PUD zone and would be consistent with the downtown area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Similarly, Steek also concluded that a variance from the improved lot coverage restriction was reasonably probable. Steek reviewed Saddle River\u2019s 1990 master plan, its 2003 reexamination report, Hals\u2019 2010 report, and Preiss\u2019 report. He stated that the 30% restriction did \u201cnot characterize the existing development in [the O-l] zone and violates the [MLUL] requirement that zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>must be drawn \u201cwith reasonable consideration to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses.\u201d\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62. He also stated that in 2002 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection had characterized the property as having an impervious coverage limit from 61% to 80%, and that in such a situation, \u201ca <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70]c(2) argument [could be advanced] wherein stormwater detention facilities would lessen the rate of stormwater runoff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Further, because we conclude that there was sufficient foundation for Hals\u2019 report, we reject Saddle River\u2019s argument that Brody\u2019s valuation derivatively was net opinion because it was based on Hals\u2019 report. It is well-settled that an expert may rely on the opinion of other experts, so long as he or she forms an independent opinion. <em>See Macaluso v. Pleskin, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 356, 747 A.2d 830 (App.Div.)

Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>contends that there is a \u201cclear constitutional obligation of providing annual compound interest on the deficiency portion of condemnation awards,\u201d and relies on <em>Borough of Wildwood Crest v.

Defendant contends that the policy of awarding interest on tort judgments in personal injury cases \u201cvastly differs from the purpose of providing interest on just compensation awards,\u201d that a tort victim has \u201cno absolute entitlement to an award without first establishing liability,\u201d whereas a property owner \u201calready has an established right to funds, representing just compensation, as of the date of taking.\u201d Defendant admits, however, that using <em>Rule </em>4:42-11 rates is not an abuse of discretion, but contends that the judge \u201chad no discretion to grant only simple rather than compound interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u201c[T]he allowance of interest on a condemnation award is a requirement of constitutional magnitude where the actual taking of the property is not contemporaneous with payment.\u201d <em>Borough of Rockaway v.

Interest rates are lower now than they were at the time of the taking. And defendant\u2019s efforts to get a $3,000,000 offer for its property before the jury was rejected by the [clourt. That was an offer, nevertheless, defendant clearly intended to accept in exchange for the sale for the property. The real estate market is worse now than it was at the time that offer was made and at the time of the taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Based upon all of these circumstances in this particular case, and consistent with this [cjourt\u2019s prior ruling, the simple interest calculation of <em>[Rule] </em>4:42-11 is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">On appeal, defendant relies on the following passage from this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">If the full value of just compensation had been paid to the property owner contemporaneously with the taking, the landowner would have had the opportunity to earn compound interest on those funds. Prohibiting the landowner from recovering compound interest on a deficiency acts to effectively reduce the awarded past value by understating its present worth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">The thrust of the present proceeding is to make the plaintiff whole for the detention of monies justly due and owing. To apply an annual interest rate for the use of withheld funds and not insist on either timely payment of interest (eoncededly impossible) or annual compounding would be fatal to the very hypothesis that the detention is to be treated as a prudent business transaction. Indeed as the unpaid interest accumulates, the accumulated interest is the equivalent of an interest-free loan. This beneficence is not generally the hallmark of any prudent commercial transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\"><em>[Wildwood Crest, supra, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 563 A.2d 73 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5K\">We note that on occasion we have affirmed awards of interest at simple rates. <em>See, e.g., Hauck, supra, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 594, 722 A.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">At present, the Legislature has not provided a uniform rate of interest in condemnation actions, an omission that we specifically addressed in <em>Twp. of W.
