The only evidence introduced on the trial of the cause is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">\"Charley Wade, sworn for State, testified: I live on Hr. Charley Brown\u2019s farm in Freestone County; I had a mule in my possession last June belonging to Mr. Charley Brown. I turned the mule outside on Saturday evening, and on the following Monday evening I was walking through my field with John High, when I heard two gunshots in the direction of defendant\u2019s home; I took to be shotgun shots; there had been a shower of rain just prior to the time. Defendant lives on Mr. Jack Oliver\u2019s farm, about one-half mile north from where I live; he is the only person in charge of the Oliver farm. Mr. Oliver\u2019s fence is a three-wire fence and very good, but not five feet high; there is a wire gap near defendant\u2019s house; it is a very good gap. On Tuesday evening following the Monday when I heard the gunshots I sent my little boy out to look for the mule, and he found it in the Charley Brown old field, and when he brought it home I found that it had been shot twice with what I took to be a shotgun. I examined the mule and found it shot in its right hip and behind and side of neck, and its right eye shot out. I went and got Mr. J. B. Clark and Mr. Hash to see about the mule being shot; I tracked the mule to where it went into defendant\u2019s field at the gap and came back out; it seemed to have gone into the field a short distance and eaten some corn and circled in coming out, and from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>track it seemed to have been running when it came out. The track looked like Mr. Brown\u2019s mule track; I looked at the track at home and took the track in the field to be same track; the defendant had a smaller mule that made a smaller track. This was in Freestone County, Texas, on Monday, in June, 1910, just after emancipation day.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cCrossed by defendant: I don\u2019t know whether the mule was shot inside the enclosure of defendant or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cJohn High, sworn for State, testified: I live near defendant Tom High; some time last June I was walking with Charley Wade through his field, and I heard two gunshots in the direction of defendant\u2019s home; I took them to be shotgun shots. Wade remarked at the time that Tom is shooting squirrels already; there had just been a shower of rain. I did not think anything about the shooting at the time; I did not see the mule after it was wounded. Tom High lives about one-half mile north from Charley Wade; another man lives about one-fourth mile east from Tom High, and still another about one-half mile west from defendant\u2019s house. No one lives north from Tom High.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201cJ. B. Clark, sworn for the State, testified: I live near defendant Tom High; some time last June Charley Wade came after me and asked me to go over with him and see about a mule that belonged to Charley Brown, of Navarro County, which had been shot. I went over and we went to defendant\u2019s house but found no one at home; we went down to the gap; I saw the mule. It had been shot in its right hip and rectum and side of neck, and its right eye had been shot out. It seemed to have been shot from behind; it could have been wounded with one gunshot and maybe two. The shot were small No. 6 shot. I picked some of them out of the mule. When we got to the gap I went in and saw where a mule had been in the field a short distance; I saw Tom\u2019s track and the mule track and also saw two gun wads lying on the ground near the mule track; I did not see where the mule went out. I saw no tracks but Tom\u2019s where the mule had been. It had rained a shower and the tracks were plain. While we were at the gap Tom High, the defendant, came up and Charley Wade in some way intimated or accused Tom with having shot the mule. Tom denied it and jumped on- Charley Wade and we had one of the biggest nigger fights that I ever saw; this put an end to the investigation and we left.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u201cCrossed by defendant: I don\u2019t know whether the mule was shot inside the enclosure or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">While we are always loath to disturb the verdict on the insufficiency of the evidence, when there is no evidence other than suspicious circumstances, we can not let the verdict stand. Mere suspicion will not support a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
