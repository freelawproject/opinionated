An examination of the record shows that no judgment of sentence has ever been entered against the appellant. Hence, there is no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">It has been the uniform holding of this court, since article 834, Code of Criminal Procedure, was adopted, that the sentence after conviction was essential to show a final judgment.
