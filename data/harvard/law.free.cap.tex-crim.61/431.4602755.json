It .has been the uniform holding of this court that where this occurs to reverse the case. There are many opinions to this effect. Tyrell v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 159; Scott v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 495; Lively v. State, 72 S. W. Rep., 393; Allen v. State, 98 S. W. Rep., 869; Bills v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 541.
