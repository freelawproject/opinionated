Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error complains of the action of the court in overruling his motion to quash the indictment. An indictment in terms exactly similar to this was passed on by this court in Newman v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 223, 124 S. W. Rep., 956, and held to be a valid indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">2. In his second assignment of error appellant insists that one who practices as a \u201cmasseur\u201d is not guilty of any offense under the Act of the Thirtieth Legislature, pp. 224 to 228, and that the facts are insufficient to sustain the judgment. Whether or not the facts are sufficient was submitted to the jury trying the cause under a proper charge, and the jury find against appellant\u2019s contention. The court, at the instance of appellant, gave the two following special charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">(1) \u201cIf you find from the evidence that the defendant did not charge for his services as a masseur, or for treatment by any method or system, and receive pay for such treatment between the 27th day of May, 1909, and the 21st day of June, 1909, you will acquit him, and say by your verdict, we, the jury, find the defendant.not guilty,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">(2) \u201cYou are instructed that a masseur in his particular sphere of labor is not required to secure a certificate authorizing him to practice medicine, and if you believe from the evidence that defendant as a masseur practiced within the particular sphere of masseurs you will acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">These charges submit to the jury fairly the defense of appellant, and the case of Newman v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 223, 124 S. W. Rep., 956, so fully presents and discusses the question of when one who uses the massage treatment for disease would become liable, we deem it unnecessary to enter into an extended discussion of the question, but merely refer to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\">ON BEHEABING.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">March 1, 1911.</p>\n<author id=\"b365-14\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AY1\">\u2014At a former day of this term of court this case was affirmed, and appellant has filed a motion for rehearing, earnestly insisting that the evidence is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction, this being the only ground for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">We have carefully reread the testimony. Mrs. Pfeiffer states that she was treated by defendant for \u201cfloating kidney.\u201d \u201cHe treated me twenty-six days for $25, and then treated me another twenty-six days for $25. This was prior to May 27. I came to his office in Boerne and was treated. I made payments to him as I was able.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Mr. Pfeiffer stated: \u201cMy wife did the paying. After two months the treatment was to be free. She came to his office for treatment.\u201d Mrs. Bergman: \u201cI went \u2022 to defendant\u2019s office and was treated by him between May <em>27 </em>and June 31. He did not charge for his services during that time, but I gave him $10. He charged me for services prior to May 37.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Defendant run an advertisement in the Boerne paper: \u201cCome and take masseur treatment and learn to live without drugs.\u201d Under the construction of the medical practice Act by this court in Newman v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 223, 124 S. W. Rep., 956, these acts constituted a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Subdivision 3 of sec. 13 of chap. CXXIII of the Act of the Thirtieth Legislature, reads: \u201cAny person shall be regarded as practicing medicine who shall treat or offer to treat any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or any physical deformity, or injury by any system or method, or to effect cures thereof and charge therefor, directly or indirectly, money or other compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANHF\">If the jury hearing the testimony arrived at the conclusion that appellant was treating and offering to treat disease by some method and charged therefor, directly or indirectly, we can not say that there was no testimony to support their finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
