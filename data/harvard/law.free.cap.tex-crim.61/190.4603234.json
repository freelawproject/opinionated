On the trial of the case the court gave in charge only the law applicable to aggravated assault, and the jury found the defendant guilty of aggravated assault and assessed his punishment at a fine of $25.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">It appears from the record that appellant, prior to the date he was indicted, had plead guilty to simple assault, growing out of the same transaction, and paid his fine, and plead this in bar of this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">We have carefully read the testimony in this ease, with the view of seeing whether or not the issue of simple assault was raised. The State\u2019s witness, Jeff Owens, makes a clear case of aggravated assault, and under his testimony and the other witnesses, the jury would have been authorized to find defendant guilty of that grade of offense. But the testimony of the defendant, in our opinion, if true, would only make him guilty of a simple assault, and he had the right to have the question submitted to the jury. Pearce v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 643. The court in his charge did not present affirmatively defendant\u2019s right to be acquitted, if they found under the facts he was guilty -only of simple assault. The defendant asked a special charge, in substance that defendant having been punished for a simple assault growing out of this transaction, then if the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>assault, but had a reasonable doubt as to whether the assault was an aggravated \u00e1ssault, they would acquit. The special charge requested may not have been properly worded, yet it called the attention of the court to the law that if the jury had any doubt as to the degree of assault, whether aggravated or simple assault, the defendant should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Because of the failure of the court to submit affirmatively defendant\u2019s theory of thf&gt; case, this cause is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
