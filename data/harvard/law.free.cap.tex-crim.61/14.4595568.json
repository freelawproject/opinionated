By the statement of deceased it was shown that on the night of the killing deceased saw defendant and his companion by the light of the headlight of a passing car, and that they were crouching. about, and that shortly thereafter he was shot by defendant\u2019s companion from ambush near where defendant lived, while the deceased was standing on the sidewalk engaged in innocent conversation with a friend; that neither he nor his friend was engaged in any depredation against said house at any time; and that defendant and his companion were acting together when deceased was shot. This statement was substantially corroborated by the said friend of the deceased, who, while not positive as to the identity of the defendant and his codefendant, believed that he recognized them at the time, and that one or both did the shooting. The bullet used to kill the deceased corresponded with those fitting defendant\u2019s pistol, and other circumstances bore out the testimony of the State\u2019s principal witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">The defendant set up an alibi, and by the testimony of his witnesses sought to contradict the State\u2019s testimony, and to show by those who were said to have been present that he did not make the declaration that he intended to kill the person who threw the rocks, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>H.

In the fourth paragraph of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial he complains that one of the jurors was at the time of his service on the jury a deputy sheriff, and claims this is a disqualification. Article 673 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enumerates the causes for challenge to a particular juror, and the reason assigned is not one of them. The civil statutes relating to persons who are competent jurors do not name this as a disqualification, but gives to civil officers the right to exempt themselves from jury service if they so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>desire. This question was recently decided by this court adverse to appellant\u2019s contention in the case of Edgar v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 252, 127 S. W. Rep., 1053, and other cases recently reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\">2. Complaint is also made of the following paragraph of the court\u2019s charge: \u201cIf from the evidence you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of murder, but have a reasonable doubt whether it was committed upon express or implied malice, then you must give the defendant the benefit of such doubt and not find him guilty of a higher grade than murder in the second degree, if from the evidence you believe he is guilty of any offense,\u201d appellant alleging that paragraph does not give the defendant, the benefit of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. There is no merit in the contention. The court\u2019s charge, when taken as a whole, presents favorably to appellant the doctrine of reasonable doubt to every phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
