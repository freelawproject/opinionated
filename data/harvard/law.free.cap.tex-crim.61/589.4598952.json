The charge is not in the usual or ordinary language defining that term. It has been held by many decisions that there is no set form of words necessary to be employed in defining the term \u201cmalice.\u201d If that term has been sufficiently defined by the charge, although not in the usual form, this court will not be required to reverse. Any language that conveys to the jury the proper and correct legal idea of malice would be sufficient. We are of opinion that this charge does this. It informs the jury that if the party acted wilfully, intentionally and without lawful justification or excuse, and when his mind was sufficiently cool to contemplate the nature and character of the act and its probable consequences, then the shooting in law would be done upon malice. This seems to sufficiently cover the term. If the party intentionally and wilfully, without lawful justification or excuse, and while his mind was cool or sufficiently so to contemplate the nature and character of his act and its probable consequences, did the shooting with intent to kill, this would seem to be malice in law.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b616-9\">{Rehearing denied March 22, 1911.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It is also contended that the court erred in not defining assault. We are of opinion that the charge does sufficiently define assault. If one party shoots at another without excuse with a pistol and shoots him, this of itself is an assault. There would be no necessity for telling the jury that this would be an assault if it occurred. The mere statement of the fact would convey to the jury\u2019s minds that it would be unlawful and an assault, and if they found that that occurred, it would not only be an assault, but the other ingredients being present, it would be an assault with intent to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The other complaints of the charge we deem without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
