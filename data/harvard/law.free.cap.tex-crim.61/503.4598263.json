However, in this case there is neither bills of exception nor a statement of facts. The indictment charges the defendant with murder. The charge submits this offense to the jury, and the jury finds the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree. Ho error of record being apparent, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
