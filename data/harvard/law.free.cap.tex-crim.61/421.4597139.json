An inspection of a purported transfer shows that on June 8, 1910, the grand jury came into court and presented quite a number of indictments, numbering from 180 to 193, inclusive. There is an order of the court transferring these numbered cases to the County Court. The place where the defendant\u2019s name should occur in each case is left blank; in fact, each one of them reads as follows: \u201cThe State of Texas v. -, File No. 180.\u201d This was made to correspond with each number to and inclusive of 193. These cases by number were ordered to be transferred to the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Court, and the district clerk certifies that they were so transferred, but there is nothing in the certificate to show that appellant\u2019s case was included in these numbers or which one of them. When we go to the County Court proceedings we find that the file number there of appellant\u2019s case was Ho. 314. Whether this was intended to be the District or County Court number is not definitely shown. There must be something in the order of transfer to show that the particular case was transferred from the District to the County Court. There is no authority of law for the presentment in the County Court of an indictment. As this record presents itself to this court, there was no order of the District Court for the transfer of this case. Austin v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We are of opinion, as the record presents this matter, that the order of transfer is not sufficient to show or identify the case against appellant as being one of those that was transferred from the District to the County Court, and unless it was included in that particular transfer, then there is no order of any kind in the record to show the transfer. We are of opinion the motion should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
