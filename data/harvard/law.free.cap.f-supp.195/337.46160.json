Plaintiffs, until 1957, were manufacturers of dry and cellulose based wallpaper paste and wall size eliminator. Pennsylvania Paste, a defendant, also manufactures wallpaper paste and related products. Samuel Schultz &amp; Co., Empire Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co., and Atlas Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co. are all retailer defendants who, among other things, retail paste products in Philadelphia. Defendant Dow Chemical manufactures methyl-cellulose and sodium ortho-phe-nolphenate which it supplied to plaintiffs and which constituted the principal ingredients of plaintiffs\u2019 cellulose paste.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-20\">Plaintiffs\u2019 basic contention is the Pennsylvania Paste Co. conspired with all the other defendants to destroy plaintiffs\u2019 business and thereby preserve Pennsylvania Paste Co.\u2019s dominant position in the wet paste manufacturing business in the Philadelphia area and Dow\u2019s control of the use of methyl-cellulose and sodium ortho-phenolphenate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-21\">This case has a protracted history of pretrial discovery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and pretrial conferences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All defendants now move for summary judgment pursuant to F.R. 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. Defendants contend (1) that taking the pleadings of the plaintiffs, their admissions, depositions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>interrogatories, and Pre-Trial Statement of Contentions there is no factual basis to support the allegation of a conspiracy between the defendants; (2) that the alleged conspiracy was neither in restraint of trade nor did it affect interstate commerce within the meaning of the Sherman or Clayton Acts; (3) that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-5\">Plaintiffs argue (1) that defendants cannot, in the face of the paper record and contentions, establish that the alleged conspiracy did not exist; (2) that such a showing is required by the apposite law upon a motion for summary judgment; (3) that plaintiffs have demonstrated an ability to prove the conspiracy, as alleged, affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the anti-trust laws; and (4) that the statute of limitations is not applicable because it was a \u201ccontinuing\u201d conspiracy\u00bb and because it was concealed from the plaintiffs until 1954, within the four year period provided by the statute.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-13\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-14\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14 and 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-15\">.

Courts, in this circuit, have applied the broad rule of Frederick Hart &amp; Co., Inc. v. Recordgraph Corporation, 3 Cir., 169 F.2d 580, to summary judgment motions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The rule of the Hart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>opinion severely limits the Court\u2019s discretion to grant such a motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On at least one occasion, it would seem the Court of Appeals deviated from this approach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The extent to which the rule in Hart has been eroded by such deviations cannot be determined. However, I do not think that the Court here is now required to resolve this question, for, as will appear, determination of the issues raised by the motions for summary judgment is controlled by specific authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">2. Conspiracy raises a question of fact or, at least, a question of factual inference. As such, it may not be properly disposed of on summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Bragen v. Hudson County News Company, 3 Cir., 278 F.2d 615.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Bragen, the Court of Appeals, in reversing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in a Sherman Anti-Trust Act Case, through Judge Kalodner, stated: \u201cThe impact of particular circumstances upon an inference arising from an admittedly existing factual situation calls for a factual determination which is the function of the trier of facts and not * * * the court in disposing of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d At page 618. \u201cHere, in the instance cited, the District Court \u2018found\u2019 from the deposition, that an inference of monopolistic practice existed by reason of the unchallenged \u2018tie-in-sales\u2019 and then proceeded to make the factual finding that the existing inference was \u2018negatived\u2019 by other \u2018facts\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">\u201cAs we earlier stated, \u2018Documents filed in support of a motion for summary judgment are to be used for determining whether issues of fact exist and not to decide the fact issues themselves.\u2019 \u201d At page 618.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\"> In the case at bar, plaintiffs allege<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in their depositions set forth, at least, a scintilla of facts which might constitute a violative conspiracy. Defendants, by denials<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of negativing facts<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> move for summary judgment. In the face of the Court of Appeals\u2019 admonition in Bragen, defendants\u2019 motions cannot be granted.<footnotemark>13a</footnotemark> Moreover, where, as here, a jury trial has been demanded, it is necessary to be cautious in granting summary judgment and <em>not </em>to decide issues which should be left to the province of the jury. Bragen v. Hudson County News Company, 3 Cir., 278 F.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">3. In support of their motions for summary judgment, defendants further argue plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, in whole or in part,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs counter that under the case of United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 31 S.Ct. 124, 54 L.Ed. 1168, a conspiracy to monopolize continues until the conspiracy succeeds; and that in the instant case the conspiracy continued until plaintiffs were forced out of business in 1957; and that, under Kissel, while the conspiracy still exists, the statute of limitations is tolled. Since plaintiffs brought, their action in 1958, they argue it is-timely. Further, plaintiffs contend the statutory period does not run until plaintiffs \u201cdiscover\u201d the conspiracy, which such discovery, according to their allegations, did not occur until 1954, within the statutory limit. For this second proposition, plaintiffs cite Moviecolor Limited v. Eastman Kodak Co., 2 Cir., 288 F.2d 80, which concerns the law of concealment in anti-trust litigation. Concealment is different from a failure-to discover.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although plaintiffs assert they failed to discover the conspiracy, I shall, in the light of their reliance on Moviecolor Limited v. Eastman Kodak Co., supra, consider their failure to discover to mean it was due to-concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Plaintiffs are correct in their statement of the rule of United States v. Kis-sel, supra, but they fail to note that the-court, in that instance, had reference to a criminal conspiracy under the anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>trust laws. The authorities have held the Kissel rule has no application to a statute of limitations problem in a civil conspiracy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I held, in part, for example, in Henis v. Compania Agricola De Guatemala, D.C.Del., 116 F.Supp. 223, at page 226: \u201cThe distinction between the application of a Statute of Limitations in a criminal conspiracy case and such application in a civil case based upon a conspiracy has been clearly pointed out in Momand v. Universal Film Exchanges, 1 Cir., 172 F.2d 37, at page 49. There it is shown that in a criminal prosecution the Statute of Limitations does not begin to run until the last overt act performed in compliance with the original agreement has been accomplished. A civil case, however, is based upon the damage caused by the commission of the overt act and the applicable statute must run from the time of the commission of that act which is alleged to have caused the damage. * * *\"</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"> Thus, absent concealment, all activity which occurred before 1954 may be introduced <em>as evidence of the existing conspiracy, but may not be the basis of a cause of action upon tohich plaintiffs may recover. </em>Plaintiffs here allege conspiratorial activity by all defendants up until 1957. Defendants\u2019 denial<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of such activity raises a question of fact which, at least initially, should be put to the jury. However, at the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case the court will entertain motions under FR 41b, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The essential elements of concealment of a civil conspiracy under the anti-trust laws, where a motion for summary judgment had been made, were stated by Judge Clary in Philco Corporation v. Radio Corporation of America, D.C.E.D. Pa., 186 F.Supp. 155. There he said (at page 163): \u201cFirst Philco says * * * * the only persons having knowledge of the facts were the conspirators themselves * * * \u2019 (Paragraph 100 of complaint). Stated affirmatively\u2014 Philco was without knowledge of the cause of action. Next they say \u2018[Phil-co] charged R.C.A. with such action [but they] vigorously denied it.\u2019 (Paragraph 100 of complaint). Stated another way \u2014 R.C.A. committed an affirmative act of concealment of this cause of action. Finally, they allege that \u2018since the only persons having knowledge of the facts were the conspirators themselves, it was apparent to Philco that further investigation would be fruitless.\u2019 (Paragraph 100 of complaint). Restated\u2014 no amount of diligence on Philco\u2019s part would have uncovered this cause of action. These allegations taken together constitute the essential elements of the defense of concealment. Had the defendants, without more, presented their present motion for summary judgment, their request would necessarily have been denied, since the pleadings alone raise a genuine issue as to a material fact, (whether or not there was concealment of the cause of action by R.C. A. so as to toll the statute of limitations). See Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Title 28, USCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Judge Clary granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding Philco had actual notice of a meeting between the alleged conspirators to formulate the conspiratorial plan, and such notice was given prior to four years before the institution of the case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>case at bar, although plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are confused,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> they would seem to fit within the traditional formula for concealment set out by Judge Clary. The fact that upon certain occasions retailer defendants told plaintiffs that Pennsylvania Paste was attempting to destroy their business<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> does not negate these allegations. Such evidence goes to possible knowledge of one of the defendants, not to any concerted action by all.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">For these reasons, I think an issue of fact exists as to whether plaintiffs\u2019 suit, in whole or in part, is barred by the statute of limitations. Therefore, on this aspect of the case, summary judgment should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">4. Defendants Pennsylvania Paste and Schultz Company both argue for summary judgment because plaintiffs\u2019 supporting papers and the present state of the record establish that the alleged conspiracy did not affect interstate commerce within the meaning of the anti-trust laws. The rule, however, of \u201ceffect upon interstate commerce\u201d laid down in Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741, and Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co. et al., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S.Ct. 365, 5 L.Ed.2d 358, is very broad. The Supreme Court has stated the rule to encompass any situation where the use of economic leverage through group boycott or efforts has been used to limit or close an individual entrepreneur\u2019s access to supply or disposition of goods in interstate commerce, or used to foreclose market entry or market operations regardless of the perceptible market effect.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under the strictist reading of this rule, it is apparent from the uncontested facts that, as a matter of law, the alleged conspiracy, if proven, affected interstate commerce. The uncontested facts supporting this view are the materials which plaintiffs bought from Dow for use in their products moved in interstate commerce;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Pennsylvania Paste Company\u2019s business operations are interstate;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and plaintiffs\u2019 products were distributed nationally through Arthur S. Hoyt &amp; Co.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment are denied on all counts. The court will entertain a motion setting an appropriate date for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. <em>In the Circuit Court of Appeals:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">Johnston v.

Hudson County News Company, D.C.N.J., 168 F.Supp. 231, was an action by a retailer of newspapers, magazines and other publications against an exclusive distributor thereof for dam-ags alleged to have resulted from distributor\u2019s violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by requiring retailer to accept \u201cdirty books\u201d as a condition of a continuing supply of morally wholesome publications. There, after examination of the plaintiff\u2019s contentions, supporting affidavits and depositions, Judge Worten-dyke granted summary judgment and said in part (at page 234):</p>\n<p id=\"aau-dedup-0\">\u201cThe complaint herein does not contain the familiar allegations in a charged monopoly that there is a conspiracy to fix prices, divide marketing territories, apportion customers, restrict production or otherwise suppress competition. Cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 1940, 310 U.S. 469, 494-498, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311. The pleadings and proof before me simply show a personal grievance between Bragen and Hudson arising from the refusal of the latter to continue doing business with Bragen. Cf. Shotkin v. General Electric Co., supra [10 Cir, 171 F.2d 236]; Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hales Stores, 9 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 214, certiorari granted 358 U.S. 809, 79 S.Ct. 23 [3 L.Ed.2d 54]. * * * Clearly, Hudson\u2019s refusal to sell is not grounded in any attempt to monopolize since it is undisputed that service would be resumed upon the settlement of the claim for money owing. In the absence of any scheme to fix prices or eliminate competition such action is not offensive to the Sherman Act. Interborough News Co. v. Curtis Publishing Co., 2 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 289.\u201d At page 235.</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">\u201cFurther Bragen is free to sell magazines, periodicals, and newspapers supplied by others than Hudson and indeed docs so. See Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., 1923, 261 U.S. 463, 43 S.Ct. 450, 67 L.Ed. 746. There is nothing to show that Hudson exercises any restraint over the distribution of magazines and publications other than those which it distributes. Journal of Commerce Pub. Co. v. Tribune Co., 7 Cir., 1922, 286 F. 111. Lastly, any inference that this is a monopolistic practice is negatived by the fact that Hudson gives full credit to the retailer for any magazines and .paper-backed books it supplied which were unsold by the retailers.\u201d At page 235.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b405-19\">.

In that case, summary judgment was granted because of plaintiff\u2019s express admission: \u201cHowever, this allegation must be interpreted and considered in the light of Bernard Taxin\u2019s deposition which concedes that the Man-dell defendants had nothing to do with alleged fraudulent representation by the Food Fair defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The contested facts of Bragen and the case at bar could not support a similar finding for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\">.
