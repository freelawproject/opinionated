CRONE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the court is Plaintiff Robert P. Theriot's (\"Theriot\") Motion to Abstain and to Remand (# 5), wherein Theriot requests the court remand this action back to state court. Having considered the pending motion, the submissions of the parties, the pleadings, and the applicable law, the court is of the opinion that remand is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some point prior to January 31, 2016, Theriot underwent surgery on his foot. Due to this surgery, he required the use of a wheelchair. On January 31, 2016, Theriot fell out of his wheelchair, injuring his wound from the previous surgery. Thus, on February 1, 2016, he underwent a second surgery to repair and reattach a skin flap from the first surgery. A few days later, Theriot's home-health nurse noticed that the site had started to dehisce. Eventually, on February 12, 2016, Theriot required an above-the-knee amputation due to the infection of the wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of his amputation, Theriot owned a group accident insurance policy issued by Defendant Transamerica Life Insurance Company (\"Transamerica\"), which provided benefits for accidental death and dismemberment. After his amputation, Theriot contacted Transamerica and made a claim under this policy for the loss of his leg. Transamerica denied the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 18, 2017, Theriot filed suit in the 163rd Judicial District Court of Orange County, Texas, asserting claims arising out of Transamerica's denial of coverage. Specifically, Theriot contends that Transamerica knowingly engaged in false, misleading, deceptive, and unconscionable acts, practices, or omissions actionable under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"DTPA\") and Chapter 541 of the Texas Insurance Code (the \"Insurance Code\") as well as unfair claim settlement practices and misrepresentation of an insurance policy as prohibited by the Insurance Code. Additionally, Theriot asserts claims for common law fraud, negligence, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, negligent management, and breach of contract. As relief, Theriot requests actual damages in the form of payment of insurance proceeds of $40,000.00, along with statutory damages for violation of the Insurance Code, damages for mental anguish, exemplary damages, and all costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Transamerica removed the action to this court on February 22, 2017, on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Subsequently, on March 28, 2017, Theriot filed a motion to remand, contending that Transamerica's removal was improper. Significantly, Theriot does not dispute that diversity of citizenship exists among the parties. Rather, the salient issue is whether the amount in controversy requirement has been met. Additionally, Theriot requests the court to order sanctions against Transamerica, including the reasonable costs and attorney's fees associated with Transamerica's removal and Theriot's motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Removal Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

First, although Theriot's petition did not specify an amount of damages, it is facially apparent that the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory minimum. Second, Transamerica's assertions regarding the amount in controversy in its notice of removal are not entirely conclusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ANPAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513491\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/559/#p565\">\n    988 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   566 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elizondo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20625327\">\n    1996 WL 625327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Sterns v.

La. July 8, 2010). Finally, Theriot's assertions regarding his recovery were made in his motion to remand, not in a sworn affidavit. To be effective, a stipulation of damages must state not only that a plaintiff is seeking damages below the jurisdictional amount; it must also waive the plaintiff's right to recover a judgment that exceeds that amount.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Tex. Sept. 2, 2010) (granting remand where stipulation stated that plaintiff could not obtain a judgment in excess of $75,000.00). Thus, the court finds that Theriot's attempt at limiting his recovery does not compel remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is apparent from the original petition that the amount in controversy can reasonably be construed to exceed $75,000.00 and that there is complete diversity between the parties. Further, Theriot has not shown to a \"legal certainty\" that the amount in controversy is below the jurisdictional minimum. Therefore, in view of the nature of Theriot's multiple claims, the myriad damages sought, and the court's familiarity with the amount of attorney's fees generally charged in the area for this type of litigation, the court concludes that Theriot's claims can reasonably be construed to exceed $75,000.00 and, hence, are adequate to support federal jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, Theriot's action shall remain in this federal forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under the federal removal statute, \"[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Nonetheless, even when the case is remanded, the Fifth Circuit has made it clear that \"[t]here is no automatic entitlement to an award of attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753243\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/290/#p292\">\n    199 F.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (5th Cir. 2000). Rather, such fees awards are discretionary and generally are proper only where \"the removing party lacks an objectively reasonable basis for removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard v. St. Germain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222665\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/455/#p457\">\n    599 F.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (5th Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319474\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/538/#p541\">\n    385 F.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541 (5th Cir. 2004). In the case at bar, Theriot contends that he is entitled to \"reasonable expenses incurred by [him] in preparing and presenting this motion, including reasonable attorney's fees ... [and] all costs, expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by [him] as a result of the removal action.\" He does not, however, cite any law in support of his proposition. In fact, the removal statute makes it clear that such an award is discretionary and warranted only where the removal was frivolous.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). As stated above, remand is not proper in this case; thus, the requested sanctions are likewise inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An evaluation of the relevant facts and controlling law reveals that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. Although no federal question is presented, complete diversity of citizenship exists between the parties, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.00. Therefore, this case was properly removed, and remand is not warranted. Accordingly, Theriot's Motion to Remand is DENIED. Furthermore, because Theriot's motion to remand is unwarranted, his request for sanctions against Transamerica is likewise DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In his original state court petition, Theriot pleaded damages in the statutory range of \"$100,000 or less.\" Transamerica maintains that this makes the action removable. That argument is without merit, however, as this is the lowest range available under state law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Because Theriot specifically pleaded that he was entitled to recover $40,000.00 under the insurance policy, the court must consider that amount rather than his post-removal allegations that the actual recovery would be reduced to $20,000.00 or $10,000.00.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
