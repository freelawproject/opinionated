Plaintiff has been housed at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, MCI-Concord, MCI-Shirley (Medium), and/or NCCI-Gardner at all times relevant to this litigation. On September 17, 2017, this Court issued an order dismissing all of Plaintiff's claims except found that Counts III and IV were plausibly pled. (Docket No. 87). Plaintiff's surviving claims are against Defendant Melendez for retaliation in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count III) and Defendants Nelligan and Cresey for failure to protect in violation of the Eighth Amendment (Count IV).
