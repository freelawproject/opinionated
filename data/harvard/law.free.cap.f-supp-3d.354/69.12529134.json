COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On an October day in 2015, Jason Goolsby was pondering whether to withdraw money from an ATM outside a Citibank in Washington, D.C. From inside the ATM vestibule, Goolsby saw a young couple with a child in a stroller approaching and, he says, held the door to help them in. The mother, Caucasian, apparently felt uneasy in the presence of Goolsby and his two\n   friends, all African-American. So she told her husband that she forgot something in the car, immediately left the vestibule, and called the police. What transpired next is the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Goolsby alleges that dispatchers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") misreported the woman's 911 call and that responding MPD officers attacked him without good reason. He brought a spate of federal constitutional and D.C. common-law claims, seeking redress for the injuries he allegedly sustained. In an earlier decision considering only the constitutional claims, the Court held that the dispatchers and officers were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed all but one of the claims. Turning now to the defendants' motion to dismiss the common-law claims-with the barrier of qualified immunity no longer standing in the way-the Court reaches a different result: almost all of Goolsby's common-law claims survive dismissal and must proceed to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

They then \"converged on the teenagers as if they were apprehending a dangerous felon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.

Goolsby contends that the dispatchers and the responding officers breached their duty of care to him by conveying false or inaccurate information from a citizen's 911 call, failing to investigate the information provided in the dispatch in order to \"accurately assess and respond to a potential criminal situation[,]\" stopping a citizen without reasonable and articulable suspicion, and using excessive force in detaining him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. The dispatchers counter that Goolsby has failed to plead facts that could establish the duty and causation elements. The officers, for their part, argue that Goolsby's negligence claim is improperly pled because his allegations in support of the claim are coextensive\n   with his allegations in support of his intentional tort claims. The Court disagrees on both fronts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    1. Dispatchers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The dispatchers submit that Gooslby's allegations, even if taken as true, fail to establish the duty and causation elements of a negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning first to duty, the critical question is whether the District of Columbia's \"public duty\" doctrine-which holds that law enforcement personnel \"are not generally liable to victims of criminal acts for failure to provide adequate police protection\"-applies to the facts in this case.\n   <em>\n    Warren v.

Here, however, Goolsby complains that it was the dispatchers' (and the responding officers') affirmative misconduct-rather than their failure to protect-that caused his injuries. He alleges that the dispatchers \"passed on false information to the MPD Officers,\" Pl's Opp., ECF No. 25, at 15, an affirmative act that he says caused the responding officers to respond over-aggressively,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Because the \"harm was brought about\n   <em>\n    directly by the government itself\n   </em>\n   \" and because \"there is no allegation of a 'failure to protect' \" from third-party harm, Goolsby contends the public duty doctrine is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Goolsby is correct, as comparison to other cases applying D.C. negligence law confirms.

The dispatchers say that he has failed to plead both the cause-in-fact and policy components of proximate cause. Dispatchers' MTD at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The dispatchers' conduct counts as a cause-in-fact of Goolsby's injuries if it was a \"substantial factor in bringing about the harm.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

Taking Goolsby's factual allegations as true, it would be strange to say that the inaccurate information relayed by the dispatchers was not a substantial factor in his ultimate injuries. Had the dispatchers not reported an attempted robbery, it is unlikely that the officers would have approached Goolsby in the first place. Moreover, even assuming that the officers would have approached Goolsby regardless of the dispatchers' mistake, the officers may have responded in a less aggressive and frightening manner-and Goolsby would not have fled nor been arrested in the rough manner he alleges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Opp. at 15-16.

Said another way, the former is \"an intervening act or force\" that is not \"a normal consequence of [the allegedly negligent] acts\"; the latter very much is. 65 C.J.S. Negligence \u00a7 206 (2007) (discussing intervening causes). But even assuming that both fight and flight are unforeseeable reactions, more pressing policy concerns-ones not nearly as prominent here-clearly animated the D.C.

Again, the jury verdict in\n   <em>\n    Hundley\n   </em>\n   meant that, even if a suspect responded violently to an officer's approach, the officer might be on the hook civilly for any ensuing injuries. That would put police in a serious predicament, and understandably might deter them from initiating legitimate stops. Here, by contrast, nothing in the Court's ruling means officers must risk liability for defending themselves in response to a suspect's violent actions; it means only that officers can be held accountable for using unreasonable force when a suspect flees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Goolsby's decision to flee does not preclude a finding of proximate cause. It was reasonably foreseeable that the dispatchers' relaying of false information might cause the responding officers to approach Goolsby over-aggressively and ultimately lead to his alleged injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    2. Officers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The officers take a different tack to secure dismissal of Goolsby's negligence claim. They contend that Goolsby's complaint improperly conflates his negligence claim with his intentional tort claims, in particular his excessive force claim. Under D.C. law, \"negligence must be distinctly pled and based upon at least one factual scenario that presents an aspect of negligence apart from the use of excessive force itself and violative of a distinct standard of care.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Chinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059331\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/701/#p711\">\n    839 A.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (D.C. 2003). The officers charge that Goolsby's complaint does not pass muster under\n   <em>\n    Chinn\n   </em>\n   , since the facts underpinning his negligence claim are the same facts supporting his assault and battery, false imprisonment, and excessive force claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Goolsby's response is two-fold: first, he says he has alleged enough facts to support a negligence theory that is independent of his other claims, and, second, contrary\n   to the government's assertion, he says D.C. law permits claims based on the same facts to go forward under different tort theories. To his first point, Goolsby suggests that the government is cherry picking amongst his claims because two of his examples of negligent conduct are wholly distinct from his intentional tort claims: the officers' failure (1) to investigate the reported crime in order to verify and appropriately respond to the situation, and (2) to prevent other officers from using unreasonable and unnecessary force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Opp. at 18-19. This alone defeats the government's argument, Goolsby contends, because he has articulated \"an aspect of negligence apart from the use of excessive force itself\" that is \"violative of a distinct standard of care.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059331\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/701/#p711\">\n    839 A.2d at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And if this claim proceeds to discovery, Goolsby will develop evidence, presumably through expert testimony, to support his allegations that the officers deviated from the standard of care. As for his second point, Goolsby asserts that the government mischaracterizes\n   <em>\n    Chinn\n   </em>\n   and other relevant case law, which actually permits intentional tort and negligence claims regarding police misconduct to be submitted to the jury based on the same facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059331\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/839/701/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

The Court finds that he just barely has done so. Paragraph 62 of his complaint is most relevant here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [The officers] owed a duty of care to Jason to use reasonable measures in their investigation of a 911 call and in their treatment of Jason. These duties included;\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , ... investigating a 911 caller's claims of potential crimes in order to accurately assess and respond to a potential criminal situation; not stopping a suspect without reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime has been committed; and protecting suspects from bodily harm through the use of only reasonable and necessary force, to include preventing fellow MPD officers from employing excessive force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 62. Though Goolsby purports to expound on the applicable standards of care in the following paragraph, there he quite clearly conflates his negligence claims with his intentional tort claims, speaking exclusively in the language of battery, excessive force, and the like.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the excerpt quoted above, the only standards of care distinct from the standards governing his intentional tort claims\n   are the allegations related to the duty to \"investigat[e] a 911 caller's claims of potential crimes in order to accurately assess and respond to a potential criminal situation\" and the duty to \"prevent[ ] fellow MPD officers from employing excessive force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Though Goolsby does not expound on the source or requirements of these standards-or how they differ meaningfully from the standards relevant to his intentional tort claims-he may be able to do so with the aid of discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7944798\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/442/159/\">\n    442 A.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing how plaintiff used \"police regulation on safe use of firearms\" to substantiate negligence claim). Accordingly, the Court will deny the officers' motion to dismiss Goolsby's negligence claim. The Court notes, however, that Goolsby should, if he wishes to survive summary judgment, develop with greater specificity the standards of care applicable to his negligence claim and explain how those standards are distinct from those governing his intentional tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Count II: False Imprisonment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    1. Dispatchers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The dispatchers contend that a cause of action for false imprisonment cannot lie against them since they did not participate in the actual on-scene investigation and stop of Goolsby. But the dispatchers cite no case to support that proposition, and the Court has found authority pointing in the opposition direction. In\n   <em>\n    Amobi v. District of Columbia Department of Corrections\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). However unlikely it is that Goolsby can ultimately prove that the dispatchers \"consciously misstate[d] the facts ... for the purpose of inducing action by the police,\"\n   <em>\n    Vessels v.

The dispatchers' motion to dismiss Goolsby's false imprisonment claim will therefore be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    2. Officers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The parties agree that the governing standard for a common-law false-imprisonment claim is \"the restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another without consent or legal justification.\"\n   <em>\n    Faniel v.

There is no dispute that Goolsby's physical liberty was restrained. The issue then is whether Goolsby has pled sufficient facts to establish that MPD did not have a legal justification to detain him.

The officers contend that reasonable suspicion arose from the report they received on the dispatch regarding a possible crime in progress. Officers' MTD at 9.

But their argument puts the cart before the horse. There are several (largely factual) disputes that must be resolved in order to determine whether the officers had the legal justification to detain Goolsby. To name but a few:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1) Did the officers subject Goolsby to a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop or an arrest? Though the officers used force to apprehend Goolsby, and then later put him in handcuffs, that does not automatically turn a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop into a full-blown arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Cir. 2017). Depending on how long Goolsby remained handcuffed, it is possible that what was initially a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop evolved into an arrest-and an arrest, of course, requires probable cause, not mere reasonable suspicion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2) At what point in the episode did the various officers develop either reasonable suspicion or probable cause that Goolsby was committing, or had committed, a crime? Was it the dispatch alone? Was the information contained in the dispatch enough on its own to provide reasonable suspicion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   3) On the other hand, if discovery reveals that some of the officers developed reasonable suspicion only after Goolsby decided to flee, then what was their legal justification for attempting to stop Goolsby in the first instance?\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While the government suggests that the dispatch report by itself provided the officers with reasonable suspicion, the pleadings alone lack the necessary details to resolve the issue, such as a description of the individuals provided by the dispatch, a description of the reported \"criminal activity,\" a location, the timing between when the dispatch occurred and when the police officers arrived at the scene, and if the identity of the caller was known at the time of the message. That information is necessary to determine whether the dispatch report actually did supply the officers with reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

That distinction is a critical one.\n   <em>\n    Stubblefield\n   </em>\n   teaches that, if the officers needed probable cause to detain Goolsby in the manner they did, their case\n   would be far stronger if the dispatch report by itself furnished the officers with reasonable suspicion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310500,4256143\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/445/\">\n    820 F.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hile flight alone cannot sustain a finding of probable cause, it\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   when coupled with pre-existing reasonable and articulable suspicion.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At bottom, then, in order for Goolsby to properly challenge the officers' reasons for stopping him, he should know the exact basis, as explained by the officers, for the seizure.

It is difficult to assess the reasonableness of the officers' threats and subsequent physical force without knowing what precipitated those acts. If the officers lacked the reasonable suspicion to conduct even an investigatory stop, the decision to approach Goolsby as aggressively as he alleges would probably be unjustified; similarly, if the officers lacked reasonable suspicion in the first place, the fact of Goolsby's flight alone would not likely provide ample justification for tackling him to the ground. Said another way, an officer cannot \"reasonably believe[ ] [it is] necessary\" to drive full speed at an unsuspecting civilian if he does not have good reason to think that person has done anything wrong, nor can officers \"reasonably believe[ ] [it is] necessary\" to tackle and handcuff someone they do not think has committed a crime.\n   <em>\n    Dormu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193566\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/795/7/#p27\">\n    795 F.Supp.2d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on the allegations in the complaint, the relaying of false information under the circumstances here-even if done intentionally-does not rise to the level of outrageousness required to state a claim for IIED. Goolsby alleges that the 911 caller did not actually report a robbery, but only told the dispatchers that the three men-Goolsby and two friends-made her nervous by standing so close to her in the ATM vestibule at the bank. The dispatchers, in turn, allegedly reported to the officers that there had been an attempted robbery or that one was imminent. Even if fact-finding bore out that allegation, the chasm between what the 911 caller said and what the dispatchers reported is not so wide as to render the dispatchers' actions \"beyond all possible bounds of decency,\" \"atrocious,\" and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9131778\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/254/89/#p102\">\n    254 F.Supp.2d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will therefore dismiss the IIED claim against the dispatchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Next, the officers. Goolsby's theory of the case, and in particular his belief that the dispatchers played a critical part in causing his injuries, proves fatal to his IIED claim against the officers. Goolsby alleges that the officers, relying on an allegedly false dispatch report, believed they were responding to an attempted robbery or other crime in progress. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-34. Even if, as the Court has already discussed, that dispatch report did not furnish an adequate basis for reasonable suspicion or probable cause, surely it prevents the officers' decision to approach Goolsby from qualifying as \"beyond all possible bounds of decency\" and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liser\n   </em>\n   , 254 Supp. 2d at 106. The dispatch may have been mistaken, and the officers may have been mistaken to rely on it, but that does not mean their actions were sufficiently beyond the pale to form the predicate of an IIED claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Comparison to other cases involving an IIED claim based on alleged police misconduct confirms this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Amons v.
