(\"Aardvark\"). (Dkt. No. 1.) In the operative Second Amended Complaint, filed April 20, 2016, Bobcar alleges patent infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and unfair competition under New York law. (Dkt. No. 12 (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 93-131.) Aardvark has also asserted\n   counterclaims against Bobcar, seeking a declaratory judgment that the six patents on which Bobcar bases its suit are invalid, that Aardvark did not infringe Bobcar's patents or trade dress, and that Aardvark did not engage in unfair competition. (Dkt. No. 22 at 22-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Aardvark moved to dismiss the patent infringement claims in the Second Amended Complaint for lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 101.) Specifically, Aardvark argues that Bobcar did not own the patents at issue at the time it filed suit, and that Bobcar thus cannot sue for patent infringement. (Dkt. No. 102 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on the evidence submitted by the parties, the Court agrees that Bobcar has not sufficiently demonstrated that it possessed standing to initiate this action. Therefore, at this point in time, the Court is inclined to grant Aardvark's motion. However, the Court will delay ruling on the motion to dismiss for ten days, to give Bobcar the opportunity to either file a sur-reply to the motion to dismiss, or move to add the original inventors, David Hazan and Benjamin Cohen, as plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bobcar filed the operative Second Amended Complaint in this action on April 20, 2016. (Dkt. No. 12.) Aardvark moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), and the Court denied the motion on January 4, 2017. (Dkt. Nos. 13 &amp; 21.) Aardvark subsequently filed its Answer, which asserted counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment in Aardvark's favor on each of Bobcar's claims. (Dkt. No. 22 at 22-31.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fact discovery in this action closed on August 17, 2018. (Dkt. No. 99.) The instant motion to dismiss was filed on September 7, 2018. (Dkt. No. 101.) On November 14, 2018, the parties completed their claim construction briefing (Dkt. Nos. 104, 107-108, 110), and a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing before the Court is scheduled for December 19, 2018 (Dkt. No. 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are taken from the operative Complaint and the parties' submissions regarding the motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC; Dkt. Nos. 101-103, 105-106.) Familiarity with the matter, as set forth in the Court's prior opinion in this case, is presumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bobcar Media, LLC v. Aardvark Event Logistics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 885,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2074729\">\n    2017 WL 74729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The patent infringement claims in this case involve three utility patents and three design patents relating to Bobcar's promotional vehicles: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,942,461 (\"the '461 patent\") ; 8,220,854 (\"the '854 patent\") ; 8,690,215 (\"the '215 patent\") ; D652,353 (\"the '353 patent\") ; D678,823 (\"the '823 patent\") ; D736,675 (\"the '675 patent\"). (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-14.) The first of these, the '461 patent, was issued on May 17,\n   2011, and lists the inventors as Benjamin Cohen and David Hazan, and the assignee as Bobcar Media, LLC. (Dkt. No. 12-1 at 1.) The other five patents were issued between January 2012 and August 2015, list Cohen and Hazan as the inventors and Bobcar as the assignee, and are related to the '461 patent through a chain of patent applications that are continuations and continuations in part of the '461 patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 12-2 through 12-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During fact discovery in this matter, Bobcar did not produce any documents constituting the written assignment of the patents at issue from the inventors (the putative assignors) to the putative assignee, Bobcar. (Dkt. No. 102 at 2; Dkt. No. 103-3 at 26; Dkt. No. 105 at 3.) Counsel for Bobcar, Morris Cohen, represented at a February 14, 2018 telephonic conference before the Court that he \"believe[s] there was an assignment document\" when the patent applications were filed, and that if a copy of the original written assignment document \"still exists\" it would have been produced; but counsel was unsure whether \"there are still copies of those documents.\" (Dkt. No. 103-3 at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   David Hazan-inventor of the patents and Bobcar's designated Rule 30(b)(6) witness-was asked about the existence of an assignment document at his Rule 30(b)(6) deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. There's a verbal agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Yes.

No. 105-1 at 218-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition, accompanying its opposition to the motion to dismiss, Bobcar submitted a declaration from Benjamin Cohen-the other inventor on the patents and the current President of Bobcar (Dkt. No. 105-12 \u00b6 1)-regarding the alleged assignment. Cohen avers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   David Hazan and I both executed a document many years ago assigning to Bobcar all of our rights in the patent applications that we filed, i.e. all our rights to the patents-in-suit.... Both of us agreed that our company Bobcar would be the owner of our rights to the patents-in-suit, and we executed that document for the purpose of transferring to Bobcar any and all our rights to the patents-in-suit.... There is no question in my mind that our written transfer of our rights to Bobcar was executed many years before the February 2016 filing of suit in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Dkt. No. 105-12 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7.) Bobcar has also submitted \"confirmations of assignment\" from both Cohen and Hazan, which confirm that the inventors assigned to Bobcar all rights in the patents at issue, and that the \"original written assignment\" of the patents occurred \"prior to April 5, 2011.\" (Dkt.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Aardvark moves to dismiss the patent claims in the Second Amended Complaint, contending that Bobcar lacks standing to claim patent infringement because it did not own the patents at issue when it commenced this action. (Dkt. No. 102 at 1.) Bobcar responds that although it lost the assignment document, it nonetheless possesses standing to assert patent infringement because it can sufficiently demonstrate that an assignment of the patents at issue in fact occurred.

An entity that is not the original recipient of a\n   patent is also considered a \"patentee\" with statutory standing to sue for infringement in its own right if it is the \"assignee[ ]\" and current owner of the patent, or an \"exclusive licensee[ ] who w[as] given all substantial rights to the patent.\"\n   <em>\n    My First Shades v.

(Dkt. No. 106 at 1.) From this evidentiary gap, Aardvark infers that a written assignment was never executed and Bobcar was not the true owner of the patents when it brought this case. (Dkt. No. 102 at 7-8.) Bobcar responds that although it has lost the assignment document, it can prove that an assignment occurred through the testimony of the two inventors and\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   assignments, corroborated by the patent applications. (Dkt. No. 105 at 4-8). Aardvark contends that this evidence is insufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 106 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In resolving Aardvark's motion to dismiss, the ultimate question for the Court is whether Bobcar has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was in fact a written assignment of the patents at issue. Aardvark asserts that Bobcar cannot meet its burden, because the evidence on which Bobcar attempts to rely is (1) \"inadmissible\" and (2) otherwise \"deficient,\" and because (3) even if the Court accepts the evidence Bobcar has put forward, that evidence is insufficient to show that each of the six patents at issue was assigned in writing. (Dkt. No. 106 at 2-4.) The Court agrees that the evidence on which Bobcar relies is inadmissible to prove the contents\n   of the alleged original written assignment; therefore, at this point in time, Bobcar has not proven that a written assignment was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In resolving a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, courts can rely on evidence outside the pleadings only if such evidence would be admissible on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MMA Consultants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274723\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/486/#p499\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Aardvark contends that the evidence relied on by Bobcar should be \"deemed inadmissible,\" because Bobcar has not \"offered any evidence that the purported assignment existed, much less was lost.\" (Dkt.

Here, though, Bobcar contends that it cannot produce the original assignment document because \"the document was lost.\" (Dkt. No. 105 at 4.) Bobcar's opposition brief states that \"[t]he document may still exist somewhere, or it may be lost. With Bobcar's prior move of offices, it has not been found to date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.1.)

And because Bobcar has adduced no admissible evidence to prove the contents of the document, it has not proven by a preponderance that it owned the patents at issue and had statutory standing to sue when the case was filed. Therefore, based on the evidence before the Court at this point in time, the Court is inclined to conclude that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court will postpone ruling on Aardvark's motion to dismiss for ten days, however, to give Bobcar the opportunity to file further submissions responding to Aardvark's reply brief (Dkt.

However, in support of its motion to dismiss, Aardvark asserts that Bobcar cannot cure any \"standing defect by joining the actual owners of the Asserted Patents to this suit.\" (Dkt. No. 102 at 11.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 103-4 at 228.) From the representations of the inventors, corroborated by the patent applications, the Court concludes that the inventors at a minimum verbally agreed to transfer all rights in the patents to Bobcar. Such an agreement-an assignment in all but memorialization-by-writing-is the equivalent of an implied exclusive license. As such, Bobcar would have statutory standing to sue for patent infringement if the inventors of the patents were also joined as plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Under Federal Circuit precedent, \"an exclusive licensee with less than all substantial rights in the patent [that] did not have the right to sue under the Patent Act at the inception of the lawsuit,\" can \"cure the defect by filing a motion to join the patentee as a plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Paradise Creations, Inc. v.
