Maybe even three convictions for sale of marijuana.

Although the Second Circuit has not directly addressed this question, district courts in this Circuit have relied on the reasoning articulated in analogous cases. Specifically, the Second Circuit has held repeatedly that the failure to advise a noncitizen of the right to seek a waiver of deportation under Section 212(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   constitutes fundamental error even though 212(c) relief, like voluntary departure, is discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

May 29, 2015) (\"[T]he Court follows the only courts within this Circuit to have decided the question and holds that the failure to inform an alien about the right to seek voluntary departure does indeed qualify as fundamental error if the alien shows that he was prejudiced by the error.\"). The\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   Court carefully analyzed the issue, ultimately concluding that \"the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   all but compels [the] conclusion [that failing to advise of the availability of voluntary departure is a fundamental error].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203443942\">\n    2015 WL 3443942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

This is important for prong two of the prejudice test, as well as prong one, because the statutory eligibility requirements vary depending on the timing of the request and these requirements in turn impact whether Defendant was prejudiced by the IJ's error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The record demonstrates that Defendant did not withdraw his request. The Government argues that he did because after first asking for voluntary departure, Defendant \"promptly declined\" the opportunity to make a pre-hearing voluntary departure application when he stated that he would like to postpone the hearing. Gov't Opp. at 16. The Government's argument is based on an exchange at the beginning of the hearing when the IJ asked Defendant \"what [he] would [ ] like to do about the case,\" to which he responded that he wanted to seek voluntary departure. Deportation Hearing Transcript at 4. The IJ advised Defendant that he could not determine whether Defendant was eligible for voluntary departure until the end of the hearing but that his chance for receiving it \"might be better if [he had] a lawyer\" and asked if Defendant still wanted to have the hearing that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

The IJ understood this too-after Defendant indicated he wanted to proceed that day, the IJ stated that he could not promise voluntary departure, thus implying that he would conduct an inquiry into Defendant's eligibility later in the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The Court also notes that Defendant proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at the hearing and, therefore, must be accorded special solicitude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruotolo v.

Second, the IJ did not merely fail to mention voluntary departure-instead he explicitly instructed Defendant that he was\n   <em>\n    ineligible\n   </em>\n   for such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140136\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/370/#p376\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that the defendant presented a stronger case than Sosa for a waiver not being knowing and intelligent because the IJ \"specifically stated that [the defendant] was ineligible for such relief,\" whereas in\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   the IJ only failed to mention it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   C. Opportunity for Judicial Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Pursuant to Section 1326(d)(1), Defendant must demonstrate that he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review.
