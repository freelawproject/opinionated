In brief, the suspects allegedly used Facebook Messenger to communicate with a victim, in which they threatened to distribute an embarrassing video of him if he did not provide them with monetary compensation. (Aff. \u00b6 7.) The Govermnent has submitted an application for a search and seizure warrant to seize various items presumed to be located at a residence in Oakland, California (\"Subject Premises\") connected to the two named suspects. The Application further requests the authority to seize various items (identified in Attachment B), including electronic devices, such as mobile telephones and computers (\"digital devices\"). The Court has reviewed the Application and finds that there are sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause to conduct a search of the Subject Premises.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-8\">\n  The Government, however, also seeks the authority to compel any individual present at the time of the search to press a finger (including a thumb) or utilize other biometric features, such as facial or iris recognition, for the purposes of unlocking the digital devices found in order to permit a search of the contents as authorized by the search warrant. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Government's request runs afoul of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and the search warrant application must be DENIED. The Government may submit another search warrant application for the Subject Premises subject to the limitations outlined below.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues presented in the Application implicate the constitutional protections afforded by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The undersigned has found no legal authority explicitly restricting the Court from considering the privileges and protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment prior to signing a warrant. In fact, the prejudice that suspects may suffer should the Fifth Amendment be ignored at this juncture-both due to the practical difficulty in prevailing on a motion to suppress and the fact that they are not represented in the warrant process-gives rise to a moral imperative demanding consideration of the Fifth Amendment.

The Proposed Use of Biometric Features is Testimonial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court finds that utilizing a biometric feature to unlock an electronic device is not akin to submitting to fingerprinting or a DNA swab, because it differs in two fundamental ways. First, the Government concedes that a finger, thumb, or other biometric feature may be used to unlock a device in lieu of a passcode. (Aff. \u00b6 17a.) In this context, biometric features serve the same purpose of a passcode, which is to secure the owner's content, pragmatically rendering them functionally equivalent. As the Government acknowledges, there are times when the device will not accept the biometric feature and require the user to type in the passcode to unlock the device. (Aff. \u00b6 17g.) For example, a passcode is generally required \"when a device has been restarted, inactive, or has not been unlocked for a certain period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775233\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/201/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is, no doubt, a security feature to ensure that someone without the passcode cannot readily access\n   the contents of the phone. Indeed, the Government expresses some urgency with the need to compel the use of the biometric features to bypass the need to enter a passcode.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775233\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/201/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This urgency appears to be rooted in the Government's inability to compel the production of the passcode under the current jurisprudence. It follows, however, that if a person cannot be compelled to provide a passcode because it is a testimonial communication, a person cannot be compelled to provide one's finger, thumb, iris, face, or other biometric feature to unlock that same device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, requiring someone to affix their finger or thumb\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a digital device is fundamentally different than requiring a suspect to submit to fingerprinting. A finger or thumb scan used to unlock a device indicates that the device belongs to a particular individual. In other words, the act concedes that the phone was in the possession and control of the suspect, and authenticates ownership or access to the phone and all of its digital contents. Thus, the act of unlocking a phone with a finger or thumb scan far exceeds the \"physical evidence\" created when a suspect submits to fingerprinting to merely compare his fingerprints to existing physical evidence (another fingerprint) found at a crime scene, because there is no comparison or witness corroboration required to confirm a positive match. Instead, a successful finger or thumb scan confirms ownership or control of the device, and, unlike fingerprints, the authentication of its contents cannot be reasonably refuted. In a similar situation, the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Application for a Search Warrant\n   </em>\n   observed that \"[w]ith a touch of a finger, a suspect is testifying that he or she has accessed the phone before, at a minimum, to set up the fingerprint password capabilities, and that he or she currently has some level of control over or relatively significant connection to the phone and its contents.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268226\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/1066/#p1073\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1073 (N.D. Ill. 2017). It is also noteworthy that many smartphone applications providing access to personal, private information-including medical records and financial accounts-now allow users to utilize biometric features in lieu of passcodes to access those records. As Judge Weisman astutely observed, using a fingerprint to place someone at a particular location is a starkly different scenario than using a finger scan \"to access a database of someone's most private information.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Application for a Search Warrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268226\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/1066/#p1073\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the undersigned finds that a biometric feature is analogous to the nonverbal, physiological responses elicited during a polygraph test, which are used to determine guilt or innocence, and are considered testimonial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmerber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/#p764\">\n    384 U.S. at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047531\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/757/#p764\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the Court sympathizes with the Government's interest in accessing the contents of any electronic devices it might lawfully seize, there are other ways that the Government might access the content that do not trample on the Fifth Amendment. In the instant matter, the Government may obtain any Facebook Messenger communications from Facebook under the Stored Communications Act or warrant based on probable cause. While it may be more expedient to circumvent Facebook, and attempt to gain access by infringing on the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, it is an abuse of power and is unconstitutional.

In so finding, the Supreme Court acknowledged that smartphones are minicomputers with the capability to make phone calls, a search of which \"would typically expose to the government far more than the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not only contains in digital form many sensitive records previously found in the home; it also contains a broad array of private information never found in a home in any form-unless the phone is [present].\"\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2484\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, \"[i]n the cell phone context... it is reasonable to expect that incriminating information will be found on a phone regardless of when the crime occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2484\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2484\">\n    at 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, mobile phones are subject to different treatment than more traditional storage devices, such as safes, and should be afforded more protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It follows that any argument that compelling a suspect to provide a biometric feature to access documents and data is synonymous with producing documents pursuant to a subpoena would fail. As the\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   court recognized, smartphones contain large amounts of data, including GPS location data and sensitive records, the full contents of which cannot be anticipated by law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2484\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the Government inherently lacks the requisite prior knowledge of the information and documents\n   that could be obtained via a search of these unknown digital devices, such that it would not be a question of mere surrender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p43\">\n    530 U.S. at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413147\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/27/#p43\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the Government would be unable to articulate facts to compel the unlocking of devices using biometric features by unknown persons the Government could not possibly anticipate being present during the execution of the search warrant. Indeed, the affidavit makes no attempt to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For these reasons, the foregone conclusion doctrine does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Government's search warrant application is DENIED. The Government may not compel or otherwise utilize fingers, thumbs, facial recognition, optical/iris, or any other biometric feature to unlock electronic devices. Furthermore, the Government may only seize those digital devices that law enforcement reasonably believes are owned and/or possessed by the two suspects named in the affidavit. The Government may submit a new search warrant application consistent with this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the undersigned hereby SEALS the search warrant application, including all attachments thereto. This order, however, is a matter of public record and shall, accordingly, be issued a case number and docketed by the Clerk of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    For instance, a suspect arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant issued under the Fourth Amendment, does not waive the right against self-incrimination provided by the Fifth Amendment absent a\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The finger and thumb scans versus actual fingerprints are one example.
