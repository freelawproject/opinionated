The parties have consented to magistrate jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). For the reasons below, the Commissioner's\n   decision is REVERSED and REMANDED for immediate payment of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was born in 1986 and was 23 years old when he alleges his disability began. Tr. 421. Plaintiff completed the twelfth grade (Tr. 202), and has past work as an administrative clerk, shuttle driver, plastic line operator, and oil change pitman. Tr. 420, 657. Plaintiff alleges disability due to immunoglobulin nephropathy, immune deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, stage one kidney failure, chronic pain disorder, fibromyalgia, migraines, and posttraumatic stress disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Tr. 201, 406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Title II application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits and a Title XVI application for social security income on July 20, 2010. Tr. 24. In both applications, Plaintiff alleged disability beginning June 30, 2009. Tr. 24. Both applications were initially denied and upon reconsideration, Plaintiff filed a written request for hearing. Tr. 131. A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and a decision denying benefits was issued on March 26, 2012. Tr. 21-36. The Appeals Council affirmed the decision, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Tr. 1-3. Plaintiff then appealed and this Court reversed the decision and remanded the claim for further administrative proceedings. Tr. 517-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 12, 2016, a second hearing was held before an ALJ. Tr. 431-94. Plaintiff, witness Michael Shirley, and a vocational expert all testified at the hearing. Tr. 431-94. The ALJ issued a decision again denying benefits on May 10, 2017. Tr. 403-22. Plaintiff now seeks review of the ALJ's 2017 decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISABILITY ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A claimant is disabled if he or she is unable to \"engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which ... has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). \"Social Security Regulations set out a five-step sequential process for determining whether an applicant is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Keyser v.

First, the ALJ considered the testimony of Mike Shirley, Plaintiff's father, but seemed to give it little weight because it was based on the claimant's subjective reports of pain and anxiety and inconsistent with the objective evidence in the record. Tr. 417. However, much of Mr. Shirley's testimony appears to be based on Mr. Shirley's own observations of his son's activities. Mr. Shirley has always lived with Plaintiff and testified that he observed his son spend most of his time in bed, doing chores for no more than a half hour at a time, and take days to recover after doing such chores. Tr. 416; 476-79. The ALJ's reasoning for rejecting Mr. Shirley's testimony is not germane because it fails to credit Mr. Shirley's independent observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the ALJ considered the statement provided by Trace Caraway, Plaintiff's former employer, but again gave his statement little weight because it was \"based on the claimant's reports of pain and limitations, which were found to be unreliable.\" Tr. 417. Many of Mr. Caraway's statements related to his own observations, including that other employees expressed concern to him about Plaintiff's health; that Plaintiff would use the production line table to hold up his body; that Plaintiff required more sick days than other employees; that he observed Plaintiff had bruising; and that Plaintiff had difficulty walking. Tr. 417. Although Mr. Caraway would have had to rely on Plaintiff's self-report about his exact level of pain, this does not discount his own observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Failing to credit the independent observations of lay witnesses is not a harmless error because Mr. Shirley's and Mr. Caraway's observations support Plaintiff's testimony about the severity and functional effects of his symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Tr. 418. He reported that Plaintiff had to lie down during the day and had pain in his elbows, hands, knees, back, and hips. Tr. 418. He stated that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, pain disorder, and migraines, and opined that Plaintiff's IgA nephropathy may be the cause of Plaintiff's pain. Tr. 418. He further opined that if Plaintiff were to attempt to work a 40-hour workweek he would miss four or more days per month. Tr. 332. The ALJ gave little weight to Dr. Woods' opinion because he had \"only been treating the claimant for about a year when he offered this opinion and is not a specialist.\" Tr. 418. The ALJ further concluded that \"[o]utside of the claimant's own reports, there is no basis for the limitations opined by Dr. Woods.\" Tr. 419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although there is a lack of objective findings in the record that identify the etiology of Plaintiff's pain, there is ample evidence that Plaintiff has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, migraines, and a chronic pain disorder. The record does not contain a contrary opinion from a specialist or someone with a longer treating history than Dr. Woods. The ALJ's reasoning for discounting Dr. Woods' opinion is not clear and convincing because there is no requirement that a doctor be a specialist or have a long treatment history with a patient for the doctor's opinion to be given weight. Moreover, the ALJ gave \"great weight\" to the opinion of Dr. French and other agency doctors who were also not specialists and only examined Plaintiff once or not at all. The ALJ's reasoning that there was no basis for Dr. Woods' opinion other Plaintiff's own reports is also unconvincing. The Court is unaware of any imagining or laboratory test that can measure the severity of an individual's pain. Doctors treating patients with fibromyalgia or a chronic pain disorder must use their training, experience, and observations of the patient to ascertain reasoned medical opinions, and although these evaluations may appear subjective, they should not be rejected simply because they depend in part on the patient's self-report. Further, as discussed in the previous sections, the ALJ erred in finding Plaintiff's symptom testimony not credible. Evidence in the record shows that Plaintiff has consistently reported the same symptoms to his treating doctors, family, friends, and supervisor at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Power was Plaintiff's treating physician in 2016. Tr. 419. She stated that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and generalized anxiety disorder. Tr. 419. She confirmed that Plaintiff's symptoms included knee, ankle, and elbow pain and stiffness, and social and generalized anxiety. Tr. 419. She opined that Plaintiff would need to lie down during the day and that his mental health issues could aggravate his fibromyalgia if not fully controlled. Tr. 419. She further opined that Plaintiff would miss one day of work per month for physical therapy. Tr. 419. The ALJ gave significant weight to the \"bulk\" of Dr. Power's opinion, \"as it [was] consistent with the lack of objective evidence showing any abnormalities,\" but gave no weight to her opinion that Plaintiff would miss a day of work for physical therapy because Plaintiff \"had not attended physical therapy and it is possible to go to physical therapy without missing work.\" Tr. 419-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court agrees that significant weight should have been given to Dr. Power's medical opinion, but disagrees with the ALJ's finding that Dr. Power's opinion is consistent with a lack of objective evidence showing any abnormalities. Dr. Power performed a physical examination of Plaintiff that confirmed a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Tr. 418. Moreover, Dr. Power's opinion of Plaintiff's symptoms and his need to lie down is consistent with the opinion provided by Dr. Woods. The ALJ also erred in giving no weight to Dr. Power's opinion that Plaintiff would miss work for physical therapy. An ALJ may not make speculative inferences from medical reports or reject a treating physician's opinion based on speculation or lay opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

The ALJ did not know how long each physical therapy session would last, how intensive each session would be, or whether physical therapy would impact Plaintiff's functioning for. the remainder of the day and interfere with his ability to work.
