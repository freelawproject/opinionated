HERNANDEZ COVINGTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before this Court is Defendant STME, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Kimberly Lowe's First Amended Complaint (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   # 22), filed on December 31, 2018. Lowe responded in opposition on January 14, 2019. (Doc. # 23). For the reasons that follow, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lowe was employed as a massage therapist by STME, which does business as Massage Envy. (Doc. # 21 at \u00b6 7). In September of 2014, Lowe requested time off to visit Ghana while her sister was stationed there by the U.S. Navy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Lowe's request was initially approved by her manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). However, Massage Envy's owners allegedly \"became concerned that Lowe would contract Ebola as a result of her travel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Massage Envy was advised by a management services company and the Center for Disease Control that Lowe's risk of contracting Ebola was low. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-15). They also advised Massage Envy that Lowe should be permitted to resume working upon her return if she did not exhibit any symptoms of Ebola. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nonetheless, on October 22, 2014, Massage Envy's owners met with Lowe to ask her not to travel to Ghana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). They informed Lowe that her employment would be terminated if she traveled to Ghana because they feared Lowe would contract Ebola. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20). But \"Lowe refused to cancel her previously-approved trip because of Massage Envy's erroneous belief that Ghanaians had Ebola,\" and therefore, \"traveled to Ghana, as planned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Consequently, Massage Envy terminated Lowe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Lowe, \"there was an Ebola outbreak in other countries in West Africa,\" but \"there was no Ebola outbreak in Ghana in 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). So Lowe alleges that Massage Envy did not believe she would contract Ebola due to visiting Ghana, \"but due to her interaction with black African people generally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). In fact, \"[m]ore than 98% of Ghanaians are black Africans\" so \"Lowe was certain to interact with black Africans and intended to associate with black Africans on her trip.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Therefore, Lowe alleges she was actually terminated because Massage Envy did not want her, \"a white American citizen,\" to \"interact with black Africans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") initially brought an action on Lowe's behalf for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. STME, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525071\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/1207/\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. 2018). The EEOC action was dismissed with prejudice, so Lowe's motion to intervene was denied as moot, and therefore, Lowe was unable to bring any claims on her own behalf. As a result, Lowe initiated this action in state court, alleging Massage Envy committed race and national origin discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1981 and disability discrimination in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act (\"FCRA\"). (Doc. # 1-1). Massage Envy timely removed the case to this Court (Doc. # 1), and shortly thereafter, moved to dismiss Lowe's initial complaint. (Doc. # 4). The Court granted Massage Envy's motion and dismissed Lowe's claims without prejudice. (Doc. # 16). Lowe filed her Amended Complaint on December 17, 2018. (Doc. # 21). Massage Envy then filed the instant Motion on December 31, 2018. (Doc. # 22). Lowe has responded (Doc. # 23), and the Motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court accepts as true all the allegations in the complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Count I of the Amended Complaint alleges Massage Envy violated Section 1981 by terminating Lowe because of her association with black Africans or in retaliation of her protected conduct of refusing not to associate with black Africans. (Doc. # 21 at \u00b6 60). Massage Envy argues Lowe fails to state either an associational discrimination claim or a retaliation claim under Section 1981.

Nov. 14, 2018) (dismissing retaliation claim because plaintiff failed to allege whether she communicated her belief that discrimination was occurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, because Lowe has failed to allege a statutorily protected activity, her Section 1981 retaliation claim is due to be dismissed. While Lowe has already been provided an opportunity to amend, the Court will nevertheless permit Lowe one more opportunity to amend her retaliation claim to properly allege a statutorily protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     FCRA Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Count II of the Amended Complaint alleges Massage Envy violated the FCRA by terminating Lowe on the basis of a perceived handicap; namely that Lowe would contract Ebola if she traveled to Ghana. (Doc. # 21 at \u00b6\u00b6 65-66). Count II also alleges Massage Envy violated the FCRA by terminating Lowe in retaliation for her refusal to refrain from engaging in a protected activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ). Massage Envy argues Lowe's FCRA claims should be dismissed with prejudice on numerous grounds. (Doc. # 22 at 15-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, the only federal claims have now been dismissed. To preserve Lowe's ability to assert her FCRA claims in state court, Massage Envy's Motion to Dismiss with respect to the FCRA claims is denied without prejudice. Massage Envy may raise its arguments regarding the FCRA claims in a subsequent motion to dismiss, if it chooses to file one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED, ADJUDGED,\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DECREED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) Defendant STME, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Kimberly Lowe's First Amended Complaint (Doc. # 22) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) The associational discrimination claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in Count I is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) The retaliation claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in Count I is dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend by February 19, 2019.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (4) The Motion to Dismiss with respect to the FCRA claims in Count II is denied without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers, in Tampa, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    5th\n   </em>\n   day of February, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
