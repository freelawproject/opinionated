In response, Weyerhaeuser filed a motion to compel arbitration, seeking to enforce arbitration provisions contained in agreements between Named Plaintiffs and the builder of their homes, Pulte Homes (Pulte), even though Weyerhaeuser is not party to those agreements. Because the Court finds there is no agreement between Named Plaintiffs and Weyerhaeuser requiring arbitration, Weyerhaeuser's motion to compel arbitration will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2017, Named Plaintiffs purchased homes in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. The homes allegedly contained formaldehyde-contaminated joists, materials used to support floors, manufactured by Weyerhaeuser. At oral argument, Weyerhaeuser's counsel conceded that the joists at-issue were sold by Weyerhaeuser to dealers and distributors, who, in turn, sold them to home builders for use in homes eventually sold to consumers. Counsel also conceded that Named Plaintiffs did not have any interaction with Weyerhaeuser nor did they pay any money to Weyerhaeuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As part of the home purchase, Named Plaintiffs each entered into identical Home Purchase Agreements (HPAs) with Pulte. Each HPA defines the \"BUYER\" as the Named Plaintiff, and the \"SELLER\" as \"Pulte Homes of PA, Limited Partnership.\" Mot. to Compel Ex. A (Doc. 26) at 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each HPA also contains an arbitration\n   provision which, in pertinent part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    ARBITRATION\n   </em>\n   . BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT,\n   <strong>\n    BUYER AND SELLER\n   </strong>\n   AGREE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR BUYER'S PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY OR ANY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS\n   <strong>\n    BETWEEN THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n   WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (TITLE 9 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE).... THIS ARBITRATION SHALL APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN\n   <strong>\n    BUYER AND SELLER,\n   </strong>\n   INCLUDING THOSE FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DEFECTIVE DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION, MISREPRESENTATION OR FRAUD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BUYER\n   </strong>\n   AGREES THAT THE OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE CLOSING OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY REASON.\n   <strong>\n    SELLER MAY, AT SELLER'S OPTION, INCLUDE SELLER'S SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS AND OTHER PARTIES IN THE ARBITRATION\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mot. to Compel Ex. A at 41 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each Named Plaintiff also received a limited warranty from Pulte as part of their purchase. The terms of the limited warranty apply \"only to Covered Defects\" which are defined as \"defects in material and workmanship that are either part of the structure or are elements of the home as supplied by the Builder at the date of closing.\" Mot. to Compel Ex. G (Doc. 26-1), at 46. The limited warranty further limits its coverage depending on the type of problem identified. Structural elements are defective if \"there is actual physical damage that diminishes the ability of the Structural Element to perform its load-bearing function such that the home is unsafe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similar to the HPAs, the limited warranties feature mandatory arbitration procedures for \"any dispute concerning [the] home or this Warranty, whether based on statute, in tort, contract, or other applicable law,\" and allow for either party to join Pulte's suppliers in such an arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon moving into their new homes (or while doing additional work on the home), Named Plaintiffs noticed a strong odor, most prominently in their basements, and they and/or their young children began experiencing physical symptoms consistent with exposure to elevated formaldehyde levels, including red, tearing, irritated, burning, itchy, tingling, and/or dry eyes; blurry vision; respiratory distress; headaches; and dizziness. In late-July 2017, the builder of the homes notified Named Plaintiffs that their homes may contain defective joists, and Named Plaintiffs thereafter vacated their homes. Testing in all of the homes confirmed the presence of excessive levels of formaldehyde, even on levels of the home above the basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 1, 2017, Named Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on their own behalf and on behalf of two separate classes of home purchasers asserting various products liability claims sounding in contract and tort. On March 26, 2018, Weyerhaeuser filed the instant motion to compel arbitration, which Named Plaintiffs oppose. On August 21, 2018, the Court stayed this matter so that the parties could attempt to resolve this matter without further judicial intervention. Those efforts having failed, the\n   Court lifted the stay, entered a revised Case Management Order on November 19, 2018, and held oral argument on the motion to compel on December 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Where \"it is apparent, based on the face of a complaint, and documents relied upon in the complaint, that certain of a party's claims are subject to an enforceable arbitration clause, a motion to compel arbitration should be considered under [the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6) standard without discovery's delay.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guidotti v.

Named Plaintiffs oppose each of these arguments. They argue that, because Weyerhaeuser is not a \"Seller\" as that term is defined under the HPA, or a warrantor under the limited warranty, there is no contractual basis to compel them to arbitrate their claims against Weyerhaeuser. Named Plaintiffs also contest the scope of the arbitration agreement and object to the application of equitable estoppel. As equitable estoppel is dispositive of Weyerhaeuser's ability to enforce the agreement and the Court finds it does not apply here for the reasons explained below, the Court declines to address the parties' disputes as to the enforceability of the arbitration provisions, or their scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A party seeking to compel arbitration must show: \"(1) an enforceable agreement to arbitrate exists, and (2) the particular dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    MacDonald v.

The HPA's arbitration provisions only apply to \"Buyer\" and \"Seller.\" Those terms are unambiguously defined as the home purchaser and \"Pulte Homes of PA, Limited Partnership\", and are thus plainly distinguishable from the definitions of \"We\" or \"Us\" in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   or \"related third parties\" in\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   . Mot. to Compel. Ex. A at 30, 41. To the extent there is any reference to non-signatories in the HPA's arbitration provision, the plain language indicates that such parties could only be added\n   <em>\n    at Pulte's option.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (\"Seller may at, at Seller's option, include Seller's subcontractors and suppliers and other parties in the arbitration.\"). This language imposes a precondition for arbitration with third parties: a dispute between the homeowner and Pulte. Thus, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   , whose agreements made arbitration foreseeable with respect to an expansive group of possible defendants (by including them in the arbitration provisions without any preconditions), arbitration with third parties\n   pursuant to the HPA was only foreseeable to Named Plaintiffs where there was a dispute between them and Pulte, and Pulte joined a third party. Put another way, plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moss\n   </em>\n   \"bargained\" for arbitration provisions that allowed third parties to compel arbitration independent of any other party's right to arbitration. The unambiguous language of the HPA's arbitration provision, however, makes a third-party's right to compel arbitration wholly derivative of Pulte's-if Pulte did not elect to arbitrate, no third party has that right pursuant to the HPA. As a result, it is not foreseeable that the HPA would require Named Plaintiffs to arbitrate claims related to the HPA against Weyerhaeuser in litigation to which Pulte is not a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The terms of the limited warranty limit the foreseeability of compelled arbitration in the same manner as the HPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Compel Ex. G at 52 (\"\n   <em>\n    [E]ither party\n   </em>\n   must submit any unresolved claim or dispute concerning your home or this Warranty ... to binding arbitration.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (\"This section provides a general overview of the Pultegroup Home Protection Plan, which consists of the limited warranty and the Performance Standards ...\n   <em>\n    provided by Pultegroup\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    through the building subsidiary identified in your purchase agreement\n   </em>\n   for the home (the \"Builder\"). The specific details, limitations, and conditions of the Warranty\n   <em>\n    are provided to you (the \"Homeowner\")\n   </em>\n   in this book.\") (emphasis added). To the extent third parties are referenced in the limited warranty's arbitration provisions, the limited warranty provides: \"\n   <em>\n    either party\n   </em>\n   may join as a party to the arbitration any ... supplier ... involved in the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53 (emphasis supplied). Although broader than the HPA in that it would permit the Homeowner to add a third party to the arbitration, this language imposes the same necessary precondition for the obligation to arbitrate with third parties as the HPA: a dispute between the Homeowner and Pulte. Accordingly, it was only foreseeable that Named Plaintiffs, as homeowners, would have to arbitrate claims against third parties if they, or Pulte, elected to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court also disagrees with Weyerhaeuser's citation to\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that foreseeability is the touchstone of a \"close relationship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reply 5. That Court's discussion of foreseeability is narrow, limited to the context of the facts before it. As an initial matter, the formulation of the applicable standard in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   makes no mention of foreseeability. Rather, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Determining whether a close relationship exists between the entities involved requires\n   <strong>\n    \"examin[ing] the relationship of the alleged wrong to the nonsignatory's obligations and duties in the contract.\"\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Miron [v.

May 8, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, the Court denied a motion to compel arbitration. The named plaintiffs-including one from Pennsylvania-brought nationwide and state-specific class actions against various Volkswagen and Audi entities for manufacturing and marketing defective engines, which were included in vehicles plaintiffs bought or leased from authorized Volkswagen or Audi dealerships.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. One of the Volkswagen entities, VW America, moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the plaintiffs should be equitably estopped from opposing arbitration because of the arbitration provisions in their sale and/or lease agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, 8. The Court denied the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. It found that there was no \"close relationship\" because \"[a]t the time [p]laintiffs acquired their vehicles, they entered into a purchase and/or lease agreement between themselves\n   <em>\n    and the dealership.\n   </em>\n   A member of each dealership presented this document. [And] [t]he agreement only contained the dealership's name and the various [p]laintiffs' names.\" Under those circumstances, the Court found that \"there was no relationship, let alone a close one, that supports the application of estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The relationship between Named Plaintiffs and Weyerhaeuser is at least as attenuated as the relationship in\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   . Weyerhaeuser was not a signatory to the HPA or the limited warranty. As the documents make clear, those agreements were entered into by the individual Named Plaintiffs and Pulte, not Weyerhaeuser, Mot. to Compel Ex. A at 44, just as the lease/purchase agreements were executed between the\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs and authorized dealers, not VW America. Moreover, those agreements contain only the names of the Named Plaintiffs and Pulte (or its affiliates, amongst whom Weyerhaeuser is not listed), and do not reference Weyerhaeuser in any way (as it conceded at oral argument).\n   <em>\n    See id. passim.\n   </em>\n   These facts, alone, preclude a finding of a sufficiently close relationship, as they did in\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   . The relationship is even more attenuated here than in\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   because,\n   as Weyerhaeuser conceded at oral argument, its products are not sold to builders like Pulte (which would parallel the manufacturer-dealer relationships in\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, Weyerhaeuser admitted that its joists were sold to distributors, who, in turn, sold them to builders (like Pulte), who then sell homes containing the joists to homeowners, like Named Plaintiffs. Under these circumstances, the Court finds Weyerhaeuser cannot be characterized as \"close\" to a transaction two bends down the stream of commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The relationship between Weyerhaeuser, Pulte, and Named Plaintiffs is too attenuated to apply equitable estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court finds there is no enforceable arbitration agreement between Named Plaintiffs and Weyerhaeuser, and its motion to compel must, therefore, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant Weyerhaeuser invokes equitable estoppel to compel Named Plaintiffs' to comply with an arbitration provision in an agreement between Named Plaintiffs and Pulte, their homes' builder. Because there is no close relationship between Weyerhaeuser and the parties to the agreements it seeks to enforce, or those agreements themselves, the application of equitable estoppel is inappropriate. As a result, the Court finds there is no enforceable agreement to arbitrate between Weyerhaeuser and Named Plaintiffs. The motion to compel will, therefore, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Court's pinpoint references are to ECF page numbers, and not the document's internal pagination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Weyerhaeuser also cites two state court decisions-one from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and the other from the New Jersey Superior Court-for the general proposition that courts \"routinely\" compel arbitration where the arbitration clause only references the agreement's signatories.
