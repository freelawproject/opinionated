Dkt. No. 69 at 4. Defendants contend that the 2013 residency contract cannot terminate the 2011 arbitration addendum because it does not address arbitration at all, and that the 2017 residency agreement governs arbitration only with respect to Ms. Carlson's relocation and stay in the memory care section beginning in December of 2017. Dkt. No. 59 at 5-9.

The California Court of Appeals determined in each of these cases that a later contract constituted a novation of a previous contract, thereby extinguishing the arbitration provision in the previous contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on these cases, Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Carlson's 2013 residency agreement constituted a novation of the 2011 agreement and arbitration addendum, and its silence on the issue of arbitration thereby extinguishes the 2011 arbitration addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court is not persuaded. As discussed in detail below, the parties explicitly addressed arbitration in two of the three agreements signed on Ms. Carlson's behalf. Based on those agreements, it is evident that Brookdale had specific procedures for opting out of arbitration within its contracts, and that Ms. Carlson and Joan Carlson were able to understand those procedures. The 2013 residency\n   agreement's silence on the issue of arbitration does not constitute a disavowal sufficient to extinguish the 2011 arbitration provision. Therefore, given the strong presumption in favor of arbitration, the Court finds that the 2013 agreement did not supersede the 2011 arbitration addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   b. 2017 Residency Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The 2017 residency agreement's arbitration provision applies to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Any and all claims or controversies arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement or your stay at the Community, excluding any action for eviction, and including disputes regarding interpretation of this Agreement, whether arising out of State or Federal law, whether existing or arising in the future, whether for statutory, compensatory or punitive damages and whether sounding in breach of contract, tort or breach of statutory duties, irrespective of the basis for the duty or the legal theories upon which the claim is asserted\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Dkt. No. 38-1 at 10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants contend that this arbitration provision, from which Ms. Carlson opted out, relates only to Ms. Carlson's stay in the memory care section of the Brookdale Fountaingrove community and not to any events relating to her time at Brookdale prior to the signing of the 2017 agreement. Dkt. No. 59 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants' position that the 2017 arbitration provision applies exclusively to Ms. Carlson's stay in the memory care section of the community is contrary to the plain language of the provision itself. The arbitration agreement applies to \"[a]ny and all claims arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement or your stay at the Community.\" Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 10. The same document defines the \"Community\" as the residential care facility building, without any mention of the memory care section.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Therefore, at least from December 18, 2017 forward, Ms. Carlson has opted out of arbitration of claims arising from her stay at Brookdale Fountaingrove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants also cite to\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Uber Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that an arbitration opt-out does not retroactively apply to claims that were brought before the opt-out.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272507\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/886/#p893\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 893 (N.D.

The 2017 arbitration provision applies to \"claims ... whether existing or arising in the future.\" Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 10. The claims asserted in this lawsuit certainly existed at the time the 2017 contract was signed, and are therefore subject to the opt-out.
