R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) [Doc. No. 62]. Plaintiff Gensetix opposes this motion [Doc. Nos. 45, 63], and Defendants Baylor College of Medicine [Doc. Nos. 53, 65] and Diakonos [Doc. No. 55] have filed their own responses. Each party has briefed whether this Court has jurisdiction over The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System (\"UT\") as an involuntary plaintiff pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, whether UT could be properly joined under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, and whether Gensetix could have standing to sue for patent infringement without UT as a plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   UT's Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 62]. The related portions of Defendant Baylor College of Medicine's Supplemental Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss Gensetix's First Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 65] and Defendant Diakonos' Motion to Dismiss Gensetix's First Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 55] are also\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Furthermore, the Court finds that the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b) factors weigh in favor of dismissal and declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gensetix's state law claims. Accordingly, this case is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Gensetix is an exclusive licensee of United States Patent Nos. 8,728,806 and 9,333,248. [Doc. No. 26 at 1]. Plaintiff alleges\n   that Defendant Professor William Decker invented methods of modifying patients' immune systems to kill cancer cells during Professor Decker's tenure at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Professor Decker is the named inventor on the patents, the methods were invented in the scope of Professor Decker's employment with MD Anderson, thus UT retained title to the patents-in-suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 2. According to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, in September 2008, UT granted Alex Mirrow an exclusive license to commercialize the patented method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. In January 2014, Mr. Mirrow assigned his rights in the licensed method to Gensetix (\"License Agreement\" or \"L.A.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, in June 2014, UT confirmed the assignment, and Gensetix and UT signed an amendment to the original agreement (\"Amendment\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that although Decker left UT and retained no rights in the patents, he continues to practice the patented technology at Baylor College of Medicine (\"BCM\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Plaintiff points to several abstracts Decker published in 2013 and 2014 and alleges that they describe Decker's use of the patented methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. In early 2014, Gensetix claims that it reached out to Decker and BCM seeking to assert its patent rights and to acquire any intellectual property rights Decker and BCM claimed to own based on improvements or new discoveries from their use of the '806 and '248 patent ed methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. Gensetix alleges that BCM was receptive to the idea of assigning these rights; accordingly, Gensetix sought financial backing from Fannin Innovation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. As negotiations were moving forward with BCM, Plaintiff claims that Decker secretly interfered with the negotiations by approaching BCM and disparaging Plaintiff and by independently soliciting Defendant Diakonos to enter a licensing agreement that cut Plaintiff out of the deal completely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it was unaware of Decker's interfering activities at the time when Decker sought funding from Gensetix to continue research.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Gensetix paid Decker, but eventually in June 2015, BCM informed Gensetix that it was no longer interested in the assignment negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Gensetix claims that it lost its financial agreement with Fannin Innovation as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. BCM eventually assigned rights for any developments allegedly based on the '806 and '248 patent ed methods to Diakonos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Diakonos offered to sublicense the '806 and '248 patents from Gensetix, but Gensetix declined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gensetix filed the present suit naming UT as an involuntary plaintiff. [Doc. Nos. 26 at 17; 63 at 1]. Gensetix alleges that Decker, BCM, and Diakonos (\"Defendants\") continue to practice, improve, and infringe on the '806 and '248 patent ed methods. [Doc. No. 26 at 17]. Further, Plaintiff claims that Defendants interfered with its contracts with UT and committed civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 39-40. With regard to Defendant Decker, Plaintiff claims that he breached his contract with Gensetix, tortiously interfered with its deals with BCM and Fannin Innovation, and is subject to promissory estoppel for the \"handshake agreement\" between Decker and Gensetix.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-39. Gensetix seeks injunctive relief, damages, and a declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court now turns to the parties' arguments regarding the Eleventh Amendment, standing, and joinder under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Eleventh Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   UT, an arm of the State of Texas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserts immunity from suit under the Eleventh\n   Amendment and argues that this immunity deprives this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. [Doc. No. 62 at 2]. Accordingly, UT moves to dismiss under 12(b)(1). Plaintiff Gensetix argues that Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity does not apply where no claims have been asserted against UT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dismissal of an action is appropriate whenever the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(h)(3). The party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of overcoming the presumption that the cause falls outside the court's limited jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins.

The Eleventh Amendment confers waivable immunity upon sovereign entities \"rather than a nonwaivable limit on the Federal Judiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Idaho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915679\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/261/#p267\">\n    521 U.S. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915679\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/261/#p267\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment does not altogether disqualify federal courts from hearing suits brought against states because states can waive their immunity and \"allow a federal court to hear and decide a case commenced\" against it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915679\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/261/#p267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, more accurately, the issue in this case is whether the Eleventh Amendment prevents UT from being joined as an involuntary plaintiff in a patent suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar this brand of joinder. [Doc. No. 63]. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Independent Wireless Telegraph Co. v.

Notably, UT retained the right to publish general findings, use licensed subject matter for research, teaching, or other academic purposes, and transfer rights to other research institutions for non-commercial research use.

The Court finds that it would not be able to lessen or avoid prejudice to UT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Third, a judgment rendered without UT would be inadequate under Rule 19(b)'s third factor.

Gensetix has also alleged that Defendant Decker breached his contract with Gensetix, tortiously interfered with its deals with BCM and Fannin Innovation, and is subject to promissory estoppel. Each of these causes of action is controlled by state law. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gensetix's state law claims.
