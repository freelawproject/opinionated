BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court provided a detailed general background on the facts of this case in its Order on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Dkt. No. [22] at 2-4. Pertinent to this Order, this matter arises from the allegedly fraudulent operation of a $10.7 million \"fund of funds\" operated by Defendant Thomas Conrad (\"Conrad\" or \"Dr. Conrad\"). Dkt. No. [1] \u00b6 1. Conrad is the owner and controlling officer of Defendants Financial Management Corporation (\"FMC\") and Financial Management Corporation, S.R.L. (\"SRL\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\") brought this action on July 15, 2016, charging six separate counts of fraud against Defendants and four counts of aiding and abetting fraud against former Defendant Stuart Conrad pursuant to various provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Complaint alleges that Defendant Conrad controls Defendant entities FMC and SRL, and together these Defendants fraudulently sold and redeemed interests in hedge funds they operate, including World Opportunity Fund, L.P. (\"WOF\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , World Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. (\"WOF Master\"), World Fund II, L.P. (\"World Fund II\") and World Opportunity Fund (BVI) Ltd. (\"BVI\") (collectively, \"the funds\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. WOF, World Fund II, and BVI are the feeder funds into WOF Master, although only WOF and World Fund II are currently active feeder funds since\n   all BVI investors were moved into WOF. Dkt. No. [67] \u00b6 21. In a master-feeder structure, investors buy limited partnership interests in a feeder fund, and the feeder funds in turn invest their assets in the master fund. Dkt. Nos. [64-2] \u00b6 11; [67] \u00b6 11. The SEC seeks civil penalties in addition to permanent injunctive relief. Dkt. No. [1] at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court dismissed all counts against Stuart Conrad on February 22, 2017, leaving only fraud Counts I, II, IV, VI, VII, and IX against Defendants Conrad, FMC, and SRL. Dkt. Nos. [1, 22]. Further, the Court partially dismissed certain counts insofar as they relied on allegedly fraudulent activities that either could not meet the elements of those counts or could not be attributed to Defendant SRL because they predated SRL's existence. Dkt. No. [22] at 17-18, 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to all Defendants, Count I alleges violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)(1) ; Count II alleges violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)(2), (3) ; Count IV alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(2)(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ; Count VI alleges violations of Section 206(1) of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6(1) ; Count VII alleges violations of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6(2) ; and Count IX alleges violations of Sections 206(4) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 275.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All remaining counts are based on five categories of allegedly fraudulent activities underlying the counts in different configurations, and they are extant against all Defendants except where otherwise noted below.

These categories include: (1) failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest and related compensation (Counts I, II, IV, VI, VII, and IX)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) failure to disclose disciplinary history (Counts I, II, IV, and IX); (3) failure to disclose loans to family members (Counts VI, VII, and IX)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) fraudulent purchases (Counts VI, VII, and IX)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (5) fraudulent redemption practices (Counts I, II, IV, and IX).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Each of these five categories, in turn, encompasses multiple separate acts. First, the \"failure to disclose conflicts and compensation\" category includes allegations of Conrad's nondisclosure of his appointment as sub-manager of WOF Master in January 2013, nondisclosure of his compensation arrangement in that role, and nondisclosure of the fact that he had unilateral authority to appoint himself to the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Dkt. No. [68-1] at 18-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   None of these proposed premises for finding the nondisclosure immaterial meets\n   the summary judgment standard. First, a jury could find the nondisclosure of Defendant Conrad's disciplinary history material notwithstanding the age of the decision, the substantive differences between the wrongdoing at issue in that case and the fraud alleged here, or the reliability of an SEC ALJ proceeding generally. The undisputed facts remain that the SEC prohibited Defendant Conrad from ever again associating with a registered broker-dealer and revoked the registration of Conrad &amp; Company, the broker-dealer Defendant Conrad controlled. Also undisputed is that these substantive disciplinary measures resulted from a finding that Conrad \"willfully violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act and willfully aided and abetted [Conrad &amp; Company's] violations of certain provisions of the Exchange Act and rules thereunder[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Thomas D.

The numerous violations and the supervisory failures found with respect to him are compounded by the lack of candor he displayed in these proceedings.\"). These findings could certainly be important or even determinative to an investor's decision whether to invest in funds controlled and operated by Defendant Conrad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, the Court must also firmly reject Defendants' argument that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Savage v. Conrad\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:14-cv-04103-ODE (N.D. Ga. Jan. 9, 2017), forecloses a finding of materiality here. That opinion turned entirely on the \"reasonable reliance\" element of a private litigant's fraud claim. Specifically, the Court granted summary judgment to Defendant Conrad because the plaintiff failed to show that he reasonably relied on Defendant Conrad's omission of the 1971 enforcement action in deciding whether to invest, given that an investor exercising due diligence would have discovered the disciplinary history on his own. The Court gave no other reason why summary judgment was warranted on the fraud claim related to that nondisclosure. But reasonable reliance \"is not an element of an SEC enforcement action because Congress designated the SEC as the primary enforcer of the securities laws, and a private plaintiff's 'reliance' does not bear on the determination of whether the securities laws were violated, only whether that private plaintiff may recover damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan Keegan &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874529\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1233/#p1248\">\n    678 F.3d at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' assertion that \"[t]his issue ... has been litigated and decided in the Northern District of Georgia\" is thus unpersuasive. Not one of the elements of the claims brought by Plaintiff here was litigated or decided there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, Plaintiff has presented deposition and affidavit evidence from investors in the funds who state they would not have invested in the funds had the disciplinary action been disclosed-i.e., that the nondisclosure was material to their investment decision.

It is undisputed that in written and oral pitches, prospectuses, and offering memoranda to investors in WOF, World Fund II, and BVI-all three feeder funds into WOF Master-Defendants FMC and Conrad touted Defendant Conrad's \"seat on the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange\" and other wealth management experience going back to 1965, while omitting that Defendant Conrad was suspended by and expelled from that very same Stock Exchange in connection with the disciplinary action by the SEC.

First, as to the auditor claims, they argue the third-party accountant in question, Earl W. Morrow, has confirmed under oath that he was hired to be an auditor for the funds and whether or not he completed an audit \"is not germane to whether he [ ] himself is properly identified as an auditor.\" Dkt. No. [68-1] at 12-13. Moreover, Defendants contend that Dr. Conrad told the limited partners that \"lesser levels of audit services\" were being completed, and that the Limited Partnership Agreement (\"LPA\") indicates that the funds' books and records \"shall be reviewed,\n   compiled, and/or audited as of the end of each fiscal year by independent Certified Public Accountants selected by the General Partner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Finally, while the LPA does require the General Partner to retain someone capable of performing audits, it does not require that the person so retained actually conduct an audit as opposed to a compilation or review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Therefore, Defendants argue Plaintiff has failed to allege a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission based on these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As for the statements in investor fact sheets about the historical performance of certain fund investments, Defendants contend that all investor fact sheets \"are clear on their face that they reflect the performance of the managers presently in the Funds, and a strained reading by Plaintiff and dissatisfied investors cannot turn that into the predicate for a fraud claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citation omitted). Defendants also note that these documents have different titles in their different iterations, but that the titles clearly refer to the performance of fund managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Defendants argue they should be granted summary judgment on fraud Counts I, II, IV, and IX arising from the auditor and historical performance allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although Plaintiff does not seek summary judgment on these allegations, Plaintiff challenges Defendants' arguments by listing specific representations to investors that the funds' financial statements would be or had been audited, even though it is undisputed that Mr. Morrow told Dr. Conrad in the fall of 2009 that he would not be able to complete a full audit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. [73] at 8-9; [77] \u00b6 37. Among other examples, Plaintiff points to offering memoranda for WOF from July 2010 and World Fund II from January 2011 identifying Mr. Morrow as the auditor and representing that \"[e]ach partner receives annual audited financial statements.\" Dkt. No. [73] at 9 (citing to Dkt. Nos. [64-7] at 156; [64-9] at 97).\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. Nos. [64-4] at 54, 56; [64-6] at 24, 26 (identifying Mr. Morrow as \"Auditor\" underneath the \"Fund Structure\" heading in investor fact sheets for WOF Master); [75-4] at 91, 92 (February and March 2010 emails from Dr. Conrad to the limited partners stating that the WOF Master \"December 31 Balance Sheet is currently being audited\" and \"[a] 12/31/2009 Balance Sheet Audit of [WOF Master] is estimated to be distributed by our newly contracted Auditors in May 2009 [sic].\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff argues that several aspects of the fact sheets indicate they were \"designed to create the appearance of a successful seven[-]year performance history.\" Dkt. No. [73] at 10. For instance, a July 2013 investor fact sheet for World Fund II included a section titled the \"Current Portfolio 7-year Manager's History\" purportedly summarizing the returns for various investments going back to 2007, although World Fund II did not exist in 2007 and the funds did not own some of the listed investments during that period. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts it is undisputed that the fact sheet did not list the funds' underperforming or unprofitable investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Pl.'s Ex. 45, Dkt. No. [64-4] at 53, and D. Conrad Dep., Dkt. No. [61] at 64:1-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court finds that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is sufficient record evidence to\n   at least create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether (1) Defendants misrepresented to investors that the funds were being audited when they were not; (2) Defendants misrepresented the historical past performance of the funds' investments to potential investors in offering memoranda; (3) these misrepresentations were material; and (4) these misrepresentations were made with scienter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims related to the \"auditor\" representations.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Beginning with the auditor-related allegations, Defendants admit that Mr. Morrow told Dr. Conrad in the fall of 2009 that his firm could not perform an audit, and that Dr. Conrad understands the distinction between an audit, review, and compilation. Dkt. No. [77] \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39. It is also undisputed that Mr. Morrow's firm performed a review-not an audit-of WOF Master's financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Yet Defendants admit Defendant Conrad sent emails to investors in February and March of 2010 indicating that the December 31, 2009 WOF Master balance sheet had been audited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 42. Moreover, identifying Mr. Morrow as an \"Auditor\" in investor fact sheets for WOF Master could mislead a reasonable investor into thinking the funds were subject to audits by Mr. Morrow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FindWhat Inv'r Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836276\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1282/#p1305\">\n    658 F.3d at 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a statement is misleading if in light of the facts known at the time, a reasonable investor exercising due care would have been misled by it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants' position hinges on the fact that identifying Mr. Morrow as an \"auditor\" was not literally false, but it provides no answer to whether it was materially misleading. The same is true of the representations in the July 2010 and January 2011 offering memoranda that \"[e]ach partner receives annual audited financial statements[,]\" notwithstanding Defendants' position that the January 2013 LPA indicated such financial statements \"shall be reviewed, compiled,\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   audited as of the end of each fiscal year ....\" Dkt. Nos. [64-7] at 156; [64-9] at 97; [68-16] \u00b6 79 (emphasis added). A reasonable juror could find these to be material misrepresentations made with scienter-that is, that Defendant Conrad must have known that making these statements presented a danger of misleading the partners into thinking that WOF Master had been audited when it had not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Defendants admit they provided investor fact sheets to actual and prospective investors as part of their marketing materials. Dkt. No. [77] \u00b6 47. The record contains World Fund II fact sheets dated December 2011, March 2013, and July 2013 including charts purporting to show the \"Current Portfolio 7-Year Manager's History.\" Dkt. No. [64-4] at 53, [64-6] at 23, 25. On both 2013 charts, the far-left column has a list of different entities under the header \"Manager.\" Each entity in the list of \"Managers\" was a fund manager in World Fund II's current investment portfolio. The horizontal rows corresponding to each Manager date from 2007 to 2013, showing that manager's return for each year. The two columns at the far right of\n   the chart purport to calculate the \"Compounded Return\" and \"Annualized Return\" for each manager. At the bottom of the chart on the far left, the chart provides four rows synthesizing the data from the chart entries above in different ways, including one row titled \"World Fund II Weighted Average.\" While there is no data given for the \"World Fund II Weighted Average\" for 2007 or 2008, the boxes from 2009 to 2013 show a percentage for each of those years (e.g., 24% in 2009, 13.8% in 2010, -3% in 2011, and so on). Then, at the far right, the \"World Fund II Weighted Average\" shows a \"Compounded Return\" of 76% and an \"Annualized Return\" of 14.2% overall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants admit that World Fund II was not established until 2011. Dkt. No. [67] \u00b6 16. Further, Defendants do not dispute that the funds did not own at least some of the listed investments during the seven-year period shown on the charts and that the charts omitted some of the funds' investments from that period. Dkt. No. [77] \u00b6 49. Additionally, one point of dispute in this litigation is whether these charts appear to show the performance of specific fund investments rather than the performance of individual managers over the course of those seven years. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds a reasonable juror could find the charts materially and intentionally or recklessly misleading in this regard. For example, the 2013 charts list \"FMC Managed Portfolio (Morgan Stanley)\" as a \"Manager.\" A jury could find that a reasonable investor would be misled by that notation into believing that the chart reflected the performance of World Fund II's\n   <em>\n    actual investments\n   </em>\n   in various funds and portfolios from 2007-2013, rather than the past performances of the fund's current managers only. Similarly, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the facts could reasonably support a finding that the charts materially misrepresented the overall performance of the funds' investments by showing how the managers in the current portfolio had performed in years before they were in the World Fund II portfolio or before World Fund II even existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims arising from the alleged \"auditor\" and historical performance misrepresentations is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Nondisclosure of Conflicts and Compensation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Counts I, II, IV, VI, VII, IX against Defendants Conrad and FMC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Both parties seek summary judgment on the counts arising from this category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    i.

Second, Defendants argue that the offering documents specifically disclosed to investors that sub-managers receive annual fees measured by a percentage of the value of the assets they manage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n    at 4, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support, Defendants rely on a January 2013 Offering Memorandum for World Fund II, which provides in pertinent part: \"The sub-managers generally charge annual fees that are measured by a percentage of\n   the value of the assets they manage.\" Conrad Decl., Ex. 1, [66-2] at 18. Third, beyond the offering documents, Defendants also aver that a reasonable investor would assume that sub-managers were being paid in connection with that role and that Plaintiff conceded as much through its 30(b)(6) representative. Dkt. No. [68-1] at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mashburn Dep., Dkt. No. [69-1] at 93:3-13, 96:18-22. Defendants contend these facts cannot establish a nondisclosure. Additionally, Defendants argue there is no record evidence that Defendant Conrad did not provide sub-manager services, charged higher rates than what another sub-manager would have charged, or that there was any loss to any investor, and that such evidence is necessary to show a conflict of interest to establish any nondisclosure as material. Dkt. No. [76] at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that they used the mails within the definition of Section 206. Thus, at issue here is whether Defendant Conrad's sub-manager position and related management fee were not disclosed-that is, whether there was any nondisclosure, misrepresentation, or fraudulent course of conduct in the first instance, and, if so, whether it was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Whether there was a nondisclosure in the first instance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant Conrad's position as sub-manager and related fee were disclosed to investors. On the one hand, Plaintiff points to evidence showing that certain fund investments were listed as \"TDC managed assets\" even before Defendant Conrad began receiving a fee for his sub-manager position and argues that Defendants' disclosures of FMC and SRL's annual management fees as well as other conflicts of interest gave rise to a duty to disclose the additional annual fee he received as sub-manager.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. [72] at 13-14, [73] at 15-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos.

On the other hand, however, Defendants point to record evidence showing that it is an industry norm for sub-managers of hedge funds to take a fee measured by a percentage of the annual return of the funds they manage (commonly 2%), that Plaintiff-through its 30(b)(6) representative-agrees that reasonable investors would expect sub-managers to receive such fees, and that it was disclosed to investors both that Defendant Conrad acted as a sub-manager of some fund investments and also that sub-managers generally charge fees measured by a percentage of the value of the assets they manage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mashburn Dep., Dkt. No. [69-1] at 89:20-92:15, 93:3-13, 96:18-22; Conrad Decl., Ex. 1, [66-2] at 18. Therefore, there is sufficient record evidence supporting both parties' positions as to whether Defendant Conrad's sub-manager role and accompanying fee were disclosed to investors to preclude summary judgment on the omission element of each count arising from this category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Whether any potential nondisclosure was material\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The dispute of fact as to whether the sub-manager position and fee were disclosed also creates a genuine dispute as to materiality. That is, the materiality determination \"requires delicate assessments of the inferences a 'reasonable shareholder' would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him, and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    TSC Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n    426 U.S. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether a reasonable investor should have inferred from notations of \"TDC managed\n   assets\" that Defendant Conrad had appointed himself a sub-manager and taken an additional fee on top of the fees he already received in connection with that role is best left to the jury to determine. And even if it were established that Defendants Conrad and FMC omitted the sub-manager appointment and related fee, the Court cannot say that such omissions are \"so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that even if the appointment and fee were not disclosed, no conflict of interest can be established absent evidence of investor loss. By acting as both the president of General Partner FMC and as a sub-manager, Defendant Conrad was responsible for valuing at least a portion of the assets that he managed and was competing with other sub-managers of the funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Thus, even if the record is devoid of evidence of investor loss as a result of Defendant Conrad's sub-manager self-appointment, a reasonable juror could still find the nondisclosure of the appointment and fee was material at the time investors first reviewed the offering materials and LPA. Therefore, taken together, the record evidence does not justify summary judgment for either party on any count arising from this alleged nondisclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   both Plaintiff's and Defendants' motions for summary judgment with regard to all counts arising from this alleged nondisclosure by Defendants Conrad and FMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Redemption Practices\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Counts I, II, IV, IX\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants' alleged preferential redemption scheme forms an additional and important part of this litigation. The SEC accuses Defendants of convincing investors to entrust the funds with millions of dollars only to institute a \"freeze\" of investors' redemption requests in February 2009 that was never formally lifted, while continuing to take redemptions for Defendants' own use and allowing Conrad family members and certain favored investors to do the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Dkt. No. [68-1] at 23-24. Similarly, Defendants contend any oral misrepresentations Defendant Conrad made to potential investors that they would be able to easily withdraw invested funds cannot support a fraud claim given the merger clause in the LPA, as well as the forward-looking, \"hopeful\" nature of the statements at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In support, Defendants cite to various cases standing for the propositions that (1) a fraud claim cannot be based on mere statements of opinion or expectation, unfilled predictions, or erroneous conjecture,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Next Century Comm'ns Corp. v.

Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that in SEC enforcement actions, a \"broker's statements [to the hypothetical reasonable investor] about the relative merit (and lack of risk) of certain investments in deciding among different investment options\" can be held material without considering \"whether the individual investor's\n   <em>\n    reliance\n   </em>\n   on his broker's statements is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan Keegan &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874529\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1233/#p1248\">\n    678 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1249 n.19.

When Defendant Conrad made these representations, he was aware that other investors in the funds had been waiting several years for outstanding redemptions.

When Mr. Clay himself later requested redemption in January 2017 and Dr. Conrad told him that redemption would not be possible at that time, Mr. Clay reminded Dr. Conrad of the earlier representation that he could redeem with a month's notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 468-69. Dr. Conrad responded, \"that was then and this is now.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 470.

Consistent with this representation, Dr. Conrad sent an email to Mr. Scheller on April 13, 2014 stating \"[w]e are legally restricted by government appointed lawyers from disbursing your funds to you. Period, period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 433. Dr. Conrad explains in his Declaration that WOF was sued in 2010 by an SEC Receiver to recover the funds WOF earned through its investments in the Ponzi scheme, and a judgment against WOF was entered in December 2013 requiring it to repay those amounts. Dkt. No. [68-2] \u00b6\u00b6 26-33. Therefore, according to Dr. Conrad, he stopped permitting redemptions in reliance on representations by counsel for the Receiver that allowing investors to redeem prior to paying the judgment would result in an additional lawsuit for fraudulent transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Yet Defendants do not dispute that between the March 23, 2014 notice and the April 13, 2014 email to Mr. Scheller, various investors were permitted a total of ten redemptions, and Dr. Conrad continued to allow redemptions to some investors even after sending the Scheller email, including allowing Defendant FMC a $59,513.38 redemption on May 13, 2014. Dkt. No. [67] \u00b6\u00b6 423-32, 434, 438. During the same period, on both December 26, 2013 and June 19, 2014, Dr. Conrad's son and World Fund II Administrator Dale Conrad told an investor there was no liquidity available to honor his redemption request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 398, 438. Defendants also do not dispute that a BVI offering memorandum dated July 1, 2014 provided that shareholders could redeem upon written notice to the General Partner or Administrator as of the last business day of the calendar month in which the redemption request is received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 456.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Throughout their Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, in order to support denials of certain facts or to assert the irrelevance of certain false statements Defendant Conrad made to investors, Defendants repeatedly rely on the disclosures in their LPA and Offering Documents that the General Partner had discretion to limit redemptions and to make exceptions to suspensions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [67] \u00b6\u00b6 99-100, 130, 144, 155, 157, 337, 367, 472. For example, Defendants do not dispute that Defendant Conrad sent the February 9, 2009 email discussed above stating that partner redemptions would be suspended until July 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. However, Defendants purport to dispute the related facts that \"Conrad never told investors that he made exceptions to the [February 2009] suspension on redemptions\" and \"Conrad never made it clear to investors generally that some investors, including [his son, Stuart] Conrad, were able to redeem their investments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99, 100. In support of these denials, Defendants cite to the January 2013 World Fund II LPA, which set forth Defendant Conrad's powers as the General Partner. In particular, the LPA disclosed to investors that the General Partner retained \"sole discretion\" to make or withhold distributions from the Partnership to the limited partners, as well as to suspend redemptions on a temporary basis and to make exceptions to any such suspensions \"due to any hardships of a Limited Partner or the contractual requirements of a Limited Partner[.]\" Dkt. No. [66-3] at 3, 4, 9, 11. Similarly, Defendants' briefing relies solely on these disclosures to establish that no fraud liability can attach to this category of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. [68-1] at 28-30; [66] at 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   However, disclosure of a discretionary power is not the same as disclosure of having exercised that power. While Defendant Conrad may have disclosed that he had the power to allow exceptions to the suspension, citation to such disclosure does not create a genuine dispute as to the allegation that he never disclosed that he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   make exceptions for some partners. More importantly, it does not transform any of Defendant Conrad's affirmative misrepresentations to investors about what was happening in real time-described above-into accurate statements, because none of the documents on which Defendants rely discloses the truth of those specific matters. Therefore, Defendants' denials premised on disclosures in the LPA are ineffective to raise a genuine dispute as to SEC UMF Nos. 99-100, 130, 144, 155, 157, 337, and 472, all of which deal with omissions of what Defendants\n   <em>\n    were in fact doing or would in fact do\n   </em>\n   , rather than omissions of what Defendants\n   <em>\n    had the power to do.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   These disclosures thus do not render\n   immaterial Defendant Conrad's numerous misrepresentations regarding redemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Whether the misrepresentations were material\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   While materiality is ordinarily left to the trier of fact, repeated misrepresentations to investors that redemption would be possible with a month's notice despite having told other investors during the same time period that redemptions were frozen or impossible due to lack of liquidity are material as a matter of law. \"To warn that the untoward may occur when the event is contingent is prudent, to caution that it is only possible for the unfavorable events to happen when they have already occurred is deceit.\"\n   <em>\n    Merch.

Any reasonable investor would attach importance to these representations, particularly given that the truth of the matter was that redemption requests of many investors took years to fulfill.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

That conduct is prohibited under Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Securities Act, as set forth in Counts I and II, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as set forth in Count IV, and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act, as set forth in Count IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As stated above, Defendants have offered no arguments in their briefing on either motion to rebut Plaintiff's arguments and supporting evidence on the other elements of these counts, including use of instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails (Counts I, II, and IV), negligence (Counts II and IX), and scienter (Counts I and IV).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Dr. Conrad paid the money from the WOF Master account in return for a promise by his daughter-in-law to repay the money with 12 percent interest. Dkt. No. [67] \u00b6 487. Defendant FMC later purchased the loan from WOF Master.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 488;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. Conrad Testimony at 106:12-107:14, Dkt.

No. [67] \u00b6 490;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. [64-5]&lt; at 99. The parties dispute whether the truck was purchased for a business purpose or for Dale Conrad to use on vacation.

No. [67] \u00b6\u00b6 489, 492. Plaintiff alleges these loans constituted a breach of Defendant Conrad's and FMC's fiduciary duty to the funds through the misuse of fund assets to benefit members of the Conrad family over the funds' actual and prospective investors, thus violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act. Dkt. No. [64-1] at 23-24. \"The provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) have been interpreted as substantively indistinguishable from Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, except that Section 206(1) requires proof of fraudulent intent, while Section 206(2) simply requires proof of negligence by the primary wrongdoer.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

No. [68-1] at 16.

Therefore, Defendants aver the nondisclosure of these specific loans is neither a fraudulent omission nor material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff argues, first, that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the LPA permits the loans in question given the LPA provision requiring full disclosure of loans that personally benefit the General Partner and requiring such loans to be at least as favorable to the partnership as an arm's-length commercial transaction would be. Dkt. No. [73] at 14 (citing to Pl's Ex. 124 at 23, Dkt. No. [64-7] at 140). Plaintiff contends it is \"indisputabl[e]\" that the interest-free loan to Dale Conrad does not meet that standard. Dkt. No. [73] at 14. Defendants reply that Plaintiff misreads the relevant provision, which concerns \"use of the Partnership's assets for the General Partner's personal benefit[,]\" because Dale Conrad is not a General Partner or an affiliate of the General Partner. Dkt. No. [76] at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that even if the LPA does permit such loans, the failure to disclose them constitutes fraud because both loans were undisclosed conflicts of interest and the nondisclosure of a conflict of interest is material as a matter of law. Dkt. No. [73] at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Steadman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1440577\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/603/1126/#p1134\">\n    603 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1130 ). In particular, Plaintiff argues that \"diverting funds away from the Fund, even for a short period of time, always carries with it the risk that some or all of the money will be lost or at least unavailable for some period of time.\" Dkt.

Ga. 2011) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For the same reasons explained above concerning the Investment Advisers Act claims arising from the nondisclosure of Conrad's sub-manager appointment and related fee, neither party is entitled to summary judgment on these claims. In short, the materiality of these nondisclosures is a matter for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   First, Defendants have admitted the specific loans were not disclosed. Therefore, the Court rejects their argument that\n   a provision in the partnership documents permitting the General Partner to enter into any \"contracts[,] agreements, undertakings, and transactions with ... any other Partner or any shareholder ... or with any person ... having any business[,] financial[,] or other relationship with the General Partner\" somehow transforms the loans into \"\n   <em>\n    disclosed\n   </em>\n   , permitted act[s.]\" Dkt. No. [76] at 4 (quoting Dkt. No. [68-4] at 6) (emphasis added). Moreover, whether or not\n   <em>\n    the LPA\n   </em>\n   permitted such loans does not answer the question of whether\n   <em>\n    the Investment Advisers Act\n   </em>\n   requires the disclosure of such loans. A reasonable juror could find that Defendants FMC and Conrad breached their fiduciary duty to both the funds and to the investors by using fund assets to pay personal debts and expenses of Dr. Conrad's family members without disclosing such use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   However, Plaintiff's citations to Steadman and\n   <em>\n    Mannion\n   </em>\n   do not support granting summary judgment in its favor either. In\n   <em>\n    Steadman\n   </em>\n   , the court in fact distinguished\n   <em>\n    TSC\n   </em>\n   from the case at bar specifically because\n   <em>\n    TSC\n   </em>\n   arose on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, \"i.e., whether the omission was material as a matter of law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1440577\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/603/1126/#p1134\">\n    603 F.2d at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court went on to emphasize that in\n   <em>\n    TSC\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court \"reaffirmed ... that the issue of materiality is a mixed question of law and fact and that divining the significance of the inferences a reasonable investor would draw from a given set of facts is peculiarly within the competence of the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1440577\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/603/1126/#p1134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Mannion\n   </em>\n   was before the court on a motion to dismiss, and the court merely held that \"a reasonable factfinder\n   <em>\n    could conclude\n   </em>\n   that it is material that the advisors of the Fund used Fund assets for purposes other than for the benefit of the Fund.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5907425\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/1321/#p1341\">\n    789 F.Supp.2d at 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That conclusion does not compel summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court finds a reasonable juror could conclude there is insufficient evidence to establish materiality where a reasonable investor would arguably anticipate such loans based on the information in the offering materials, the loans were repaid quickly and one was repaid with interest, and nothing in the record shows the loans substantially affected liquidity. Accordingly, it is possible a reasonable investor, in making his investment decision, would consider such relatively small loans \"essentially useless\" information. It is also possible an investor would find such conduct inappropriate by an investment advisor and indicative of a larger privileging of Defendants' own self-interest over their fiduciary duty, thereby greatly affecting an investor's investment decision and making the nondisclosure material. In other words, the Court cannot determine the materiality of the nondisclosure as a matter of law. Thus, both parties' motions seeking summary judgment on Counts VI, VII, and IX arising from the nondisclosure of the loans to family members are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Fraudulent Purchases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Counts VI, VII, and IX against Defendants Conrad and FMC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff has brought claims under Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act based on Defendant Conrad's titling of certain fund assets in his own name. These assets include two soybean farms in Uruguay and approximately $88,000 worth of precious metals. Dkt. No. [1] at \u00b6\u00b6 67-69. In its Complaint, Plaintiff contends Defendants Conrad and FMC violated the Investment Advisers Act by failing to disclose that Conrad held title personally to assets purchased with investor funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Defendants argue that the LPA \"permits the General Partner to possess partnership property, including through a\n   nominee, unless it is 'for other than a Partnership purpose.' \" Dkt. No. [76] at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [66-3] at 5, 6. Defendants contend \"the exercise of disclosed contractual powers is not fraudulent, is not an omission, does not form the predicate for any assertion of scienter and is certainly not material.\" Dkt. No. [76] at 8. Therefore, because there is no record evidence that any of the assets Dr. Conrad held in his own name were used for anything other than a \"Partnership purpose,\" Defendants argue summary judgment in their favor is proper on all fraud counts arising from these purchases. Plaintiff does not seek summary judgment on these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   While Defendants refer to the absence of a showing of materiality or scienter in a conclusory fashion, their briefing advances substantive argument solely on the question of whether the record evidence shows an omission in the first instance. The Court finds Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on these grounds. As discussed above, the purpose of the Investment Advisers Act is to require disclosure of all possible conflicts of interest to allow clients and investors to make informed investment decisions. And again, disclosure of a power is not the same as the disclosure of having exercised that power. While the record shows that the World Fund II LPA disclosed that assets owned by the Partnership \"may be registered in the name of the Partnership or in the name of a nominee,\" a reasonable juror could nonetheless find that Defendants Conrad and FMC were specifically required by their fiduciary duty to investors to disclose that Dr. Conrad himself possessed certain valuable assets, purchased with money from the funds, in his own name. Moreover, a reasonable juror could find from the record evidence that even if the LPA did permit Defendant Conrad to possess Partnership property for \"a Partnership purpose,\" he did not possess those assets for such a purpose. For example, Defendants admit that Defendant Conrad held at least some of the precious metals at his home address, and that in an email discussing the purchase of one of the soybean farms, Dr. Conrad stated that he expects \"the house will be at my disposal\" within 60 days of closing. Dkt. No. [77] \u00b6\u00b6 54, 58. For that reason, Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the counts arising from this category is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
