The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motions and the remainder of the file and hereby rules as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Quinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20616\">\n    573 U.S. 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581778\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2618/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581778\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2618/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , in Plaintiffs' framing, held that in-home caregivers who are paid through the Medicaid program to provide in-home care for adults and children (\"caregivers\") \"could not be forced to belong to or otherwise financially support a union because it violated their First Amendment rights.\" Dkt. 50 at 7. Plaintiffs explain that their interest in contacting caregivers in Washington\n   arose \"[i]mmediately after\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   was issued in 2014.\" Dkt. 50 at 7. On July 2, 2014, two days after the decision, the Freedom Foundation submitted public records requests to DSHS and DEL, seeking a list of caregivers from each. Dkt. 50 at 12 (citing Dkt. 6, Declaration of Maxford Nelson (\"Nelson Decl.\"), at 3-4). DEL provided the requested list, and \"[f]or over two and a half years, the Foundation has been using this list to reach Childcare Providers and informing them of their right to leave the union.\" Nelson Decl. at 4. DSHS \"determined that the names of [caregivers] were disclosable information\" but, according to Plaintiffs, \"delayed disclosure long enough to allow SEIU 775 to sue [DSHS] and the Foundation to prevent disclosure of the records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the suit was ultimately unsuccessful, the state trial court granted a temporary restraining order preventing disclosure and kept it in place until the appeal was resolved in 2016 in favor of the Foundation. Dkt. 50 at 12. Additional disputes over public records requests followed. Dkt. 50 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Washington voters enacted Washington State Initiative 1501 (\"the Initiative\") in the 2016 general election. Dkt. 47 at 4. The Initiative's text described its intent to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   protect the safety and security of seniors and vulnerable individuals by (1) increasing criminal penalties for identity theft targeting seniors and vulnerable individuals; (2) increasing penalties for consumer fraud targeting seniors and vulnerable individuals; and (3) prohibiting the release of certain public records that could facilitate identity theft and other financial crimes against seniors and vulnerable individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dkt. 47-1 at 5, Text of the Initiative. Plaintiffs challenge Part Three of the Initiative, which amended Washington's Public Records Act, RCW Chapter 42.56 (\"PRA\"). The PRA provides for broad public access to state records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WAC 44-14-01003, but state statutes have also created hundreds of exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49-5, Declaration of Gregory Wong, Ex. E Table of Exemptions from Public Records Disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Initiative added an exception for \"sensitive personal information of vulnerable individuals and sensitive personal information of in-home caregivers for vulnerable populations from inspection and copying\" under the Act, and defined sensitive personal information to include names, in addition to addresses, GPS coordinates, telephone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, \"or other personally identifying information.\" Dkt. 47-1 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Neither party provides an explicit comparison of which identifying data points were available prior to the passage of the Initiative which are now not available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the Court's examination of the text of RCW 42.56.250(4), \"[r]esidential addresses, residential telephone numbers, personal wireless telephone numbers, personal electronic mail addresses, social security numbers, and emergency contact information of employees or volunteers of a public agency\" in personnel records or public employment related records have\n   been excluded from public inspection and copying since at least 2006,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and driver's license numbers and identicard numbers have been excluded since 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Comparing this information to \u00a7 8(2)(b) of the Initiative, it appears that for caregivers, the only additional information the Initiative withholds is their names.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 47-1 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Initiative continues to allow some entities to access caregiver identities, including the certified bargaining representative under RCW 41.56.080,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11(d), parties to contracts with the state where the contract requires disclosure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11(f), or entities under contract with the state to provide services to or conduct research about vulnerable residents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The argument for the Initiative in the Voters' Guide noted that seniors and vulnerable people were particularly at risk of identity theft and other financial exploitation or scams. Dkt. 49-2 at 6-7. The argument against the Initiative in the Guide claimed the Initiative's goal \"is to rewrite the Public Records Act to prevent in-home caregivers and childcare providers from learning they no longer can be forced to pay dues to the union.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 5, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the State alleging that the Initiative violates Plaintiffs' rights to free speech and free association under the First Amendment, and right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, seeking a permanent injunction enjoining the State from enforcing the Initiative. Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 89-132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also on April 5, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against the State, seeking to enjoin the Initiative. Dkt. 2. Plaintiffs raised their First Amendment and Equal Protection claims, as well as Thurber and Benn's desire to call an election to replace SEIU 925 with another union for child caregivers. Dkt. 2 at 12. To call an election at that time, they would have had to \"convince 30% of Childcare Providers to call for an election during the month of April\" to meet the deadline, sixty days prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreement for child caregivers. Dkt. 2 at 12. On April 10, 2017 the State responded, Dkt. 15, and the Court held a hearing. The Court denied the temporary restraining order due to Plaintiffs' failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits and delay in bringing the motion. Dkt. 21. Also on April 10, the Campaign filed a motion to intervene as a defendant. Dkt. 17. On May 11, 2017, the Court granted the Campaign's motion to intervene. Dkt. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 17, 2018, the State and the Campaign each filed motions for summary judgment. Dkts. 47, 48. On July 18, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 50. On August 6, 2018, the parties responded. Dkts. 60, 61, 63. On August 10, 2018, the parties replied. Dkts. 65, 67, 68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, the dispute centers on whether Part Three of the Initiative violates the Constitution. Both sides agree the dispute is primarily legal rather than\n   factual. Dkts. 47 at 3, 48 at 14, 63 at 7. The primary legal question is whether a statute enacted by Washington voters is constitutional. As a threshold matter, legislative classifications are presumed constitutional, and \"the burden of showing a statute to be unconstitutional is on the challenging party.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y. State Club Ass'n, Inc. v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775005\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1/#p17\">\n    487 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775005\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1/#p17\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775005\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1/#p17\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Regarding the merits, Plaintiffs assert two Equal Protection claims and three First Amendment claims. The Court considers the First Amendment claims first, concluding that Plaintiffs have failed to establish any violation of a fundamental right. Based on that conclusion, the Court grants the State and the Campaign's motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims and first Equal Protection claim, which is based on interference with a fundamental right. The Court then considers Plaintiffs' second Equal Protection claim under rational basis review and concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish any constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of a claim in the case on which the nonmoving party has the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The Court must resolve any factual issues of controversy in favor of the nonmoving party only when the facts specifically attested by that party contradict facts specifically attested by the moving party. The nonmoving party may not merely state that it will discredit the moving party's evidence at trial, in the hopes that evidence can be developed at trial to support the claim.\n   <em>\n    T.W.

First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that creating a PRA exception for caregiver identities interferes with Plaintiffs' exercise of free speech and association because the identity lists \"are essential for both Plaintiffs and\n   the Unions to engage in political speech with [caregivers].\" Dkt. 1, \u00b6 96. Plaintiffs rely on seven lines of doctrine to support their claim that the exception burdens their First Amendment speech and association rights: (1) methods of communication cases, (2) access to government cases, (3) ballot access cases, (4) right to listen cases, (5) viewpoint discrimination cases, (6) overbreadth cases, and (7) freedom of association cases.

Plaintiffs convincingly establish that the Supreme Court values affordable methods of distributing speech, but their cited authorities do not support the proposition that the First Amendment compels the government to disclose information to help speakers identify their target audience.

Voters received communications from the Campaign with details about the rates of financial fraud committed against seniors, the likelihood of fraud against seniors going unreported, and headlines from local news stories about cases of seniors losing their savings to fraud. Dkt. 62-1 at 4-5. While this evidence is thin, it is analogous to legislative history discussing the \"situations in which agricultural production facilities have been, or may be, harmed as a result of a misrepresentation leading to the acquisition of records\" in\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Defense Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266859\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1184/#p1200\">\n    878 F.3d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   These points support an inference that withholding a list of identities that would pinpoint homes containing vulnerable seniors reduces the amount of publically available information that could be used identify targets for financial fraud and identity theft, potentially reducing the rate at which seniors fall victim to these crimes. Plaintiffs argue that the purpose of protecting seniors and vulnerable individuals from fraud is \"based on nothing more than speculation that some person might file a [public records request] and (now on record for requesting the information) commit identity theft or fraud.\" Dkt. 50 at 29. Plaintiffs argue that the law will not achieve its purpose of preventing identity theft because caregiver contact information was already exempted from disclosure, supporting an inference that the \"only true effect of [the Initiative's Public Records Act] provisions was to preclude anyone other than approved groups from being able to learn the identity of [caregivers].\" Dkt. 50 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   However, Plaintiffs anticipate being able to \"access the individual [caregivers] through mail directed to them and door-to-door canvassing\" once they are provided a list of caregiver names. Dkt. 50 at 24. Plaintiffs suggest wrongdoers would not want to identify themselves by placing a public records request, but do not explain why legislative reasoning that identity thieves could also find direct contact information once they have a list of likely targets is irrational or speculative. Plaintiffs affirm that the primary work location for many caregivers is their own homes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 64, Second Declaration of Matt Hayward at 3, 4. If a caregiver's identity leads easily to address information to support direct mail or canvassing efforts, it appears rational for the voters to reason that protecting caregiver identities removes an avenue that could be abused to identify homes with vulnerable residents. Identity theft and financial fraud against seniors is undoubtedly a real problem. The Court finds that \"it is evident from all the considerations presented to [the legislature],\" or here, to the general voting public, that on the efficacy of reducing publically available information about caregivers to reduce possible avenues to target seniors for identity theft and similar crimes, \"the question is at least debatable,\" and survives rational basis scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Clover Leaf Creamery Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716456\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/456/#p464\">\n    449 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716456\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/456/#p464\">\n    101 S.Ct. 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The parties devote substantial briefing to the question of whether union animus against the Freedom Foundation would render the Initiative's withholding of previously\n   available information an illegitimate action driven by impermissible animus. Plaintiffs' most compelling argument may be that the true, or at least primary motivation of the Initiative's drafters and promoters was to restrict the Foundation's ability to communicate with caregivers about their right to withhold financial support from the unions. Plaintiffs have submitted both internal communications of union officials as well as communications from the unions to its members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this evidence and SEIU 775's loss in the state court, one could rationally infer that the predominate motivating factor for the Initiative and the Campaign's support for the Initiative was animus toward the Freedom Foundation and outside entities with prerogatives similar to the Foundation. That inference leads to the conclusion that the proffered motivation of protecting seniors was merely pretext for the true motivation of animus. This rational conclusion, however, is of no moment to the Court's consideration of the issues because Plaintiffs have failed to submit any evidence that this allegedly impermissible animus \"prompted the statute's enactment.\"\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Defense Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266859\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1184/#p1200\">\n    878 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The voters of Washington enacted the Initiative, not the Washington legislature. Thus, to prove their claim, Plaintiffs would have to show that the Washington voters harbored impermissible animus, which Plaintiffs have failed to do, and in any case almost certainly could not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Instead, the text of the Initiative and the materials used to promote it to the general public can only lead to the conclusion that the legislation received voter approval because of the widely and legitimately promoted purpose of protecting a vulnerable population of the state's citizens from identity theft and financial fraud. Moreover, the motivations of the Campaign cannot render void a lawfully enacted initiative by the voters of Washington State even if some evidence establishes that the electorate may have been misled by the Initiative's chief proponent as to the proponent's true motivations. Therefore, the legitimate purpose for the PRA exception survives even a searching form of rational basis scrutiny, and the Court grants summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs' Claim Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to dislodge the Initiative's presumption of constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
