When the plaintiff was first hired by Tiffany, she reported to Andrea Davey, whose title was \"Vice President - Marketing, Northern America.\" Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 10. Davey transferred to a different team in early 2014, and upon Davey's transfer, the plaintiff began reporting to Catherine Lacaze.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Adrienne Davis, who originally reported to Lacaze alongside the plaintiff, was given a promotion in April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 65. When Davis was promoted, she became the plaintiff's direct supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. The plaintiff supervised two employees, Jennifer Greene and Caitlyn Byrnes. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff is a practicing Catholic. Pl.'s. 56.1 \u00b6 100. Jennifer Greene is Jewish and Caitlyn Byrnes is Catholic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lacaze was raised in the Catholic faith and went to Catholic school but no longer practices, and Davey is of Jewish heritage but not religious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the plaintiff delivered satisfactory performance in certain aspects of her position, the plaintiff displayed partnering and communication deficiencies early on.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Beginning in early 2014, Lacaze and Human Resources (\"HR\") began receiving complaints about the plaintiff's abrasive communication style and lack of professionalism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. For example, in early 2014, Tiffany received a complaint that the plaintiff told an employee, who did not report to the plaintiff, that the plaintiff told her she was doing a great job \"no matter what others say.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The employee found that comment to be disconcerting and spoke to HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Lacaze also received complaints regarding the plaintiff's interactions. Lacaze testified that the plaintiff's coworkers complained that the plaintiff \"was abrasive in meetings [and] dismissive,\" and that she made her coworkers feel \"belittled and that [the plaintiff] was contemptuous.\" Polido Decl., Ex. 6, at 35. The plaintiff also failed to\n   turn in assignments on time. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff's first performance review was in the Spring of 2014, and it evaluated her performance for her first four months of work. Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 104. Davey, who was the plaintiff's manager at the time, conducted the plaintiff's performance review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Overall, Davey gave her a positive performance review, rating her six out of six.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the performance review noted concern in some areas, including that the plaintiff's approach to managing multiple projects was \"not sustainable.\" Rightnour Decl., Ex. A, at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the summer of 2014, Byrnes reported to Lacaze and HR comments that the plaintiff made that Byrnes believed were inappropriate and made Byrnes feel uncomfortable. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 22. Among other issues, Byrnes reported that around November 2013, the plaintiff commented to Byrnes and Greene -- in reference to a Hispanic security guard at a Tiffany store -- that the security guard was the only person who paid attention to the plaintiff at the store because \"Hispanics love blondes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Byrnes also reported that around April 2014, the plaintiff discussed Good Friday in a meeting with her direct reports -- Greene and Byrnes. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 24. Byrnes reported that the plaintiff told Greene, who is Jewish, that Good Friday is when \"your people killed Jesus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Byrnes also reported an incident where the plaintiff stated that a certain social media marketing technique should be used in Asia because \"[a]ll Asians love social media.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   56.1 \u00b6 27. The plaintiff does not dispute that Byrnes reported this comment, but the plaintiff asserts that she did not make the comment as described. Pl.'s 56.1 Counter Stmt. \u00b6 27. The plaintiff states that she shared information based upon consumer behavior research reports showing that social media usage is higher in Asia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Byrnes also reported problems with the plaintiff's management and communication style, including that the plaintiff micromanaged her direct reports, which made it difficult for them to complete projects on time. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Upon receiving the complaints from Byrnes, HR opened an investigation into the plaintiff's behavior, interviewing employees such as Greene, Byrnes, and the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. The interviews were primarily conducted by Sylvia Raymond, who is a practicing Catholic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 94. During the investigation, Greene said that she was not personally offended by the plaintiff's behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; Raymond Decl., Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In light of the plaintiff's communication, leadership, and partnership deficiencies, Lacaze and HR determined that corrective action was warranted. On September 11, 2014, Tiffany issued a warning to the plaintiff. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35. The warning stated: \"Because of your work performance and or conduct you are at risk of losing your job.\" Lacaze Decl., Ex. 5. The warning notified the plaintiff that during the HR investigation, many of the plaintiff's business partners stated that the plaintiff's communication style was \"abrasive, condescending, and/or dismissive,\" and that the\n   plaintiff frequently displayed body language that signaled disinterest in what other individuals had to say, such as rolling her eyes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The warning mentioned the plaintiff's November 2013 comment about Hispanics loving blondes and the plaintiff's April 2014 remark that \"your people killed Jesus.\" The warning explained that the plaintiff's behavior was particularly important because of her role as a leader within the company, which required her to lead by example.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The warning recommended that the plaintiff attend a Management Development Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 38. Lacaze, Raymond, and the plaintiff all signed the warning. Lacaze Decl., Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Raymond and Lacaze delivered the warning to the plaintiff in a meeting in which they reiterated the consequences of the warning. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 41. Under Tiffany company policy, employees on active warning are not eligible for a bonus, a merit increase, a transfer, or a promotion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Additionally, employees on active warning cannot receive an overall rating higher than \"adequate\" in their annual performance review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43; Raymond Decl., Ex. 7. When Raymond and Lacaze delivered the warning, the plaintiff did not raise any concerns about discrimination or retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Three months later, in December 2014, the plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to Tiffany, claiming that by issuing the warning Tiffany discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her religion. Polido Decl., Ex. 7. In that letter, the plaintiff's attorney claimed that the warning was issued because the plaintiff expressed her religious belief that the Jewish people killed Jesus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite being issued a warning and counseled on her deficiencies, Lacaze and HR continued to receive complaints about the plaintiff. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 50; Polido Decl., Ex. 1, at 264-65, 337-38, 344, 376. For example, Byrnes complained that the plaintiff made an inappropriate comment about Byrnes's financial situation by telling Byrnes that she does not \"know what it's like to really need a paycheck\" because she \"live[d] at home.\" Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. The plaintiff also attempted to circumvent the consequences of her warning status. Even though the plaintiff knew that she was not allowed to transfer to a different group while under the warning, she contacted another group to ask them about transferring to an open position without notifying Lacaze.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55, 57-58. Discussions about a potential transfer ceased only when senior management contacted Lacaze, who notified them that the plaintiff was on active warning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the spring of 2015, another employee, Burke, complained to HR that the plaintiff introduced Burke to a photographer at a photoshoot as a \"crazy bodybuilder crossfit chick.\" The plaintiff then stated to Burke, \"See it can be fun to dress like a girl,\" and \"You should keep that dress, it would help your wardrobe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Burke reported that the plaintiff made her uncomfortable on several occasions and that she felt as if she was being bullied by the plaintiff. Raymond Decl., Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiff's March 2015 performance review reflected her active warning status and the feedback her managers continued to receive about her. Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 61.

First, there is no evidence that any of the decision-makers harbored religious animus towards the plaintiff or against Catholics. There were three primary decision-makers involved in the decisions to place the plaintiff on a warning and ultimately to terminate the plaintiff's employment -- Lacaze, Davis, and Raymond. Of those three decision-makers, only one, Raymond, practices a religion, and she is Catholic. Lacaze, who no longer practices a religion, was raised in the Catholic faith. Although there is no presumption that employers will not discriminate against members of their own protected\n   class, the fact that one of the key decision-makers is Catholic \"undermines any possible inference of discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

This is especially so here, where Raymond, a Catholic, conducted most of the interviews for the HR investigation of the plaintiff. Moreover, the plaintiff has not put forward any evidence that a single person at Tiffany made any statements about her religion that could be deemed discriminatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rozenfeld v. Dep't of Design &amp; Const. of City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857581\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/875/189/#p205\">\n    875 F.Supp.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (considering as a factor that \"nobody made disparaging comments\" about the plaintiff's race),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870631\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/522/46/\">\n    522 F. App'x 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, the plaintiff has not established that she was treated differently from other employees because of her religion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pesok v.

The plaintiff has not shown any similarly situated employee with similar communication deficiencies who was not disciplined. For example, the plaintiff argues that several Jewish managers at Tiffany freely discussed religion at work without being reprimanded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 13; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 103. However, the plaintiff has not identified the nature of these discussions or whether the comments made were offensive, nor has the plaintiff established that these individuals made additional offensive comments\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or were the subject of complaints by their colleagues. Indeed, when asked if she was aware of other employees making comments such as \"your people killed Jesus,\" \"all Asians love social media,\" \"Hispanics love blondes,\" or \"[s]ee it can be fun to dress like a girl,\" the plaintiff responded that she was \"not aware of any other employee's specific situation.\" Polido Decl., Ex. 1, at 287. Nor does the plaintiff point to any other employees who were reported to their managers and HR for dismissive body language, micromanagement, or an abrasive communication style.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The plaintiff's argument that the circumstances give rise to an inference of discrimination is further undermined by the fact that the person who was eventually hired by Davis, with Lacaze's approval, to perform some of the plaintiff's duties is Catholic. The fact that the person hired to perform some of the plaintiff's duties is a member of the same protected class as the plaintiff \"effectively precludes [the] plaintiff from establishing that her termination occurred under the requisite circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    DeJesus v.

Therefore, it is unnecessary to reach steps two and three of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework.

Her arguments here are similarly without merit. The defendant states that it made those decisions on the basis that the plaintiff was not improving and was not open to feedback. The defendant based its conclusion on the continued negative feedback that Davis received about the plaintiff's partnership and communication deficiencies after the warning was issued and after Davis became the plaintiff's supervisor, as well as on the plaintiff's own behavior. For example, when Tiffany asked the plaintiff to participate in the plan, the plaintiff did, but only under protest, noting in her email to Davis that she disagreed with the reasons for placing her on the plan.

The defendant has presented overwhelming evidence that the reason that comment was included in the warning was not because it embodied one of the plaintiff's religious beliefs, but for the same reason that other comments were included in the report -- because the comment was perceived by management to be offensive and inappropriate for the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Contrary to the plaintiff's assertions, the warning focuses on the plaintiff's general communication deficiencies, and not only on her comment about Jesus's death.

The plaintiff argues that the disciplinary actions taken against her after she sent the December 2014 letter and filed her EEOC charges, including her placement on a development plan in June 2015 and her termination in August 2015, constitute retaliation for protected activities. However, the plaintiff has failed to show a causal connection between the adverse employment actions and her protected activities, and therefore she has failed to show a prima facie case of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To show a causal connection under Title VII, the plaintiff is required to show that her protected activity was the \"but for\" cause for the alleged retaliatory actions.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex.

Nov. 9, 2017) (quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff has not met either standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, the defendant began taking disciplinary actions against the plaintiff before the plaintiff engaged in any protected activities. The defendant issued the warning against the plaintiff in September 2014, three months before the plaintiff's lawyer sent a letter to the defendant, and seven months before the plaintiff filed her original EEOC charge. \"When disciplinary action begins prior to the protected activity, there is no inference of retaliation simply because the adverse action is completed after the protected activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

June 14, 2010). Almost all of the alleged retaliatory actions were taken as a result of the plaintiff's September 2014 warning and the failure by the plaintiff to adjust her conduct accordingly. Employees on active warning at Tiffany are not eligible for a bonus or a promotion and cannot receive a performance evaluation with a rating higher than \"adequate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That the\n   actions took place after the December 2014 letter is not evidence of retaliation, because those actions followed from the September 2014 warning. Even placing the plaintiff on the June 2015 development plan and terminating her in August 2015 were simply continuations of the progressive discipline that began with the September 2014 warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Despite the plaintiff's warning, colleagues continued to complain to Lacaze, Davis, and HR about the plaintiff's behavior and communication style, and the plaintiff does not dispute that other employees complained about her. Those continued complaints confirmed that the plaintiff had not improved on the same issues that caused Tiffany to issue the warning -- her communication and partnering deficiencies. The plaintiff herself admits that she had to explain or apologize for her comments in the workplace on at least four occasions both before and after her protected activities. Pl.'s 56.1 Counter Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 51-53, 64, 78, 86; Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 27 &amp; Ex. L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although the development plan and termination post-dated the plaintiff's protected activities, \"[w]here timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise.\"\n   <em>\n    Slattery v.

The plaintiff's August 2015 termination occurred eight months after the plaintiff's December 2014 lawyer letter, four months after her first EEOC charge, and two months after her amended EEOC charge. While temporal distance alone is not dispositive, in this case, the timing supports the defendant's argument that its actions were not retaliatory. Indeed, \"courts in this Circuit have consistently held that a passage of more than two months between the protected activity and the adverse employment action does not allow for an inference of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Avillan v. Donahoe\n   </em>\n   , No. 13cv509,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20728169\">\n    2015 WL 728169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2015) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In her opposition brief, the plaintiff contends that she does not rely solely on timing to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and purports to put forward direct evidence of retaliation. However, the plaintiff has not pointed to any direct evidence that the defendant was motivated by retaliatory animus in taking progressive disciplinary actions against her. Rather, the plaintiff merely questions the defendant's perception of the plaintiff's job performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, the plaintiff points to her largely positive 2013 performance review, conducted by Davey, to argue that her 2014 performance review, conducted by Lacaze, was retaliatory because it was negative. As explained above, the fact that the plaintiff received an \"adequate\" rating of her performance review was a direct consequence of her warning status, which required that she receive at most an adequate rating. This precludes any argument that the performance review was retaliatory, because it was necessitated by a warning that predated any of the plaintiff's protected activity. Moreover, the \"mere fact of past satisfactory performance, followed by negative feedback, is not suggestive of impermissible animus ....\"\n   <em>\n    Missick v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960111\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/707/336/#p350\">\n    707 F.Supp.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). This is especially true in this case, where the first performance review was conducted by a different manager than the subsequent performance reviews, and the first performance review only evaluated the plaintiff's work during her initial months at the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The plaintiff also contrasts the \"2014 Tiffany Profilor\" -- a review which asks many different colleagues, including the plaintiff's managers, peers, and direct reports, to evaluate her performance -- with her \"adequate\" 2014 performance review. Although the plaintiff characterizes the 2014 Tiffany Profilor as a positive review because it compliments her work in many respects, it also shows that her managers, her peers, and her direct reports all perceived problems with the plaintiff's communication and leadership skills. Comments from her boss include that the plaintiff needed \"to gain more empathy and good will from her colleagues,\" and that would only come from \"a switch in her behavior.\" Polido Reply Decl., Ex. 16, at 28. Comments from the plaintiff's direct reports included that the plaintiff needed stronger communication skills with \"less harsh delivery/delegation,\" and less \"rude comments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960111\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/707/336/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They further noted that she needed to engage in less micromanagement, \"has a tendency to be close-minded,\" and often does not realize \"how what she is saying or doing comes across to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. They further remarked that the plaintiff \"is rarely open to hearing ideas or recommendations on different approaches to work, always feeling that her way is the best way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. The plaintiff's peers and colleagues echoed these concerns, commenting that the plaintiff needed to be \"more sensitive to those around her\" and to acknowledge other peoples' points of view.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. These comments undermine any notion that the plaintiff's \"adequate\" performance review by Lacaze was retaliatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that the June 2015 development plan was retaliatory because, according to the plaintiff, it was unnecessary. To support this argument, the plaintiff points out that she apologized to many of the colleagues she had previously offended. The plaintiff's argument amounts to a disagreement with the defendant's determination that it was appropriate to place the plaintiff on a development plan. However, that disagreement is not evidence that the defendant acted with retaliatory animus.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203334796\">\n    2009 WL 3334796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Droutman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201796120\">\n    2005 WL 1796120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. The fact that the plaintiff concedes she apologized to colleagues because of her remarks is an acknowledgement that she made such offensive remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The plaintiff also believes that the June 2015 development plan was pretextual because similarly situated employees were not placed on similar plans. However, as explained above, the plaintiff has not pointed to any employees with similar communication and leadership deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that her August 2015 termination directly evinces retaliatory animus. The plaintiff believes she was fired for giving negative feedback regarding the management development program. The plaintiff says that her managers solicited her honest feedback and argues that by soliciting her honest feedback and then using that feedback as a basis for her termination, the defendant retaliated against her. That the plaintiff was asked for her honest feedback does not undermine the defendant's reliance on its perception that the plaintiff's feedback evinced an unwillingness to improve on her alleged deficiencies, and it certainly does not show that the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff for engaging in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The plaintiff also states that her warning was extended in July 2015 to go beyond one year and argues that this purported extension is evidence of retaliation. The only evidence she puts forward to show that her warning was extended is a tape-recorded conversation between the plaintiff and Davis. However, the conversation does not establish that the warning\n   period was extended, and there is no documentation of such an extension in the record. In any event, the plaintiff has not put forward evidence showing that the alleged extension was retaliatory, rather than a reaction to the plaintiff's continued deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the plaintiff has not shown any causal connection between her protected activity and any adverse employment actions, she has not made out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII. The plaintiff has also failed to show that any of the employment actions about which she complains were motivated in any part by retaliation. Therefore, she has failed to show that the defendant retaliated against her in violation of the NYCHRL. Accordingly, the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff's retaliation claims is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties.
