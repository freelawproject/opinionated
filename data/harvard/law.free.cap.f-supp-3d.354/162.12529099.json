ECF 32. The Defendants replied on January 25, 2018. ECF 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the Court issued the Order denying the second motion to dismiss as moot. In issuing the Order, the Court stated: \"it appears that the Plaintiff has addressed the Defendants' arguments contained in their motion to dismiss. Of course, this does not prevent the Defendants from filing a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.\" February 28, 2018 Electronic Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 7, 2018, the Defendants filed the instant motion seeking reconsideration of the Order, or, in the alternative, dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint based on the papers submitted in favor of dismissing the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Local Civil Rule 6.3 permits a party to move for reconsideration of a court order within 14 days after the entry of the Court's determination of the original motion. \"The standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked - matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926073\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/255/#p257\">\n    70 F.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (2d Cir. 1995). \"The major grounds justifying reconsideration are 'an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520218\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/1245/#p1255\">\n    956 F.2d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4478 at 790). Of importance, \"a motion to reconsider should not be granted where the moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926073\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/255/#p257\">\n    70 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court will reconsider the Order, because the court apparently overlooked the fact that the Second Amended Complaint only corrected clerical errors in the First Amended Complaint. To the extent that it expressed that the revisions in\n   the Second Amended Complaint addressed the merits of the motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, the Court was incorrect. That being said, the Court now finds that the consequences of this misstatement were\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   , considering that the Court granted the Defendants leave to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint. With this in mind, the Court will treat the Defendants' January 18, 2018 motion to dismiss as a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
