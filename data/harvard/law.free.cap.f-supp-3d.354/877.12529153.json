Kenall argues that the License Agreement's No Challenge Clause-which, as noted, provides in part that \"Cooper shall refrain from contesting the validity, enforceability, or infringement of the Subject Patents in any court of law or other forum unless Kenall asserts the Subject Patents against Cooper products other than the Subject Products,\" Doc. 1-1 at pp. 41-42, \u00a7 15-prohibits Cooper from raising this defense because Kenall's suit asserts Subject Patents against Subject Products.

Even setting aside forfeiture, Kenall is correct. As relevant here, the License Agreement defines Subject Patents to include the '055 patent, patents claiming priority to U.S. Application No. 10/156,423, and reissues of those patents.

All five are Subject Patents: The '055 patent is named in the License Agreement's definition of \"Subject Patents,\" Doc. 1-1 at p. 35; the '241 and '656 patents claim priority to U.S. Application No. 10/156,423,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C494%2C241%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,494,241,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at [63];\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C550%2C656%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,550,656,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at [63]; and the '563 and '591 patents are reissues of the '241 and '055 patents, respectively,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Patent No. RE45,563, at [64]; U.S. Patent No. RE45,591, at [64].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Cooper argues, rather, that the No Challenge Clause does not apply because Kenall asserts the Subject Patents against products other than Subject Products. Doc. 108 at 7 &amp; n.1; Doc. 109 at 7; Doc. 117 at 7-11. As Cooper notes, Doc. 109 at 7, Kenall's patent infringement claim is necessarily\n   directed at unlicensed sales because this court dismissed the claim except as to Subject Single Products that Cooper sold after the license for those products expired on April 1, 2008.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527784\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/338/841/\">\n    338 F.Supp.3d at 850-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this premise, Cooper contends that the License Agreement's definition of \"Subject Products\" is coextensive with the scope of the license, such that an infringement claim directed at unlicensed sales is, by definition, not directed at Subject Products. Doc. 108 at 7 &amp; n.1; Doc. 109 at 7; Doc. 117 at 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Cooper's conclusion does not follow from its premise. As defined by the License Agreement, Subject Products comprise two types of objects: Subject Single Products and Subject Continuous Products. Doc. 1-1 at p. 35. Subject Single Products are defined in turn as Cooper's \"8\" and 12\" Linear Single products shown and/or referred to in the Cooper website documents (eight sheets) and additional photographs (three sheets) attached as Exhibit B\" to the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527784\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/338/841/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 57-68 (providing specifications for and photos of two Cooper products). Subject Continuous Products are similarly defined as Cooper's \"8\" and 12\" Linear Continuous products shown and/or referred to in ... Exhibit A\" to the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 43-56 (providing specifications for and photos of three Cooper products). Thus, contrary to Cooper's understanding, the Agreement defines Subject Products in terms of a given product's physical characteristics, not whether it is licensed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To support its interpretation, Cooper points to the following language in the License Agreement and, in particular, to the fact that it refers to Subject Products in defining the license's scope:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations in this Agreement, Kenall grants Cooper a worldwide, nonexclusive license under the Subject Patents to make, to have made, to use, to have used, to offer for sale, to have offered for sale, to sell, to have sold, to export, to have exported, to import and to have imported the Subject Products and any other products within the scope of the Subject Patents, all such products being referred to herein as \"Licensed Products.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 36, \u00a7 1. Rather than modifying the definition of Subject Products, however, this provision grants Cooper a license authorizing the manufacture, use, export, import, and sale of an already-defined category-the Subject Products. The rest of the Agreement then spells out the details of that license, one being that the license expires as to the Subject Single Products no later than April 1, 2008. Doc. 1-1 at pp. 36-37, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527784\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/338/841/\">\n    338 F.Supp.3d at 849-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, under the Agreement's plain terms, products defined as Subject Products do not cease being Subject Products once the license expires; rather, those products continue to be Subject Products whether or not they remain licensed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Land of Lincoln Goodwill Indus., Inc. v.

Thus, Cooper's reading of the definition of Subject Products would transform the Settlement Agreement, under which it agreed to stop selling certain products after a grace period giving it time to design around Kenall's patents, into an agreement that inexplicably required Cooper to redesign its products while merely delaying the parties' dispute over whether Kenall's patents are valid and infringed by those products. Accordingly, Cooper's interpretation not only conflicts with the Agreement's plain language, but also would lead to nonsensical results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suburban Auto Rebuilders, Inc. v.

But in rejecting that capacious reading of the clause, the court did not reach the narrower question presented here. To thwart the first affirmative defense, Kenall need show only that the clause precludes Cooper from raising one specific defense: \"noninfringement\" in the sense of Cooper's defense that Kenall's patents do not cover Cooper's products, \"either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.\" Doc. 93 at \u00b6 89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20282\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (listing \"[n]oninfringement, absence of liability for infringement,\" \"unenforceability,\" and \"[i]nvalidity\" as defenses \"in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent\").

Cooper itself invokes this narrower sense of \"infringement\" and \"noninfringement\" by setting out noninfringement as an affirmative defense, Doc. 93 at \u00b6 89, and then in its brief by describing \"the infringement determination\" as \"comparing the patent claims as construed by the Court to the accused product\" to determine whether all the elements (or their equivalents) are present in the accused product, Doc. 108 at 6 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Kenall's interpretation of the No Challenge Clause is correct. It is altogether natural, if not expected, that an agreement settling patent litigation would bar future\n   litigation over whether the plaintiff's patents cover the defendant's products-that is, whether the defendant's products infringe the plaintiff's patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flex-Foot, Inc. v.

First, the clause begins with the phrase \"Cooper does not admit infringement, validity or enforceability of the Subject Patents.\" Doc. 1-1 at p. 41, \u00a7 15. Cooper admitted elsewhere in the License Agreement that it sold the Subject Products during the term of at least one of the Subject Patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 36 (admitting sales during 2006 and 2007);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C984%2C055\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,984,055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (issued Jan. 10, 2006) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (providing that the term of a patent \"begin[s] on the date on which the patent issues and end[s] 20 years from the date\" of filing of the earliest application to which the patent claims priority). Accordingly, all that was left for Cooper to decline to admit was that the Subject Products were covered by the Subject Patents, which suggests that the clause's first use of \"infringement\" takes the narrow meaning implicating only that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, while the No Challenge Clause next \"reserves\" for Cooper \"all defenses to any allegation of infringement\" related to those patents, it then adds \"\n   <em>\n    provided, however\n   </em>\n   , that Cooper shall refrain from contesting the validity, enforceability, or infringement of the Subject Patents\" where, as here, Kenall asserts the Subject Patents against Subject Products. Doc. 1-1 at pp. 41-42, \u00a7 15 (emphasis added). The fact that language reserving for Cooper \"all defenses to any allegation of infringement\" is followed by \"provided, however\" language barring Cooper from \"contesting ... infringement\" necessarily means that the \"infringement\" in \"contesting ... infringement\" refers to one of many potential \"defenses to any allegation of infringement,\" and thus that Cooper reserved all but the three identified defenses: invalidity, unenforceability, and noninfringement. True, this interpretation results in \"infringement\" meaning two different things\n   in the same sentence-first narrow (Cooper does not admit that the Subject Patents cover the Subject Products), then broad (Cooper reserves the right to defend itself if faced with a patent infringement suit), and then back to narrow (if Kenall asserts the Subject Patents against the Subject Products, Cooper will not dispute that the Subject Products are covered by the Subject Patents). But in doing so, the No Challenge Clause mirrors the Patent Act, which makes \"[n]oninfringement\" (narrow) one of many defenses to an \"infringement\" action (broad).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20282\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"The following shall be defenses in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent and shall be pleaded: (1) Noninfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More importantly, it would not make sense to read \"infringement\" to mean the same thing all three times it is used in the No Challenge Clause. If \"infringement\" bore the narrow meaning throughout, then the \"provided, however\" provision carved out everything Cooper reserved-and then some-by giving up the defense that the Subject Patents do not cover the Subject Products as well as the defenses of invalidity and unenforceability, even though only the first of those defenses would be reserved. And if \"infringement\" bore the broad meaning throughout, then \"validity\" and \"enforceability\" would become surplusage because prohibiting Cooper from defending itself against an infringement suit necessarily would prohibit it from doing so by raising invalidity and unenforceability defenses; the \"provided, however\" provision again would carve out everything Cooper reserved because it cannot raise \"defenses\" to a patent infringement suit without \"contesting\" that suit; and the clause would make the license illusory by preventing Cooper from raising the defense of license to \"contest[ ]\" an infringement suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the appearance of \"validity\" and \"enforceability\" along with \"infringement\" in the \"provided, however\" provision confirms that \"infringement\" in that clause bears a narrow meaning. The \"commonsense canon of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   ... counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\"\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

Here, the word \"infringement\" in the \"provided, however\" provision appears in a list alongside \"validity\" and \"enforceability,\" suggesting that \"contesting ... infringement\" is the same kind of thing as contesting validity or enforceability. Invalidity and unenforceability are defenses to a patent infringement action, and they are often listed alongside a third defense: noninfringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20282\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (listing \"[n]oninfringement,\" \"absence of liability for infringement,\" \"unenforceability,\" and \"[i]nvalidity\" as defenses to a patent infringement suit); N.D.

The three terms' appearance together thus signals that Cooper's agreement in the \"provided, however\" portion not to\n   contest infringement is an agreement not to raise a noninfringement defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The No Challenge Clause therefore bars Cooper's noninfringement defense-that is, Cooper's defense that the Subject Patents do not cover the Subject Products.

Kenall argues that the first allegation is implausible given its \"undisputed record of enforcement\" and that the second is \"fatally vague.\" Doc. 97 at 11-12.

Doc. 97 at 12-13.

R. Civ. P. 1. One of the ways the Rules pursue these purposes, though, is by setting out different procedures for different stages of litigation. It would not advance the Rules' purposes to read away the distinction between Rules 12(c) and 56 that the Civil Rules have drawn for more than eighty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4 Wright &amp; Miller,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1029 (\"[A] construction that ignores the plain wording of a rule or fails to view it as part of the total procedural system ultimately may prove to be as detrimental to the system as an arbitrary or rigid construction and, in the end, not further the goal of the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Rule 12(c) therefore does not permit Kenall to seek judgment solely as to liability on its contract and patent claims.

Given the substantial overlap between the affirmative defenses the court struck previously and those asserted in Cooper's amended answer, the defenses are stricken with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bausch v.
