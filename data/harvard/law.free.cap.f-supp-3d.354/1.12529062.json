BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict casts a long shadow, one that extends even to this Freedom of Information Act suit. Plaintiff here, the American Center for Law and Justice, challenges the State Department's withholding of portions of a report containing information about the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). State withheld the information under FOIA Exemption 1, contending that its release would be a threat to national security. In this suit, ACLJ challenges the withholding, and State now moves for summary judgment. Because the Court finds\n   that the invocation of Exemption 1 is sound, it will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ACLJ is a non-profit organization \"dedicated to the defense of constitutional liberties secured by law.\" ECF No. 1 (Compl.), \u00b6 5. In line with its mission, Plaintiff regularly makes records requests to federal, state, and local governments and then publishes its findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This case stems from one such request. In recounting the procedural history, the Court, for the purposes of this Motion, accepts as true ACLJ's factual retelling of all that has transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 15, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to State's Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS) seeking various documents related to the work of the UNRWA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. The request specifically asked for a State Department report concerning UNRWA aid to Palestinian refugees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Defendant failed to make a determination within the requisite twenty-day period, Plaintiff filed the instant Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 31-33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ACLJ later amended its request, limiting it to the specific UNRWA Report to Congress on Protracted Refugee Situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15-4 (Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts), \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-2 (Redacted Report).

As to the former, it argues that, because State has not complied with the technical requirements of Executive Order 13526 - the E.O. governing classification - its invocation of Exemption 1 was improper. As to the latter, it maintains that Defendant has not produced a sufficient substantive basis for its withholdings. The Court looks at each separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   E.O. 13526 enumerates a number of procedural requirements that the Government must satisfy in classifying information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%20707\">\n    75 Fed. Reg. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 29, 2009). ACLJ argues that State did not follow those requirements in two ways: (1) the original Report contained insufficient markings and assurances that Richard complied with the classification procedures originally; and (2) Richard did not provide an adequate rationale for classification on the Report, a mistake that cannot be cured by Stein's subsequent Declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Markings and Assurances\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 1.6 of the Executive Order requires documents at the time they are\n   classified to contain five sets of markings: (1) that the information was within one of the three classification levels; (2) the identity, by name and position, of the original classification authority; (3) the agency and office of origin; (4) instructions for declassification; and (5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories. The Report contains each of these markings: (1) it was labeled \"Confidential\"; (2) Anne C. Richard's name and position were given; (3) PRM, the office of origin, was cited; (4) it set the declassification date to occur on January 14, 2025; and (5) Reason 1.4(d) was provided as an applicable classification category.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Redacted Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ACLJ nonetheless argues that Richard failed to \"ma[k]e certain\" that the Report was properly classified under these requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Canning v.

This position is a stretch. To begin, the Order says nothing about a classifier's need to \"make certain\" that procedural requirements were met. As State correctly asserts, moreover, there are no magic words required to meet this standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7. Rather, in the absence of bad faith, general statements of procedural compliance may suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch v.

There is no allegation of evidence of such bad faith here. In addition, Stein, who has \"original classification authority and [is] authorized to classify and declassify national security information,\" repeatedly provides assurances throughout his Declaration that the Report is properly classified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16-18, 21, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that because Richard invoked \u00a7 1.4(d) as her classification rationale while Stein cited both \u00a7 1.4(b) and \u00a7 1.4(d), this somehow renders the entire classification improper. The Court is not persuaded. Section 1.6 of the Order requires that the relevant document contain \"a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories.\" E.O. 13526, \u00a7 1.6.(a)(5). This reason must be \"immediately apparent\" at the time of the original classification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572514\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/44/#p57\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572514\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/44/#p57\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 1.6(a). ACLJ takes this to mean that the only markings relevant to the Court's analysis are those contained in the initial Report, and that Stein's subsequent addition of \u00a7 1.4(b) classification renders the Report's initial classification under \u00a7 1.4(d) invalid. That makes little sense. The fact that the original Report held one fewer classification rationale has no bearing on whether the information was properly classified originally. Whether Richard made reference to only \u00a7 1.4(d) in her initial classification is irrelevant, as \"the information is within one of eight protected categories listed in section 1.4 of the Order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Competitive Enter.

One of these states that the original classification authority must \"determine[ ] that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.\" E.O. 13526, \u00a7 1.1(a)(4). Plaintiff argues both that Richard failed to identify such relevant threats and that Stein was incapable of curing her omission, as that duty is reserved solely to the classification authority who reviews the Report \"in the first instance.\" Opp. at 7 (quoting E.O. 13526 \u00a7 6.1(gg) ). In other words, because Richard did not fully explain the threat in\n   classifying the original Report, Stein cannot bolster her effort with a subsequent affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This position holds no water. Plaintiff misinterprets the Order to mean that Richard must have articulated possible threats initially. ACLJ cites no caselaw to support this proposition, and with good reason - it does not exist. State properly asserts that the determining factor is whether a present-day original classification authority (in this case, Stein) is able to certify, based on his own independent review of the information, that it\n   <em>\n    presently\n   </em>\n   meets the standards for classification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 863, 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (accepting affidavits by CIA and NSA stating that records were \"currently properly classified\" as sufficient to establish that they were appropriately withheld under Exemption 1);\n   <em>\n    cf\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Cir. 1980) ). That rule makes practical sense as well. For example, where a new threat arose between the time of original classification and subsequent classification, Plaintiff's theory would bar the Government's ability to protect the information. The Court should not endorse such a position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This does not mean, however, that Richard - who first marked the document classified - has no duties in this respect. Rather, the Order is clear that \"[a]t the time of original classification,\" the classification authority must provide \"a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4.\" E.O. 13526, \u00a7 1.6(a)(5).

Section 1.4(b) classification applies to foreign-government information, which is defined as information provided to the United States Government by a foreign government \"with the expectation that the information, the source of the information, or both, are to be held in confidence.\" E.O. 13526, \u00a7 6.1(s). Section 1.4(d), conversely, covers \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources.\" Plaintiff alleges that: (1) Stein's Declaration is insufficient because he did not demonstrate the\n   requisite personal knowledge of the basis for classification; and (2) even if he did, Stein did not adequately describe his rationale for why the documents should be classified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   a.

Stein explicitly states that the statements are \"based upon [his] personal knowledge, which in turn is based upon information furnished to [Stein] in the course of [his] official duties.\" Stein Decl., \u00b6 1. In applying Exemption 1, at least one court in this district has found an almost identical statement sufficient to satisfy the personal-knowledge requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310738\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/881/38/#p64\">\n    881 F.Supp.2d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court reaches the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Unsatisfied with this standard, Plaintiff then attempts to tack on requirements that Stein specify the precise means by which he learned of this information, such as whether it came through a \"review of documents, testimony, or written statements.\" Opp. at 10. ACLJ cites no basis for such intensive inquiry, and this Court does not impose one today.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carney v.

Rationales\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ACLJ also takes issue with each of Stein's classification rationales. Recall that under \u00a7 1.6(a)(5) of the Order, an original classification authority must provide a \"concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of [the Order].\" Two rationales are offered in the Declaration: \u00a7 1.4(b) and \u00a7 1.4(d). ACLJ suggests that Stein, somehow knowing Richard's \u00a7 1.4(d) classification to be insufficient standing alone, attempted to pull the wool over its eyes by later asserting \u00a7 1.4(b) without requisite explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Yet Stein gave a plethora of reasons as to why both \u00a7 1.4(b) and (d) were accurate rationales to support classification. With respect to \u00a7 1.4(b), he stated that: (a) \"A portion of the classified information is 'foreign government information' provided to the Department by a foreign government or international organization with the expectation that it would be kept confidential,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16; (b) \"A representative of the source of this foreign government information recently reaffirmed to a State Department official that it continues to have the same expectation of confidentiality with respect to the information provided to the State Department, which was utilized in the report,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; and (c) \"Additional classified information in the report was derived from other State Department sources discussing the region, which were themselves classified at the [c]onfidential level.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that these are conclusory, again requesting information as to the source and method of communication with this representative, as well as raising other specific questions as to the nature of Stein's knowledge of these discussions with foreign officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 8, 10. State has no obligation to answer Plaintiff's multitude of questions - in fact, E.O. 13526 does not \"require that a classifying authority indicate the person who classified the information in question or when [that] information [was] originally classified.\"\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/#p501\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). On the contrary, \"the text of Exemption 1 itself suggests that little proof or explanation is required beyond a plausible assertion that information is properly classified.\"\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stein has done just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   His Declaration also explains specific harms that would likely occur as a result of the information's release. He notes that the \"ability to obtain information from foreign governments is essential to the formulation and successful implementation of U.S. foreign policy,\" and that the \"[r]elease of foreign government information provided in confidence ... would cause foreign officials to believe that U.S. officials are not able or willing to observe the confidentiality expected in such interchanges.\" Stein Decl., \u00b6 26. He then describes the potentially damaging impact release would have on a \"number of our bilateral relationships with countries whose cooperation is important to U.S. national security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-29 (describing further potential harm to foreign relations from disclosure). It is against precisely such harm to the Government's \"foreign relations\" that \u00a7 1.4(d) seeks to protect. These statements are thus sufficient because they demonstrate that \"the withheld information logically falls within the claimed exemption[s]\" - namely, the ones identified in both \u00a7 1.4(b) and \u00a7 1.4(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only conclusory assertions the Court sees are those of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ACLJ last argues that the \"proper justification for withholding the information under Section 1.4(d) relies upon a proper showing under Section 1.4(b).\" Opp. at 11. Put simply, Plaintiff seems to believe that a \u00a7 1.4(d) classification cannot stand on its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 10-11. This contention founders on two shoals. First, the Court has just determined that State\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   made a sufficient showing under \u00a7 1.4(b). Second, Stein has also satisfactorily explained why the \u00a7 1.4(d) classification was appropriate, an explanation this Court accepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; 27-29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (instructing \"defere[nce] to executive affidavits predicting harm to the national security\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With both \u00a7 1.4(b) and (d) properly invoked, ACLJ's argument falls apart. The Executive Order requires only that \"the information is within\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   or more of the [protected] categories ... listed in section 1.4\" of the Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   E.O. 13526, \u00a7 1.1(a) (emphasis added).

ACLJ posits that the discussion there of topics similar to those classified here and a letter by members of Congress requesting declassification of the Report undermine the Government's contention that disclosure could actually pose a threat to national\n   security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 12. In other words, any classification would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court is not convinced. ACLJ bases its first claim on the fact that some topics similar to information referred to in three of the classified paragraphs are \"routinely provided and/or discussed on UNRWA's website.\" Opp. at 11. Plaintiff asserts that, because of the \"broad public discussion\" of these topics, it is \"inconceivable\" that the information withheld would pose a legitimate threat to national security if released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that ACLJ's conclusion does not necessarily follow from its premise. For instance, it is entirely possible that the government did not rely on \"information provided ... by a foreign government,\" E.O. 13526, \u00a7\u00a7 1.4(b), 6.1(s)(1), in compiling information within a certain topic at one time, but did at a later time. But more significantly, Plaintiff's assertions run headlong into State's assessment of the impact of disclosure. Stein has provided a long list of potential harms to foreign relations or activities of the United States in the event of release, including \"damage to [ ] a number of our bilateral relationships with countries whose cooperation is important to U.S. national security, including some in which public opinion might not currently favor close cooperation with the United States\" and the possibility that the withheld information would \"impair the U.S.['s] ability to continue [as] an intermediary\" in related negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27.

The Court will take Stein - not the Internet - at his word.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nor is there any basis to a possible claim that State has waived its classification authority through an official acknowledgment. It is true that, where \"the government has officially acknowledged information, a FOIA plaintiff may compel disclosure of that information even over an agency's otherwise valid exemption claim.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU v. U.S. Dep't of Defense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n    628 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   620 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378 ). Yet, the Stein Declaration explicitly states that \"the Department has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   previously authorized or officially acknowledged public release of\" the specific information withheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6 21 (emphasis added). ACLJ points to no evidence to the contrary. Although courts typically assess official acknowledgments through a multi-factor test,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n    628 F.3d at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , given the express and plausible assertions by State on this question, the Court sees no reason to go that far.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6 21. If Exemption 1 were considered waived every time a controversial issue was discussed on the Internet, then even the most sensitive information would be subject to disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff then points to a letter written by certain members of Congress to President Trump that requested that the information be declassified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 12; Letter to Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, from Members of the United States House of Representatives (Apr. 18, 2018). It is a dangerous proposition indeed that executive-branch determinations should be overruled by a simple missive from a few members of the legislature. Such a theory would overturn years of deference to executive affidavits in matters\n   of national security and potentially implicate separation of powers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   865 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon v.

It is true that E.O. 13526 \u00a7 1.7(a) provides that classification shall not be used to \"prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.\" ACLJ's argument, however, is mere unsupported speculation, and the Court will not entertain it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Competitive Enter.

Even if certain portions\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be considered embarrassing to State, \"it would nonetheless be covered by Exemption 1 if, independent of any desire to avoid embarrassment, the information withheld [was] properly classified.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.
