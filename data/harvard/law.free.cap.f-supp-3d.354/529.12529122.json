INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Through this lawsuit, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the \"Plaintiff\" or \"Commonwealth\") seeks to hold Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions, LLC, (collectively, \"Defendants\" or \"Navient\") liable for conduct that has allegedly harmed student loan borrowers in Pennsylvania, as well as student loan borrowers nationwide. Specifically, the Commonwealth contends that Navient has committed a variety of unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in connection with the origination and servicing of student loans in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (\"CFPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205536\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (\"CPL\"), 73 Pa Stat. and Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 201-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1). The Commonwealth's case is similar to a parallel action before the Court involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") and Navient,\n   <em>\n    CFPB v. Navient Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-101 (M.D. Pa. filed Jan. 18, 2017) (hereinafter, the \"\n   <em>\n    CFPB-Navient\n   </em>\n   matter\"), and references to the Court's previous ruling on Navient's Motion to Dismiss the CFPB's Complaint are made in the body of this Opinion.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 5, 2017, Navient filed a Motion to Dismiss the Commonwealth's Complaint Under Rule\n   12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (the \"Motion\"). (Doc. 16). Navient submitted its Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss on December 22, 2017 (Navient's \"Brief in Support\"). (Doc. 24). The Commonwealth responded on February 2, 2018 with its Memorandum of Law in Support of its Opposition to Navient's Motion to Dismiss (the Commonwealth's \"Opposition\"). (Doc. 25). Navient submitted a reply brief in response to the Commonwealth's Opposition on March 5, 2018 (Navient's \"Reply\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since fully briefing the Motion, the parties have submitted several Notices of Supplemental Authority to the Court pursuant to Local Rule 7.36. On March 13, 2018, Navient filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority informing the Court of published notice from the Department of Education (\"ED\") on ED's position on \" Federal Preemption and State Regulation of [ED]'s Federal Student Loan Programs and Federal Student Loan Servicers,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010619\">\n    83 Fed.

For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny Navient's Motion to Dismiss in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commonwealth's Complaint (Doc. 1) alleges the following facts which, for the purposes of resolving Navient's Motion, the Court takes as true:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants were or currently are in the business of originating, marketing, servicing, and collecting federal and private student loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). \"Defendants Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions, LLC have two corporate predecessors: a parent company (SLM Corporation) and a subsidiary (Sallie Mae, Inc.).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). \"In April 2014, Defendants Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions, LLC assumed the liabilities of their predecessors, SLM Corporation and Sallie Mae, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). Defendant Navient Corporation shares corporate officers with Defendant Navient Solutions, LLC, and controls and directs the hiring of employees at Navient Solutions, LLC, which is a subsidiary of Navient Corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). Defendant \"Navient Corporation often makes no meaningful distinction between Navient Corporation and its subsidiaries,\" and \"consented to, has knowledge of, has materially participated in, and/or has controlled the activities of Navient Solutions, LLC with respect to the conduct alleged in [the] Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The conduct alleged in the Complaint involves Navient's origination and servicing of federal and private student loans, some of which occurred at Navient's corporate\n   predecessors before the transfer of corporate liabilities in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 45-172). Federal student loans offer features distinct from other loan products, most notably, the availability of repayment options that are tied to the borrower's income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). \"Until approximately 1994, federal student loans were originated and funded by private lenders such as Defendants, and guaranty agencies insured those funds, which were reinsured by the government pursuant to the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Starting in 1994, the federal government also began lending directly to borrowers through the Direct Loan Program, and ceased the FFELP program in 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). Whether a federal student loan was originated through the FFELP or Direct Loan Program, the servicing of federal student loans is handled by private entities like Navient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   33). \"Federal student loan servicers handle a multitude of issues for borrowers, including: collecting payments, providing repayment options to borrowers, facilitating the loan's payoff, and collecting on delinquent loans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unlike federal student loans, private student loans are not guaranteed by the government and are issued \"based on the lender's assessment of the borrower's creditworthiness/likelihood of repaying the loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). They are often more expensive than federal student loans, with higher interest rates, and often require cosigners who are \"equally responsible for the payments on the loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41). They do not offer standard repayment plan options, such as the income-driven repayment options provided by federal student loans, which can prevent borrowers from defaulting on their loans and suffering serious financial consequences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. NAVIENT'S LOAN ORIGINATION-RELATED CONDUCT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"As far back as the year 2004,\" Navient's corporate predecessors \"originated both FFELP and private student loans nationwide, including in Pennsylvania.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 45). The lending landscape for student loan originators has changed over the years: until about 2007, when federal regulations changed, many schools \"maintained a list of 'preferred lenders' to provide guidance to students who had to choose between the different lenders offering federal and private student loans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50). Preferred lenders \"typically received in aggregate up to 90% of the loans taken out by the institution's students and their parents, giving the preferred lender exclusive or near-exclusive access to a school's population of borrowers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). Navient \"sought to establish [itself] at the top of preferred lending lists in order to obtain\" this exclusive access, and created custom packages of loans to market to schools to obtain their business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). \"These packages consisted of a variety of loan products including: FFELP loans; private loans for borrowers who qualified for [Navient's] standard private student loan products (prime loans); and private loans for borrowers who were ineligible for [Navient's] standard private student loan products (subprime loans).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). Both schools and Navient had a motivation to include private loans as part of a package deal, because more students could obtain financing to attend school and because it meant Navient could obtain a greater volume of FFELP loans, which were a larger part of the market and were lower risk for Navient due to a 100% federal government guarantee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56). In general, private student loans were also more lucrative for Navient, because of their higher interest rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). However, subprime loans, which suffered from high levels of default and were not profitable\n   for Navient, were merely included in the loan packages as a marketing tool to gain access to schools' preferred lender lists. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). Internal communications evidence Navient's motivation to use subprime loans as a tool to win prime and FFELP business, despite the poor performance of the subprime loan portfolio:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In February 2007, Defendants internally described their subprime lending strategy and implications as follows: \"Current Strategy is Working: - Use subprime to win school deals and secure FFELP and standard private volume - View economics on an all-in basis[ ]\"; ... [and] [o]ne of Defendants' January 17, 2007 emails entitled \"Subprime Lending workgroup meeting attachments,\" describes one of Defendants' subprime loan programs as \"the baited hook to gain [FFELP] volume.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Navient's desire to obtain access to preferred lender lists and the associated benefit of increased FFELP and prime loan volume led it to loosen its credit standards downward and lend to borrowers who attended schools with low graduation rates (less than 50%, in some instances). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76). Navient pursued subprime loan borrowers despite the likelihood that some or many of these borrowers would not graduate and would be unable to repay their student loans; these borrowers were responsible for a large percentage of Navient's \"credit losses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, 82-83, 85). As Navient's loan originations grew rapidly from 2000 to 2006, much of the increase was due to growth in subprime loan originations to risky borrowers who attended for-profit or non-profit schools with less than 50% graduation rates, with FICO scores of 640 or less, and who were charged high interest rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81). Within these particularly risky loan cohorts, \"in every year from 2000 to 2007, between 68% and 87% of ... [l]oans defaulted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82). Borrowers who took out subprime student loans with Navient \"were not told, and had no idea, that they were far more likely to default than pay back their loans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84). Additionally, these borrowers were not told about steps that Navient took to insulate itself from the credit risk of defaults, including \"credit enhancement\" or \"recourse\" arrangements, in which schools agreed to accept some of the default risk of the subprime loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-92). The Commonwealth asserts that subprime borrowers were harmed by Navient's loan origination-related conduct, including by having to delay starting a family, save for a down payment on a house, or start their own business \"and actually apply the education for which they borrowed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. NAVIENT'S LOAN SERVICING-RELATED CONDUCT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ALLEGED FORBEARANCE STEERING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, federal student loans come with certain protections for borrowers that are not standard features of private student loans. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 42-43, 97-103). One of these protections is income-driven repayment (\"IDR\") plans, which are linked to borrowers' income and family size, and are intended to make monthly payments more affordable (sometimes $0 per month) and sometimes offer interest payment benefits, depending on the type of federal student loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96-100). Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans can also obtain loan forgiveness if they enroll in the plans and make qualifying payments for 20-25 years \"for most IDR plans or 10 years of qualifying payments while working full time for certain employers, under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Federal student loans are generally also eligible for\n   <strong>\n    forbearance\n   </strong>\n   , which is a short-term, temporary postponement of payment. With forbearance, a borrower experiencing financial hardship or illness\n   may be able to stop making payments or reduce his or her monthly payment for a defined period of time, which can be multiple consecutive months. Borrowers may be entitled to multiple forbearances over the course of a loan, up to 36 months in total.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103) (emphasis in the Commonwealth's Complaint). Forbearance is generally only appropriate for borrowers facing temporary financial hardship, due to the \"accumulation of unpaid interest and the addition of that unpaid interest to the principal balance\": \"[Navient's] website states that forbearance is appropriate for borrowers 'who have a problem making on-time payments due to a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     temporary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   financial difficulty.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-05) (emphasis in the Commonwealth's Complaint). IDR plans are usually a better option for borrowers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite this, the Commonwealth alleges that since at least July 2011, Navient affirmatively steered borrowers facing long-term financial hardship into forbearance rather than exploring more appropriate IDR options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-10). Navient took this course of action despite telling borrowers to contact it to obtain help in evaluating repayment options, placing statements on its website that included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"If you're experiencing problems making your loans payments, please contact us. Our representatives can help you by identifying options and solutions, so you can make the right decision for your situation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 \"We can help you find an option that fits your budget, simplifies payment, and minimizes your total interest cost.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108). The Commonwealth alleges that Navient's motivation in steering borrowers to forbearance rather than evaluating IDR options is rooted in a desire to cut down on lengthy customer-service interactions and processing of forms, which are more likely when enrolling a borrower in an IDR plan versus a forbearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Between January 2010 and March 2015, the number of borrowers that Defendants enrolled in forbearance has generally exceeded the number of borrowers enrolled in IDR repayment plans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117). Navient steered borrowers having problems making a payment on their loans into voluntary forbearance rather than advising them about IDR plans; \"many of those borrowers would have likely qualified for a $0 payment in an IDR plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118). \"Defendants also enrolled many borrowers in multiple consecutive forbearances, even though they had clearly demonstrated a long-term inability to repay their loans, rather than the short-term financial hardship appropriate for forbearances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121). Hundreds of thousands of borrowers were enrolled in extended periods of forbearance lasting two or three years, or more. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Because Defendants placed IDR borrowers into forbearance before ultimately enrolling them in IDR plans with a $0 payment, the borrowers had delayed access to the benefits of IDR and were negatively impacted by consequences of forbearance, including the addition of interest to the principal and lost months that would have otherwise counted toward forgiveness. This may have been avoided had Defendants enrolled borrowers in IDR initially.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. ALLEGED INCOME RECERTIFICATION FAILURES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans for their federal student loans must recertify their income and family size every twelve months, as an IDR payment is only valid for that period of time. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 131). Borrowers will suffer negative consequences if they do not timely recertify their IDR payment, including: an increased monthly payment; the addition of\n   unpaid, accrued interest to the loan principal; the potential loss of an interest subsidy for subsidized federal loans; and delayed progress towards loan forgiveness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Commonwealth alleges that Navient, in issuing notices to borrowers regarding their IDR plans, did not advise borrowers of the negative consequences of failing to submit timely, complete, and correct recertifications to renew borrowers' IDR plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-45). For example, in the \"initial disclosure notice\" provided to borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan, Navient did not include a specific renewal deadline or advise of negative consequences for failing to timely meet recertification requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 133-34). \"From at least January 1, 2010 until December 2012, Defendants' annual renewal notices for IDR plans sent through U.S. mail\" did not include a specific renewal deadline or advise borrowers of negative consequences for failing to timely meet recertification requirements, instead providing vague and incomplete information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Navient's electronic annual renewal notices (sent to most of Navient's federal loan borrowers, as they had consented to receiving electronic communications) required borrowers to log into Navient's website to view the full renewal notice, and the email containing the link to Navient's website did not provide information regarding the purpose of the notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 140-41). Navient tracked the number of borrowers who clicked on hyperlinks in Navient emails sent to them, and so \"knew or should have known that many borrowers did not view the electronic renewal notices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144). \"Between at least July 2011 and March 2015, the percentage of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment in IDR plans regularly exceeded 60%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145). Starting in March 2015, Navient \"made several enhancements\" to their email renewal notices, and the renewal rate for IDR plans \"has more than doubled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    3. ALLEGED COSIGNER RELEASE MISREPRESENTATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"A cosigner is generally necessary for a borrower to obtain a private student loan, or to obtain that loan with more favorable terms. Once a borrower enters repayment on his/her private student loan with Defendants, he/she generally can apply to release the cosigner from the loan after meeting certain eligibility criteria.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 149). \"Since at least January 2010, one of the eligibility criteria that Defendants have required private student loan borrowers to meet before they can apply to release a cosigner is that the borrower must make a minimum number of\n   <strong>\n    consecutive, on-time payments\n   </strong>\n   consisting of both principal and interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150) (emphasis in the Commonwealth's Complaint). Depending on the time period (prior or subsequent to January 21, 2014), Navient has required borrowers to make a varying number of \"consecutive, on-time principal and interest payments before applying for cosigner release,\" but Navient has failed \"to specifically define for borrowers 'consecutive' or 'on-time' payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151). This has led to confusion for borrowers who have made monthly payments on their loans that are in excess of what they owe.

Navient has told borrowers in \"paid ahead\" status in any given month that the amount due for that month is $0, but until at least mid-2015, if those borrowers did not make a payment\n   during that month, Navient treated the \"lack of payment by a borrower in response to a $0 bill as a failure to make a 'consecutive, on-time principal and interest payment' that month\" and reset the borrower's progress towards cosigner release to zero months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154-56). \"Nothing on Defendants' billing statement, their website, nor any other borrower-facing document advised borrowers that making no payment in response to a $0 bill could impact their eligibility for cosigner release.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158).

Defendants, however, do not have adequate processes and procedures in place to sufficiently address certain errors they make in the processing of payments they receive or to prevent errors from recurring.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 162). These errors have included errors in the allocation of payments, or how a payment is distributed across multiple loans, and application of payments, or how a payment is applied to a specific loan or loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163-72). \"Since at least July 2011, many borrowers and cosigners, primarily those who pay by mailing a check or through an external bill payment system, have complained that Defendants misallocated or misapplied submitted payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165). \"One source for payment processing errors appears to be Defendants' default payment allocation methodology which Defendants did not disclose on any billing statement, promissory note, or printed or online resource available to borrowers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166). \"Because Defendants did not make their default allocation methodologies clear or public until at least late 2013, prior to that time, borrowers generally had no way of knowing in advance how Defendants might allocate payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because of issues with Navient's mail reading equipment, Navient has not always properly detected and applied written instructions placed by borrowers on their paper checks.

Navient has not systematically categorized or tracked many borrower inquiries regarding payment processing errors that were not escalated to supervisors, and has not identified or fixed underlying issues surrounding such errors, leading to some borrowers facing the same errors in numerous months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 170-71).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Navient raises numerous arguments in seeking to dismiss the Commonwealth's Complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Navient's first two sets of arguments are based on preclusion and preemption theories. First, Navient contends that a proper reading of the CFPA bars the Commonwealth from bringing a \"copycat\" action under the CFPA where the CFPB has already filed a similar lawsuit alleging identical claims under the CFPA (Counts III, V, VII, &amp; IX).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, Navient argues that certain federal laws, the Higher Education Act (\"HEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , preempt the Commonwealth's loan origination, forbearance steering, and recertification conduct claims brought under\n   the CPL (Counts I, II, &amp; IV). Finally, Navient asserts a litany of arguments against most of the Commonwealth's claims to contend that the Commonwealth has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Counts l-V, VIII-IX). The Court will address each set of arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE CFPA AND STATE \"COPYCAT\" ACTIONS (COUNTS III, V, VII, &amp; IX)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Navient begins its attack on the Commonwealth's Complaint by arguing that \"the Commonwealth's complaint is an unauthorized 'copycat' lawsuit.\" (Doc. 24 at 1). This argument is specifically focused on the Commonwealth's CFPA claims, which Navient asserts impermissibly \"parrot allegations from a materially indistinguishable lawsuit filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") nearly a year ago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While Navient agrees that the CFPA allows a state to file a civil action under the statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205552\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , it argues that the text and structure of the remainder of \u00a7 5552 should lead the Court to conclude that \u00a7 5552(a) does not permit a state to bring an action \"where, as here, the CFPB itself has been pursuing materially indistinguishable claims against Navient for more than nine months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). Navient's complex statutory interpretation argument relies on \"three features of the statute\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (1) \"the CFPA's pre-suit notice provisions, which condition state-initiated CFPA claims on the [state] AG 'provid[ing] a copy of the complete complaint to be filed and written notice describing such action or proceeding to the Bureau,' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205552\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5552(b)(1)(C) (describing what should be included in the written notice, including \"the alleged facts underlying the proceeding and whether there may be a need to coordinate the prosecution of the proceeding so as not to interfere with any action, including any rulemaking, undertaken by the Bureau, a prudential regulator, or another Federal agency\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (2) \"the statute's intervention provisions, which authorize the CFPB to intervene as a party-plaintiff in any state-initiated CFPA litigation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205552\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (3) \"the lack of statutory authorization for state intervention in pending CFPB cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Doc. 24 at 10-14). Essentially, Navient argues that that the CFPA does not make sense if a court allows what it characterizes as a \"copycat\" lawsuit. \"Pre-suit notice\" from a state AG is irrelevant if the CFPB is conducting its own identical lawsuit, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11), and allowing intervention by the CFPB in a state-initiated CFPA case would be prohibited by the traditional \"rule that a single-party plaintiff cannot simultaneously maintain two actions against the same defendant(s),\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). And it argues that congressional intent to exclude a \"copycat\" action is shown because Congress did not specifically authorize a state to intervene in a pending CFPB case, when it has provided for a state right of intervention in other federal statutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). Navient closes its line of\n   argument with a policy-based argument that allowing \"copycat\" lawsuits would burden courts and risk inconsistent rulings, which would work against what it says is an avowed purpose of the CFPA, to \"enforce Federal consumer financial law\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     consistently.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205511\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added in Navient's Brief in Support) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Commonwealth responds in its Opposition by affirmatively arguing that the \"plain and unambiguous meaning\" of \u00a7 5552 permits concurrent state claims, and that if Congress had wanted to explicitly preclude concurrent state claims, it would have done so. (Doc. 25 at 4). In making this argument, the Commonwealth references two other sections of the CFPA:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205514\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B)(i), which prohibits either the FTC or CFPB from filing an action if the other agency has already filed an action based on the same legal claims; and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205515\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), which provides \"backup enforcement\" authority for the federal banking regulators over \"very large\" depository institutions if the CFPB does not use its primary enforcement authority. (Doc. 25 at 5). The Commonwealth also cites other federal consumer protection statutes to \"exemplify Congress' ability to authorize state enforcement and prohibit concurrent state claims when it so intends.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And the Commonwealth emphasizes that \"Navient cannot point to any court that has\n   <em>\n    blocked\n   </em>\n   concurrent CFPA claims,\" and cites to a case in the District of New Mexico where a federal court allowed a state AG to \"pursue CFPA claims based on the same underlying conduct of a previously-filed CFPB consent order,\"\n   <em>\n    New Mexico ex rel. King v. Capital One Bank (USA) N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022436\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/980/1314/\">\n    980 F.Supp.2d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2013). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 &amp; n.4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Commonwealth also responds to Navient's CFPA statutory interpretation arguments by arguing that Navient \"misses the point of the notice provision\" of the CFPA; that the \"intervention provision\" in the CFPA does not imply that the CFPA prohibits concurrent state claims, because similar provisions also exist in other statutes that prohibit or allow concurrent state actions; and that \"the CFPA's omission of an unconditional state intervention right has no bearing on whether states may file concurrent claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9). Finally, in response to Navient's argument that allowing concurrent state lawsuits will burden the courts, the Commonwealth states that \"[d]ismissing Pennsylvania's CFPA claims would not appreciably reduce the scope of this case because the CPL counts rely on similar underlying facts as the CFPA claims,\" and that the risk that the CFPB will drop its lawsuit makes it important to allow the Commonwealth to continue its case in order to protect consumers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Navient argues in its Reply that the Commonwealth's reliance on the provisions in the CFPA that prohibit federal regulators from engaging in concurrent actions is misplaced because those provisions are solely focused on federal agencies and the division of enforcement responsibility \"among\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     federal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   agencies with otherwise-concurrent enforcement jurisdiction in a post-CFPB world\" which it asserts was one of the purposes of the CFPA. (Doc. 26 at 1-2). Instead, \u00a7 5552, it contends, exists only to allow states to step in if the CFPB is not acting, and Navient cites the legislative history of the provision, which Navient argues establishes that Congress was focused on situations when \"federal regulators are not 'asleep at the switch.' \" (Doc. 26 at 2). Navient also counters the Commonwealth's citation to other federal statutes which explicitly prohibit concurrent state actions by questioning the application of the\n   <em>\n    Russello\n   </em>\n   presumption,\n   <em>\n    Russello v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n    464 U.S. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n    104 S.Ct. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n    78 L.Ed.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), of ascribing meaning to congressional silence because\n   Navient asserts that other textual and contextual evidence here point to congressional intent. (Doc. 26 at 3). Navient further argues that the Commonwealth's responses to its statutory interpretation arguments are deficient, and, in reply, mainly restates or rephrases arguments it presented in its Brief in Support. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5).

A state seeking to bring a concurrent action may have a different litigation strategy than the CFPB, even if it alleges the same or similar claims in its own case. In that case, the notice would provide the CFPB with an opportunity to advise the state, perhaps with lessons learned from its own experience in its concurrent action. More importantly, as the Commonwealth points out in its Opposition, \u00a7 5552(b)(1)(C), which specifies the minimum contents of the written notice a state must provide to the CFPB before initiating an action, contains language which explicitly contemplates that the CFPB may already have its own action underway: \"[the written notice should describe] whether there may be a need to coordinate the prosecution of the proceeding so as not to interfere with\n   <em>\n    any action\n   </em>\n   , including any rulemaking,\n   <em>\n    undertaken by the Bureau\n   </em>\n   , a prudential regulator, or another Federal agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205552\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C)(iii) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The intervention provision in \u00a7 5552(b)(2) also does not suggest that concurrent state enforcement actions are barred by the CFPA.

Thus, contrary to Navient's argument, the existence of other statutes which establish the right of a state to intervene in a federal case, such as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which allows a non-party state to intervene in a case if the constitutionality of a state statute is called into question, has no bearing on the Commonwealth's ability to bring its own case under a statute which explicitly grants the Commonwealth the right to bring its action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Navient's policy argument that permitting \"copycat\" lawsuits creates burdens for courts and risks inconsistent rulings on issues of federal consumer financial law also does not contravene the plain text of \u00a7 5552(a)(1). Navient cites to the CFPA's statement of the purpose of the CFPB in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205511\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in support of this argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The Bureau shall seek to implement and, where applicable, enforce Federal consumer financial law consistently for the purpose of ensuring that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Notably absent from any part of \u00a7 5511(a) or the rest of \u00a7 5511 is any indication that enforcing \"Federal consumer financial law consistently\" precludes a state from bringing its own action under the CFPA.

THE HEA (COUNTS II &amp; IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Navient argues that the Commonwealth's state law loan servicing claims under the CPL regarding Navient's forbearance steering (Count II) and income-driven repayment plan recertification practices (Count IV) are preempted by the HEA. Navient contends that these claims are essentially that Navient made improper disclosures, and that the HEA expressly bars state law disclosure claims, citing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098g. (Doc. 24 at 15-19). Navient also argues that the claims are conflict preempted by the HEA because the HEA establishes \"clear, uniform standards\" for federal loan programs, and allowing state consumer protection lawsuits would threaten the uniformity and efficiency of federal student lending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). For both arguments, Navient relies heavily on a Ninth Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Chae v.

(Doc. 25 at 12). The Commonwealth argues that its loan servicing claims are distinct from loan origination claims, and were not brought in an attempt to impose state law disclosure requirements, citing\n   <em>\n    Genna v. Sallie Mae, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-cv-7371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201339482\">\n    2012 WL 1339482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2012) in support of its argument that express preemption should not apply. (Doc. 25 at 12-16). The Commonwealth focuses much of its rebuttal on Navient's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   , contending that\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present matter because \"\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   dealt with 'billing statements, coupon books, and standardized forms' that 'complied with federal regulations governing such instruments.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Genna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201339482\">\n    2012 WL 1339482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 ) ). The Commonwealth further asserts, \"the primary concept arising out of\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   -that a misrepresentation claim is merely the converse of a disclosure claim and, therefore, subject to preemption-is based upon an incomplete reading\" of\n   <em>\n    Cipollone v.

(Doc. 25 at 14-15). The Commonwealth also argues that the legislative history of the HEA suggests that \u00a7 1098g was intended to exempt federal student loans from TILA requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that the HEA does not conflict preempt its CPL loan servicing claims, arguing against the adoption of the \"uniformity\" preemption rationale from\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   , citing other sections of the HEA that expressly preempt certain types of state laws to contend that \"Congress intentionally did not preempt state law generally, or in respects other than those it addressed,\" and citing other cases where it contends that \"[o]ther courts have not reached\n   <em>\n    Chae\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that the goal of the HEA uniformity conflicts with the application of state law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20). The Commonwealth closes by stating it \"does not seek a specific disclosure regimen that would conflict with the HEA; it merely seeks compliance with the CPL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Navient replies that the Court should not apply any \"presumption against preemption\" here because \"Congress made its intent to preempt state law clear[,]\" it is improper to apply such a presumption to \"state laws seeking to regulate federal programs[,]\" and there is nothing in the cases that the Commonwealth cites to suggest that \u00a7 1098g applies only to \"standardized forms.\" (Doc. 26 at 7-10). Navient also challenges the Commonwealth's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Genna\n   </em>\n   and cites another case that found express preemption of similar claims at issue in the present matter,\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Great Lakes Educ. Loan Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-00183,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206501919\">\n    2017 WL 6501919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Ill. Dec. 19, 2017). (Doc. 26 at 9-11). Navient further attacks the Commonwealth's use of\n   <em>\n    Cipollone\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the \"portions invoked by the Commonwealth were joined only by four Justices-\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and expressly rejected by five\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" (Doc. 26 at 11-12 (emphasis in Navient's Reply) ), and that the Commonwealth's resort to the legislative history of \u00a7 1098g is not only inappropriate, but incorrect, as the Commonwealth cited the Senate Report that applies to the wrong section of the statute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). Finally, Navient responds to the Commonwealth's conflict preemption rebuttal by arguing there can be \"implied preemption of claims that fall outside the scope of an express preemption clause\" and emphasizing that the objective of the HEA is to establish \"clear, uniform standards\" and \"ensure the stability in the loan program,\" and that those \"objectives would be jeopardized if lenders and servicers are subjected 'to lawsuits under fifty separate sets of laws and court systems.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Navient closes that \"the only way a servicer or originator could comply with the CPL, as construed by the Commonwealth, would be to make additional disclosures\" that are not required by the HEA, and so the CPL claims conflict with the objectives of the HEA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court will address Navient's HEA express preemption arguments first before turning to Navient's conflict preemption arguments. Despite the complexity of the parties' preemption arguments, the express preemption clause from the HEA that is at the crux of the express preemption dispute is relatively simple:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00a7 1098g. Exemption from State disclosure requirements\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Loans made, insured, or guaranteed pursuant to a program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201070\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) shall not be subject to any disclosure requirements of any State law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098g. The parties' dispute thus hinges on the meaning of \"any disclosure requirements of any State law.\" Navient would have the Court take an expansive view of the phrase, whereas the Commonwealth urges a more restrained application based on its reading of the statute and preemption case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court finds that Navient's suggested interpretation of Section 1098g goes too far: the phrase \"any disclosure requirements of any State law\" does not apply to the sort of claims alleged by the Commonwealth here under the CPL, which are allegations of unfair and deceptive conduct related to forbearance steering and recertification. The HEA and its associated regulations only require that particular disclosures are to be made in the delivery of federal student loans and generally prescribes how those disclosures should be made.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201083\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (disclosure requirements for FFELP loans).

Indeed, the State's claims concerning practices related to enrolling borrowers in repayment plans (Compl., \u00b6 469 (a)-(d) ) are not \"re-styled disclosures' because the core of the State's allegations is that Navient schemed to steer borrowers into forbearances, not just that Navient failed to disclose the availability of IDR plans. Additionally, express preemption does not apply to the claims related to recertification in IDR plans because complying with the principles of the law does not mean that deceptive and unfair practices cannot be analyzed or questioned. Navient's own conduct of providing notices that vaguely stated when the borrower's renewal period would expire in both written and electronic notifications and misrepresenting the consequences of failing to renew removed itself from the context of what is an appropriate disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

Navient asserts that TILA only requires lenders to disclose certain credit terms to prevent \"informational overload.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Credit Co. v.

Navient contends that, in contrast, the allegations in the Commonwealth's Complaint would require Navient to \"disclose additional details regarding 'preferred lender' agreements, school graduation rates, default potential, and the effect of default on credit scores,\" and thus conflict with TILA's \"comprehensive disclosure rules that Congress decided to impose-and, equally important, not to impose-on private loan originators.\" (Doc. 24 at 21-22). Navient also asserts that \"subsequent actions by Congress indicate that it never intended to impose such disclosure obligations on private education lenders.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that Navient \"mischaracterizes Count I (origination) by restyling it simply as a request for additional disclosures while ignoring the breadth of averments detailing a comprehensive predatory lending scheme.\" (Doc. 25 at 21). The Commonwealth further contends that the cases cited by Navient in its Brief in Support did not involve TILA preemption issues or hold that TILA would preempt state consumer protection laws, and that \"in instances where a preemption analysis has been applied to TILA, state consumer protection laws have been found compatible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22). In its Reply, Navient echoes the argument it made in favor of HEA conflict preemption and asserts that the Commonwealth's CPL claims, including its loan origination claim, seek to impose additional disclosure requirements on Navient that are not required by TILA, and that this would \"directly undermine the goals, objectives, and specifics\" of TILA.

As the Illinois state court recently found in evaluating and rejecting a similar invocation of TILA preemption by Navient in the similar ongoing case brought by the State of Illinois under its state consumer protection statute regarding Navient's student loan practices, \"the State has not alleged that Navient failed to accurately disclose an interest rate, or failed to put certain terms in certain boxes on a TILA form.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Navient Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 CH 761, at 24 (III. Cir. Ct. July 10, 2018).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 174-75). According to the Commonwealth, Navient's unlawful conduct included originating subprime student loans to high risk borrowers to attend colleges with poor graduation and employment\n   rates and failing to disclose or concealing material facts from borrowers, such as Navient's relationships with schools and the high likelihood of default and damage to credit for borrowers who took out the subprime loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174). The Commonwealth alleges that this conduct violated Sections 201-2(4)(vii) and (xxi) of the CPL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20201-2\">\n    73 Pa.

Thus, TILA does not preempt the Commonwealth's CPL claim in Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    C. FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM ARGUMENTS (COUNTS I-V, VIII-IX)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In the final section of its Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss, Navient raises numerous additional arguments against the majority of the Commonwealth's claims under the CPL and the CFPA, asserting that these claims should be dismissed because they fail to allege \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" practices. (Doc. 24 at 22-30). The first three of these arguments focus on the Commonwealth's loan origination claim brought under the CPL in Count I: the Commonwealth cannot bring a CPL claim to enjoin allegedly ceased conduct; the claim does not allege actionable \"deceptive\" or \"unfair\" conduct; and the Commonwealth is barred by laches from alleging that it was \"unfair\" for Navient to lend to students attending Commonwealth-approved schools. Navient's fourth argument is that the Commonwealth's forbearance steering and income-driven repayment recertification claims under the CPL and the CFPA in Counts II-V fail to allege actionable deceptive conduct, and its fifth argument raises what is essentially a puffery defense to the Commonwealth's forbearance steering claims in Counts II and III. Navient's final argument is that the Commonwealth's payment processor claims in Counts VIII and IX challenge \"mistakes\" or \"errors\" that are non-actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    1. INJUNCTIVE AUTHORITY OVER ALLEGEDLY CEASED CONDUCT (COUNT I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Navient argues that Count I of the Commonwealth's Complaint seeks to enjoin conduct that, it asserts as alleged in the Complaint, ceased in 2007. Navient contends that the CPL only provides the Commonwealth with the authority to seek an injunction for conduct that is \"imminent or ongoing.\" (Doc. 24 at 23). And, Navient asserts, other relief that can be sought in the CPL, such as restitution and civil penalties, \"hinges on [the Commonwealth] first securing injunctive relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Navient concludes, Count I must be dismissed as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Commonwealth responds that Navient misreads the CPL and that \"case law supports the granting of injunctive relief for violations of the CPL based on past illegal conduct,\" because otherwise, one could merely claim that the conduct had been discontinued and avoid liability. (Doc. 25 at 22-23). Navient replies that the cases cited by the Commonwealth in support of its position are mere \"garden-variety application[s] of voluntary-cessation principles drawn from the mootness doctrine,\" and\n   involved the cessation of conduct for much shorter periods of time than the alleged ten years at issue in the present matter. (Doc. 26 at 17-18). Navient argues that \"the Commonwealth has not even alleged that there is any danger of reoccurrence of the conduct giving rise to these claims,\" and that it was Navient's predecessors that originated loans, not it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The plain text of the CPL grants the Commonwealth the authority to bring an action to seek a temporary or permanent injunction when it \"has reason to believe that any person is using or about to use any method, act or practice declared by ... this act to be unlawful, and that proceedings would be in the public interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20201-4\">\n    73 Pa.

Navient seizes upon the phrase \"is using or about to use\" in support of its argument that the Commonwealth cannot seek an injunction for past misconduct. However, as Navient later concedes its Reply, the fact that purported unlawful conduct has allegedly ceased is not a complete bar to seeking injunctive relief under the CPL. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26 at 17-18). Instead, numerous courts interpreting the CPL and other related state and federal consumer protection statutes, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, which courts have recognized is the model for the CPL, have found that an injunction can issue even if alleged unlawful conduct has ceased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Specifically, we conclude: 1) that an injunction can issue to restrain future conduct based on prior unlawful activity; 2) that cessation of the offending conduct does not, in and of itself, bar a claim for injunctive relief; and 3) the Court may consider whether the offending conduct is likely to reoccur absent the grant of an injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

While the Commonwealth's allegations appear to suggest that Navient's alleged unlawful loan origination conduct may have ceased in 2007 (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 77), this is not a concession that the Commonwealth believes that an injunction is unnecessary because the conduct is unlikely to reoccur. The Commonwealth instead alleges that Navient is \"using, [has] used, or [is] about to use methods, acts or practices declared unlawful\" by the CPL and that \"citizens of the Commonwealth are suffering and will continue to suffer harm unless the acts and practices complained of herein are permanently enjoined.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 12).

FAILURE TO ALLEGE \"DECEPTIVE\" OR \"UNFAIR\" CONDUCT IN LOAN ORIGINATION (COUNT I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Navient continues its argument for dismissal of the Commonwealth's loan origination claim under the CPL by asserting that the claim cannot be sustained as a matter of law because it does not allege any misrepresentations about the terms of the loans extended to borrowers. (Doc. 24 at 24-25). Navient asserts that \"[t]he Complaint does not allege Navient represented to any borrower that she would be able to repay her loans, nor could a borrower reasonably have relied on such representation,\" and that the Complaint does not allege that Navient entered into a fiduciary position with respect to its borrowers that would have necessitated more disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The Commonwealth responds that Navient \"mischaracterizes Count I's allegations[, and that] [t]he alleged misconduct does not relate to the terms of the loans or federal loan disclosures but rather to the unfair and deceptive manner in which Navient's subprime loans were originated and implemented.\" (Doc. 25 at 23). The Commonwealth further asserts that \"opportunistic and unfair lending practices violate the CPL,\" and that \"where a loan provider targets a vulnerable group of people and does not account for their ability to repay, then a court is likely to find there was predatory lending.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Navient replies that the cases relied upon by the Commonwealth only demonstrate that \"making false statements or unfairly inflating fees or interest rates violates the CPL,\" and that the Commonwealth's allegations essentially place Navient in the role of borrowers' fiduciary, which is \"fundamentally inconsistent with long-settled Pennsylvania law.\" (Doc. 26 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Evaluating Navient's argument requires the Court to analyze the CPL to determine if Count I states a claim for relief under the statute. \"The [CPL] was created to even the bargaining power between consumers and sellers in commercial transactions, and to promote that objective, it aims to protect the consumers of the Commonwealth against fraud and unfair or deceptive\n   business practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth by Shapiro v.

The Complaint presents an account of a subprime student lending operation that presents the types of unfair and unconscionable conduct in lending that has previously been found to state a colorable claim under the CPL. For example, the Complaint alleges that Navient only maintained its subprime student lending business to gain access to more profitable FFELP and prime private student loans. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 54-59, 65). The Complaint further alleges that, similar to the unfair self-serving conduct in\n   <em>\n    Milbourne\n   </em>\n   , Navient did not disclose to subprime borrowers that the loans had a high likelihood of default, and that, essentially, subprime borrowers served as pawns in Navient's quest for profits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 66-69, 84). Certain subprime loans experienced astonishingly high levels of default, ranging from 68%-87% in every year from 2000 to 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82). The Complaint notes that the high likelihood of default would have been material to borrowers' decision to take out a subprime student loan from Navient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73). Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Navient failed to disclose additional facts that may have been material to subprime borrowers, including \"credit enhancement\" and \"recourse\" arrangements that minimized Navient's risks from engaging in subprime lending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-92). The subprime borrowers which Navient targeted had low credit scores and often attended schools with low graduation rates and gainful employment rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 174c.-d). These allegations are not wholly dissimilar\n   from the claims in\n   <em>\n    Milbourne,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , which all involved lenders taking undue advantage of borrowers.

APPLICABILITY OF LACHES TO LOAN ORIGINATION CLAIM (COUNT I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Navient's final argument for dismissal of Count I is that laches should bar the Commonwealth's claim because the Commonwealth itself \"deemed\" the schools that borrowers attended \"fit for enrollment.\" (Doc. 24 at 26). Thus, the Commonwealth should be estopped from claiming that it was \"unfair\" to lend to borrowers to attend the schools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Commonwealth responds that laches is generally an inappropriate basis for dismissal of an action, and also that asserting laches against the Commonwealth generally cannot be sustained when the Commonwealth is acting under its police power, as it is doing here in enforcing the CPL.

However, regardless of what equitable defense is being raised by Navient, the factual record is simply not developed enough at this stage to rule that the Commonwealth should be equitably barred from exercising its authority to police unfair or deceptive commercial conduct. Viewing only the well-pleaded allegations in the Complaint, there is no mention of Commonwealth licensing and approval of schools. Thus, the Court has no factual basis upon which to find laches applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Even if there were allegations in the Complaint that could assist the Court in analyzing the application of laches, the Court is not convinced by Navient's argument because it is based on an excessively broad reading of the case law. In its Reply, Navient quotes a footnote of dicta from\n   <em>\n    Clearview\n   </em>\n   to suggest that laches can be asserted against the Commonwealth when exercising its police power \"in the limited situation where agents of the Commonwealth have actively aided in and expressly approved of the continued operation of a business later alleged to constitute a public nuisance.\" (Doc. 26 at 20-21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Clearview\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%20202\">\n    327 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   205 n.7 ) ).\n   <em>\n    Clearview\n   </em>\n   itself did not involve such a situation.

Despite Navient's rhetorical flourishes urging to the contrary in its Reply,\n   <em>\n    Folcroft Landfill\n   </em>\n   is not analogous to the situation here because, according to the parties, the Commonwealth only accredited educational institutions and not lenders, such as Navient's predecessor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25 at 25-26, Doc. 26 at 20-21).

FAILURE TO ALLEGE ACTIONABLE CONDUCT IN FORBEARANCE STEERING AND RECERTIFICATION CLAIMS (COUNTS II-V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Navient raises similar arguments against the Commonwealth's forbearance steering (Counts II &amp; III) and recertification claims (Counts IV &amp; V) under the CPL and CFPA. With respect to the forbearance steering claims, Navient asserts that the Complaint does not allege that Navient \"failed to disclose all material facts regarding the availability of IDR plans, or that Navient failed to comply with any of the extensive federal disclosure requirements regarding IDR plans,\" just that \"borrowers were not provided this information\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     enough times\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     through a\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     preferred medium\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (i.e., by phone).\" (Doc. 24 at 27 (emphasis in Navient's Brief in Support) ). And, Navient claims, the material facts at issue were disclosed in writing, and so the Commonwealth cannot sustain a CPL claim for \"deceptive\" conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, Navient argues that the Commonwealth's claims regarding recertification are legally deficient because federal law authorized Navient to provide disclosures thorough secure email or electronic links, and that the Commonwealth does not explain how borrowers who consented to those types of notifications were deceived by them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). As a result, Navient asserts, the Commonwealth has failed to state an actionable claim for unfair or deceptive conduct under either the CFPA or CPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that Navient mischaracterizes its forbearance steering and recertification claims, noting that they are not only about failing to disclose pertinent, material information to borrowers, but that they allege steering borrowers into forbearance and misrepresenting the suitability of repayment options. (Doc. 25 at 26). The Commonwealth additionally argues that nothing in the CPL permits \"bait-and-switch marketing\" involving fine-print disclaimers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). And the Commonwealth contends that even though federal regulations may permit email notifications, \"Navient is still obliged to ensure such notifications are not deceptive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Navient replies that the Commonwealth's forbearance steering claims are premised on a failure to provide \"IDR-related information by phone, every time a borrower called,\" and is thus not \"a 'bait-and switch' marketing situation, but rather a claim that a federal loan servicer giving proper written disclosures is nonetheless engaged in 'deceptive' conduct under the CPL.\" (Doc. 26 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   With respect to both the forbearance steering and recertification claims, the Court agrees with the Commonwealth that Navient has both misconstrued the allegations in the Complaint and the relevant applicable law. Navient's focus on purported compliance with federal disclosure requirements regarding IDR plans misses the thrust of the Commonwealth's claims, which are not predicated on establishing that Navient violated ED disclosure regulations, but instead, whether Navient's conduct constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or, additionally in the case of the CFPA forbearance steering claim, an abusive act or practice. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 176-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   At the pleading stage, the forbearance steering and recertification claims state viable claims for relief under the CPL and CFPA. First, the Commonwealth alleges that Navient's purported steering borrowers into forbearance is \"unfair\" under the CPL (Count II) and \"unfair\" and \"abusive\" under the CFPA (Count III). As noted previously, under the CPL, unfair or deceptive acts or practices are those which have the \"capacity or tendency to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Golden Gate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501250,12501251\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/1010/\">\n    194 A.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth ex rel.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 108-110, 116, 118, 125-30). The Commonwealth further alleges that this conduct substantially harmed borrowers and that Navient took advantage of the reasonable reliance that borrowers placed on Navient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181-82). Based on these allegations alone, the Court finds that the Commonwealth has stated a claim under the CPL and CFPA for unfair and abusive conduct. It is simply not necessary for the Commonwealth to have alleged that Navient violated ED disclosure regulations, as Navient argues in its Brief in Opposition. Finding otherwise would improperly predicate liability under the CPL or CFPA on an underlying violation of ED disclosure regulations. Additionally, to the extent that Navient's purported compliance with ED disclosure regulations has bearing on the Commonwealth's forbearance steering claims, that evidence is not before the Court, and cannot be considered at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem.

The recertification claims are essentially that Navient made a host of misrepresentations to consumers regarding IDR recertifications, including the date certain to recertify income and the negative consequences for failing to timely recertify income. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 131-48, 183-89). The Commonwealth alleges that Navient's conduct led more than 60% of borrowers to miss their recertification deadlines between at least July 2011 and March 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145). Borrowers were deceived and unfairly harmed by Navient's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 183-89). Contrary to Navient's argument that the Commonwealth does not explain how consumers were deceived by purportedly ED compliant electronic notices, the Commonwealth's allegations posit that the bare-bones notices effectively misrepresented information about IDR recertification deadlines and consequences for failing to meet those deadlines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 140-46). The Complaint alleges that once Defendants made \"several enhancements to their email that provides access to the electronic renewal notice,\" the recertification renewal rate \"more than doubled,\" suggesting that the previous notices failed to provide enough information to borrowers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146). The Complaint also alleges that the postal mail notices Navient sent to borrowers failed to inform borrowers of material information about their IDR plans and thus were misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 133-39). Thus, these allegations in Counts IV and V are enough to state a claim for unfair or deceptive conduct under the CPL and CFPA. Navient's urging to the contrary based on purported compliance with ED disclosure regulations is not persuasive to the Court for the same reasons addressed above with respect to the\n   forbearance steering claims. Only the Commonwealth's allegations and not the actual disclosures are before the Court at this stage, and Navient again fails to convincingly explain how compliance with the disclosure regulations would preclude liability under the CPL and CFPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

However, the Court notes that the statements that Navient appears to argue are problematic do not resemble the type of \"hyperbolic or excessively vague\" statements that courts typically find to constitute puffery. The Complaint alleges that Navient's website \"states that forbearance is appropriate for borrowers 'who have a problem making on-time payments due to a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     temporary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   financial difficulty' \" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 104 (emphasis in Complaint) ), creating the fair implication that forbearance is not appropriate for those who face a long-term or permanent financial difficulty. (\n   <em>\n    See also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06 (detailing negative consequences of extended forbearance) ). The Complaint further alleges that Navient made statements on their website that Navient would \"help [borrowers] by identifying options and solutions, so [borrowers] can make the right decision for their situation\" and that Navient could \"help [borrowers] find an option that fits [their] budget, simplifies payment, and minimizes [borrowers'] total interest cost.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108). As the Court previously ruled in the\n   <em>\n    CFPB-Navient\n   </em>\n   matter, these are specific statements (Navient will help borrowers select the lowest cost, best repayment option for their student loans) that are measurable against a standard (forbearance is only appropriate for those facing temporary financial hardship).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem.

Thus, the Complaint sufficiently alleges that Navient failed to deliver on these claims by unfairly and abusively steering borrowers into forbearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 125-30 (detailing conduct of Navient customer service representatives), 176-82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    6. MISTAKE OR ERROR DEFENSE TO PAYMENT PROCESSING CLAIMS (COUNTS VIII-IX)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Navient's final argument is that the Commonwealth's payment processing claims brought under the CPL in Counts VIII and IX are legally deficient because they are based on unintentional mistakes and errors that are not actionable as a matter of law. (Doc. 24 at 29-30). The Commonwealth responds that \"wrongful intent is not a required element of a claim under the CPL.\" (Doc. 25 at 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Court agrees. As an initial matter, Navient's argument mischaracterizes Count IX of the Complaint, which is a claim brought under the CFPA for unfair conduct, not a state law claim under the CPL. In the\n   <em>\n    CFPB-Navient\n   </em>\n   matter, in evaluating the CFPB's deception claims related to Navient's loan rehabilitation-related conduct, the Court cited numerous\n   other courts in ruling that CFPA claims should not be understood as common law fraud claims, and thus, do not require a showing of intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, the Court will deny Navient's Motion in its entirety.

However, Navient's first argument in its Brief in Support, its CFPA \"copycat\" argument, arguably applies to Count VII, as it is a claim under the CFPA that was also in the\n    <em>\n     CFPB-Navient\n    </em>\n    matter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at 56-57,\n    <em>\n     CFPB v.

In its Opposition, the Commonwealth refers to a 2013 case from the District of New Mexico where the court \"permitted that state's AG to pursue CFPA claims based on the same underlying conduct of a previously-filed CFPB consent order.\" (Doc. 25 at 6 n.4); Amended Complaint \u00b6 6,\n    <em>\n     New Mexico ex rel.

However, as Navient states in its Reply, that case did not involve a concurrent state/CFPB action, nor did the defendant appear to raise the \"copycat\" argument that Navient has raised here, and so the\n    <em>\n     King\n    </em>\n    court did not consider the argument in making its decision to deny dismissal of New Mexico's federal law claim.

Navient provides no legal support for this argument. And as detailed,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , Navient fails to explain how the issue of a state's possible intervention in an ongoing CFPB lawsuit has anything to do with the clear grant of authority in the CFPA for a state to bring its own action under the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Navient's reference to\n    <em>\n     Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v.
