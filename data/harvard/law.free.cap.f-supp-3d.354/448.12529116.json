At base, the suit concerns First and Fifth Amendment facial challenges to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the \"ITAR\"), 22 C.F.R. parts 120-130, which is the regulatory regime that implements the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (the \"AECA\"), 22 U.S.C. ch. 39. Among other things, the ITAR imposes strict licensing requirements on exporting technical data related to \"defense articles,\" such as blueprints for tanks and nuclear weapons. Plaintiff, a law firm that advises clients and publishes free educational materials on export control matters, seeks to disseminate certain technical data via public presentations within the United States and on its public website. It argues that the ITAR in its current form imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint on Plaintiff's anticipated expressive activities and is as well unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a failed application for injunctive relief and an appeal of same, the matter returned to this Court in 2018, and the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. This Court does not accept either side's arguments\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , but after evaluating the unambiguous text of the ITAR, as opposed to the parties' glosses thereon, it cannot discern the constitutional infirmities identified by Plaintiff. Accordingly, and for the reasons stated in this Opinion, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The parties agree generally that information available from one of these public domain sources is excluded from the ITAR's licensing requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Br. 7, 9 n.4 (\"[I]nformation that is already in the public domain, through various means, is not treated as ITAR-controlled.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 3, 2015, the Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have amended the definition of public domain to state that \"technical data ... is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in the public domain if it has been made available to the public without authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    80 Fed.

The preamble to the proposed revision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Paragraph (b) of the revised definition explicitly sets forth the Department's requirement of authorization to release information into the \"public domain.\" Prior to making available \"technical data\" or software subject to the ITAR, the U.S. government must approve the release....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The requirements of paragraph (b) are not new.\n   </em>\n   Rather, they are a more explicit statement of the ITAR's requirement that one must seek and receive a license or other authorization from the Department or other cognizant U.S. government authority to release ITAR controlled \"technical data,\" as defined in \u00a7 120.10. A release of \"technical data\" may occur by disseminating \"technical data\" at a public conference or trade show, publishing \"technical data\" in a book or journal article, or posting \"technical data\" to the Internet. This proposed provision will enhance compliance with the ITAR by clarifying that \"technical data\" may not be made available to the public without authorization. Persons who intend to discuss \"technical\n   data\" at a conference or trade show, or to publish it, must ensure that they obtain the appropriate authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    at 31,528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). To date, however, this amendment has not been promulgated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Several other developments concerning the ITAR merit mention. On May 24, 2013, the Department posted a notice in the Federal Register responding to comments seeking clarification of the current definition of \"defense service,\" which notice stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Five commenting parties recommended ITAR \u00a7 120.9(a)(4) be revised to clarify that an aggregation of public domain data is still public domain data, and two commenting parties requested clarification that the aggregation of public domain data cannot be considered a defense service or render the data \"other than public domain.\" The Department confirms that a defense service involves technical data and therefore the use of publicly available information would not constitute a defense service according to the new ITAR \u00a7 120.9(b)(2). The Department notes, however, that it is seldom the case that a party can aggregate public domain data for purposes of application to a defense article without using proprietary information or creating a data set that itself is not in the public domain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C444\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. 31,444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,445. On June 3, 2015, the Department further clarified that a \"release of 'technical data' may occur by ... posting 'technical data' to the Internet.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 31,525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,528. And on June 3, 2016, the Department updated the ITAR's definition of \"export\" to include \"releasing or otherwise transferring technical data to a foreign person in the United States (a 'deemed export').\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Information Plaintiff Seeks to Use and Disseminate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff \"is a law firm that advises clients on export control matters ... [and] publishes free educational information to the public on export control matters.\" (FAC \u00b6 5). Plaintiff has announced plans to develop \"presentation and written materials\" using \"published and generally accessible public information that is available from bookstores and libraries, and for which foreign persons already have access to. This information would have otherwise constituted technical data but is excluded from the technical data provisions because it is in the public domain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 49). However, Plaintiff underscores, \"these materials were not authorized by the Defendants into the public domain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52). Further, Plaintiff contemplates that it \"would also aggregate and modify public domain information to provide more interactive examples[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff plans to use its presentations and written materials in public speaking, including at public conferences in Manhattan, New York, and in \"free educational materials on the ITAR's technical data provisions[.]\" (FAC \u00b6 46). \"Plaintiff reasonably believes that foreign persons will have access to the presentations and the published materials because they will be freely distributed at the public conferences and also made publicly available on the Plaintiff's website and through other channels of communication.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff further intends its speech to educate \"the public on how to comply with the ITAR's technical data controls and to inform the public with how the government implements such regulations.\" (FAC \u00b6 48). Plaintiff's speech \"would also contain some comments critical of the government and ... propose future regulatory revisions in this area.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). It is Plaintiff's concern that, given various interpretive\n   statements from the Department, Plaintiff's contemplated conduct may run afoul of the Department's construction of the ITAR without actually running afoul of the regulations' text and, alternatively, that the ITAR as construed by the Department is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on October 28, 2015, challenging the constitutionality of the ITAR under the First and Fifth Amendments. (Dkt. # 1). On November 2, 2015, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. # 15). While the motion was pending, on December 3, 2015, Plaintiff filed the FAC, alleging that the ITAR's \"licensing requirement ... is facially invalid as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, is overly broad, vague, lacks any procedural safeguards, provides boundless discretion to government officials, and fails to provide any judicial review,\" in violation of the First Amendment. (FAC \u00b6 58). Plaintiff also alleged that the ITAR's licensing provision \"violates the Fifth Amendment because it is vague to the public and fails to provide fair notice, constitutes a delegation of authority to government officials in its enforcement, violates clearly established legal standards that an agency must announce and explain a departure from long-standing practice, and applies retroactively as an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On January 26, 2016, the Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin, to whom the case was then assigned, found that Plaintiff had standing to seek injunctive relief on a claim of prior restraint, but denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. # 35).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stagg P.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326807\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/203/#p209\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Stagg I\n   </em>\n   \"). Plaintiff appealed from the denial; in April 2016, during the pendency of the appeal, the case was reassigned to the undersigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On December 16, 2016, the Second Circuit affirmed both Judge Scheindlin's finding of standing and her denial of the application for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stagg P.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390127\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/673/93/#p94\">\n    673 F.

Following the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stagg II\n   </em>\n   , the Department posted the following notice to the Frequently Asked Questions (\"FAQ\") section of its website:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: I found some information in a book at a library and I think it might be technical data.

The Department is providing this guidance to clarify the preamble of the June 3, 2015 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ....

Indeed, the Second Circuit noted that \"the [G]overnment unambiguously confirmed at oral argument that Stagg correctly characterizes the government's interpretation of the existing regulatory scheme [as requiring a license to use technical data that entered the public domain without prior approval from Defendants] ....

Plaintiff has standing to challenge the ITAR because, under the Government's own stated interpretation of the regulatory scheme, Plaintiff may be subject to prosecution for republishing technical data that was obtained from otherwise\n   public domain sources, but that was not authorized by Defendants to be placed into the public domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Claims Are Not Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At earlier stages of this action, both Judge Scheindlin and the Second Circuit noted the possibility that the Department might moot Plaintiff's claims. Judge Scheindlin commented that the Department might \"reword or even withdraw\" the proposed, 2015 amendment to the ITAR, \"and obviate the need for this lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Stagg I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326807\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/203/#p209\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   209 n.37. Similarly, during oral argument before the Second Circuit, Judge Reena Raggi remarked that the Government could \"represent that there will be no prosecution for the dissemination of material that's already in the public domain, and then you move on with the case.\" (Tr. 27:01-27:31). The Second Circuit's summary order went on to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [M]any of Stagg's arguments ... could be read as attacking not the existing regulatory scheme, but either a proposed regulation that was never adopted, or a prior regulation that Stagg claims was once in force but has since been repealed.

App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In short, were the Department to (i) disavow Plaintiff's characterization of its construction of the ITAR, and (ii) clarify that the allegations in the FAC address a proposed or prior interpretation of the regulation that does not currently control, this action would not continue. In the instant cross-motions, Defendants gesture in the direction of mootness by asserting that the FAQ notice posted to the Department's website following the Second Circuit's ruling clarified that \"the information Stagg asserts it intends to publish - information available in\n   <em>\n    printed\n   </em>\n   books, newspapers, journals, and magazines that Stagg can buy in a\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   bookstore or check out from a public library - does not require approval from the Department for export or republication.\" (Def. Br. 14 (emphases added) ). Unfortunately, the gesture falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As stated above, the FAC does not limit the materials that Plaintiff seeks to republish merely to information obtained from \"printed\" sources or \"physical\" bookstores and libraries. (FAC \u00b6 49). Therefore, the Department's FAQ notice does little to assure Plaintiff that the Government will not prosecute it for disseminating the materials in its possession. Moreover, Plaintiff also seeks to \"aggregate and modify\" the information that it plans to disseminate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54), which Judge Scheindlin properly determined to be an independent basis for standing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stagg I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326807\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/203/#p209\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FAQ notice makes neither mention nor disclaimer of liability for aggregating public domain materials. Accordingly, the FAQ notice has not mooted Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Court Interprets the Text of the ITAR Differently Than the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   With those antecedent issues resolved, the Court now considers Plaintiff's facial challenge to the constitutionality of the ITAR's licensing provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 7 (\"This case presents a facial challenge and only pure questions of law ... only the text of the regulations is required.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 18; Pl.

Significantly, however, Plaintiff's claims - and Defendants' responses - rely heavily on certain disputed interpretations of the ITAR's current text. In consequence, the Court will address the parties' disputes about how to construe the ITAR as a threshold matter before turning to Plaintiff's constitutional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A word is in order about this portion of the Court's analysis. As made clear by the Second Circuit, Plaintiff has standing to challenge only the current ITAR, and not the June 3, 2015 proposed revision to the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stagg II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390127\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/673/93/#p94\">\n    673 F. App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 n.1. The Court will thus consider Plaintiff's facial challenge solely as it pertains to the current text of the ITAR's \"public domain\" exclusion, and \"deemed export\" provision. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.11\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 120.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 120.17(a)(2). Put somewhat differently, the Court will not consider any aspect of Plaintiff's briefing that purports to mount a facial challenge to text that has not been formally adopted into the ITAR. Relatedly, to the extent that the Court considers the Department's interpretation of the ITAR, it will look to the Department's statements on its website and in the Federal Register as indications of that interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

To the contrary, the ITAR unambiguously defines \"public domain\" as \"information which is published and which is generally accessible or available to the public\" through certain enumerated sources.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.11\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Nowhere does the ITAR mention, or conceivably imply, that prior government authorization is required for public domain status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This is not to say that Plaintiff's concerns are unfounded. The Court recognizes that the Department has, at times, appeared to advance a different interpretation of the public domain exclusion. On June 3, 2015, for example, the Department proposed a revised definition of public domain stating that \"technical data ... is not in the public domain if it has been made available to the public without authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 31,525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,535. While Plaintiff has no standing to mount a facial challenge to this proposed-but-not-enacted revision, the preamble suggests that the proposed revision actually reflects the Department's current interpretation of the ITAR's current text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    at 31,528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The requirements of paragraph (b) are\n   <em>\n    not new.\n   </em>\n   Rather, they are a more explicit statement of the ITAR's requirement.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   What is more, the Department's assertion that the public domain exclusion requires prior authorization is conspicuously absent from Defendants' opening and reply briefs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, during oral argument before the Second Circuit, the Department refused to represent that it would not prosecute Plaintiff for republishing information that is already in the public domain, \"but is publicly available without the appropriate authorization.... If it is out there without the appropriate authorization, we cannot make such a representation[.]\" (Tr. 27:31-28:25). The Department explained that information \"may be in some limited place, but through republication, the danger of it being provided to foreign persons is amplified. [For example,] something that's in an obscure journal, put on the Internet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:50-30:20). Indeed, the Department adopted the position that, if information were to enter the public domain without authorization, then \"the State Department should in fact be able to analyze those materials and offer its own response\" as to whether the materials are \"in fact something that would even be subject to the ITAR's licensing requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:26-31:15). And because Defendants have advanced these interpretations of the ITAR earlier in this case, the Court will consider them here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To the extent that the Department interprets the ITAR to disqualify from the public domain exclusion any information that was made available to the public without prior authorization, the Court disagrees. To review, \"[d]eference to an agency's interpretation is owed only when the regulation at issue is ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821385\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/104/#p105\">\n    653 F.3d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is nothing ambiguous in the text of the ITAR's public domain exclusion that could be read to imply prior government authorization as a prerequisite. Nothing in the current ITAR's definition of public domain can reasonably be interpreted to suggest that data that would otherwise qualify as public domain does not solely because it became publicly available without government authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The ITAR Does Not Disqualify Information from the Public Domain Exclusion Solely Because the Information Has Been Aggregated or Modified\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Separately, Plaintiff argues that the ITAR requires an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   license to aggregate and modify public domain data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply 6 (\"[T]he ITAR\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   imposes a prior restraint on putting aggregated technical data into the public domain by publishing it ... because aggregating technical data, as the Plaintiff intends to do, creates a new set of technical data.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 54 (alleging Plaintiff's intent to \"aggregate and modify\" public domain information) ). Again, while understanding the source of Plaintiff's malaise, the Court disagrees with its argument based on the plain language of the ITAR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nowhere does the ITAR mention, or conceivably imply, either non-aggregation or non-modification as requirements for public domain status. To be sure, the Department's May 24, 2013 statement in the Federal Register suggests a different interpretation; there, the Department observed that \"it is seldom the case that a party can aggregate public domain data for purposes of application to a defense article without ... creating a data set that itself is not in the public domain.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C444\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. 31,444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,445. Similarly, Defendants' opening brief asserts that aggregating public domain data \"would not create ITAR-controlled technical data ... [unless the] aggregation is 'for purposes of application to a defense article,' [and the aggregator] possesses the expertise necessary to make such an application.\" (Def. Br. 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 3 (asserting \"the Department's position [that there are] limited circumstances in which aggregation can create new technical data\") ). However, to the extent that the Department interprets the currently existing ITAR so that the bare fact of aggregation or modification, without more, could suffice to remove otherwise-qualifying data from the public domain exclusion, the Court rejects that interpretation. There is nothing ambiguous in the text of the exclusion that could be read to imply non-aggregation and/or non-modification as prerequisites for public domain status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    c. ITAR-Controlled Technical Data Does Not Qualify for the Public Domain Exclusion Solely Because the Data May Be Widely Available on the Internet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The ITAR defines the public domain exclusion to include information that is \"generally accessible or available to the public ...

Reply 5 (challenging the notion \"that the public domain exclusion does not include the Internet\") ). Plaintiff reasons that \"the Supreme Court has long equated the Internet to a public library,\" and therefore this Court should construe the ITAR's public domain exclusion to include the Internet.

To start, Defendants assert that Plaintiff's current position - that the public domain exclusion covers information widely available on the Internet - contradicts Plaintiff's prior position before the Second Circuit at the preliminary injunction stage of this case. (Def. Br. 29-30; Def. Reply 4 n.6). The Court disagrees. It is true that Plaintiff's opening brief to the Second Circuit discussed the public domain exclusion in relation to the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 16-315-cv, Appellant's Brief 53-54). However, that discussion conflated the issue of what information falls within the public domain exclusion - and may thus be\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   unrestricted by the ITAR - with the issue of what distribution channels the ITAR permits to\n   <em>\n    release\n   </em>\n   ITAR-controlled information, without running afoul of the export restrictions. A quick read of the brief evidences this conflation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [T]he preliminary injunction Stagg seeks would only prohibit enforcement of the ... prior restraint to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   the public domain exclusion, including on materials that have already been placed there. ...

Reply 9). In other words, Defendants urge a narrow interpretation of the regulation, where nothing that that is available exclusively from the Internet could qualify as a library open to the public.

However,\n   even without such deference, the Court agrees with Defendants' view that technical data must be available from one of the enumerated sources listed in the public domain exclusion in order to qualify for that exclusion. The text of the ITAR unambiguously restricts the public domain exclusion to information that is \"generally accessible or available to the public\" \"through\" or \"at\" one of eight sources.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.11\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

An interpretation of the term library that excludes all institutions and collections that exist solely on the Internet, just because they do not also exist off the Internet, is plainly erroneous and does not reflect a fair and considered judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   One definition of a \"library\" presented by the American Library Association states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A library is a collection of resources in a variety of formats that is (1) organized by information professionals or other experts who (2) provide convenient physical, digital, bibliographic, or intellectual access and (3) offer targeted services and programs (4) with the mission of educating, informing, or entertaining a variety of audiences (5) and the goal of stimulating individual learning and advancing society as a whole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Definition of a Library, AMERICAN LIBRARY ASS'N http://libguides.ala.org/library-definition (quoting The Librarian's Book of Lists (Chicago: ALA, 2010) ) (last visited Jan. 28, 2019). Another such definition states: \"A collection or group of collections of books and/or other print or nonprint materials organized and maintained for use (reading, consultation, study, research, etc.). Institutional libraries, organized to facilitate access by a specific clientele, are staffed by librarians and other personnel trained to provide services to meet user needs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821385\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/104/#p105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the Institute for Museum and Library Services defines a \"public library\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A public library is established under state enabling laws or regulations to serve a community, district, or region, and provides at least the following: (1) an organized collection of printed or other\n   library materials, or a combination thereof; (2) paid staff; (3) an established schedule in which services of the staff are available to the public; (4) the facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and schedule, and (5) is supported in whole or in part with public funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821385\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/104/#p105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   None of these definitions limits libraries to brick-and-mortar buildings, or to collections of print materials. Entities such as the Digital Public Library of America - which exists on the Internet, houses a collection comprising exclusively materials that \"are immediately available in digital format,\" and counts among its Board of Directors the Commissioner and CEO of the Chicago Public Library, the Director of MIT Libraries, and a former Dean of Harvard Law School, among others - can readily satisfy the definition of a library.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   About Us, DPLA, https://dp.la/about (last visited Jan. 28, 2019). The Court therefore declines Defendants' invitation to read the entirety of the Internet out of the definition of a library. Data sourced from the Internet is not categorically barred from coverage under the ITAR's public domain exclusion solely because it is not also available from an enumerated source that is not the Internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   But while the Court finds Plaintiff's analogy between a library and the Internet compelling, it declines to construe the term \"library\" in the ITAR to include the\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   of the Internet. As Defendants point out,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [T]he Internet differs fundamentally from a public library - virtually anyone with internet access can post information to the internet or republish information made available by someone else and there are no publication standards or systems of peer or editorial review to help ensure that sensitive national security information is not released.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Def. Br. 31 n.17). Moreover, there are persuasive policy arguments not to include the entire Internet as an enumerated source constituting the public domain under the ITAR. As Judge Scheindlin previously recognized, if the Court were to read the ITAR as Plaintiff proposes, \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   unclassified technical data leaked to the Internet would be fair game to republish in any forum without regard to consequences - and in an era where national security information has been successfully leaked, this is not a specious threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Stagg I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326807\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/203/#p209\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Uploading ITAR-Controlled Technical Data to the Public Internet Qualifies as a \"Deemed Export\" Under the ITAR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court's final act of interpretation addresses Defendants' assertion that uploading ITAR-controlled technical data to the public Internet would qualify as an \"export\" for purposes of the ITAR's licensing requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 31 n.18 (\"[T]he government took the position in\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed\n   </em>\n   that dissemination of technical data in a manner that allows access by foreign persons - in that case through the internet - is an 'export' requiring appropriate authorization[.]\") ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021299\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/680/\">\n    121 F.Supp.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Tex. 2015). Plaintiff rejects this construction, and instead urges the Court to \"limit the ITAR's construction to exclude publication as an export.\" (Pl. Br. 18). The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that \"[t]he ITAR treats domestic publication as an export because the very nature of publishing means that foreign persons may access those materials domestically and then could take them abroad to manufacture defense articles.\" (Pl. Br. 18). Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the ITAR improperly regulates domestic publications, rather than solely exports, because the ITAR's licensing requirement applies to any speech that is not \"to a purely domestic audience,\" and such an audience \"must involve\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   U.S. persons - which is an impossibility when publishing information to public forums.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Importantly, however, Plaintiff never clearly specifies what language in the ITAR permits the Court to exclude publication as an export. Plaintiff's discussion of these issues in the context of its First Amendment arguments cites the AECA's registration and license requirements for exporters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and the ITAR's registration requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.1\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Pl. Br. 3-4). Neither of these categories of provisions mentions publication. However, in Plaintiff's discussion of the Fifth Amendment, it quotes the ITAR's current definition of \"export,\" which includes \"releasing or otherwise transferring technical data to a foreign person in the United States (a 'deemed export').\" (Pl. Br. 23 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ) ). And Plaintiff also points to the Department's June 3, 2015 notice in the Federal Register stating that \"[a] release of 'technical data' may occur by ... posting 'technical data' to the Internet.\" (Pl. Br. 17 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C525\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 31,525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,528 ) ). The Court therefore assumes that Plaintiff's argument concerning publication as an export applies to the Department's view that a \"deemed export\" includes uploading data to the public Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff contends the Court should construe either the AECA or the ITAR to eliminate any licensing requirement for the foreign distribution of otherwise ITAR-controlled technical data via a particular technological medium such as the Internet, the Court declines. Nothing in either the AECA or the ITAR immunizes otherwise-regulated exports simply because they are undertaken through a particular technological medium. Plaintiff concedes as much in its reply, stating that \"even ignoring that Plaintiff intends Internet publication - the same regulation applies to the publication of technical data, regardless as to whether that publication is to the Internet or in a book or in any other medium.\" (Pl. Reply 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   On this score, the Court agrees with Defendants: The ITAR's restrictions on exports unambiguously apply to ITAR-controlled technical data regardless of the medium in which such data is exported. Uploading data to the public Internet - even a hypothetical domestic-only public Internet - qualifies as a \"deemed export\" under the ITAR because it \"releas[es] or otherwise transfer[s] technical data to a foreign person in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Of course, the ITAR does not apply to purely domestic disseminations limited to U.S. persons, thereby enabling private-sector research and industry development. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Br. 2 (\"The ITAR sets forth a regulatory framework that recognizes that private companies developing munitions can further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, while simultaneously safeguarding those interests by prohibiting the unfettered access to defense articles and services by foreign countries and persons.\") ). But the regulation does restrict the unlimited release of ITAR-controlled technical data to foreign persons, even within the domestic territory of the United States. The Court declines to construe the ITAR to exclude domestic publication as an export where such publication releases or transfers ITAR-controlled technical data to foreign persons inside the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The ITAR's Current Licensing Restrictions, Including Its Definitions of \"Public Domain\" and \"Export,\" Do Not Violate the First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   When Plaintiff's constitutional challenges are considered in terms of the unambiguous text of the ITAR - rather than Plaintiff's fears (or Defendants' wishes) regarding that text - the Court's constitutional analysis is straightforward. As Defendants point out, courts have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the ITAR's licensing requirements against First Amendment challenges. (Def. Br. 19-20). In the words of the Ninth Circuit,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [T]he AECA prohibits export without a license of items on the USML without regard to content or viewpoint ...

Moreover, as Defendants point out, \"the AECA and ITAR restrict only the\n   <em>\n    export\n   </em>\n   of technical data, not domestic dissemination.\" (Def. Br. 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021299\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/680/\">\n    121 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   695 ) ). The Court agrees that the AECA and the ITAR are content-neutral restrictions on speech that survive intermediate scrutiny under\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   and are not unconstitutionally overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   When the ITAR is properly construed, each of Plaintiff's First Amendment challenges to it fails.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that the ITAR's currently existing public domain exclusion imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint because it requires\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   licensing to republish technical data that entered the public domain without prior authorization from the Department, and to aggregate or modify existing public domain information. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Br. 3 (\"[T]he ITAR\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   imposes a prior restraint to use the public domain exclusion by ... the republication of such publicly available technical data.\"); Pl. Reply 6 (\"[T]he ITAR\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   imposes a prior restraint on putting aggregated technical data into the public domain by publishing it.... because aggregating technical data, as the Plaintiff intends to do, creates a new set of technical data.\") ). Plaintiff concedes, however, that information that falls within the public domain exclusion is not subject to the ITAR's licensing provisions, \"is no longer regulated\" (Pl. Br. 4), and \"may be freely published without the Government's approval\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As explained above, Plaintiff's argument proceeds from a misapprehension of the public domain exclusion; the exclusion does not restrict either the republication of information that entered the public domain without prior authorization by the Government, or the dissemination of public domain information solely because it has been aggregated or modified. As a result, Plaintiff has failed to identify any aspect of the public domain exclusion that operates as a prior restraint, and its arguments that the public domain exclusion fails the procedural requirements for constitutional prior restraints are irrelevant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 8-16; Pl. Reply 17-25). The Court thus agrees with Defendants that \"the\n   <em>\n    Freedman\n   </em>\n   factors are not the appropriate legal test\" to evaluate the constitutionality of the public domain exclusion under the First Amendment. (Def. Br. 23). Indeed, Plaintiff has not identified any aspect of the public domain exclusion that restricts expressive activity in any way. Under any standard of First Amendment scrutiny, therefore, Plaintiff's challenge to the ITAR's public domain exclusion fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that the ITAR \"imposes a prior restraint on publication on the Internet[.]\" (Pl. Br. 16). To start, since information that is generally available online does not necessarily qualify for the public domain exclusion, the ITAR can restrain the republication of that information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021299\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The ITAR's prior restraint on publication on the Internet also violates the First Amendment[.]\"); Pl. Reply 5 (opposing the position \"that the public domain exclusion does not include the Internet\") ). And since uploading information to the public Internet qualifies as a \"deemed export,\" the ITAR can restrain the dissemination of information via the Internet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply 6-7 (\"[T]he ITAR\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   imposes a prior restraint on holding a conference or seminar on the Internet that involves technical data[.]\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Of course, neither of these scenarios involves an Internet-specific prior restraint. The mere fact that ITAR-controlled technical data might be sourced from, or exported via, the Internet does not alter the\n   Court's constitutional analysis. As explained above, ITAR-controlled technical data that is sourced from non-library places on the Internet is subject to the same licensing requirements as any other technical data not in the public domain. Plaintiff has not made a case for Internet exceptionalism in analyzing the ITAR's speech-licensing provisions. Therefore, Plaintiff's argument is, effectively, that the ITAR's licensing restrictions on republishing any technical data not in the public domain - as the term is defined in the ITAR - are an unconstitutional prior restraint. They are not. Similarly, interpreting the current ITAR's definition of a \"deemed export\" to include uploads to the Internet does not restrict the publication of\n   <em>\n    otherwise unregulated\n   </em>\n   information to the Internet, such as information that falls within the public domain exclusion; it merely recognizes that publication on the public Internet is one means of \"releasing or otherwise transferring technical data to a foreign person in the United States[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \"The ITAR's licensing requirements apply to a broad range of technical data related to items on the USML, and the 'export' of that data involves transmission to foreign persons in a variety of contexts[.]\" (Def.

When determining a Fifth Amendment due process challenge for impermissible vagueness, courts consider \"whether a statute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for a plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Humanitarian Law Project\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n    561 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (internal citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). The Court must therefore determine whether Plaintiff \"\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   had fair notice that the statute and regulations proscribed [its] conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hsu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9271454\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/192/#p196\">\n    364 F.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (4th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"the ITAR's regulation of domestic publication violates the Fifth Amendment\" because it is unconstitutionally vague and\n   <em>\n    ex post facto.\n   </em>\n   (Pl. Br. 22). Plaintiff cabins its challenge, however, by stating that \"the issue here concerns only the\n   <em>\n    publication\n   </em>\n   of technical data, which qualifies as 'exempt' once published into various public forums.\" (Pl. Br. 23 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.10\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 120.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) &amp; 120.11 ) ). The FAC alleges that Plaintiff wishes to distribute, via its website, \"published and generally accessible public information that is available from bookstores and libraries, and for which foreign persons already have access to,\" that \"would have otherwise constituted technical data but is excluded from the technical data provisions because it is in the public domain.\" (FAC \u00b6 49). The information was \"not authorized by the Defendants into the public domain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As explained above, technical data that is otherwise ITAR-controlled does not qualify for the public domain exclusion\n   simply by virtue of being sourced from the Internet. Therefore, Plaintiff has fair notice that the ITAR proscribes the republication of ITAR-controlled technical data, even if that data is sourced from the Internet, and even if that data is republished via upload to the Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In 2015, the Western District of Texas considered a Fifth Amendment challenge to the ITAR's prior definition of export, which was then defined to include \"[d]isclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferring technical data to a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad.\"\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021299\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/680/\">\n    121 F.Supp.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 120.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed\n   </em>\n   , as here, wished to post ITAR-controlled technical data to the public Internet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the preliminary injunction stage, the court concluded that the ITAR's definition of an export did not violate the Fifth Amendment because \"[p]ersons of ordinary intelligence are clearly put on notice by the language of the regulations that such a posting would fall within the definition of export.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20120.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with this reasoning. Moreover, the 2016 ITAR revision defining \"export\" to include \"releasing or otherwise transferring technical data to a foreign person in the United States (a 'deemed export')\" did not substantially alter the regulation. Therefore, the Court concludes that the current ITAR's definition of \"export\" is not unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Court recognizes that certain portions of this Opinion may engender cognitive dissonance to readers of two prior opinions in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stagg I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326807\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/203/#p209\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiff also raises several arguments regarding its likelihood of success on the merits that the Government would be wise to note.\");\n   <em>\n    Stagg II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390127\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/673/93/#p94\">\n    673 F.

The parties have each submitted statements and counterstatements pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 (Dkt. # 65, 72, 73, 77); the Court notes, however, that the parties do not rely on these materials in advancing their respective arguments, and the Court therefore does not cite them in this Opinion. The parties do reference certain allegations in the operative pleading, Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, which the Court refers to as the \"FAC\" (Dkt. # 27).

The Department's May 24, 2013 response to comments in the Federal Register also concerns the Department's interpretation of the public domain exclusion: specifically, whether it covers aggregations and modifications of public domain data.
