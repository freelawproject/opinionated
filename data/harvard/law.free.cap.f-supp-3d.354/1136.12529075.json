(Dkt. No. 82 (hereinafter, \"Mot.\").) Plaintiff Lerna Mays (\"Plaintiff\") opposed the motion, and Walmart filed a reply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 83 (hereinafter, \"Opp'n\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 85 (hereinafter, \"Reply\").) For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff brought this suit against Walmart on behalf of a putative class of former and current Walmart employees for\n   alleged violations of the California Labor Code. Plaintiff moved to certify the class and alleged Walmart engaged in three \"class-wide policies and practices\" that violate California law, including: (1) failing to provide the legal name of the employer on its wage statements; (2) failing to list net wages earned on certain wage statements issued after the Statement of Final Wages; and, (3) failing to timely pay all accrued wages immediately upon separation of employment. (Dkt. No. 43 at 1-2.) Plaintiff sought to certify two classes of Walmart associates: (1) all California workers who received a wage statement between December 16, 2016 to date (the \"Wage Statement Class\") and (2) all California workers who received one or more wage payments during the period from December 18, 2014 to date, whose employment terminated on or after December 18, 2014, who received additional wages or vacation pay following the issuance of their Statement of Final Wages (the \"Former Employee Class\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 22, 2018, this Court denied the motion. (Dkt. No. 61 (hereinafter, \"Class Cert. Order\").) As to the Former Employee Subclass, the Court determined Plaintiff failed to establish numerosity, commonality, and predominance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13.) As to the Wage Statement Class, the Court found Plaintiff alleged no plausible concrete injury and therefore did not have standing to sue in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Accordingly, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's second cause of action for lack of standing with leave to amend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) The Court denied Plaintiff's subsequent motion for reconsideration of the order denying class certification. (Dkt. Nos. 63, 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint adding a representative claim under the Labor Code's Private Attorneys General Act (\"PAGA\") of 2004,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202698\">\n    Cal.

Violation of Section 226(a)(8)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Walmart violated Labor Code section 226(a)(8), which requires employers to provide accurate, itemized wage statements to employees that list \"the\n   <em>\n    name\n   </em>\n   and address\n   <em>\n    of the legal entity that is the employer\n   </em>\n   ,\" because the wage statements listed \"Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.,\"-Walmart's payroll company-instead of \"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\"-Plaintiff's employer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 15.) Walmart argues that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to support her claim because the wage statement identified\n   <em>\n    Walmart\n   </em>\n   as the employer and therefore complied with section 226(a)(8). Walmart contends the question at issue is \"whether a statutory violation exists simply because the term 'Associates' was used instead of 'Stores' after the name 'Walmart.' \" (Mot. at 18.) The answer, in Walmart's view, is no. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, Plaintiff attached a statement of earnings and deductions to her complaint, which has a \"Walmart\" logo at the top of the page and includes the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Wal-Mart Statement of Earnings and Deductions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   792 S.W. 8th Street 3522\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Bentonville, AR 72716\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (FAC, Ex. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff also attached to the complaint a document titled \"Notice to Employee\" to \"communicate employment-related information,\" which lists \"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\" as the name of her employer and 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, AR 72716 as the physical and mailing address. (FAC, Ex. 3 at WM0006.) The notice lists other names that the employer does business as: \"Wal-Mart Supercenter, Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart Vacations, Sam's Club, [and] Wal-Mart Distribution Center.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the notice states \"[t]he worksite employer does not use any other business entity to hire employees or administer wages or benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The notice contains no information about the payroll entity \"Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The search results from the California Secretary of State's website\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicate that at least three other \"Wal-Mart\" entities\n   share the same address as her employer \"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\" and the payroll company \"Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.\" (RJN \u00b6\u00b6 2-6; Mohan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-8, Exs. 2-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Walmart argues the Court should follow\n   <em>\n    Elliot v.

The letter states that, \"[p]ursuant to ... the California Labor Code [and] Private Attorneys General Act,\" Plaintiff alleges \"Walmart violated provisions of the California Labor Code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The letter asserts that \"[t]he California Labor Code requires employers to provide its employees, among other things, itemized wage statements\" and that \"Wal-Mart failed to provide Plaintiff and the Aggrieved Employees pay stubs that contain all of the information required by section 226 of the Labor Code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) The letter continues by listing all nine requirements enumerated in section 226(a).

And then, after listing these requirements, the letter states \"Plaintiff's wage statements show that Wal-Mart fails to designate on certain wage statements the information required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.

But Walmart argues \"Plaintiff did not provide any requisite 'facts and theories' pertaining to the allegations in the [First Amended Complaint] that her wage statements failed to show all accumulated vacation pay\n   earned, failed to accurately list the gross and net wages paid, and failed to identify the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Walmart assumes that the letter must disclose\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   theory on which a plaintiff seeks civil penalties and allege facts supporting each of those theories.

Here, Plaintiff's PAGA letter informs the LWDA that Walmart's wage statements were inadequate because Walmart failed to provide all information required by Labor Code section 226(a), \"\n   <em>\n    such as the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid.\n   </em>\n   \" (LWDA Notice at 2.) These allegations are sufficient to put Walmart and the LWDA on notice for potential investigation regarding deficiencies in Walmart's wage statements and therefore \"satisfies the policy goal of California Labor Code \u00a7 2699.3(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407253\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/705/644/#p645\">\n    705 F.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The notice sufficiently suggested claims on behalf of aggrieved employees. The letter complains that \"Wal-Mart also failed to pay Plaintiff proper reporting time for her last day of work, February 11, 2017.\" (LWDA Notice at 1.) The letter indicates, \"[w]hen Plaintiff arrived for work that day, she was told she was terminated\" and \"was not paid proper reporting time work for that day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) If this was all Plaintiff said in the letter it, might suggest, as Walmart contends, that Plaintiff\n   was complaining about an individual violation. But PAGA claims \"function[ ] as a substitute for an action brought by the government itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Arias v.

Thus, PAGA claims, by their very nature, are only brought on a representative basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The language in the opening paragraph of Plaintiff's notice-informing the LWDA and Walmart that \"Plaintiff seeks civil penalties on behalf of the State of California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, to be shared with all impacted employees\"-further undermines Walmart's argument.

Exhibit 1 is the respondent's brief from\n    <em>\n     Brown v. Ralphs Grocery Co.\n    </em>\n    , Case No. B278911. (RJN, (Dkt. No. 83-1 (\"RJN\"); Dkt. No. 84, Declaration of Priya Mohan (\"Mohan Decl.\") \u00b6 1, Ex. 1.) Exhibits 2 through 5 are various search results on the California Secretary of State's website. (RJN \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5; Mohan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-7, Exs. 2-5.) And Exhibit 6 is a copy of Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.'s Statement of Information that it filed with the Secretary of State on September 6, 2018. (RJN \u00b6 6; Mohan Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. 6.) Walmart has neither opposed the request or questioned the authenticity of these results. Although the Court may judicially notice that Exhibit 1 was filed in another proceeding, it may not notice the brief for the truth of any facts or arguments recited therein.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lee v.

The Court does not address this argument in the body of this Order because Plaintiff states she is not seeking penalties on her failure to permit inspection of employment records theory. (Opp'n at 2.) In its reply, Walmart insists it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff's PAGA claim for employment records in light of Plaintiff's concession. (Reply at 2.)
