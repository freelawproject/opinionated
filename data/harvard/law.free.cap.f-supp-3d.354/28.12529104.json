Hammond claims that because he was sentenced at a time when the Guidelines had the force of law, and because his sentence was enhanced through application of the residual clause, he is entitled to resentencing on his firearm conviction.

Hamond has made those showings. Second, Hammond must establish that without the residual clause, his prior convictions do not qualify as crimes of violence. Hammond fails at this second stage because the prior convictions that served as the basis for his enhanced sentence constitute crimes of violence under the Guidelines' so-called \"elements clause.\" Thus, Hammond's \u00a7 2255 motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Hammond's sentence for his firearm offense reflects his two prior convictions for a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 22, 35, 36; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2003). Hammond claims that he is entitled to resentencing because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   holds that, for defendants sentenced before\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , the Guidelines' residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Def.'s Supp. \u00a7 2255 Mot. at 9-13. While\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was decided after Hammond's convictions became final, Hammond explains that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   has been given retroactive effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17. Finally, Hammond maintains that without the residual clause, his Maryland armed robbery and his federal bank robbery convictions do not qualify as crimes of violence under the Guidelines' two other definitions of crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In response, the government puts forward multiple arguments for denial of this motion, including that Hammond's guilty plea waived the right to bring the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, Gov't's Opp'n at 10-11; Hammond's vagueness claim has been procedurally defaulted,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12; Hammond's motion is untimely,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-19;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's right has not been made retroactive to cases like Hammond's,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-25;\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   precludes attacking for vagueness the mandatory Guidelines,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-29; and, finally, even if Hammond prevails on these aforementioned arguments, Hammond's predicate convictions are crimes of violence under the Guidelines' elements clause,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Hammond's vagueness argument is neither untimely nor procedurally defaulted. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   has been made retroactive and enforcing that decision requires invalidating any sentence enhanced through application of the mandatory Guidelines' residual clause. Despite clearing those hurdles, Hammond is not entitled to resentencing on his federal firearm conviction because the prior convictions on which Hammond's enhanced sentence are based qualify as crimes of violence under the Guidelines' elements clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
