TIGAR, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Once again, the parties are before the Court regarding a rule issued recently by the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security. The rule, in combination with a Presidential proclamation, makes anyone who crosses the southern border of the United States somewhere other than a designated port of entry ineligible for asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs previously asked the Court to issue a temporary restraining order against the new rule. After considering the arguments on both sides and holding a hearing, the Court found the rule was inconsistent with the will of Congress as expressed in the United States' immigration statutes. Specifically, the rule conflicts with Congress's command that an alien \"physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States ...\n   <em>\n    whether or not at a designated port of arrival\n   </em>\n   \" may apply for asylum.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Court found the rule is probably invalid for the additional reason that the Government failed to allow Plaintiffs and other interested members of the public to provide comments about the rule before it went into effect. The Court also found that the plaintiff immigration organizations had the right to bring this lawsuit, and that\n   allowing the rule to remain in effect while this case was pending was not in the public interest because of the harms that would befall both the plaintiff organizations and immigrants who were legitimately seeking asylum. Accordingly, this Court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the regulation from going into effect. A few weeks later, the Ninth Circuit denied a stay and left that order in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction that would keep the new rule from going into effect for an extended period of time. As set forth below, the arguments on both sides are nearly identical to those made earlier to this Court and to the Ninth Circuit. Moreover, what new evidence and argument there is largely supports Plaintiffs' position. If anything, the inconsistency between the new regulation and the immigration laws has been stated more clearly. The harms to those seeking asylum are also even clearer, and correspondingly the public interest more plainly supports injunctive relief. Not surprisingly then, the result of the present motion is the same: the Court again concludes that Plaintiffs have established an overwhelming likelihood that the new rule barring asylum is invalid. Accordingly, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Nature of the Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has previously set forth the relevant legal framework and the challenged executive actions, ECF No. 43, and it need not repeat them in great detail here. In brief, on November 9, 2018, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") published a joint interim final rule, entitled \" Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection Claims\" (the \"Rule\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    83 Fed.

The Rule makes an alien categorically ineligible for asylum if the alien enters the United States in violation of \"a presidential proclamation or other presidential order suspending or limiting the entry of aliens along the southern border with Mexico.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    at 55,952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to be codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), 1208.13(c)(3) ). On the same day, the President of the United States issued such a proclamation (the \"Proclamation\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   suspending the entry of any alien into United States along the southern border for ninety days, except for \"any alien who enters the United States at a port of entry and properly presents for inspection.\" Proclamation \u00a7 2(b). Taken together, the Rule and the Proclamation \"create an operative rule of decision for asylum eligibility\" that denies asylum to all aliens who fail to enter at a designated port of entry.\n   <em>\n    E.

The Court's TRO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 19, 2018, the Court granted the Organizations' motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"). ECF No. 43. The Court concluded that the case was justiciable because the Organizations had Article III standing to bring this challenge and third-party standing to assert the rights of their clients, and that their asserted interests arguably fell within the zone of interests protected by the INA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 13-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Turning to the preliminary relief factors, the Court held that the Organizations were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Rule was inconsistent with the INA, because the Rule purported to deny asylum eligibility on a ground that Congress had clearly stated could not be disqualifying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 19-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Court concluded that the Organizations had at least raised serious questions going to the merits of their claims that the agencies lacked a basis to assert the foreign affairs or good cause exceptions to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 27-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the remaining equitable factors, the Court found that the Organizations' clients would suffer irreparable harm while the Rule was in place,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the Organizations themselves would be irreparably injured in light of the loss of opportunity to exercise their procedural rights and the Rule's substantive harm to their operations,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Court concluded that the equities and the public interest weighed in favor of preliminary relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Given the need for uniformity in immigration law,\" the Court determined that a nationwide injunction was appropriate, particularly given Defendants' failure to provide a more narrow but workable alternative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 34 &amp; n.21. The Court therefore issued a TRO, to remain in place until December 19, 2018, and ordered Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 27, 2018, Defendants appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion requesting that the Court stay the TRO pending appeal.

The Ninth Circuit's Denial of a Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The next day, Defendants filed a motion for a stay pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-17274 (9th Cir.), ECF No. 4. On December 7, 2018, a divided motions panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the stay in a published order.\n   <em>\n    E.

The court concluded that the Organizations lacked third-party standing because their clients did \"not have standing to assert a right to cross the border illegally, to seek asylum or otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n    at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit agreed, however, that the Organizations satisfied the Article III requirements for organizational standing because the Rule \"frustrated their mission of providing legal aid to affirmative asylum applicants\" and required the Organizations to divert resources from their other initiatives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n    at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also held that the Organizations suffered an independently sufficient cognizable harm because they had shown \"that the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n    at 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Ninth Circuit held that the Organizations had statutory\n   standing to pursue their APA claims because their interests arguably fell within the zone of interests protected by the INA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519246\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1219/#p1246\">\n    at 1244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turning to the merits of Defendants' stay request, the panel majority held that Defendants had not made the requisite showing, because the Rule was likely inconsistent with the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and the structure of the INA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1246-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority further observed that, even if the statute were ambiguous, the Rule's interpretation was likely unreasonable in light of a practical understanding of the circumstances under which refugees seek asylum, as reflected in international treaty obligations and precedent from numerous Circuits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1248-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the majority rejected Defendants' argument that the Proclamation provided a valid basis for the Rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The majority further found that Defendants were unlikely to succeed on the merits of the foreign affairs exception, noting that \"courts have disapproved the use of the foreign affairs exception where the Government has failed to offer evidence of consequences that would result from compliance with the APA's procedural requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Concerning Defendants' argument that \"the 'very announcement' of the Rule itself would give aliens a reason to 'surge' across the southern border,\" the majority concluded that Defendants' \"reasoning is only speculative at this juncture,\" and that \"[a]bsent additional evidence, this inference is too difficult to credit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the remaining stay factors, the majority found that Defendants had failed to show a likely irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    at 1254-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority addressed the final two factors only briefly. It noted that \"a stay of the district court's order would not preserve the status quo: it would upend it, as the TRO has temporarily restored the law to what it had been for many years prior to November 9, 2018,\" and that the Plaintiffs would suffer real harm if the rule were not enjoined.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The majority acknowledged that there were weighty public interests on both sides, but that \"when considered alongside the Government's failure to show irreparable harm, the final two factors do not weigh in favor of a stay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the majority rejected Defendants' argument that the nationwide scope of the Court's injunctive relief was inappropriate.

MOTION TO STRIKE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As an additional threshold matter, the Court considers Defendants' motion to strike. ECF No. 88. On November 29, 2018, Defendants submitted the administrative record. ECF No. 60. In response to the Organizations' motion for a preliminary injunction, Defendants filed a motion to strike various attached or incorporated materials, arguing that they were improper extra-record evidence in this administrative review case. ECF No. 88. Defendants agree that the Organizations may submit this evidence \"to demonstrate organizational standing or cognizable irreparable harm,\" but object to its consideration \"for any other purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The parties dispute whether the Court may consider evidence beyond the administrative record for (1) the merits of the Organizations' notice-and-comment challenges; (2) the preliminary injunction factors regarding the balance of the equities and the public interest; and (3) third-party standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court turns first to the question of the merits. The APA instructs that, in reviewing \u00a7 706 challenges, \"the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, to the extent practicable, a court should determine a plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits of such a challenge based on the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

ECF No. 88 at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yassini v.

The Organizations do not contend otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because, as discussed below, the Court concludes that Defendants have likely failed to justify the foreign affairs exception on the administrative record, it does not decide whether the Organizations' evidence is admissible for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lands Council v. Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171785\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/1019/#p1030\">\n    395 F.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (9th Cir. 2005). As to good cause, the Organizations have not met their \"burden of demonstrating that a relevant exception applies.\"\n   <em>\n    San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Locke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891552\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/971/#p993\">\n    776 F.3d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (9th Cir. 2014). The Organizations state, without additional explanation, that their evidence \"identif[ies] relevant factor the agency did not consider.\" ECF No. 93 at 9 &amp; n.7. This is not sufficient. Moreover, much of this evidence seems related to the merits of the Rule itself, rather than the relevant question whether good cause existed to dispense with notice and comment. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this evidence when reviewing good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, the Court considers the use of extra-record evidence for assessing the balance of the equities and the public interest. Defendants have cited no authority suggesting that \u00a7 706 limits the scope of the evidence that may be considered for those equitable factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' position\n   likewise lacks any support in the text of the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Notice-and-Comment Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the Organizations have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claim that the Rule is substantively invalid, the Court need not reach the notice-and-comment exceptions.

Foreign Affairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants' arguments in support of the foreign affairs exception are largely devoted to arguing that \"the Court was wrong to require an evidentiary showing that undesirable international consequences would result from following the rulemaking procedures\" and that the justifications set forth in the Rule's preamble are facially sufficient. ECF No. 87 at 22-24. Neither contention can be sustained in light of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Ninth Circuit concluded that \"the connection between negotiations with Mexico and the immediate implementation of the Rule [wa]s not apparent on th[e] record\" before it - including the text of the Rule and its preamble - and invited the Government to\n   demonstrate the purported connection with further evidence before this Court.\n   <em>\n    E.

First, Defendants cite remarks by President Trump on November 1, 2018, announcing in general terms the Rule's upcoming implementation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 87 at 24 (citing AR 484-91). These remarks do not mention negotiations with Mexico. Rather, the President largely focused on domestic consequences, such as the number of asylum applicants, the merits of their claims, and the length of time to adjudicate their cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 486 (\"The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts, but by that time, the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country.\"). To the extent the President discussed the Mexican government, his remarks do not indicate that foregoing notice and comment \"encourages Mexico to take account of th[e] aliens and to cooperate with the United States.\" ECF No. 87 at 24. Rather, the President indicated that Mexico had already attempted to do so, but repeatedly stated that its efforts had been ineffective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 485 (stating that \"[t]he government of Mexico has generously offered asylum, jobs, education, and medical care for people within the caravan, but many members of the caravan have refused those offers\"); AR 488 (\"Anybody throwing stones, rocks - like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico - we will consider that a firearm.\"); AR 489 (\"All we know is they're pretty tough people when they can blast through the Mexican military and Mexican police. They're pretty tough people. Even Mexico said, 'Wow, these are tough people.' I don't want them in our country. Women want security. Men don't want them in our country. But the women do not want them. Women want security. You look at what these women are looking for. They want to have security. They don't want to have these people in our country. And they're not going to be in our country.\"). Defendants have identified no indication in these remarks that additional efforts from the Mexican government were possible or likely forthcoming, let alone contingent to any degree upon \"\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   publication of the Rule, instead of\n   <em>\n    announcement\n   </em>\n   of a proposed rule followed by a thirty-day period of notice and comment.\"\n   <em>\n    E.

AR 92-96. This MOU was discussed in the Rule, which explained that \"since 2004, the United States and Mexico have been operating under a memorandum understanding concerning the repatriation of Mexican nationals,\" and that \"Article 6 ... reserves the movement of third-country nationals through Mexico and the United States for further bilateral negotiations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,950 n.15. Providing a copy of the MOU, with no additional information or explanation, does not come any closer to revealing the connection the Ninth Circuit found lacking on the face of the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because Defendants have failed to articulate the connection demanded by the Ninth Circuit, the Court concludes that the Organizations are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Good Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants similarly suggest that the Court may not look beyond the Rule's facial justifications to determine whether good cause exists. ECF No. 87 at 25. Again, this is flatly inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that \"the Government's contention that the 'very announcement' of the Rule itself would give aliens a reason to 'surge' across the southern border in numbers greater than is currently the case\" was, \"[a]bsent additional evidence, ... too difficult to credit.\"\n   <em>\n    E.

The article further indicates that the number of asylum seekers entering as families has risen in proportion to that of single adults and suggests a link to knowledge of those policies. AR 393. Reviewing this report with deference to the agencies' views, it at least supports the inference that smugglers might similarly communicate the Rule's potentially relevant change in U.S. immigration policy, albeit in non-technical terms. The Court concludes the Government has identified a \"rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\" to promulgate the interim rule on an emergency basis,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a logical consequence of applying the higher reasonable-fear standard to those aliens, the Rule recognizes that some \"aliens who would have previously received a positive credible-fear determination [will] now receive ... a negative credible-fear and reasonable-fear determination,\" not because they have no credible fear, but because they did not comply with the Rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    at 55,947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
