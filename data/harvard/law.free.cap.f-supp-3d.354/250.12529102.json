Indeed, when questioned at oral argument as to Defendant's position on a time period that would be reasonable but less than the four months set forth in \u00a7 4241(d), defense counsel was not able to articulate a specific period of time.

Defendant contends that he was in transport for 24 days prior to his competency and criminal responsibility examinations (from July 27, 2018, when Judge Roemer ordered the examination, to August 20, 2018, when he arrived at MCC Manhattan) and for another 43 days after the completion of the evaluations (from November 8, 2018, when the last examination of Defendant occurred, to December 21, 2018, when Defendant returned to this District). (Dkt. 6 at 16-17). Defendant further argues that the time limits set forth in \u00a7 4247(b) were violated in this case, and that the excess days expended on performing the competency\n   and criminal responsibility evaluations are also non-excludable.

Nor, as Defendant seems to suggest in his papers, is release from custody a viable sanction, inasmuch as the Court is statutorily mandated under \u00a7 4241(d) to commit Defendant to the Attorney General's custody. Defendant's reliance on the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     United States v. Fuller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452629\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/105/#p106\">\n     86 F.3d 105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , is misplaced. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 6 at 18). The Seventh Circuit's reference to habeas corpus in\n    <em>\n     Fuller\n    </em>\n    indicated it was a potential remedy for a defendant who remained in the custody of a mental institution in violation of the statutory limitations on initial competency examinations set forth in \u00a7 4247(b) ; it did not reference or discuss the mandatory hospitalization under \u00a7 4241(d).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452629\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/105/#p106\">\n     86 F.3d at 106-07\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that habeas corpus is \"the traditional remedy for illegal detention in a mental institution\");\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204247\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g) (confirming that illegality of detention pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4243, 4246, or 4248 (but not \u00a7 4241 ) may be established by writ of habeas corpus).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Court has considered Defendant's argument that the Bail Reform Act does not apply to him and has rejected it, for the reasons discussed in Part IV of this Decision and Order.

However, if Defendant wishes to have a detention hearing, he is free to request that such a hearing be held before Judge Roemer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188388\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/541/#p544\">\n     764 F.Supp.2d at 545\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that \"[d]etention proceedings were held in abeyance pending the outcome of competency proceedings,\" but finding \"no reason why a detention hearing cannot be held\" while competency issues are being addressed).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
