Tostrud, United States District Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prime Therapeutics LLC (\"Prime\") seeks a preliminary injunction forbidding a former employee, Ashley D. Beatty (\"Beatty\"), from performing some (but not all) activities in a new job she began recently with Maxor National Pharmacy Services, LLC (\"Maxor\"). Prime alleges that, if not limited by an injunction, Beatty will inevitably disclose Prime's confidential business information to Maxor. According to Prime, disclosure of this information would violate Minnesota and federal trade-secret statutes and breach a contract between Prime and Beatty. Prime also alleges that the disclosure of its confidential information would cause it to suffer irreparable harm. The Court will deny Prime's motion, primarily because the law and facts do not show at this preliminary stage that Prime is likely to prevail on the merits or to suffer irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prime and Maxor are pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Overman Decl. [ECF No. 8] \u00b6 1; Wheeler Decl. [ECF No. 31] \u00b6 16. A high-level description of the business of PBMs helps in understanding this lawsuit and Prime's preliminary-injunction motion. Fundamentally, PBMs administer prescription-drug plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beatty Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [ECF No. 33-1] \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Overman Decl. \u00b6 4; Wheeler \u00b6 14. To that end, PBMs facilitate relationships with various participants in the prescription-drug market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 14; Overman Decl. \u00b6 5; Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From a bird's-eye view, the prescription-drug market starts with drug manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Shrayber Decl. [ECF No. 33], Ex. 6 at 3. Drug manufacturers sell their products through wholesalers and pharmacies, and pharmacies deliver prescription drugs to consumers, usually based on the terms of consumers' health insurance.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. PBMs may be involved at each step in this process. For example, PBMs may negotiate with drug manufacturers for rebates and inclusion on a formulary (a list of drugs approved for coverage).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 9. PBMs may negotiate with pharmacies for discounts in exchange for including the pharmacies in a health plan's network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4. PBMs may work with health-benefit providers (including insurers, self-insured entities, and federal Medicare and Medicaid programs) to design benefit plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 8; Overman Decl. \u00b6 7. PBMs may also facilitate the dispensing of drugs to consumers by verifying coverage, calculating copays and coinsurance, and otherwise processing and paying prescription-drug claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 9; Overman Decl. \u00b6 4. Some PBMs own and operate pharmacies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 23. Others conduct pharmacoeconomic research and clinical trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Overman Decl. \u00b6 4; Shrayber Decl., Ex. 5 at 15-16. Still others provide consulting services related to the prescription-drug market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prime and Maxor dispute to some degree what specific PBM services each of them provides and the extent to which the two compete. Prime says there is meaningful overlap between its business activities and Maxor's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Overman Decl. [ECF No. 38] \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Prime advances this position in an effort to establish that Beatty is working for a competitor and is more likely to rely upon Prime's confidential information in her new position with Maxor. To show the opposite, Maxor says that it and Prime are not really competitors and that Beatty will have no use for Prime's confidential information in her new job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 55. More on this dispute later. For the time being, it seems fair to observe that Prime and Maxor are PBMs, that each engages in some of the activities described in the previous paragraph, that both engage in at least some similar activities, and that each engages in some activities the other does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beatty is a twenty-year PBM-industry veteran who began working for Prime in 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 3; Shrayber Decl., Ex. 3. Beatty's employment with Prime was contingent upon her signing a contract entitled \"Agreement Regarding Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information, Assignment of Inventions, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation\" (\"Agreement\") [ECF No. 1-1, Ex. B]. Friese Decl. [ECF No. 9] \u00b6 6 &amp; Ex. A. Beatty signed the Agreement on April 5, 2016. Agreement at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Principally at issue in this motion are the Agreement's non-disclosure and non-competition terms. The Agreement's non-disclosure term requires Beatty to \"hold all Confidential Information in the strictest confidence\n   <em>\n    both during and after\n   </em>\n   \" her employment with Prime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.B (emphasis added). Elsewhere, the Agreement defines \"Confidential Information\" as information \"whether oral, written, or in electronic form or committed to Employee's memory, which is not generally known by persons not employed by, or parties to contracts with, [Prime].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.A. The Agreement's non-compete-quoted here in its entirety in light of its significance to this motion-reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Non-Competition\n   </em>\n   . During Employee's employment and for a period of twelve (12) months following Employee's termination of employment with Company (\"Restricted Period\"), whether such termination is at the initiative of Employee or Company and regardless of the reason for termination, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, individually or collectively (including as an officer, director, employee, advisor, agent, consultant or otherwise), render the same or substantially the same services to an entity or operation engaged in the same or similar Business as Company anywhere in the United States. Subject to the foregoing, it is agreed that Employee is free to work for or provide services to a competitor of Company, provided that: (a) such work or services does not include, directly or indirectly, any responsibilities for, or have any connection with, a Competitive Product (defined below) during the Restricted Period or (b) Employee has not assumed a position with a competitor that would lead to the inevitable disclosure of Confidential Information. \"Competitive Product\" means any product or service that was marketed, sold or under development by Company during the twelve months preceding Employee's termination of employment and: (a) (i) is of the same general type and (ii) is used for the same or similar purposes as a Company product or service; or (b) competes for the same clients, providers or suppliers that Company markets or sells to or purchases from, or is developing to market or sell to or purchase from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.A. The Agreement also contains choice-of-law and choice-of-forum provisions, which state that Minnesota law shall govern \"[t]he validity, enforceability, construction and interpretation of this Agreement\" and that Beatty consents to jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beatty held two jobs during her employment with Prime. Beatty's first job was as Vice President of Networks in the Pharmacy and Network Services Department. Friese Decl. \u00b6 6; Beatty Decl. \u00b6 6. The parties do not describe Beatty's duties in this position. In June 2017, Prime promoted Beatty to the position of Chief Innovation and Network Services Officer. Prime characterizes Beatty's role in this position as \"a senior leader ... tasked with ... setting the strategic direction of [her] teams ... and collaborating with other senior leaders.\" Second Overman Decl. \u00b6 12. In a document called a \"job matrix,\" Prime describes the purpose of the Chief Innovation and Network Services Officer position to include several high-level responsibilities, including \"establish[ing] the vision and strategy for\" a series of departments and organizations within Prime, \"execut[ing] on all activities pertaining to the development and maintenance of network management and PBM innovation strategies,\" and \"ensur[ing] Prime has quality, competitive and accessible pharmacy providers under contract to deliver pharmaceutical services to clients and members at the lowest possible cost of care; as well as product analytics to support innovation\n   products, and services to support new business and current clients.\" Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 &amp; Ex. A;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beatty does not seem to dispute Prime's general description of the position, but she goes into greater detail describing her duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-22. In addition to identifying the Prime organizations for which she had responsibility, Beatty describes the activities she undertook with respect to each organization and the approximate amount of time she spent in each area.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to Prime's Pharmacy Network Management organization, Beatty testifies that her team \"manag[ed] the reimbursements\" to pharmacies and was \"responsible for managing the company's ongoing relationships with its large network of pharmacies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. According to Beatty, this occupied approximately sixty percent of her time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Beatty also oversaw Prime's Pharmacy Fraud, Waste, and Abuse area, which \"conduct[ed] pharmacy audits and investigat[ed] fraud ... within Prime's pharmacy network,\" and the Business Capabilities and Innovation area, which \"creat[ed] new service options for existing plans\" based on feedback from Prime's Blue Cross and Blue Shield (\"BCBS\") clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19. Beatty testifies that she spent roughly fifteen percent of her time in each of these two areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Finally, Beatty oversaw the Applied Analytics organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. This group \"measur[ed] and report[ed] to Prime's BCBS clients the returns and effectiveness of the various plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Beatty testifies that she spent something close to ten percent of her time overseeing this group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prime and Beatty say different things regarding Beatty's involvement in negotiations with pharmacies on behalf of Prime. Prime says that Beatty was \"the primary negotiator with pharmacies.\" Overman Decl. \u00b6 15. Beatty seems to concede that she had some involvement in pharmacy negotiations, testifying that she \"typically was not involved in negotiations\" (saying one is \"typically\" or \"usually\" not involved in an activity seems to confess at least occasional involvement), but Beatty also says that she \"was not required to develop or negotiate specific rates with pharmacies,\" and that she never managed relationships with or negotiated with pharmaceutical manufacturers or BCBS clients or members. Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prime also asserts that Beatty's job exposed her to both high-level strategic and relatively specific confidential information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 20-23. Here, Prime highlights Beatty's role on Prime's \"Pricing Committee,\" which met monthly, and the \"Best and Finalist\" leadership group, which reviewed bids just before they went to market. Second Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Prime claims that in these capacities, Beatty was involved in \"key discussions and decisions relating to Prime's pricing and services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Beatty acknowledges having had access to some of this information but testifies that she does not currently recall these \"figures or formulas\" and \"never knew [them] by memory.\" Beatty Decl. \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prime also points to Beatty's role on a strategic-planning committee. In the final weeks of Beatty's employment at Prime, but before she announced her resignation, she was appointed to a steering committee \"comprised of high-level Prime employees\" tasked with creating, developing, and implementing a five-year strategic plan. Overman Decl. \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Overman Decl. \u00b6 18. In this capacity, Beatty received three PowerPoint presentations, all labeled \"Confidential and Proprietary.\" Overman Decl. \u00b6 20. In support of its motion, Prime filed a redacted version of one of these presentations, entitled \"Rebate Aggregation Business Review,\" that identifies a Maxor subsidiary called Gateway\n   Health Partners (\"Gateway\") by name when discussing the \"competitive landscape.\" Second Overman Decl., Ex. 1 at 5. Prime says all three PowerPoints contained confidential information, ranging from \"ways Prime can be more competitive\" to \"a strategic plan to improve Prime's market share\" in underwriting and rebate aggregation. Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. Beatty admits to receiving the presentations, though she testifies that she received them by e-mail while on vacation, that she reviewed them only on her mobile phone, and that she \"had no input or involvement in preparing\" the PowerPoints and \"was not personally involved in any discussions relating to those documents.\" Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For something close to fourteen of the roughly fifteen months that Beatty worked in the Chief Innovation and Network Services Officer position, Beatty reported directly to Prime's Chief Financial Officer, Alec Mahmood (\"Mahmood\"). Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27; Mahmood Decl. [ECF No. 33-2] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7; Second Overman Decl. \u00b6 2. Mahmood announced his plans to leave Prime in spring 2018, and his supervision of Beatty ended in August 2018. Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-27; Mahmood Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. In light of Mahmood's departure, Beatty began reporting to Prime's Chief Operating Officer, David Overman (\"Overman\"), effective August 2018. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 27; Overman Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mahmood's announcement of his resignation prompted Beatty to consider leaving Prime. Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-26. She interviewed with Maxor in July 2018. Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 6. During initial meetings with Maxor, Beatty gave Maxor a copy of her Agreement with Prime. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 45. On August 20, 2018, Maxor sent Beatty an offer of employment. Shrayber Decl., Ex. 10; Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 57 &amp; Ex. A (stating that \"Maxor has no interest in receiving any confidential information or Trade Secrets of Prime\"). The very next day, Beatty informed Prime that she intended to terminate her employment. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 30; Overman Decl. \u00b6 24. She asked Overman whether she should \"throttle back\" her involvement at Prime, particularly since she was scheduled to attend meetings with BCBS executives and pharmaceutical providers. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 31. Saying that it \"trust[ed] her integrity,\" Prime not only said that throttling back her employment would be unnecessary, Beatty Decl. \u00b6 31, it asked Beatty to stay on for thirty days rather than two weeks, Overman Decl. \u00b6 25. Beatty declined, and her employment with Prime terminated effective September 6. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 36; Overman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. She began working for Maxor on September 20. Beatty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41; Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Maxor hired Beatty to be Executive Vice President, Industry Relations. Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 31. As Maxor explains, it envisioned that Beatty's responsibilities in this position would include overseeing five functions-underwriting, rebate reporting, margin analytics, retail-network administration, and auditing-across four businesses: Maxor's rebate-aggregation business, Gateway; Maxor-owned on-site pharmacies; hospital-pharmacy (or \"340B\") consulting and services; and its PBM business, MaxorPlus. Wheeler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In an effort to account for Beatty's Agreement with Prime, however, Maxor did not assign all of these responsibilities to Beatty immediately. Instead, Maxor developed a plan to phase in Beatty's responsibilities in four stages. Wheeler Decl. \u00b6 30. According to Maxor and Beatty, the four planned phases are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) September 20, 2018, to November 25, 2018: \"Listen and learn\" Maxor's business from the retiring\n   Chief Financial Officer of Gateway, Maxor's third-party rebate-aggregation business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) November 26, 2018, to January 6, 2019: Supervise rebate-aggregation business, including internal departments handling rebate accounts and client guarantees.

Defendants' position seems to be that Prime's lack of specificity means Prime has failed to show a likelihood of success with respect to a threshold element of its DTSA and MUTSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds that Prime has done enough to show at this early stage that it possesses trade secrets implicated by Beatty's departure. Some of Prime's evidence is specific. For example, Prime describes three PowerPoint presentations and includes in its motion papers a redacted version of one of the presentations. These presentations describe particular elements of Prime's strategic plans, and Prime labeled the documents \"Confidential and Proprietary.\" Overman Decl. \u00b6 16; Second Overman Decl. \u00b6 18 &amp; Ex. 1 at 5. Prime's less-specific descriptions of some claimed trade secrets-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"pricing, margins, and purchase history of pharmaceutical drugs\"-do not altogether undermine its position. It makes sense that Prime would opt not to be more specific in describing data in these areas because that would disclose a level of information it wishes to protect. Prime's position also finds at least some support in legislative records submitted by Beatty. These records document a committee hearing in the Nebraska legislature concerning a bill that would increase transparency from PBMs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shrayber Decl., Ex. 6 at 1-49. There, a pharmacist from Prime testified essentially that no two PBM contracts are exactly alike.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (\"[I]f you have seen one PBM contract[,] you've seen one PBM contract .... None of those contracts look the same.\"). The pharmacist went on to explain that although Prime's contracts permit pharmacies to share the costs of therapy options with patients, those same contracts often also contain confidentiality clauses prohibiting pharmacies, manufacturers, and health plans from disclosing other contract terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.

Prime must also show a likelihood of succeeding on its claim that Beatty's employment with Maxor will result in the misappropriation of Prime's trade secrets. With respect to this element, Prime does not allege that Beatty has actually misappropriated any of its trade secrets at this point in time. Prime does not allege, for example, that Beatty possesses paper or electronic copies of contracts, price lists, strategic plans, employee training manuals, seminar materials, contract-negotiation scripts, or purchase histories of pharmaceutical drugs (the documents that Prime says contain its trade secrets). Instead, Prime asserts that Beatty's employment with Maxor threatens \"a high degree of probability of inevitable disclosure\" and, thus, future misappropriation of Prime's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    Surgidev Corp. v.

The doctrine reflects the common-sense notion that trade secrets merit protection regardless of whether misappropriation has already occurred or inevitably will occur.

Beatty says she \"typically was not involved in negotiations\" with pharmacies and \"was not required to develop or negotiate specific rates.\" Beatty Decl. \u00b6 62. Moreover, Beatty maintains that she does not recall, nor did she ever know by memory, any of the \"thousands\" of \"figures and formulas used by Prime to determine [pharmacy] reimbursement rates at any particular point in time.\" Beatty Decl. \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (\"Prime maintained hundreds of MAC [Maximum Allowable Cost] lists as of 2018, each of\n   which included thousands of different price points, and all of those prices were systematically reviewed and updated on a weekly basis.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mahmood corroborates Beatty's testimony on this point. Mahmood Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15 (\"No [one] ... could possibly remember off-hand the thousands of different price-points that were in effect at any particular time.\"), 29 (\"[I]t would be impossible for me to remember in detail all the specifics of Prime's p ricing, discounts, margin or contractual terms.\"). At this preliminary stage, and with respect to these issues, the Court accords greater weight to the declarations of Beatty and Mahmood than Overman's. To be clear, the Court finds no fault with Overman's declarations. But Beatty's declaration is based upon her personal experience, and it is more specific.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 2. Also, Mahmood was Beatty's supervisor for the bulk of her time at Prime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mahmood Decl. \u00b6 7. Overman served as her supervisor for approximately one month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Overman Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To summarize, then, Beatty's new position is sufficiently dissimilar to the position she held with Prime, and Maxor has taken sufficient preventive measures, largely in the form of phasing in Beatty's employment, to minimize the risk of Beatty using or disclosing Prime's trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, Beatty's actions neither arouse suspicion about her intentions nor reveal a motive to misappropriate Prime's trade secrets. As mentioned earlier, there is no evidence of wrongdoing or that Beatty possesses any documents containing Prime's trade secrets. Though its proposed order would compel the immediate return of such documents, Prime acknowledges that it has no information suggesting that Beatty actually possesses any. By all appearances, Beatty has been forthright during her transition from Prime to Maxor. She was upfront with Maxor about her ongoing obligations to Prime from the start, providing them with a copy of her Agreement with Prime during early meetings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beatty Decl. \u00b6 45. After announcing her intention to leave Prime for Maxor, Beatty volunteered to \"throttle back\" her involvement during her final weeks. Beatty Decl. \u00b6 31. Prime's response-telling Beatty that it trusted her integrity and that throttling back her employment would be unnecessary, Beatty Decl. \u00b6 31, and asking her to stay on for thirty days rather than two weeks, Overman Decl. \u00b6 25-reflects trust in Beatty's intentions. Though its Agreement with Beatty permitted Prime to inspect any personal electronic devices that Beatty used to conduct Prime business, Prime confirmed at the hearing that it did not make that request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement \u00a7 1.B.e.

In a nutshell, the Court concludes that Prime is not likely to prevail on the merits of this claim because the Agreement at issue permits Beatty to work for a Prime competitor so long as Beatty \"has not assumed a position ... that would lead to the inevitable disclosure of Confidential Information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Agreement \u00a7 3.A. As the Court determined with respect to Prime's statutory trade-secret claims, Prime has not shown that Beatty's position with Maxor is likely to lead to the inevitable disclosure of confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Under Minnesota law, a breach-of-contract claim requires: \"(1) a valid contract; (2) performance by the plaintiff of any conditions precedent; (3) a material breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Russo v.

Minn. 2006). Though defendants challenge the non-compete's enforceability, the parties focus more of their attention on whether Beatty's new job with Maxor breaches the contract, and that is where the Court will go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, determining whether a breach has occurred starts (and for practical purposes ends) with interpreting the non-compete itself. The non-compete contains a general prohibition followed by two exceptions to the general prohibition. The prohibition says that, for twelve months after termination of her employment with Prime, Beatty \"shall not, directly or indirectly ... render the same or substantially the same services to an entity or operation engaged in the same or similar Business as [Prime] anywhere in the United States.\" Agreement \u00a7 3.A. If this were all the non-compete said, the Court would have to determine whether Beatty's employment with Maxor amounted to \"the same or substantially the same services\" that she provided to Prime, and whether Maxor is \"an entity or operation engaged in the same or similar Business as [Prime].\" But the Agreement doesn't end there. It goes on to say that there are two situations in which \"[Beatty] is free to work for or provide services to a competitor,\" regardless of whether the work would violate the non-compete's general prohibition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5806870\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/462/981/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She may work for a competitor provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (a) such work or services does not include, directly or indirectly, any responsibilities for, or have any connection with, a Competitive Product ... during the [twelve-month] Restricted Period\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (b) Employee has not assumed a position with a competitor that would lead to the inevitable disclosure of Confidential Information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5806870\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/462/981/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The word \"or\" is dispositive. Because the two carve-outs are disjunctive, Prime's claim fails if Beatty's employment with Maxor fits under either carve-out (a)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   carve-out (b). For the reasons discussed in the previous section analyzing Prime's statutory trade-secret claims and the inevitable-disclosure doctrine, Beatty's employment with Maxor does not place her in \"a position with a competitor that would lead to the inevitable disclosure of Confidential Information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Prime has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The parties devote less attention to Prime's claim against Maxor for tortious interference with contract.

Because Prime has not shown a likelihood that Beatty breached the Agreement, it cannot show a likelihood that Maxor intentionally procured Beatty to breach the Agreement.

The harm Prime identifies flows exclusively from the misappropriation of its trade secrets through inevitable disclosure. But the Court determined already that Prime has not shown a likelihood of inevitable disclosure. Just as that determination leads to the conclusion that Prime is not likely to prevail on the merits, it warrants the conclusion that Prime has not shown that legally cognizable harm is likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Assuming for the sake of argument that harm were likely, the irreparable-versus-reparable issue presents a closer call. The Court nonetheless concludes Prime has not shown that its alleged injuries are truly irreparable. On one level, this question seems straightforward: if its trade secrets were misappropriated by Beatty and Maxor, Prime no doubt would identify lost business resulting from the misappropriation.

By definition, lost profits are 'reparable' through money damages.\"). On another level, it is true that some harms resulting from trade-secret misappropriation may be difficult to quantify. Perhaps there are more nebulous competitive advantages that are difficult to calculate or remedy through a damage award.

This factor does not weigh clearly in favor of any party. The Court previously determined that Prime does not stand to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.

However, at the hearing on this motion, defendants stayed silent when Prime suggested (more than once) that an injunction would not cause Beatty to lose her job. This makes sense. Prime concedes that some of Beatty's duties at Maxor do not trigger a violation of her Agreement with Prime. It seems reasonable to infer from defendants' silence that, if an injunction were issued, Maxor would retain Beatty at least to perform those duties to which Prime does not object.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Jude Med.

Rowe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554073,1554085\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/294/\">\n     429 F.3d 294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 308 (1st Cir. 2005). But its determination that this information did not qualify as a trade secret was contingent on the particular facts of that case-specifically, \"[t]he record [was] replete with evidence\" that the PBMs \"ha[d] taken no special steps to protect their information,\" such as keeping client contracts \"in unlocked cabinets in public areas such as hallways.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554073,1554085\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/294/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits entry of a temporary restraining order \"only if ... specific facts in an affidavit or verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(A). Because Prime does not object to Beatty's phase-one responsibilities, and because phase one runs through November 25, 2018, Rule 65's immediacy requirement cannot be established. For this reason, the Court will deny Prime's motion for a temporary restraining order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Reflecting the high bar posed by the inevitable-disclosure doctrine, the Court has identified only one case from this District finding inevitable disclosure of trade secrets:\n    <em>\n     Cenveo Corp. v. Southern Graphic Systems, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 08-cv-5521 (JRT/AJB),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20161210\">\n     2009 WL 161210\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 (D. Minn. Jan. 22, 2009). That case is distinguishable. The\n    <em>\n     Cenveo\n    </em>\n    court determined that the departing employee had retained proprietary documents and that there were \"discrepancies in her explanations for doing so\" suggesting \"her motives were not altruistic.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20161210\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    No similar allegations or facts appear in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Prime's use of the disjunctive \"or\" makes sense in the context of the carve-outs. In the abstract, it makes sense that Prime would not be terribly concerned about a former employee working for a competitor or on a \"Competitive Product\" if the disclosure of confidential information were not inevitable. Also, Prime does not argue that the definition of \"Confidential Information\" in the Agreement is different from the definition of \"trade secrets\" in the DTSA and MUTSA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
