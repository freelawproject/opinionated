Beach II and Richard J. McNally, Jr. violated Plaintiffs Nash and Koch's Second Amendment rights when they refused to grant them licenses to carry a firearm outside the home for self-defense. (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). On March 26, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (Dkt.

Plaintiffs oppose the motion, but concede that this Court is bound by\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   . (Dkt. No. 26, at 7-8, 11). With leave of the Court, amicus curiae Everytown for Gun Safety (\"Everytown\") has filed a brief in support of Defendants' motion. (Dkt. No. 25). For the reasons below, Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Firearm Regulations in New York State\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   New York law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   absent a license. (Dkt. No. 31, \u00b6 15 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20265.01\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 265.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 265.20(a)(3) ) ). A general member of the public may apply for a handgun carry license (the \"License\") to carry a concealed handgun for the purposes of self-defense, which a licensing officer must approve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). A licensing officer must determine whether a person meets the statutory requirements of New York Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 before the officer can grant a license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). New York Penal Law \u00a7 400.00(2)(f) requires that an applicant show that \"proper cause exists for the issuance thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). Some licensing officers note restrictions on the license, such as \"hunting and target,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   and refer to those licenses as \"restricted licenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). These licenses \"allow the licensee to carry a firearm only when engaged in those specified activities\" but do not \"permit the carrying of a firearm in public for the purpose of self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Licensing officers have \"some discretion in determining what constitutes 'proper cause,' \" but \"this discretion is cabined by the significant body of New York case-law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Under that caselaw, the applicant must \"demonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community\" to satisfy the proper cause standard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff NYSRPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff NYSRPA \"has at least one member\" who \"would forthwith carry a firearm outside the home for self-defense,\" but the member(s) cannot \"satisfy the 'proper cause' requirement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40). NYSRPA is \"organized to support and defend the right of New York residents to keep and bear arms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). The New York firearm regulations limiting the \"public carrying of firearms\" is a direct \"affront to [its] central mission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Both Nash and Koch are members of NYSRPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs Robert Nash and Brandon Koch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs Nash and Koch do not fall within any exception under New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.20 to New York's ban on carrying firearms in public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 31). While they meet many of the statutory requirements to obtain a handgun carry license under New York Penal Law \u00a7 400.00, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 32), Nash and Koch do not satisfy the \"proper cause\" requirement because they do not \"face any special or unique danger to [their] life\" nor are they \"entitled to a Handgun Carry License by virtue of [their] occupation, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 400.00(2)(b)-(e).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 33). Instead, Nash and Koch \"desire to carry a handgun in public for the purpose of self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about September 2014, Plaintiff Nash \"applied to the Licensing Officer ... for a license to carry a handgun in public\"; his application was granted on March 12, 2015, but he was \"issued a license marked 'Hunting, Target only.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). Nash's license does not permit him to \"carry a firearm outside of his home for the purpose of self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). On September 5, 2016, Nash requested that the licensing officer, Defendant McNally, \"remove the 'hunting and target' restrictions from his license and issue him a license allowing him to carry a firearm for self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). In support of his request, Nash \"cited a string of recent robberies in his neighborhood and the fact that he had recently completed an advanced firearm safety training course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On November 1, 2016, \"after an informal hearing, Defendant McNally denied Mr. Nash's request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). McNally denied the request because Nash \"failed to show 'proper cause' to carry a firearm in public for the purpose of self-defense, because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense that distinguished him from the general public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Currently, Nash \"refrain[s] from carrying a firearm outside the home for self-defense\" but \"would carry a firearm in public for self-defense in New York were it lawful for him to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Koch \"was granted a license to carry a handgun in public by the Licensing Officer\" in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). The license, however, was \"marked 'Hunting &amp; Target' \"; Koch is therefore unable \"to carry a firearm outside of his home for the purpose of self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). In November 2017, Koch requested that Defendant McNally \"remove the 'hunting and\n   target' restrictions from his license and issue him a license allowing him to carry a firearm for self-defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). Koch cited \"his extensive experience in the safe handling and operation of firearms and the many safety training courses he had completed\" in support of his request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 16, 2018, McNally denied Koch's request because he \"failed to show 'proper cause' to carry a firearm in public for the purpose of self-defense, because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense that distinguished him from the general public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38). Koch \"continues to refrain from carrying a firearm outside the home for self-defense\" but \"would carry a firearm in public for self-defense in New York were it lawful for him to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
