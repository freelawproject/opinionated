R. CIV. P. 45(d)(3)(A)(ii). But, consistent with this Court's understanding of how to determine the court or district \"where compliance is required,\" a court in the district encompassing that improper place of compliance can properly make that ruling on a Rule 45(d)(3)(A)(ii) motion as the court for the district where compliance is-whether properly or not-required on the face of the subpoena, and does so consistent with Rule 45's text and structure as well as the practical realities that courts presented with subpoena-related motions and applications face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After all, while \"[a]lthough Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii) permits the subpoena to direct a place of compliance, that place must be selected under Rule 45(c),\" FED. R. CIV. P. 45(f), advisory committee notes (2013 amendments), the place of compliance is the one directed by the subpoena unless and until a court rules otherwise on a motion under Rule 45(d). At the time of deciding where such a motion must be filed, then, the place named in the subpoena\n   as required by Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii) is the place \"where compliance is required.\" This is so even if the subpoenaed non-party has objected based on Rule 45(c) to a subpoena's named place of compliance, because the determination that the subpoenaed non-party and not the subpoenaing party has the better of a Rule 45(c) dispute must await decision on a Rule 45(d)(2) or 45(d)(3) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court understands the concern that Rule 45's \"purpose of protecting nonparties is defeated if a party could demand compliance in a location more than 100 miles from where the nonparty resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person and still require the nonparty to adjudicate a dispute over that subpoena in a distant forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Raap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202462823\">\n    2017 WL 2462823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. And a subpoenaed person could decide where to file a Rule 45(d)(3) motion to quash or modify based on where the person will assert that he, she, or it resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But Rule 45(d)(3)(A)(ii) motions to quash often are filed in the court corresponding to the improper place of compliance stated in the subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    HCAPS Conroe Affiliation Inc. v.

Tex. June 22, 2015). And a subpoenaing party can always be expected to file a Rule 45(d)(2) motion to compel in the court for the district encompassing the place of compliance that the party listed on the subpoena. On those motions, notwithstanding any concerns with requiring a nonparty to adjudicate a dispute over a subpoena in a distant forum, the court addressing the motion to compel will have no way of dependably making the fact-intensive determination whether the subpoena's stated place of compliance is within 100 miles of where the subpoenaed person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person without hearing from the subpoenaed person.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Risk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204055372\">\n    2014 WL 4055372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (\"But, while C. Jim Romig may reside and work more than 100 miles from Dallas, Texas, there is no evidence directed to the question whether he regularly conducts business in Dallas, where he is directed to produce the documents. The Court simply does not know the answer to that question....\"). It is at the least impractical for a court to be required to formally decide if the nonparty or the subpoenaing party wins a Rule 45(c) issue on a Rule 45(d) motion in order to determine whether the court actually can decide which side prevails on the motion on that or any other issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In any event, an email address does not qualify as a location or place where compliance is required under Rule 45, although the subpoenaing party and the subpoenaed person could agree to production by electronic means.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 45(f), advisory committee notes (2013 amendments) (\"Under the current rule, parties often agree that production, particularly of electronically stored information, be transmitted by electronic means. Such arrangements facilitate discovery, and nothing in these amendments limits the ability of parties to make such arrangements.\"). At least where the parties have not so agreed, a subpoena that provides only an email address arguably violates Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii)'s requirement to \"command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified ... place.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 45(a)(1)(A)(iii). It seems that, in such an instance, a court faced with a Rule 45(d)(2) or 45(d)(3) motion could take appropriate action on the motion based on the understanding that the subpoena is simply not a valid and enforceable subpoena.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Paso Del Norte Motors, LP v.

Tex. Aug. 19, 2015) (\"A subpoena that violates Rule 45(a)(2)'s requirement is facially invalid and cannot be enforced by the Court notwithstanding that a violation of Rule 45(a) (2) is not a ground for quashing or modification listed in Rule 43(d)(3). The subpoena is simply not a valid subpoena, and, even if this Court otherwise had some basis or authority to address this subpoena under Rule 45, the Court would have no authority to enforce it by an order granting a motion to compel under Rule 45(d) or for contempt under Rule 45(g).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Alternatively, a court could look to the physical location listed for the person to whom a subpoena is directed to determine which district covers the place where compliance is required and therefore which court can hear and decide a subpoena-related motion. But, in an age of mobile devices, this Court cannot adopt Defendants' assumption that, where an email address is provided, the place where compliance is required-understood by Defendants as the place where the electronic transmission will actually be received over email-is the office address of the attorney whose email is listed on a subpoena. Given the realities of electronically transmitting and receiving information, if only an email address is provided for compliance on a subpoena and a court is left with no good choices for deciding which is the district where compliance is required, a more plausible assumption seems to be that the subpoenaed person would comply by transmitting the subpoenaed information from the location where that person works or resides as listed on the subpoena. This approach, too, has the virtue of requiring the party seeking to file a motion to quash or compel and the court reviewing such a motion in the first instance to look only to the face of the subpoena-and not to determine where the subpoenaed party actually resides or works in light of the 100-mile geographical limit-to ascertain which court Rule 45 authorizes to hear and decide the motion. Of course, if the subpoena lists only an email address for the subpoenaed person, that raises a separate, threshold issue of whether the subpoena was personally delivered as Rule 45(b)(1) requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitley v.

Tex. Sept. 20, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Fortunately, here, the Subpoenas list a physical address for a law office in Dallas, Texas as the place of compliance-which, for good measure, the Kofile Entities do not dispute complies with Rule 45(c)(2)(A). That the Notices of Intent may have communicated to parties in the West Virginia case-including CSS but not the Kofile Entities-that Defendants' preference was electronic transmission to Mr. Annand's email does not change what the face of the Subpoenas themselves direct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, the court for the district where compliance with the Subpoenas is required is the Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas, and CSS properly filed its Motion to Quash in this Court under Rule 45(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Transfer is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(f).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The parties do not see eye to eye on where the Motion to Quash should be decided, and the Court has carefully considered the argument for and against a Rule 45(f) transfer, including the Kofile Entities' assertions that transfer is inappropriate where they \"maintain their principal places of business in Dallas, their officers and directors are located in Dallas, and any physical documents responsive to the subpoenas\n   are located in Dallas\"; \"counsel for the Kofile [E]ntities on the Motion [to Quash] is located in Dallas\"; and, \"[a]s non-parties to the Lawsuit based in Dallas, the Kofile [E]ntities have a substantial interest in resolving this dispute in this Court rather than in West Virginia.\" Dkt. No. 10 at 10 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After considering all the arguments for and against finding exceptional circumstances justifying transfer, the Court is convinced that Defendants have met their burden of showing that transfer under Rule 45(f) is appropriate here based on exceptional circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Motion to Quash is based on CSS's and the Kofile Entities' assertion that the Subpoenas are untimely because the discovery deadline in the West Virginia case has passed. The presiding judge in that case recently denied a motion to extend the deadline. But Defendants maintain that the Subpoenas are still timely and enforceable under all the circumstances of the case. Most importantly, these same issues are presented to the court in that case on Defendants' pending and fully briefed motions to compel-although CSS and the Kofile Entities assert that those motions were improperly filed there. The Court understands that CSS and the Kofile Entities believe that \"Defendants' position that their motion to compel against CSS is 'linked' to the subpoenas served on Kofile only highlights the fact that Defendants are using the subpoenas in an effort to bypass discovery rules for parties to the litigation under Rule 34.\" Dkt. No. 10 at 9. That may be so. And the court in the West Virginia case may agree with this Court's analysis that motions on the Subpoenas are only properly filed in this Court. But, whether it does or not, by transferring the Motion to Quash and Motion to Join, that court will be able to resolve these disputes as to the Subpoenas-which appear to involve issues that did not arise in connection with the subpoena seeking the deposition of third party Clyde Lowers-based on the court's own discovery deadline on either the pending motions to compel or the Motion to Quash and the Motion to Join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rule 45(f) provides that, on a transfer, \"if the attorney for a person subject to a subpoena is authorized to practice in the court where the motion was made, the attorney may file papers and appear on the motion as an officer of the issuing court.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 45(f). And the Advisory Committee Notes explain that, \"[i]f the motion is transferred, judges are encouraged to permit telecommunications methods to minimalize the burden a transfer imposes on nonparties, if it is necessary for attorneys admitted in the court where the motion is made to appear in the court in which the action is pending\" and that \"[t]he rule provides that if these attorneys are authorized to practice in the court where the motion is made, they may file papers and appear in the court in which the action is pending in relation to the motion as officers of that court.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 45(f), advisory committee notes (2013 amendments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But, here, diminishing any concerns about the burden on the Kofile Entities (much less on CSS) in litigating the Motion to Quash and Motion to Join in the West Virginia case, the same counsel representing CSS in the West Virginia case are representing CSS and the Kofile Entities in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court is presented here with exceptional circumstances in which transfer is warranted to avoid disrupting the issuing court's management of the underlying West Virginia case and in which those interests outweigh whatever interests that CSS and the Kofile Entities may have in resolving the Motion to Quash and Motion to Join in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court ORDERS, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(f), that CSS, Inc.'s Motion to Quash Third-Party Subpoenas and Motion For Protective Order [Dkt.
