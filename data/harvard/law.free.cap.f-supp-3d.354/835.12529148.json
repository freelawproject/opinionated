INTRODUCTION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     Gerald Steven Kosirog (\"Kosirog\") brought the present action pursuant to section 405(g) of title 42 of the United States Code. Kosirog sought this Court's review of the decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (the \"Commissioner\") to deny his applications for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits from April 15, 2012 to August 26, 2013. Mot. J. Admin. R., ECF No. 13; Mem. Supp. Pl.'s Mot. J. Admin. R. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 13-1. Kosirog asked that this Court reverse the Commissioner's decision or remand his case for further administrative proceedings. Pl.'s Mem. 1. The Commissioner, in contrast, requested that this Court affirm its decision. Def.'s Resp. Pl.'s Mot. J. Admin. R. (\"Def.'s Resp.\") 4, ECF No. 15.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     This Court granted Kosirog's motion to remand because the hearing officer failed to identify the specific evidence in the record upon which he relied when making his decision.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     <strong>\n      A. Procedural History\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     On September 20, 2012, Kosirog applied for disability insurance benefits. Admin. R. 131-37, ECF No. 10. On March 13, 2013, Kosirog applied for supplemental security income benefits.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 138-47. Both applications had a disability onset date of April 15, 2012.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 131, 148. The Social Security Administration denied Kosirog's request for both benefits initially and after reconsideration.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 71-73, 78-79. On September 3, 2014, a hearing officer held a hearing upon Kosirog's request.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 29-49, 81-82.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     The hearing officer found that Kosirog had a disability beginning August 27, 2013, when Kosirog turned 50 years old, but not earlier.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 13-28. Disputing this finding, Kosirog requested review of the hearing officer's determination that he did not have a disability between April 15, 2012 and August 26, 2013.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 9. On February 26, 2016, the Appeals Council denied review of the hearing officer's decision.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 1.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     On May 26, 2016, Kosirog filed the present action for review of the Commissioner's decision. Compl., ECF No. 1. On July 18, 2016, the Commissioner filed an answer, ECF No. 9, and the administrative record, ECF No. 10. On September 30, 2016, Kosirog filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record and a supporting memorandum. ECF No. 13. On October 28, 2016, the Commissioner responded. ECF No. 15. On November 11, 2016, Kosirog replied. Pl.'s Reply 1, ECF No. 16.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     On January 29, 2018, the case was assigned to this Court. Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No. 17. On September 19, 2018, this Court heard oral argument and remanded the case for further proceedings. Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF Nos. 21, 22. This opinion explains that decision.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     <strong>\n      B. Factual Background\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Kosirog was born in 1963. Admin. R. 131. He completed his GED in 1991,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 34, and has worked as a concrete construction worker, a carpenter, and an overhead crane operator,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 33, 34, 44-45.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     On March 2, 2012, after examination, Arthur Williams, D.O. (\"Dr. Williams\"), diagnosed Kosirog with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\").\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 246. On April 15, 2012, Kosirog fell off a horse and fractured four ribs.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 253, 266, 301. Kosirog stated that he became disabled after that accident.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 40, 131.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     On July 26, 2012, during an appointment with Dr. Williams, Kosirog reported feeling substantial pain resulting from his horseback riding accident.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 266. During Kosirog's examination, Dr. Williams detected decreased breathing patterns in both lungs and tenderness of the right flank and lumbar spine.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 267. Dr. Williams diagnosed Kosirog with lumbar disc disease, COPD, and anxiety.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     He prescribed Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Symbicort, and Clonazepam to treat those ailments, respectively.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     On August 7, 2012, John Klekamp, M.D. (\"Dr. Klekamp\"), began treating Kosirog for lower back pain radiating to the right leg.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 253. After reviewing Kosirog's x-rays, Dr. Klekamp diagnosed Kosirog with disc degeneration as well as cervical pain.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 253-54.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     On August 23, 2012, during an appointment with Dr. Williams, Kosirog reported continued back pain and stated that medication was helping \"just a little bit.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 264. An examination revealed that Kosirog had decreased reflexes in his right knee and decreased strength in both legs.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 265. Dr. Williams rediagnosed Kosirog with lumbar disc disease, administered an injection of Depo-Medrol and Decadron, and prescribed Prednisone.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     On September 25, 2012, Dr. Williams noted no significant changes in Kosirog's symptoms.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 262.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     On October 5, 2012, an MRI of Kosirog's lumbar spine showed some mild and moderate arthropathy, a disc herniation, and marked degenerative L5-S1 disc stenosis.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 277. On October 12, 2012, Dr. Williams administered an epidural steroid injection to Kosirog.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 279. Then, on October 26, 2012, Kosirog underwent a second epidural steroid injection.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 280.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     On December 5, 2012, Dr. Klekamp performed a lumbar discectomy surgery on Kosirog.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 249-50. On February 14, 2013, Kosirog stated that he had pain in the middle region of his back, right shoulder, neck, and tailbone despite the lumbar discectomy surgery.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 402. At Dr. Klekamp's recommendation, Kosirog visited a pain management specialist who diagnosed him with sacroliitis, lumbar disc degeneration, thoracic back pain, cervicalgia, and lumbar radiculopathy.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 319, 402.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     On March 14, 2013, Dr. Williams saw Kosirog for a follow-up visit regarding his lumbar discectomy surgery.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 297. X-rays of his spine, taken the same day, showed straightening of the cervical spine with decreased range of motion, osteophytic spurs, and degenerative disc disease with spondylosis and disc narrowing.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 289.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     On May 6, 2013, Dr. Williams completed a Multiple Impairment Questionnaire for Kosirog.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 299-306. He diagnosed Kosirog with lumbar disc disease after his surgery in December 2012.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 299. To support his assessment, Dr. Williams cited clinical findings that included an MRI scan and the absence of ankle reflexes.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 299-300. Dr. Williams reported that Kosirog's primary symptoms were pain in the right leg, a limping gait, and exhaustion.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 301. Kosirog's pain ranged from moderate to severe, from six to ten on a ten-point scale, and his fatigue ranged from moderate to moderately severe, from six to eight on a ten-point scale.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Dr. Williams stated that the symptoms and limitations detailed in the questionnaire had been present since April 15, 2012.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 305.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-28\">\n     Dr. Williams found that Kosirog could sit for a maximum of one hour and stand and walk for a total of one hour during an eight-hour workday, but needed to change positions every 15 minutes.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 299-306, 324, 408. Kosirog could occasionally lift and carry ten pounds, but never more.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     at 302. He had significant limitations performing repetitive reaching, handling, fingering, and lifting.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Dr. Williams determined that Kosirog was markedly limited, or effectively precluded, from using his upper extremities for grasping, turning, and twisting objects, and moderately limited from performing fine manipulations.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 302-03. Kosirog's pain, fatigue, and other symptoms were frequently severe enough to interfere with his attention and concentration.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 304. Kosirog required unscheduled breaks, of a 35-minute duration, approximately once an hour in an eight-hour workday.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Kosirog had good and bad days, but would be absent from work, on average, more than three times a month.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 305.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     <strong>\n      D.

Kosirog also testified that the pain interferes with his ability to stand and walk.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Kosirog stated that he can walk only 100 feet before he needs to stop and rest for 15 minutes; he can sit only for 45 minutes and stand for approximately 15 minutes; and after three to four hours he must lay flat.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 37.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     Kosirog testified that he was recently diagnosed with COPD, for which he uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine during the night to help him breathe.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 38. Also, it is difficult for him to go outside in hot weather.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     A vocational expert testified that an individual of Kosirog's age, education, and work history, limited to light exertional work with no concentrated exposure to pulmonary irritants or vibrations, could not perform Kosirog's past work.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 45-46. The vocational expert testified that such an individual could work as an assembler and a gate guard.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 46-47. He further explained that if the individual was further limited to sedentary work, he could perform jobs as a document preparer, a surveillance system monitor, and a ticket-taker or ticket-seller.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 47. The vocational expert stated that if an individual needed to lie down for at least one hour a day, he could not perform any work.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Finally, the vocational expert testified that an individual who missed work three times a month could not work.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 48.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     <strong>\n      II.

Def.'s Mem. 4-5.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-61\">\n     A hearing officer's subjective symptom evaluation is entitled to \"great weight and deference,\" and this Court's review is limited to determining whether the hearing officer's reasons to discredit the subjective symptoms are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n     <em>\n      Jones\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Commissioner of Soc.

Whenever the hearing officer \"rejects a claimant's testimony as incredible, he must clearly state his reasons for doing so.\"\n     <em>\n      Felisky\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Bowen\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529573\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/1027/#p1036\">\n      35 F.3d 1027\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 1036 (6th Cir. 1994). In\n     <em>\n      Duncan\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n     </em>\n     , the Sixth Circuit distilled these guidelines into a two-pronged test:\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-62\">\n     First, we examine whether there is objective medical evidence of an underlying medical condition. If there is, we then examine: (1) whether objective medical evidence confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from the condition; or (2) whether the objectively established medical condition is of such a severity that it can reasonably be expected to produce the alleged disabling pain.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-64\">\n     Here, the hearing officer incorrectly followed the two-step process to analyze Kosirog's symptoms.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Admin. R. 21. In the first step, the hearing officer found objective medical evidence supporting medical conditions.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549352\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/801/847/#p853\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     In the second step, after enumerating the subjective symptoms, the hearing officer found that Kosirog's subjective symptoms were credible, but not to the extent that he could not perform sedentary work.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 21. The hearing officer may reasonably discount a claimant's testimony concerning the severity of his condition because his testimony was inconsistent with medical evidence in the record.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Temples\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Commissioner of Soc.

App'x 460\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 462 (6th Cir. 2013) (per curiam). In this case, the hearing officer concluded that Kosirog's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be\n     expected to cause many of the alleged symptoms; however, he retains the ability to perform sedentary work.\" Admin R. 21. The hearing officer then summarized the evidence in the record.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 21-22. The hearing officer, however, did not explain how any of the evidence contradicted Kosirog's symptoms.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-65\">\n     Finally, the hearing officer noted that Kosirog received unemployment compensation in the first, second, and third quarters of 2012.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 19, 168-69. Even though the Social Security Administration has adopted the policy that receipt of unemployment benefits does not preclude disability benefits, Social Security Memorandum 10-1258 (Aug. 9, 2010), the Sixth Circuit still observes that \"[a]pplications for unemployment and disability benefits are inherently inconsistent.\"\n     <em>\n      Workman\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Commissioner of Soc.

Jan. 29, 1999) ). In his opinion, however, the hearing officer only considered this point when deciding that Kosirog had not engaged in substantial gainful activity. Admin. R. 19. Thus, though the Commissioner makes this argument now, the hearing officer never referred to it as a reason to undermine Kosirog's credibility.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ; Def.'s Resp. 6. As the Sixth Circuit has stated, the hearing officer is required to \"explain his credibility determinations in his decision.\"\n     <em>\n      Rogers\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117964\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/234/#p248\">\n      486 F.3d at 248\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The hearing officer \"is not free to make credibility determinations based solely upon an 'intangible or intuitive notion about an individual's credibility.' \"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117964\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/234/#p248\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     at 247 (citing Social Security Ruling 96-7p, 1996 SSR WL 374186, at *4). Therefore, this Court need not analyze the significance of this argument here.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-66\">\n     The hearing officer should have identified specific medical evidence and non-medical facts to demonstrate inconsistencies in Kosirog's testimony. The hearing officer failed to comply with these requirements as well as Sixth Circuit precedent governing credibility determinations, and thus, failed appropriately to analyze Kosirog's residual functional capacity.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-67\">\n     Therefore, the Court also GRANTED Kosirog's motion to remand the case on this basis.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-69\">\n     For the foregoing reasons, on September 19, 2018, this Court GRANTED Kosirog's motion to remand the hearing officer's decision for further proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-72\">\n     Nancy A.
