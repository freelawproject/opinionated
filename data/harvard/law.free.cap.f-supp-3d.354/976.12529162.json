Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FLSA Collective Action Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Failure to Inform Employees of Tip-Credit Provisions of the FLSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff claims Defendants violated the FLSA by failing to inform their employees of the tip-credit provisions of the FLSA. As Plaintiff points out in her Suggestions in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Decertify, Defendants do not address this claim in their Motion for Decertification. Plaintiff also fails to advance her argument for class certification on this claim in her Suggestions in Opposition. Defendants argue in their Reply Suggestions that according to evidence set forth by Defendants' tipped employees in 35 declarations submitted prior to step-one certification of this class, \"many of Defendants' employees ... were advised of the tip credit.\" (Doc. # 286, p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court finds class certification remains proper as to the claim that Defendants failed to inform plaintiffs of the tip-credit provisions of the FLSA. While defendants typically move for decertification at the close of discovery \"when the Court has much more information and is able to make a more informed decision,\" here, neither Plaintiff nor Defendants have presented the Court with analysis of any new discovery as to this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636982\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/243/360/#p363\">\n    243 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   363 ) (citation omitted). In Defendants' Suggestions in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Step-One Notice, Defendants state, \"[Defendants] did indeed notify Plaintiff and all other members of the class of the tip credit provision of the FLSA, whether through individual signed notices and/or through the poster that hangs in each of its restaurants.\" (Doc. # 39, p. 18 n.22). This statement demonstrates class members experienced similar rather than \"disparate factual and employment settings,\" in that class members all allegedly signed notices and/or worked in the presence of a poster informing them of the FLSA tip credit provision. (\n   <em>\n    Bouaphakeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186145\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/791/#p796\">\n    765 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   796 ). Defendants have not put forth any individualized defenses, which cuts in favor of class treatment of this claim. Further, fairness and procedural considerations weigh in favor of class treatment as to this claim, given that Defendants claim all class members were made aware of the FLSA tip credit provision in a similar manner. That being the case, it would be efficient and fair to all parties to resolve the claim on a class-wide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Requirement that Employees Reimburse Restaurants for Customer Walkouts and Cash Register Shortages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff claims Defendants violated the FLSA by enforcing a policy that\n   required tipped employees to reimburse Defendants for customer walkouts and cash register shortages. As Plaintiff points out in her Suggestions in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Decertify, Defendants do not address this claim in their Motion for Decertification. Plaintiff also fails to advance her argument for class certification as to this claim in her Suggestions in Opposition. Defendants argue in their Reply Suggestions that it \"would be improper to maintain certification of an FLSA class based on customer walkouts and cash register shortages[ ] when evidence in the record ... indicates that many [o]pt-[i]n [p]laintiffs likely either never experienced such an event or never had to pay for it out of their tips.\" (Doc. # 286, p. 6). Defendants argue an individualized inquiry would be required to determine which class members experienced reimbursing Defendants for customer walkouts or cash register shortages. Defendants failed to analyze decertification of this claim utilizing the three factors laid out above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court finds class certification remains proper as to the claim that Defendants unlawfully enforced a policy that required tipped employees to reimburse Defendants for customer walkouts and cash register shortages. Even if some opt-in plaintiffs either never experienced or were never required to reimburse Defendants for a customer walkout or cash register shortage, all opt-in plaintiffs were subjected to the same policy in the course of their employment. Differences in injury flowing from enforcement of the policy is not a proper defense or basis for decertification, as differences in injury do not disprove the claim that Defendants enforced an FLSA-violating policy to which all class members were subjected. Although the Court recognizes that this action will necessitate a degree of individual inquiry into the harm suffered by class members, procedural considerations weigh in favor of class treatment as to this claim given that liability will turn on common evidence relating to the legality of Defendants' single policy. Further, fairness considerations warrant plaintiffs the right to bring their claims collectively, since many could not pursue their claims individually given the relatively small value of their individual claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Dual Jobs Under the Fair Labor Standards Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff claims Defendants violated the FLSA by requiring tipped employees to perform excessive amounts and improper types of non-tipped work. The FLSA permits employers to pay \"tipped employees,\" defined as employees \"engaged in an occupation in which [they] customarily and regularly receive[ ] more than $30 a month in tips,\" sub-minimum wage by taking a tip credit toward the tipped employees' wages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t) ; C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56(a)-(d).

Specifically, subsection \"e\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In some situations an employee is employed in a dual job, as for example, where a maintenance man in a hotel also serves as a waiter. In such a situation the employee, if he customarily and regularly receives at least $30 a month in tips for his work as a waiter, is a tipped employee only with respect to his employment as a waiter. He is employed in two occupations, and no tip credit can be taken for his hours of employment in his occupation of maintenance man. Such a situation is distinguishable from that of a waitress who spends\n   <em>\n    part of her time\n   </em>\n   cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and\n   <em>\n    occasionally\n   </em>\n   washing dishes or glasses.

(Doc. # 296, p. 2). Defendants argue the Court should follow the plain language of the FLSA and ignore the Dual Jobs Regulation, referring the Court to a brief filed in a separate Ninth Circuit case that detailed an argument that the Dual Jobs Regulation is not worthy of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Defendants argue alternatively that if the Court defers to the DOL's interpretations, it must defer to the Opinion Letter and not former guidance of the \"now-withdrawn FOH provision that the DOL itself says was an incorrect interpretation of the law.\" Plaintiff argues the Opinion Letter only applies prospectively and therefore does not apply to this case. Plaintiff argues alternatively that even if the Opinion Letter applies retroactively, the Court should decline to grant the Opinion Letter\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference because \"the sudden change in the DOL's position results in 'unfair surprise.' \" (Doc. # 296, p. 1). Plaintiff argues \"[t]his means the Court is free to independently interpret\" the Dual Jobs Regulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p837\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court finds Opinion Letter FLSA2018-27 is currently unworthy of\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference in this case. As both Plaintiff and Defendants recognize in their briefing, the DOL's interpretation of the Dual Jobs Regulation as set forth in the Opinion Letter directly conflicts with its prior guidance in the FOH implementing the 80/20 rule pertaining to \"related duties.\" With the exception of the nearly identical opinion letter issued and swiftly withdrawn in 2009, the DOL has consistently interpreted the Dual Jobs Regulation as limiting an employer's ability to require its tipped employees to participate in non-tip-producing related tasks to 20% of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in a workweek. As Plaintiff notes, the DOL reaffirmed its 80/20 rule interpretation at various instances over this time period. Such instances include the DOL's submission of amicus briefs before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and the republishing of its interpretation in the 2016 edits to the FOH. To give\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference to an Opinion Letter pronouncing the sudden forthright withdrawal of such longstanding guidance would result in \"unfair surprise\" to Plaintiff, who brought this lawsuit almost three years ago when the time-honored 80/20 rule interpretation was understood to be the law. It would also constitute \"unfair surprise\" to class members who were subjected to the allegedly unlawful restaurant policies and procedures that were in place at that time. Furthermore, during the entirety of the class period in this case, the DOL's sole interpretation of the Dual Jobs Regulation was that which was set forth in the FOH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For similar reasons, the Court also finds the DOL's interpretation set forth in the Opinion Letter unpersuasive and unworthy of the lesser\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference. The abrupt issuance of an Opinion Letter purporting to change the DOL's interpretation after years of consistently construing the Dual Jobs Regulation as limited by the 80/20 rule does not persuade this Court to apply a new interpretation to this litigation. Aside from expressing the DOL's desire to clarify the FOH sections addressing the tip credit, the DOL does not offer reasoning or evidence of any thorough consideration for reversing course. Accordingly, the Court finds the Opinion Letter unpersuasive and unworthy of\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because the Court finds the Opinion Letter to be unworthy of deference, the Court need not address whether the Opinion Letter applies to pending litigation. Without interpretative guidance from the Opinion Letter, the Court must determine whether to follow Eighth Circuit precedent as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   , 638 F.3d at 872, which held the DOL's interpretation of the Dual Jobs Regulation contained in the FOH was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference and the 80/20 rule was a reasonable interpretation of the Dual Jobs Regulation, or independently interpret the ambiguous Dual Jobs Regulation. While the Opinion Letter states that \"[t]hese principles supersede our statements in FOH \u00a7 [30d00(f) ]\" and \"[a] revised FOH statement will be forthcoming,\" as of the date of the issuance of this Order, the FOH has not been revised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this reason, the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   remains controlling law and binding on this Court. However, even if the 80/20 rule provision in the FOH is ultimately\n   rescinded or otherwise revised, the Court agrees with the Eighth Circuit's rationale for finding that the 80/20 rule is a reasonable interpretation of the Dual Jobs Regulation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"By using the terms \"part of [the] time\" and \"occasionally,\" the regulation clearly places a temporal limit on the amount of related duties an employee can perform and still be considered to be engaged in the tip-producing occupation.... [T]he DOL's regulations consistently place temporal limits on regulations dealing with the term \"occasional[ ]\" .... and the DOL has used a 20 percent threshold to [impose temporal limits] in various contexts within the FLSA.... The 20 percent threshold ... is a reasonable interpretation of the terms \"part of [the] time\" and \"occasionally [.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Fast\n   </em>\n   , 638 F.3d at 879-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should not afford\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference to the Dual Jobs Regulation because the Dual Jobs Regulation \"was not subject to notice and comment\" and \"the final rule was entirely different from the proposed rule.\" (Doc. # 296, p. 16). Defendants do not flesh out this argument in their briefing; rather, Defendants direct the Court to \"Appellee's Brief filed in\n   <em>\n    Llanos v. P.F.

Instead, Defendants indicate that three of the four individuals it deposed who consented to join the FLSA collective action signed declarations prior to conditional, or \"step-one,\" certification of this class, representing that they spent 20% or less time on non-tipped sidework, and then made inconsistent statements under oath during deposition. Defendants also point out that additional individuals who opted in to the class, whom Defendants did not depose, submitted declarations indicating they spent 20% or less time on non-tipped sidework. Defendants also argue, as they argued in opposing step-one certification, that the declarations \"show a wide divergence in the amount and type of side work that servers and bartenders were asked to complete.\" (Doc. # 286, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff argues that class members are similarly situated in terms of factual and employment settings because \"Defendants' commonly owned restaurants distribute the same policies to newly hired employees, use common human resource employees, and employ common regional managers who get the same instructions about enforcing policies across restaurants.\" (Doc. # 275, p. 13).

Plaintiff and class members are similarly situated in terms of factual and employment settings. According to declarations of former managers who worked at various restaurant locations, Defendants require servers and bartenders [across their restaurants] to perform: opening duties, shift change\n   \"outs\" or cut work, closing duties, intensive cleaning duties, and other ongoing \"side work\" duties performed during the course of the shift in between serving customers. According to declarations of former managers, servers, and bartenders, such duties range from brewing tea, stocking server stations, and slicing lemons, to dusting, sweeping, cleaning bathrooms, and taking out the trash. (See Doc. # 36, pp. 11-14). Former managers state that across Defendants' restaurants, bartenders \"spent 30 to 60 percent of their shifts performing the non-tipped duties\" and servers \"typically spent between 25 and 45 percent of their shifts performing the non-tipped duties[.]\" (Doc. # 36-1, p. 15). Former managers state that throughout Defendants' restaurants, such tipped employees were paid sub-minimum hourly wages for performing such non-tipped duties. Moreover, according to deposition testimony from Defendants' corporate representatives, Defendants utilized the same human resources department, distributed the same packet of policies to new hires, and employed regional managers who receive the same instructions about how to carry out these policies, across restaurants. (Doc. # 275, p. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While each server and each bartender may not perform the same duties for the same amount of time every day, Defendants employed the same policies and procedures across restaurants that required class members to complete similar job duties, some apparently related to the job of serving or bartending and some apparently unrelated, for similar amounts of time during each shift at tip-credit rates of pay. The declarations of Defendants' former managers and depositions of Defendants' corporate representatives indicate \"that using tipped employees to [perform dual jobs] was not an isolated, rare, or random occurrence, but rather the general practice at [Defendants'] restaurants across the various locations and throughout the class period.\"\n   <em>\n    Driver v.

Sept. 24, 2007) (denying Defendants' motion for decertification, stating \"[Defendant] exaggerates the factual differences among employees on various shifts and in different departments. If one zooms in close enough on anything, differences will abound; even for a single employee doing a single job, the amount of time that she spends [on preparatory work at or before the start of her shift] on Monday will differ, at least minutely, from the amount of time that she spends [on such preparatory work] on Tuesday.).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While Defendants argue individuals who opted in to the class even after submitting declarations stating they spent 20% or less time on non-tipped work should be ineligible for class membership, Plaintiff claims the declaration process Defendants used was deficient and resulted in inaccurate results. Defendants deposed\n   three of these individuals, and their deposition testimony corroborates Plaintiff's claim that the employees' declaration testimony was inaccurate. The Court cannot decertify the class or \"disqualify\" certain members from the class when such members claim their declaration testimony was recorded inaccurately or that the declaration process was otherwise faulty and captured inaccurate representations of their experiences. The Court also finds that fairness and procedural considerations weigh in favor of maintaining class certification considering class members were commonly subjected to Defendants' policies and procedures allegedly requiring them to perform unrelated duties for sub-minimum wages and perform related duties for excessive amounts of time in violation of the FLSA. If affected employees are not permitted to proceed as a class, the monetary value of their claims may not be large enough to enable each employee to proceed with their claims individually. It follows that class treatment in this circumstance serves to implement the policy of construing the FLSA liberally, \"in favor of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

Defendants support their request with their interpretation of the results from a questionnaire Defendants sent to 993 class members seeking the class members' experiences with customer walkouts and cash register shortages. Specifically, Defendants argue that because they received a low response rate to the survey, and because around 30% of respondents indicated they either could not remember or never had to pay for a customer walkout or cash register shortage, Plaintiff's claims are not typical of the claims of the class, and that individual questions predominate over common questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the questionnaire results do not defeat typicality or predominance. Plaintiff contends the data demonstrates that 95% of survey respondents who reported experiencing a customer walkout or cash register shortage indicated they were required to pay the restaurant for it, which demonstrates that Defendants enforced a common illegal policy. Plaintiff stresses that the fact that some tipped employees did not experience or have to pay for a customer walkout or cash register shortage is irrelevant to class certification; rather, that fact goes to damages. Plaintiff asserts that at best, the class definition should be modified to include only \"Defendants' Missouri servers and bartenders who paid for customer walkouts or cash register shortages.\" (Doc. # 275, p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Missouri law does not specifically contemplate \"decertification\" of a class certified under Rule 23.
