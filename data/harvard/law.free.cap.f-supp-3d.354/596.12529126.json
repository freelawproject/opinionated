The Third Circuit has held that sexual orientation does not form the basis for a claim of sex discrimination under Title VII. Plaintiff invites me to hold otherwise, effectively contravening that precedent. Despite the powerful appeal of Plaintiff's arguments, it is not my place to \"overrule\" a higher court. Accordingly, although I reject Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies, the controlling law in this circuit does not allow his hostile work environment\n   claim, which is based solely on sexual orientation discrimination. I must dismiss Count I and Count II, to the extent that it is based on sexual orientation discrimination, though such dismissal is without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Shaun Guess worked as an employee of Defendant, the Philadelphia Housing Authority, until August 31, 2017. Plaintiff served as a Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Coordinator beginning in November 2014, and he alleges that he was compensated less per year than three similarly situated female FSS Coordinators. Plaintiff made inquiries with supervisors about the reason for the pay disparity, but his concerns went unaddressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Throughout his employment with Defendant, Plaintiff claims that he was \"routinely assigned to lift boxes, carry water jugs, pick up bookbags, or perform more manual, labor-intensive tasks, instead of the female employees.\" Pl.'s First Am. Compl. 4, ECF No. 14. In vernacular terms, Plaintiff was asked to perform stereotypically male tasks. In one such instance, on July 26, 2017, a supervisor told Plaintiff to pick up heavy bookbags. When Plaintiff objected, the supervisor called Plaintiff a \"fucking faggot\" (hereinafter \"f---ing f-----\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiff is not in fact homosexual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same day, Plaintiff approached the Director and Executive Vice President, Mr. Myles, about the incident. Myles purportedly asked Plaintiff whether he really wanted to file a complaint and told him to be sure that was what he wanted to do. The following day, Plaintiff wrote a memo regarding the incident, which he sent to Myles. Plaintiff met with Human Resources personnel on August 27, 2017, and they informed him that, while his complaint may establish a violation of Defendant's General Regulations of Behavior, it did not establish an EEO violation. On September 8, 2017, after Plaintiff had terminated his employment with Defendant, he received a formal letter confirming this assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Guess received text messages from the supervisor who called him a f---ing f----- twice after he reported the incident. On August 2, 2017, she sent a message suggesting that Plaintiff could have talked to her personally about the incident and warning him to watch who he spoke to. On September 6, 2017, she expressed shock at his handling of the situation. The message stated in part, \"[a]ll of this over something you started...yeah I slipped and said you were acting a certain way and I apologized for it but for you to go this far!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. She also threatened to reveal untrue information about Plaintiff and stated, \"[y]ou're not even gay to be that hurt that I said your [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] acting that way...I'm beyond hurt!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or around his last day of employment with Defendant, August 31, 2017, another female coworker approached Plaintiff and stated, in reference to the incident on July 26, 2017, \"I don't know if you are or you aren't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The same female coworker had, previously in 2017, said, \"[g]irl, please\" and \"[g]irl\" to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. He asked her not to call him a girl, and that incident also led to the involvement of Human Resources. Plaintiff ultimately resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 26, 2018, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Def.'s Mot. Dismiss, Ex. B, ECF No. 16. Plaintiff marked \"sex\" as the form of discrimination and noted the latest date of discrimination as July 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The section containing \"the particulars\" stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Guess was hired by the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) on or about June 19, 2014. During Mr. Guess' employment with PHA he transitioned to a\n   FSS Coordinator. Mr. Guess was compensated significantly less than similarly situated female FSS Coordinators. Also, Mr. Guess was routinely assigned to more manual labor and tasks, despite other female FSS Coordinators being ready, willing and available for those same labor intensive and less desirable tasks. (disparate treatment-sex/gender (a) pay and (b) job assignments). On July 27, 2017, a PHA manager called Mr. Guess a \"fucking faggot\" in front of his co-workers. PHA's treatment of Mr. Guess was severe and discriminatory, on August 31, 2017, Mr. Guess terminated his employment with PHA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, Complainant suffered discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff received a Notice of Right-to-Sue from the EEOC and timely instituted this civil action. Defendant now moves to dismiss Count I of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint in its entirety for failure to exhaust administrative remedies or for failure to state a claim and Count II, to the extent that it alleges discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation, for failure to state a claim.

Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's charge did not provide sufficient notice of allegations concerning sexual orientation discrimination or of any hostile work environment claim. I find no such defects in the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The allegations related to sexual orientation discrimination are well within the scope of the charge. The Plaintiff recounted an incident in which a supervisor directed a homophobic slur at him. Such facts would put any reasonable defendant on notice of claims involving sexual orientation, perceived or otherwise. Such allegations\n   certainly fall within the \"scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1234746\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/572/960/#p963\">\n    572 F.2d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is particularly true because the EEOC recognizes sexual orientation discrimination as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin v.

Pa. 2016). None of the allegations in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint are beyond the scope of an EEOC investigation based on Plaintiff's charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to the hostile work environment claim, the charge again sufficiently supported Plaintiff's allegations. Plaintiff's failure to mark the space for \"continuing action\" when he completed the form in February 2018 does not prevent the claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The failure to check a particular box on a charge form does not alone preclude the assertion of a claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1234746\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/572/960/#p963\">\n    572 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   966-67 ;\n   <em>\n    Lowenstein v.

Pa. 2011), and a hostile work environment claim does not necessarily require a \"continuing action\" because such allegations may be based on severe\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   pervasive conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moody v.

Plaintiff here alleged facts about his work environment beyond those related to compensation discrimination, including routine-i.e. regular or continuing-sex discrimination in job assignments and an incident in which a supervisor called him a homophobic slur. The charge indicated that Plaintiff experienced \"severe and discriminatory\" treatment based on his sex in violation of Title VII. This sufficiently put the Housing Authority on notice that Plaintiff was alleging severe or pervasive discrimination because of sex, as required for a hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275177\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/206/#p213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies, and I will not dismiss Count I on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. 12(b)(6) Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), as augmented by\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

A hostile work environment claim requires a plaintiff to \"establish that 1) the employee suffered intentional discrimination because of his/her sex, 2) the discrimination was severe or pervasive, 3) the discrimination detrimentally affected the plaintiff, 4) the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like circumstances, and 5) the existence of respondeat superior liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Moody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275177\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/206/#p213\">\n    870 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2017) (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mandel v.

The first prong, establishing discrimination \"because of\" sex or gender,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   presents the sole foundation for\n   Defendant's objections. The Housing Authority contends that Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim under Title VII fails because he alleges only discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which cannot constitute discrimination \"because of sex\" for purposes of Title VII as a matter of law. Because the Third Circuit has explicitly endorsed that view and for the reasons that follow, I must agree with Defendant that Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint has failed to state a viable hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Third Circuit has held that discrimination because of sexual orientation is not discrimination because of sex for Title VII purposes.\n   <em>\n    Bibby v. Phila.

I am not empowered to overrule that decision, although Plaintiff's arguments urging me to do so certainly warrant discussion, which I have reserved for the end of this opinion. Plaintiff has expressly alleged in Count I a claim of \"Hostile Work Environment/Harassment\n   <em>\n    Based on Perceived Sexual Orientation\n   </em>\n   ,\" and the First Amended Complaint does not identify an alternate basis for the hostile work environment sex discrimination claim. Pl.'s First Am. Compl. 3, ECF No. 14 (emphasis added). I must, therefore, grant the Motion to Dismiss Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff opposes dismissal on the ground that he has set forth a claim for gender stereotyping. He is correct as to the controlling law, but that is not how the complaint is formulated. As to the law, although the Third Circuit does not view Title VII sex discrimination as encompassing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, it does recognize gender stereotyping claims as a form of discrimination because of sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bibby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496746\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/257/#p261\">\n    260 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   262-63 ;\n   <em>\n    Prowel v.

That these arguments are persuasive to the EEOC, two circuit courts, and a number of federal district courts that Plaintiff cites, suggests they are worthy of the Third Circuit's consideration should it have the opportunity to revisit\n   <em>\n    Bibby\n   </em>\n   's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It will soon be two decades since the Third Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Bibby\n   </em>\n   .
