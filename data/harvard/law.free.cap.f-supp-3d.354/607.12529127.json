It is alleged that these crimes occurred over several years, involving twelve separate incidents. Defendant Romel Anthony was only involved in one of these incidents and was found guilty of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count Four), but was acquitted on the charge of using or possessing a firearm in furtherance of a federal crime pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (Count Five).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Anthony currently moves for acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial on Count Four, arguing that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial. He also asserts that the Government's use of historical cell-site location information (\"CSLI\") violated his Fourth Amendment rights, in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). For the following reasons,\n   Defendant Anthony's Motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 28, 2015, a federal grand jury returned a seventeen-count indictment charging Defendant Anthony and fifteen co-Defendants. The grand jury subsequently returned a thirty-count superseding indictment on May 26, 2016, charging the original sixteen defendants and adding four defendants. Six of the Defendants, Marcus Bowens, Michael Queen, Daniel Hayes, Jeffrey Bellamy, Eric Scott, and Louis Miller, eventually entered into cooperation plea agreements with the Government. Scott and Bowens testified on the Government's behalf against Defendant Anthony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both the original and superseding indictments charge a conspiracy \"[f]rom in or around September 2012 through on or about April 29, 2014,\" in violation of the Hobbs Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The superseding indictment describes eleven incidents as part of the conspiracy, as well as one independent incident, amounting to twelve total incidents. Only the details of one of the incidents are relevant to Defendant Anthony and the issues addressed in this Opinion: an attempt by Defendant Anthony and his cohorts to break into the home of a drug dealer and steal cocaine and/or drug proceeds (Counts Four and Five) (the \"Bristol Street\" Incident).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Anthony was tried separately\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for this incident and, on June 12, 2018, the jury convicted Defendant Anthony only on Count Four, attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 25, 2018, Defendant Anthony filed a post-verdict motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, arguing that the Government had presented insufficient evidence because the Government did not establish the existence of cocaine in the home. On July 2, 2018, Defendant Anthony filed a second post-verdict motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), where the Supreme Court held that the acquisition of CSLI constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, thereby requiring the Government to obtain a warrant supported by probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both of these Motions are now ripe for decision and, for the reasons discussed below, will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As noted above, Defendant Anthony was only involved in one of the incidents charged in the Superseding Indictment, referred to as \"Bristol Street.\" This incident occurred on September 11, 2012, wherein co-Defendants Smith, Jefferson, and Scott climbed the rooftop of a building on the 4300 block of North 5th Street in Philadelphia to conduct surveillance on a Bristol Street resident. Defendant Anthony and his co-Defendants had planned to break into the home of a drug dealer to steal drugs and/or drug proceeds. Defendant Anthony stayed on the ground and\n   acted as a lookout, along with co-Defendant Bowens. A search of the intended residence revealed a storage compartment where drugs and drug proceeds are typically stored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The thrust of Defendant Anthony's sufficiency argument is that no drugs and/or drug proceeds were found in the residence that the Government witnesses identified (437 Bristol Street). Defendant Anthony stresses that the residence actually searched was 433 Bristol Street. (Def.'s Mot. Acquittal 6/25/18 \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, ECF No. 1435.) As will be detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant Anthony was charged with attempted possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, which requires both intent and a substantial step toward the commission of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. Third Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction No. 6.21.841.A (2015). Thus, it is immaterial which residence-433 or 437 Bristol Street-had a storage compartment for drugs and/or drug proceeds, as long as the Government established the intent to attempt to possess drugs with the intent to distribute. In any case, because Defendant Anthony has raised a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, for completeness sake, I will recount here the evidence presented by the Government:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Philadelphia Lieutenant William Hill testified that, on September 11, 2012, based on a neighbor's observation of two men on the roof, he responded to a call regarding a possible burglary in progress on Bristol Street. (N.T. 6/4/18 at 28:21-13.) Hill observed two men on the roof: one male was wearing a gray hoodie and black pants, while the other man was wearing a gray hoodie and tan cargo pants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:22-30:16.) Hill observed both men wearing some type of mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:14-16.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Hill then observed the two men flee from the roof. (N.T. 6/4/18 at 36:6-16.) Hill drove toward that general location and observed three men, two of whom were wearing the same clothes that Hill had observed the two men on the roof wearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:3-18.) As he followed the men, he alerted his co-officers of his observations, who stopped, and eventually arrested, these males after the two were identified by Hill as the persons on the roof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:18-38:23.) The two men identified were Smith and Scott, and the third was Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:4-22.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. After the arrests of Smith, Scott, and Jefferson, Hill walked back toward Bristol Street, whereby he found a bag, containing cut clothing commonly used as a mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:4-42:23.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4. Hill informed Special Agent Jared Krzwyicki of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (\"ATF\"), who was also on the scene, that he had observed Scott and Smith carrying something in their hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:19-24.) Krzwyicki walked back toward Bristol Street, whereby he also found bags that contained cut t-shirt sleeves, which he knew was commonly used as a mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:1-17:21.) Krzwyicki also identified the two men in the gray hoodies as Smith and Scott, and the third man as Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:17-13:14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   5. Based on Hill's information that he saw Scott and Smith jump off a vending services building, Krzwyicki went to this building, spoke to the owner of the business, and conducted a walk-through of the building,\n   wherein he observed a broken window on the second floor. (N.T. 6/5/18 at 23:8-25:23.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   6. Co-Defendant Eric Scott testified as a cooperating witness for the Government. (N.T. 6/5/18 at 99:17-22, 102:23-113:12.) Scott identified Jefferson as one participant, stating that he had met Jefferson two-to-three years before the Bristol Street Incident when they were both incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115:9-116:6.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   7. Scott testified that he met Smith through Jefferson sometime during the summer of 2012. Scott identified Smith and a man by the name of \"Junior\" as participants in the Bristol Street Incident. Junior was an alias used by cooperating witness, Marcus Bowens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116:7-16, 124:7-21, 125:14-20.) Scott testified that Junior was present when he met Smith for the first time in the Summer of 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:15-129:14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   8. Scott detailed his involvement in the Bristol Street Incident, explaining that Jefferson and Smith contacted him regarding a \"job\" on September 10, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132:7-24.) That same night, Scott met with Jefferson, Smith, Junior, and \"Dame\" at Fifteenth Street and Lenox Street. Scott identified Defendant Anthony as \"Dame.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132:25-133:12.) During this meeting, Jefferson, Smith, Defendant Anthony, Junior, and Scott discussed the burglary plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136:10-137:16.) Jefferson, Smith, Scott, and Junior then drove to the target house on Bristol Street, where they discussed that Smith and Jefferson would climb onto the corner grocery store to reach the home's roof. Once on the roof, Smith and Jefferson would enter the targeted residence through the skylight, while Junior and Defendant Anthony stayed on the street using police scanners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:22-136:1; 137:17-21.) Jefferson and Smith informed Scott that the burglary would occur on September 11, 2012, based on their information that the homeowners would leave around 8:00 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140:4-141:4.) Scott testified that the goal of the burglary was to obtain \"a couple hundred thousand in cash as well as bricks of drugs,\" which he explained were kilograms of cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139:1-15.) Jefferson and Smith told Scott that these drugs were being stored in a closet inside of a trap floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139:16-23.) After leaving the home on Bristol Street, they went their separate ways, with the understanding that the entire group was to meet again around 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. on September 11, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143:8-22.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   9. Scott testified that he met Smith, Jefferson, Defendant Anthony, and Junior early in the morning of September 11, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143:23-144:16.) They briefly prepared for the burglary and Scott described that they had the following items: police scanners, zip ties, gloves, a bag, and face masks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144:17-145:12.) They then travelled to Bristol Street in separate vehicles: Scott drove his friend's truck, Smith drove a Chrysler 300, and Defendant Anthony drove a white van. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145:20-146:20.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   10. When they arrived at Bristol Street, Scott climbed the roof with Jefferson and Smith, while Defendant Anthony and Junior stayed on the street \"to stay in contact with Jefferson and Smith that way they\n   would know if the cops were - if a call came through that we were on the roof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146:18-147:16.) Defendant Anthony and Junior communicated with them on the roof using a cell phone and walkie talkie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147:17-22.) The three of them took turns sleeping on the roof. Later that morning, Jefferson woke Scott up on the roof and told him that \"a call had come through,\" which Scott explained meant that Defendant Anthony or Junior had called to tell them that the police were coming based on a call on the police scanner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151:3-153:22.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   11. Scott testified that he had used a mask to conceal his identity during the burglary, but had thrown it once they reached Lawrence Street. Scott identified the cut t-shirt sleeve that the Government had found and taken into custody as his mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:23-154:20.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   12. Co-Defendant Marcus Bowens also testified as a cooperating witness for the Government. (N.T. 6/7/18 at 59:12-14, 60:10-69:8.) Bowens identified Smith, Jefferson, and Scott as participants in the plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:12--71:25, 73:10-74:12, 88:12-89:20.) Bowens also identified Defendant Anthony as a participant, referring to him as \"Dame\" and stating that he knew Dame through Dame's stepson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:6-77:10.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   13. Bowens testified about his involvement in the Bristol Street Incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:11-15.) Bowens showed the jury the tattoo on his neck which was a symbol with \"J-r period, like Junior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:21-4.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   14. Bowens explained that he learned of the plan to burglarize the home to find drugs and money two or three weeks before September 11, 2012. Bowens learned from co-Defendants Smith and Woods that the man who lived at Bristol Street sold significant amounts of cocaine and stored the supply and money in his home. In the weeks leading up to September 11, 2012, Bowens, Smith, Woods, and Jefferson conducted surveillance of the home to identify when the man would routinely leave his home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:12-82:13.) Bowens stated that the plan was as follows: Scott, Jefferson, and Smith would climb up on the roof and break into the home through a skylight. Dame (Defendant Anthony), Woods, and Bowens were to serve as lookouts. Bowens was in charge of monitoring the police scanner, while Dame stood watch at the other corner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84:1-85:23.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   15. In the weeks leading up to September 11, 2012, Jefferson added Scott to the crew. During a meeting approximately one week before the Incident, Smith, Jefferson, Woods, Scott, Bowens, and Defendant Anthony met to discuss plans for the burglary. It was during this meeting that Bowens learned that Smith added Defendant Anthony to the job to serve as a lookout. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:14-83:20.) Bowens testified that the entire crew met again two more times before the Incident: the first meeting was close in time to the Bristol Street Incident and the second meeting was in the early morning hours of September 11, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:3-8.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   16. On September 11, 2012, Bowens met Smith, Jefferson, Defendant Anthony, and Scott around 4:00 a.m. Bowens explained that they prepared for the robbery by getting their clothes ready and gathering\n   a crowbar, ladder, and other items needed to commit the robbery. The five of them then went to Bristol Street and Smith drove a black 300 Chrysler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:14-93:15.) Once they arrived at Bristol Street, Bowens set up the police scanner to hear calls from the Philadelphia Police and observed Smith prepare his gun and put on a mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:16-94:11.) Smith, Jefferson, and Scott climbed up next to the restaurant and then climbed up onto the house. Defendant Anthony stayed as a lookout on Bristol Street and Fifth Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:12-96:3.) Bowens testified that he spoke with Smith and Defendant Anthony on a three-way call during this Incident (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97:12-99:13.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   17. Upon hearing a call on the police scanner that there were men on the roof at Bristol Street, Bowens alerted Smith of the call and helped Smith, Jefferson, and Scott flee. Bowens observed them jump off the roof, and walk past a police car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:4-104:10.) Bowens then drove to pick up Defendant Anthony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:11-12.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   18. Bowens identified the following items from the crime scene: Smith's black gun, Jefferson's silver and black gun, the two bags, a crowbar, and a t-shirt without sleeves, which he said was used as a mask. (N.T. 6/7/18 at 144:12-147:3.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   19. Scott identified the cut t-shirt sleeve that the Government had found and taken into custody as his mask. (N.T. 6/5/18 at 153:23-154:20.) When the Government showed Scott one of the guns that was found on September 11, 2012, Scott identified this gun as belonging to Smith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155:9-156:2.) Finally, Scott testified that he had used cell phone number 484-634-6830 during the Bristol Street Incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159:1-25.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   20. Philadelphia Police Officer Jose Cartagena similarly testified during trial that he responded to a call around 5:22 p.m. on September 11, 2012 from Javencia Lopez. (N.T. 6/5/18 at 35:11-36:1; 38:1-18.). Ms. Lopez told Cartagena that she was the owner of the bar on Fifth Street and Bristol Street. She had called the police because she was concerned about two bags that her employee's had found on the roof. 38:14-39:34.) Using the Government's photographs, Cartagena identified the bar on Bristol Street and Fifth Street. Cartagena explained that his partner went onto the roof of the bar and picked up two bags. These bags contained two firearms, a crowbar, a black t-shirt with its sleeves cut off, and a receipt from the Franklin Mills Mall. Cartagena identified these physical items and specified that the guns were loaded with live rounds and secured with rubber bands.

Special Agent David Krueger testified that he was an ATF agent who assisted with the larger conspiracy investigation and the Bristol Street Incident. (N.T. 6/7/18 at 3:1-6:6.) Krueger explained that he had conducted searches of residences, cellular\n   phones, electronic devices, and vehicles during the course of his investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:2-15.) Krueger described that he recovered Smith's Blackberry flip phone, Smith's iPhone, Jefferson's iPhone, and two of Woods' phones during the investigation of other incidents involved in this larger investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:16-17:3.) Krueger specifically testified about his effectuation of a search warrant for the Bristol Street Incident. His partner, Detective Morano, obtained a search warrant for 433 Bristol Street, which was based in part on Scott's information that this address contained a trapdoor for drug trafficking materials (among other evidence). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:4-21:12.) Krueger testified that, based on his experience and training, 433 Bristol Street was \"the most fortified residence [he had] ever encountered,\" which indicated illegal drug trafficking activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:14-26:20.) During the search, Kreuger found a trap compartment on the second floor of 433 Bristol Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:1-36:9.) Krueger also explained that 433 Bristol Avenue was close in proximity to where the persons were observed on the roof.

Philadelphia Police Officer John McKenna testified as an expert in the field of digital forensics. (N.T. 6/8/18 at 16:16-24:4.) McKenna testified that he conducted a digital analysis on the phones recovered by ATF agents belonging to Smith, Jefferson, and Woods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24:4-26:11.) Specifically, McKenna testified that he conducted digital analysis on Smith's cellphone with the number 215-617-8610 and wrote a report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:15-19.) In this report, McKenna testified that one of the contacts was listed as \"D\" for number 215-971-7033. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:14-37:4.) McKenna also introduced a series of text messages between Smith and Shaka Johnson, who was listed as \"Lawer / Family\" in Smith's contact list.

The evidence established that Defendant Anthony had the intent where he participated in the planning of the Bristol Street Incident, as well as a substantial step toward the commission of the offense by the attempted execution of this Incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, 12-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Government also sufficiently established the third element of \"an agreement to work toward the goal which the defendant knowingly joined\" through the testimony of Scott and Bowens that Defendant Anthony acted as a lookout as part of the plan to burglarize the home to steal money and drugs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Scott explained that he was recruited just prior to the Bristol Street Incident and met the leader Smith, and the other participants Jefferson, Defendant Anthony, and Bowens (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"Junior\") on Lenox Street the night before the burglary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On the morning of the burglary, all of the defendants and Defendant Anthony met on Lenox Street before departing in separate vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Scott explained that he, Jefferson, and Smith climbed on the roof to break into the target's home through a skylight. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Defendant Anthony and Bowens remained on the street to act as lookouts, communicating with the others on the roof using cell phones and monitoring scanners to alert them of police activity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Scott testified that they were unable to break into the home because a call had come through on the police scanner and they had to jump off the roof. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Bowens similarly implicated Defendant Anthony as the lookout. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-16.) Bowens was involved in the plan from the early planning stages and testified that he learned of Defendant Anthony's involvement about a week prior to the Bristol Street Incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15.) Bowens explained that he observed Smith describe the plan to Defendant Anthony, instructing that Defendant Anthony would be the lookout. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Bowens explained that he, Smith, Jefferson, Defendant Anthony, and Scott discussed the details of their plan at a second meeting before September 11, 2012. On the morning of September 11, 2012, the participants met on Lenox Street to prepare for the burglary and then departed for Bristol Street. Bowens testified that he and Defendant Anthony remained on the ground as lookouts while Smith, Jefferson, and Scott went onto the roof. Bowens explained that Scott, Smith, and Jefferson were unable to break into the home because he heard a call over the police scanner and alerted them that the police were on their way. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The testimony given by Bowens and Scott was also corroborated by physical evidence of two bags, two guns, a crowbar, and masks, as well as DNA evidence that linked Smith to one of the firearms recovered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.) Special Agent Krueger explained that he searched 433 Bristol Street and found a trap compartment on the second floor, which confirmed the planned purpose of stealing drugs and/or drug proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government also introduced cell phone records from phones recovered by ATF agents belonging to Smith, Jefferson, and Woods. These phone records further corroborated the testimony and physical evidence by showing a series of calls between Defendant Anthony and the co-Defendants during the time of the Bristol Street Incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) Additionally, Special Agent Sonnendecker explained that he analyzed the CSLI for the phones of Smith and Jefferson, which showed that Smith and Jefferson were in the general area of Bristol Street and Fifth Street during the time of the Bristol Street Incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant Anthony asserts that there was insufficient evidence because the Government did not find evidence of drugs in the home burglarized. However, Defendant Anthony's claim confuses the elements of the crime that the Government was required to prove at trial. As explained above, the Government only had to prove \"attempt.\" Thus, it is inconsequential that the Government did not present evidence of drugs because the existence of illicit substances is not one of the requisite elements of \"attempt.\" As described in detail above, the location of the home that the Defendants intended to burglarize was consistently identified by Scott, Bowens, Hill, and Krzwyicki. Moreover, the Government presented substantial physical evidence that corroborated the witnesses' testimony, including photographs, guns, crowbars, masks, CSLI, and call records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Defendant Anthony's pending Motion filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
