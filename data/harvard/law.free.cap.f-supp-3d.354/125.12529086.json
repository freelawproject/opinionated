Iannucci commenced this action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Ulster County, on February 12, 2016, alleging breach of contract after Defendant Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\") denied his claim for coverage of the roof collapse of his building located at 221 Catherine Street in Kingston, New York. (Dkt. No. 2). On March 30, 2016, Allstate removed this action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York based on diversity of citizenship under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. No. 1). On June 19 and 20, 2018, the Court held a two-day bench trial in Albany, New York, at which six fact witnesses and four expert witnesses testified. (Dkt. Nos. 94-95). Both parties have submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. (Dkt. Nos. 96, 97, 99, 101). The Court has carefully considered the trial record, the credibility of the witnesses at trial, and the submissions of the parties. In accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the\n   Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. 221 Catherine Street Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, Plaintiff purchased a parcel of land together with a building located at 221 Catherine Street in Kingston, New York. (T. 96-97). The three-story building was a multi-family residential brick structure, built in approximately 1870, with a wood-framed gable roof topped with asphalt shingles. (Ex. P-3, at 1; D-12, at 000536; Ex. D-35, at 2). Plaintiff testified that he paid $125,000 for the property. (T. 96, 391). No one resided in the building at the time Plaintiff purchased the property or afterward; Plaintiff testified that he intended to use the building as an anchor structure for a larger residential project. (T. 97, 103-104, 139). Plaintiff disconnected the building from electric, gas, and water utility lines; removed the bathrooms and kitchens; and boarded up the first-story doors and windows. (T. 97, 106, 151).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The building was not well maintained. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , T. 100-03, 190, 206; Ex. D-28(a)-(c) ). Plaintiff testified that, other than occasional exterior inspections and lawn work, he did not perform or have any work performed on the building between 2005 and 2014. (T. 113, 141, 150-151). One long-time neighbor described the building as \"abandoned,\" \"condemned,\" and deteriorating. (T. 190). Photos of the property from 2012, obtained from Google Street View, show damage to the bricks, mortar, gutters, and fascia of the building, as well as a small tree growing at the roofline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. D-28(a)-(c) ). Between 2011 and 2013, the Kingston Fire Department (the \"KFD\") issued multiple zoning/ordinance violation notices ordering Plaintiff to make various improvements to the building and property. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. D-11; D-12 (May 23, 2012 violation notice stating that building was \"abandoned and [no] work being done to maintain the building\" and that \"[t]here is a tree growing out of the roof\"); D-13 (May 6, 2011 violation notice stating that the \"entire exterior of the building is in need of repairs including the siding, soffits, fascias, windows and doors\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One such violation notice, issued on October 17, 2013, stated that \"the roof on your house needs to be replaced\" and warned Plaintiff that \"[f]ailure to begin work\" to remedy the violation would result in a fine. (Ex. D-11). Plaintiff responded by writing to KFD Deputy Fire Chief David Allen, explaining that he had \"done nothing to the property\" since receiving the notice and that he believed there were \"good reasons to allow the property to remain in its present condition.\" (Ex. D-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff testified that, shortly after receiving the notice, he contacted Ian Horowitz of J &amp; A Roofing to inspect the roof. (T. 111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Horowitz did not testify at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Horowitz testified at deposition that he inspected the roof in October 2013 by climbing a ladder to check the condition of the shingles and by accessing the attic to view the supporting elements beneath. (Ex. P-17, at 15-17). He testified that the asphalt shingles of the roof were loose and worn, but that, as viewed from the attic, the underlying structure-the decking, joists, and rafters-were sound with no sagging, bent, or rippling areas in the ceiling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 21-23). That testimony is not consistent with the photographic evidence and the credible testimony of the Defendant's engineer, its claims adjuster, and its architectural and roofing expert. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. 256-57, 269-70, 337-38, 377-79). The Court, therefore, does not credit Mr. Horowitz's testimony regarding the state of the roof in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff testified that, as a result of Mr. Horowitz's inspection, he intended to replace the shingles-but not the rafters, decking, or other underlying structural elements of the roof-at the end of the winter \"when the weather would be more friendly.\" (T. 112). Before any such work was performed, however, the roof collapsed during a snowstorm on February 21, 2014. (Ex. P-1, at 000355; Ex. D-16, at 001399-401).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Allstate Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From the time he purchased the Catherine Street building in 2005, Plaintiff insured the property under Allstate's \"New York Landlords Package Policy\" (the \"Policy\"). (Ex. D-1, at 000677). The Policy provides a maximum of $103,000 in dwelling protection coverage and up to an additional 5% of that amount, or $5,150, for debris removal following a covered loss. (Ex. D-1, at 000645-46, 000682). The Policy states that \"[l]oss to property insured by this policy ... will be settled on an actual cash value basis,\" and specifies, in relevant part, that \"[p]ayment will not exceed the smallest of: (a) the actual cash value of the damaged [or] destroyed ... property at the time of loss; (b) the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged [or] destroyed ... property with other of like kind and quality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000663; T. 225-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Policy under which the Catherine Street property was insured contains both \"all-risk\" coverages-meaning coverage for any loss or cause of loss, except those expressly excluded from coverage-and named-peril coverages that extend protection only to losses caused by specific risks. (T. 227-29). To that end, \"Coverage A\"-the all-risk section of the Policy-extends coverage to an insured's \"dwelling, including attached structures, at the residence premises.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ex. D-1, at 000674). The Policy\n   states that Allstate \"will cover sudden and accidental direct physical loss\" to such structures, \"except as limited or excluded\" in the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000675). Under the heading \"Losses We Do Not Cover Under Coverages A and B,\" the Policy lists twenty-three exclusions, and explains that Allstate does \"not cover loss ... consisting of, or caused by,\"\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Enforcement of any building codes ... regulating the ... demolition of any building structure....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   7. The failure of an insured person to take all reasonable steps to save and preserve property when the property is endangered by a cause of loss we cover.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   12. Collapse of a building structure or any part of a building structure, except as specifically provided in Section I-Additional Protection under item [6],\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Collapse.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   15. (a) Wear and tear, aging, ... deterioration ... or latent defect; ... (c) Growth of trees, shrubs, [or] plants ...; (d) Rust or other corrosion, mold, wet or dry rot; ... (g) Settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion of ... walls, floors, roofs or ceilings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   23. [F]aulty, inadequate or defective: ... (d) maintenance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00675-78). Subsection 24 of the \"Losses We Do Not Cover\" exclusion section contains a predominant cause exclusion, which states that, in the event that \"there are two or more causes of loss to the covered property\" and the \"predominant cause(s) of loss is (are) excluded,\" Allstate will not cover the loss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000678).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to all-risk coverage subject to specified exclusions, the Policy also contains a \"Section I-Additional Protection\" section listing named-perils covered beyond those encompassed by Coverages A, B, and C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000682). These \"Additional Protection[s]\" include, for example, the cost of removing debris resulting from a covered loss and certain specified collapses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; T. 227). The collapse provision in the \"Additional Protection\" section (\"Additional Protection 6\") provides that Allstate \"will cover: (a) the entire collapse of a covered building structure; (b) the entire collapse of part of a covered building structure; and (c) direct physical loss to covered property caused by (a) or (b) above.\" (Ex. D-1, at 000682). For such coverage to apply, however, the Policy specifies that any such collapse must \"be a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by one or more\" of six named causes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In relevant part, these causes include \"(b) hidden decay of the building structure [or] ... (e) weight of rain or snow which collects on a roof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000682-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Allstate's Denial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 3, 2013, the KFD issued a \"violation notice and order to remedy,\" directing Plaintiff to demolish the Catherine Street building because the \"roof ha[d] collapsed[,] causing an unsafe environment to the safety of the public.\" (Ex. D-16, at 001403). Multiple documents in the City of Kingston's \"street file\" on the Catherine Street property indicated that the collapse of the roof was caused by \"heavy accumulation\n   of snow,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 001399), or \"accumulation of heavy snow,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 001401).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff notified Allstate of the collapse on March 4, 2014; Allstate began its investigation of the collapse immediately thereafter, scheduling an inspection of the Catherine Street property for March 7, 2014. (T. 233; Ex. P-1, at 000355). John Kirk, an Allstate claims adjuster,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   traveled to the property sometime in early March 2014, where he observed and photographed extensive damage to the building. (T. 251-52; Ex. D-5, at 000363-80). He noted flaking brick and mortar, water damage, burned rafters, and a tree growing out of the roof, among other indicators of \"long-term deterioration.\" (T. 252-58). Morris Reid, who performed a property inspection and valuation assessment for EFI Global at Allstate's request, testified that the building was poorly maintained and that he observed charred rafters, a tree growing in the mortar near the roofline, cracks in brickwork, and uneven settling of the foundation walls. (T. 318-23, 327). Mr. Reid's March 31, 2014 property condition assessment attributed the collapse to weakening from deterioration that caused the roof to fail under the weight of snow. (Ex. D-6, at 000542). In his assessment, Mr. Reid estimated that, assuming that no snow melted in February 2014 due to constantly below-freezing temperatures, there would have been approximately 37.5 inches of snow on the roof at the time of the collapse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000552).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 22, 2014, Allstate denied Plaintiff's claim based on the conclusion of Mr. Reid's EFI Global report that the \"cause of the roof collapse [was] ... a lack of adequate and timely maintenance that resulted in hidden and long term deterioration of the roof rafters, decking and inadequate restraint for the lateral thrust at the ends of the rafters.\" (Ex. D-6, at 000539 (Reid's March 2014 report);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-2, at 000588 (Allstate's denial of coverage letter using same language) ). According to the denial letter, the weakness resulting from Plaintiff's failure to maintain the roof ultimately caused \"the rafters to fail under snow load conditions well below that which the building framing should have been designed and constructed to withstand.\" (Ex. D-2, at 000588). In support of its conclusion that Plaintiff's claim was excluded from coverage, Allstate cited several Policy provisions excluding losses caused by or consisting of enforcement of\n   building codes, failure to preserve property endangered by a covered loss, wear and tear, and inadequate maintenance, among others. (D-2, at 000586-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 5, 2014, Plaintiff requested that Allstate reconsider its denial and review a May 2, 2014 report authored by Timothy Lynch, a structural engineer, regarding the cause of the collapse. (T. 233-34). Mr. Lynch's report stated that, upon inspection of the collapsed roof, he concluded that the \"loss was the result of a collapse of a portion of the structure caused by the weight of snow or hidden damage.\" (Ex. P-3, at 2). Allstate reviewed Lynch's report but reaffirmed its denial on May 15, 2014, (Ex. D-3), and issued a final determination of denial on October 15, 2014, (Ex. D-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Cause of the Collapse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At trial, all of the witnesses who gave testimony relevant to the issue expressed similar theories as to the mechanics of the collapse. The consensus view, generally stated, was that: (i) under the weight of the snow, the top plates\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (and/or the rafters' or joists' connection thereto) failed; (ii) this failure allowed the decking and rafters to slide outward, pushing them out over the brick walls of the building; (iii) as the decking slid outward, the ridge of the roof collapsed downward, flattening across the top of the exterior walls of the building. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. 30-31 (Lynch), 254-55 (Kirk), 338 (Reid), 379-80 (Cannon);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-9, at 000868).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Plaintiff and Allstate's witnesses diverged in their opinions as to contributing factors, including hidden decay, deterioration due to lack of maintenance, or some combination thereof, each witness who testified to the issue agreed that the collapse was caused, at least in part, by the weight of the snow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's expert structural engineer, Timothy Lynch, testified that he inspected the Catherine Street building in April 2014 after the roof collapsed. (T. 24). Mr. Lynch stated that the weakening in the roof structure was \"likely wood rot or deterioration from water intrusion,\" and also that he observed fire damage to the rafters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (T. 37, 50-51). He testified that he observed a \"tree or bush\" that appeared to be rooted \"at the top of the masonry wall.\" (T. 36). On direct examination, Mr. Lynch opined that any deterioration of the top plate would have been \"underneath the roof and the roofing\" and therefore \"would not have been visible.\" (T. 30-31). According to Mr. Lynch, the roof \"was weakened from hidden damage such that the load imposed by ... the snow[ ] was able to initiate the collapse.\" (T. 30-31). He concluded that, although the roof \"may or may not have been in a weakened condition,\" he observed \"no other indication of any ... cause\" for the collapse other than the weight of snow. (T. 30-31). The Court notes that while some of the deterioration, including the fire damage, may have been hidden, the tree growing out of the building since at least 2012, with inevitable resulting water penetration, was not. Nor was the damage to the gutter and fascia board, cited in a 2011 violation and visible in 2012 Google Street View photos, \"hidden.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's roofing expert, Ian Horowitz, was the only witness who testified that he observed the condition of the roof and its supporting elements before the collapse on February 21, 2014. (Ex. P-17, at 15-22). Following the collapse, he reported observing \"classic signs of collapse by live load,\" including \"[c]racked and split rafters as well as main ridge pole and beams completely severed due to weight.\" (Ex. P-2). Based on his pre- and post-collapse observations of the roof, Mr. Horowitz opined that, despite some deterioration, \"the only factor involved\" in the collapse of the roof was \"heavy snow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Since, however, the Court does not credit Mr. Horowitz's testimony regarding his pre-collapse inspection, the Court does not credit his opinion regarding the cause of the roof collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court credits the testimony of the Defendant's witnesses on this issue. John Kirk, the property adjuster assigned to Plaintiff's claim, testified that, although the snow may have been the triggering event, the building had deteriorated to the point that \"it was inevitable that this building was goin[g] to collapse ... a bird could have done it, too, by landin[g] on it.\" (T. 258). He testified that the wooden structural components of the roof showed indications of long-term exposure to the elements and described their condition as \"almost like a piece of driftwood, it [was] just crumbly.\" (T. 259). Morris Reid testified that his inspection of the property revealed that all aspects of the building, not just the roof, were inadequately maintained and structurally impaired. (T. 321-26). Mr. Reid stated that this lack of maintenance led to deterioration of the roof over time, until the \"roof was in a condition [such that] it would not support the snow load for which it was originally designed.\" (T. 328). Although Mr. Reid stated that he believed the roof \"collapsed because of the weight of the snow,\" he further testified that it \"collapsed under snow load conditions far below which it should have been designed to withstand\" due to \"inadequate maintenance of the roofin[g] systems.\" (T. 338). Finally, Herbert Cannon, Allstate's architectural and roofing expert, concluded that, although \"the presence of the snow load is what caused the structure to give,\" (T. 369), there \"was enough damage to the structure\" that \"it was inevitable that ... the roof would have collapsed.\" (T. 382). Mr. Cannon noted that, over the course of its\n   lifetime, the roof repeatedly withstood the weight of snow without collapsing; thus prompting him to conclude that \"something was going on there that deteriorated the structure to allow the collapse.\" (T. 381).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the evidence presented at trial demonstrates that the claimed loss is within coverage because it consisted of a sudden collapse caused by the weight of snow and/or hidden decay. (Dkt. No. 96, at 26, 29-30). Allstate, on the other hand, argues that Plaintiff failed to carry his burden of proving any of the requisite elements under the Policy, (Dkt. No. 97, at 58), and that, in any event, it carried its own burden of proving that the collapse was predominantly attributable to an excluded cause, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

D-16, at 001401). It was not until March 3, 2014-more than a week later-that the City of Kingston determined that the roofless structure was a public hazard, at risk of additional collapse. (Ex.

He did not see \"anything that indicated that the brick\" load bearing walls \"failed in any way.\" (T. 70-71). He determined that the building was structurally sound enough to support their weight, went inside the building, and walked up to the second floor. (T. 27, 44). The Court credits the testimony of Mr. Cannon, Defendant's architect, who testified that \"[f]rom the outside of the building it looked like it could be saved.\" (T. 384). Mr. Cannon noted that \"you would have to have a structural evaluation\" to \"find out the condition of the floor supports and of the brick on the inside,\" but estimated that there was \"better than a 50/50 chance that it would be salvageable.\" (T. 384). Mr. Cannon further noted that, while a structural engineer would have to evaluate the building, the walls were three bricks wide, and where some of the brick had peeled off \"the rest of the wall was intact.\" (T. 383-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On the other hand, other witnesses-including Deputy Fire Chief Tiano and Defendant's expert electrical engineer, Mr. Reid-testified that it was not safe to enter\n   the building. (T. 207, 303). In his property assessment, Mr. Reid identified significant deficiencies in the foundation and the external structural frame of the building; he noted that the property had exceeded its useful life and should be demolished. (P-6, at 538, 541).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In any event, the Court need not decide whether there was an \"entire collapse\" under an expanded definition of that term because, as discussed below, Plaintiff failed to prove that any structural impairment of the building that might constitute an \"entire collapse\" occurred \"suddenly\" or as a result of a coverage-triggering event, such as the weight of snow. The Court thus finds that there was an \"entire collapse of\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of a covered building structure\"-the roof-within the meaning of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Instead, the evidence at trial established that the building's structural impairment was caused by long-term deterioration and predated the February 21, 2014 collapse of the roof. The Court credits the testimony of Timothy Lynch, John Kirk, and Herbert Cannon, all of whom explained how the deterioration of the roof, including the presence of the tree at the roofline, resulted in water damage to the walls of the building structure over time before the collapse. (T. 48, 255-58, 261, 265, 374-75). John Kirk pointed to disintegrating bricks as an indication that, before the roof collapsed, the building's \"structural integrity was already compromised.\" (T. 284-85). Morris Reid's property condition assessment also noted structural damage to the building that predated the collapse of the roof, including \"structural cracks in the sidewall\" superstructure and \"deteriorated masonry pointing and loose bricks.\" (Ex. P-6, at 000538). He further identified cracked bricks in the fa\u00e7ade reflecting \"deterioration over time\" that was \"totally\n   unrelated to the roof collapse.\" (T. 321, 327). Furthermore, the Court credits Mr. Reid's testimony that the absence of gutters and drains resulted in erosion of soil surrounding the base of the building structure, causing \"differential settlement of the foundation walls.\" (T. 322-23). Mr. Reid's assessment concluded that \"the cracked foundation wall[,] when taken into consideration with the age of the building, [has] no structural value in [its] current condition and should be demolished in its entirety.\" (Ex. P-6, at 000538). While Mr. Reid testified that \"some part\" of the building structure \"was compromised\" because of the roof collapse, (T. 362), the evidence did not reflect what that \"part\" was and whether it was substantial enough to constitute an \"entire collapse\" of the building. Based on the credible trial testimony and photographic evidence, the Court finds that extensive water damage compromised the structural integrity of the building over time, long before the roof collapsed. Accordingly, the Court finds that, while the collapse of the\n   <em>\n    roof\n   </em>\n   was sudden, any purported \"entire collapse\" of the\n   <em>\n    building structure\n   </em>\n   was not.

There was, however, no evidence indicating how the City of Kingston concluded that the building required demolition one week after reporting that the building appeared stable and unlikely\n   to collapse further. There was no evidence showing that the building sustained any distinct, demonstrable, physical alteration or change in condition as a result of the collapse of the roof. The 2012 Google Street View photographs indicate that, before the collapse, the condition of the building's exterior and foundation was poor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-28(a)-(c) ). Mr. Reid's assessment noted \"significant signs of cracking or movement\" in the foundation walls indicating \"excessive settlement or an improperly-installed foundation system.\" (Ex. P-6, 000538). Mr. Kirk testified that he observed \"pervasive damage\" to the building that predated the collapse of the roof, (T. 265), including cracked and disintegrated bricks resulting from \"long-term weather exposure,\" (T. 260-62). Mr. Kirk further testified that, during his inspection of the building, he was specifically examining \"how much was damaged by this collapse.\" (T. 258).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Both the interior and exterior of the building were in poor condition after the collapse. (Ex. D-6, at 000602-04). But Plaintiff failed to prove what new damage or additional impairment-beyond the destruction of the roof-was directly caused by the collapse. For example, Mr. Lynch testified that the extent of the roof collapse was limited \"to the attic level or the ceiling joists at the top of the masonry walls.\" (T. 26). Photographs included in Mr. Reid's property assessment show that the decking of the roof slid outward, lying flat on top of the masonry walls of the building. (Ex. D-6, at 000569). Having considered all of the evidence and the credibility of all of the witnesses, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to prove that the collapse of the roof caused additional damage that might have arguably been within coverage, such as new damage to the building's interior, superstructure, or foundation; the development of water damage that was not there previously; or damage to property inside the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

That clause provides that Allstate does \"not cover loss to covered property ... when: (a) there are two or more causes of loss to the covered property; and (b) the predominant cause(s) of loss is (are) excluded\" from coverage. (Ex. D-1, at 000678). Allstate carries the burden of showing that an exclusion applies, and argues that, \"[u]nder\n   <em>\n    Fabozzi\n   </em>\n   , if Allstate is able to show that an excluded peril was the predominant cause of the collapse, Allstate will win.\" (Dkt.

(T. 344-45).

The tree remained in place after the roof collapse. (Ex. D-6, at 000595; T. 78-79). Accordingly, the Court does not credit Mr. Iannucci's testimony that the tree was growing from a gutter. The tree was either rooted in the masonry wall of the building, as both parties' engineers testified, (T. 36, 79, 304, 309), or somewhere inside the attic itself, as the Allstate claims adjuster testified, (T. 286).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \"Soffits\" are the undersides of the eves overhanging a building's exterior wall; fascia are exterior boards running along the roofline, to which gutters are typically attached.
