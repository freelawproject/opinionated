Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's rejection of Plaintiff's medical school application constitutes discrimination on the basis of her race, gender, national origin, and ancestry; that Defendant created a hostile educational environment; and that Defendant rejected Plaintiff in retaliation after Plaintiff submitted a discrimination complaint. The First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") alleges four Counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    Count I\n   </strong>\n   : Violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VI\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, by discriminating against Plaintiff on the basis of her race (Caucasian), sex (female), national origin (American), and ancestry (European); creating a hostile educational environment; and/or retaliating against Plaintiff for registering a complaint of discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Count II\n   </strong>\n   : Violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), by discriminating against Plaintiff on the basis of her sex (female), creating a hostile educational environment, and/or retaliating against Plaintiff for registering a complaint of discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Count III\n   </strong>\n   : Violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by discriminating against Plaintiff on the basis of her race (Caucasian) and creating a hostile educational environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Count IV\n   </strong>\n   : Violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by retaliating against Plaintiff for registering a complaint of race discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Presently before this Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss all Counts of the Complaint. For the reasons discussed below, the Motion to Dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, the factual background is as follows. Plaintiff is a twenty-two-year-old female who graduated from Princeton University in June 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. (ECF 8, First Am. Compl., \"FAC\" \u00b6 7.) She is a citizen of New Jersey and resides in Mullica Hill, New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Defendant is a non-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, at all times relevant to this action, has maintained its place of business in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While Plaintiff attended Princeton, she aspired to pursue a career in medicine and majored in Neuroscience in furtherance of that goal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff also held various jobs and participated in numerous extracurricular and volunteer activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) For example, Plaintiff served as a Math Teaching Assistant and Tutor, worked as a counselor at Stanford University during a summer vacation, organized an annual fashion show to raise awareness for Autism, volunteered at a local animal\n   shelter, served as Princeton's Preview Host, and volunteered with United for Sight and PrinceTHON. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff also maintained high marks in her Neuroscience major. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff researched various medical schools and ultimately decided to pursue a career at Defendant's Sidney Kimmel Medical College (\"Jefferson\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff scored in the 82nd percentile nationally on the Medical College Admission Test (\"MCAT\"), which was \"well-within the range of those students previously admitted to Jefferson.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about August 10, 2016, Plaintiff learned that Defendant's Director of Admissions, Dr. Brooks, would be visiting Princeton's campus on August 11, 2016 to discuss Jefferson with prospective applicants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff was excited to discover that she would be the only student attending Dr. Brooks's presentation, so it would be a one-on-one meeting where she would have the opportunity to express her interest in Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about August 11, 2016, Plaintiff attended the meeting with Dr. Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Dr. Brooks immediately inquired into Plaintiff's ethnicity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) After informing Dr. Brooks that she was Caucasian, Dr. Brooks asked if Plaintiff was sure and suggested that Plaintiff obtain an expensive genetic test to see if she could qualify as Native American or American Indian to garner better chances of being accepted to Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Brooks informed Plaintiff that she advised a past Caucasian applicant to obtain a genetic test, that the applicant learned that he was partially African American, and that he was accepted into Jefferson on account of his race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Dr. Brooks also informed Plaintiff that she would gain admission to Jefferson in the incoming medical school class if she were African American, rather than Caucasian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff attempted to steer the conversation to a more appropriate subject by asking about Jefferson's JeffHOPE program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) In response, Dr. Brooks informed Plaintiff that she could get information about the program on Jefferson's website, and then proceeded to ask Plaintiff if she could give her \"maternal advice\" about how to \"take her 'mess' and turn it into admission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Dr. Brooks insinuated that Plaintiff's \"status\" as a Caucasian, European, American was a \"mess\" incapable of admission to Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff again tried to move the conversation away from her national origin, ancestry, and race, asking about Jefferson's mentorship programs for first-generation college students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Dr. Brooks responded, \"Oh! You are a first generation, that's why you're at Princeton,\" insinuating that Plaintiff's high SAT scores and status as Valedictorian of her high school would not warrant admission to Princeton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Dr. Brooks continued to assert that Plaintiff should attempt to discover if her family was somehow related to a minority group, Plaintiff again responded that she was a Caucasian, European, American who could not qualify as Native American or a member of any other minority group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Brooks suggested that Plaintiff pursue a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (\"DO\") instead of a Doctor of Medicine (\"MD\") degree, stating that a DO \"is not bad unless you plan on marrying off and living in a foreign country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In response to this \"sexist remark,\" Plaintiff stated that she aspired to pursue an MD, after which Dr. Brooks proposed that\n   Plaintiff withdraw all of her applications to medical schools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Plaintiff stated that she did not intend to withdraw her applications, Dr. Brooks \"abruptly\" ended the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On or about August 15, 2016, Plaintiff emailed Allison Smith, Princeton's Health Professions Advisor, to express her concern about Dr. Brooks's \"discriminatory commentary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Plaintiff met with Ms. Smith to recount Dr. Brooks's remarks on or about August 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Ms. Smith had not taken any steps to address Plaintiff's concerns, on August 20, 2016, Plaintiff contacted Michele Minter, Vice Provost of Equity at Princeton, to register another complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) On or about August 23, 2016, Plaintiff met with Ms. Minter to discuss her meeting with Dr. Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) During that meeting, Ms. Minter told Plaintiff that she would not assist her further because Princeton did not want to \"burn bridges\" with Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, on or about August 27, 2016, Plaintiff emailed a detailed complaint to Clara Callahan, Jefferson's Dean of Students and Admissions, articulating the \"discriminatory behavior\" of Dr. Brooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) On November 28, 2016, Plaintiff received a rejection letter from Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff filed the original Complaint in this case on August 13, 2018 (ECF 1). On September 14, 2018, the parties stipulated that Defendant's time to file an answer, motion, or otherwise respond to the Complaint was extended to September 28, 2018 (ECF 6). Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss on September 28, 2018 (ECF 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") on October 12, 2018 (ECF 8), after which the Court denied Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the original Complaint as moot (ECF 12). Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint on October 15, 2018 (ECF 9, \"MTD\"). Plaintiff filed a Response on October 29, 2018 (ECF 10, \"Resp.\"), and Defendant filed a Reply on November 5, 2018 (ECF 11, \"Rep.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendant contends that the Complaint must be dismissed for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's hostile educational environment claims under Title VI (Count I), Title IX (Count II), and Section 1981 (Count III) must be dismissed because Plaintiff was never a Jefferson student. (MTD at 5.) Defendant points out that there are no precedential judicial decisions suggesting that an applicant, as opposed to a student, can state a hostile educational environment claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant recommends that the Court refer to Supreme Court precedent addressing hostile environment claims under Title VI for guidance, and notes that judges within the Third Circuit have applied such precedent to hostile environment claims under Title IX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Similarly, Defendant recommends that the Court follow cases within and outside of the Third Circuit rejecting Title VII hostile work environment claims brought by applicants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Defendant avers that Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory rejection pursuant to Title VI (Count I), Title IX (Count II), and Section 1981 (Count III) fail as a matter of law because the Complaint does not allege that Plaintiff was qualified for admission to Jefferson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) According to Defendant, Plaintiff's sole allegation that her MCAT Score \"was well within the range of those students\n   <em>\n    previously admitted\n   </em>\n   to Jefferson\" fails to demonstrate that Plaintiff's scores were within the range of students admitted to Jefferson in 2016, the year that Plaintiff applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12) (quoting FAC \u00b6 31).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VI (Count I), Title IX (Count II), and Section 1981 (Count IV) must be dismissed because there is no causal connection between Plaintiff filing a discrimination complaint-the alleged protected activity-and the denial of her application to Jefferson, as the three-month gap between the two events is not sufficient to establish causation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fourth, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's Title VI sex discrimination claim (Count I) must be dismissed because Title VI does not prohibit sex discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Defendant further avers that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of national origin or ancestry discrimination under Title VI because the Complaint only alleges that Plaintiff \"believes\" that Jefferson's decision to deny her admission was based on her national origin and ancestry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) According to Defendant, Plaintiff must allege that similarly situated applicants outside of her protected class, such as non-Americans, were admitted to Jefferson in 2016, and Plaintiff fails to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Fifth, Plaintiff's Title IX claim (Count II) must be dismissed, Defendant argues, because the Complaint does not allege any facts demonstrating gender bias. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, Defendant avers that the Complaint makes a conclusory allegation that Jefferson rejected Plaintiff's application because of her sex, relying only on Dr. Brooks's comment that Plaintiff should pursue a D.O. unless she planned on \"marrying off and living in a foreign country.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17) (quoting FAC \u00b6 23.) This comment, Defendant contends, could apply equally to men and women, and therefore, is insufficient to create an inference of discrimination. (MTD at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's Section 1981 claims (Counts III and IV) must be dismissed because Plaintiff does not allege that she is a member of a racial minority, a necessary element of a Section 1981 claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In response, Plaintiff withdraws her claims for sex discrimination under Title VI (Count I) and Title IX (Count II). (Resp. at 1 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff then proceeds to argue that the hostile educational environment claims (Counts I, II, and III) should not be dismissed because there are no precedential decisions limiting such claims to students, as opposed to applicants like Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiff seeks to undermine Defendant's contention that Plaintiff cannot state a hostile educational environment claim because Dr. Brooks made the alleged statements took during a pre-application meeting analogous to a job fair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that because Dr. Brooks harassed Plaintiff \"at a sanctioned and official admissions interview,\" the harassment supports a hostile educational environment claim.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) According to Plaintiff, the Complaint clearly alleges that Dr. Brooks informed Plaintiff that she would be admitted to Jefferson if she were African American after reviewing Plaintiff's GPA and MCAT score. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing FAC \u00b6 18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also specifically responds to Defendant's contention that Plaintiff cannot show that she was treated differently from similarly situated persons outside of her protected class. (Resp. at 9.) Though this is an element of a prima facie case, Plaintiff argues that a complaint need not establish a prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Moreover, Plaintiff avers that the prima facie case is irrelevant in this action because Plaintiff has shown direct evidence of discrimination; namely, that Dr. Brooks informed Plaintiff that if she were of a different race\n   or ethnicity, she would be admitted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff then argues that the Complaint states a claim for retaliation under Title VI (Count I), Title IX (Count II), and Section 1981 (Count IV) because Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity by reporting Dr. Brooks's discrimination to Jefferson, experienced a materially adverse action after the protected activity when Plaintiff was denied admission, and there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Plaintiff refutes Defendant's argument that a three-month time lapse is insufficient to establish causation, arguing that courts within the Third Circuit have declined to set a bright-line rule for temporal proximity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff contends that she can state a Section 1981 discrimination claim (Count III) even though she is not a racial minority, as the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit have allowed \"reverse discrimination\" claims to proceed under Section 1981. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the Reply, Defendant reiterates that there is no authority to support Plaintiff's novel theory that an applicant for admission can state a hostile educational environment claim. (Rep. at 2.) Defendant then argues that Plaintiff's racial discrimination claims under Title VI (Count I) and Section 1981 (Count III) must be dismissed because the Complaint fails to allege that Plaintiff was qualified for admission to Jefferson in 2016 or that similarly situated applicants were admitted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Defendant acknowledges that Section 1981 supports \"reverse discrimination\" claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n.4). However, Defendant avers that Dr. Brooks's alleged statement that Plaintiff would be one of many hundreds of students admitted if she were African American does not support Plaintiff's Section 1981 or Title VI race discrimination claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Specifically, Defendant contends that this statement is not direct evidence of race discrimination because Dr. Brooks did not state that Plaintiff would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be admitted because of her race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Plaintiff's race discrimination claims must be dismissed, Defendant argues, because Plaintiff fails to allege that Dr. Brooks was involved in the decision to reject Plaintiff's application, or that there was a specific link between Dr. Brooks's comment and Plaintiff's rejection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, Defendant argues that Dr. Brooks's statement is not direct evidence of national origin or ancestry discrimination under Title VI, setting forth nearly identical arguments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly, Defendant again argues that Plaintiff's retaliation claims (Counts I, II, and IV) should be dismissed because the three-month time lapse between Plaintiff's discrimination complaint and Defendant's rejection of Plaintiff's application, without additional facts, does not establish causation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Hostile Educational Environment Claims (Counts I, II, and III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant created a hostile educational environment in violation of Title VI (Count I), Title IX (Count II), and Section 1981 (Count III).

For example, Defendant seeks to analogize this case to another case in this Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Barnett v. Rutgers University\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201385664\">\n    2018 WL 1385664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Mar. 16, 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff alleged that defendant violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\"LAD\") and the ADA by repeatedly denying her entry into Rutgers Medical School and a Rutgers PhD program even though she was qualified for both programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Plaintiff alleged that she was qualified for medical school because the Associate Dean informed her that she \"ma[de] a compelling candidate for the program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Plaintiff alleged that she was qualified for admission into the PhD program because she successfully completed four graduate level courses during one semester with a 3.25 GPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court dismissed plaintiff's LAD and ADA claims without prejudice because Plaintiff failed to plausibly plead that she was qualified for admission into either program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court explained that the complaint did not plausibly allege that the plaintiff ever applied to or was rejected from the programs, the admissions requirements for each program, or how plaintiff was in fact qualified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Not only is Barnett distinguishable from this case because Barnett determined whether the plaintiff was qualified under the ADA and New Jersey state law, not Title VI, but also because Plaintiff in this case has plausibly alleged that she was qualified for admission in 2016. Plaintiff does not allege the admissions requirements for Jefferson in 2016, as perhaps she does not know. Plaintiff also fails to allege when Plaintiff's 82nd percentile MCAT score was within the range of accepted applicants, or that her high marks in her major or her extracurricular activities warranted admission. However, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Brooks expressly told her that she would be admitted if she were African American. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 18.) Accepting this factual allegation as true, as this Court must at this stage, the Court can reasonably infer that Plaintiff was qualified for admission to Jefferson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Dr. Brooks's alleged statement also plausibly supports the fourth element of Plaintiff's Title VI race discrimination claim-that Plaintiff was treated differently from non-Caucasian, similarly situated applicants. Plaintiff's allegations that Dr. Brooks informed her that if she were African American, she would be accepted, and that Dr. Brooks recommended that Plaintiff invest in genetic testing to determine whether she was a member of a minority\n   group to increase her chances of admission, raise the reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal that Plaintiff was rejected for admission because of her race. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has stated a Title VI race discrimination claim. Though Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot sustain a Title VI claim based on national origin/ancestry discrimination, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged facts that support a Title VI violation based on at least one protected class-race-sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss stage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rep. at 10-11.)
