Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the instant action against defendants the Milton Hershey School and the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (collectively, \"the School\"), alleging federal and state claims in the wake of the tragic suicide of their daughter, Abrielle Kira Bartels (\"Abrielle\"). In this opinion, we will revisit our August 10, 2017 decision, which improvidently dismissed several of plaintiffs' tort claims pursuant to the gist of the action doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Julie Ellen Wartluft (formerly Julie Ellen Bartels) and Frederick L. Bartels, Jr. (collectively, \"plaintiffs\") are the natural parents and administrators of the estate of the decedent, Abrielle. (Doc. 29 \u00b6 1). Prior to her death, Abrielle was a student of the School, which is a private, nonprofit institution that offers cost-free education to low income children from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 16). The School also provides residential accommodations for students, housing them in group homes with supervisory \"houseparents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-26). Abrielle enrolled in the School in August 2004 at the age of five. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). At the time of enrollment, Abrielle had \"great social needs related to her family structure and home life,\" as her immediate family members suffered from severe mental health problems and substance abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60). Prior to Abrielle's admission, plaintiffs executed the School's \"Enrollment Agreement,\" a three-page\n   document setting forth terms and conditions of enrollment including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , attendance, conduct and discipline, student dating, school-provided health care, release of personal information, visitation, textbooks, and religious services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 11-1 at 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that Abrielle excelled and thrived during her nine years at the School. (Doc. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18). They describe Abrielle as a \"model student,\" twice being named middle school \"Student of the Month\" and consistently achieving honor roll status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). She was also a member of the swim team and an \"anti-bullying\" organization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). Abrielle's likeness was even utilized by the School in marketing materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). According to plaintiffs, Abrielle planned to graduate from the School, attend college, and then join the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Abrielle began eighth grade at the School in August 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69). That year she allegedly was subjected to several incidents of bullying and experienced other stressors, including her father's likely incarceration for a second DUI offense and another student falsely accusing her of making physical threats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-72). In the face of these challenges, Abrielle's emotional well-being began to deteriorate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). In April 2013, as a result of the accusations of threatening behavior, Abrielle was removed from her student home and committed to the School's Health Center, an \"on-campus hospital-type facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74). After release from the Health Center, Abrielle's School psychologist, Benjamin Herr, M.D. (\"Dr. Herr\"), learned that she had recently expressed a desire to kill herself-a claim that Abrielle denied when questioned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77). On May 1, 2013, Abrielle was again admitted to the Health Center for overnight observation after she expressed self-harm ideations and disclosed past self-harm conduct to her houseparents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78). During her psychological examinations in the following weeks, Abrielle indicated that family difficulties, including her father's job loss, alcohol abuse, and potential loss of visitation rights, were animating her depression and thoughts of self-harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-81, 83-84). Abrielle also expressed anxiety and discomfort regarding an upcoming visit to her father's residence in light of his alcohol problems and the volatility of his relationship with his female companion, whom Abrielle referred to as her \"stepmother.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Throughout May 2013, Abrielle underwent multiple admissions to the Health Center for suicidal ideations, depression, and anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-88). She frequently reported during treatment that family concerns and instability were the driving forces behind her mental health issues and that she preferred to remain on campus rather than return to her father's home for holiday breaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On Dr. Herr's recommendation, Abrielle underwent inpatient treatment at an off-campus mental and behavioral health care facility from May 28 to June 5, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89). During inpatient therapy, Abrielle repeated the stressors of family mental health, discord, and substance abuse as the impetus for her self-harm and suicidal ideations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Abrielle's serious mental health problems continued when she returned to the School, necessitating further treatment and admissions to the Health Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92). On June 10, 2013, School physicians recommended that Abrielle again be treated at an inpatient mental health facility as soon as possible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93). Abrielle was admitted to a different inpatient mental health care facility the following day, beginning a nine-day course of psychotherapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, despite knowing that Abrielle's depression and suicidal ideations were driven largely by her unstable family life, the School directed that she be discharged from inpatient care back to her family home rather than to her campus residence under the care of her houseparents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101). According to plaintiffs, the School was operating under an official or unofficial \"shadow policy,\" which mandated that students be expelled after two mental health hospitalizations in outside facilities, even if those hospitalizations were recommended by School medical staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108). Dr. Herr purportedly explained this two-hospitalization policy to Abrielle's mother before and during Abrielle's second inpatient hospitalization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114). Dr. Herr also informed Abrielle of the policy, causing her to be \"devastated\" and \"terrified of being thrown out\" of school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When a psychologist at the inpatient mental health care facility learned of the policy, she \"expressed grave concern\" to Dr. Herr about the effects of such a policy on Abrielle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115). On June 19, 2013, the day Abrielle was discharged from her second inpatient hospitalization back to her father's home, Dr. Herr informed Abrielle that there was a \"significant likelihood\" that she would be expelled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118, 144).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that, prior to Abrielle's second inpatient discharge, the School had performed an \"enrollment review\"-a closed-door, internal process by School administrators that essentially was a precursor to expulsion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-28). On June 20, 2013, the day before middle school graduation, the School informed Abrielle that it was rescinding her invitations to the graduation ceremony and her houseparents' graduation barbeque. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130). The School further barred her from returning to campus and from attending ninth grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School officials allegedly told Abrielle's mother that the School may consider allowing Abrielle to return for tenth grade if she could satisfy certain conditions, which plaintiffs maintain were nearly impossible to meet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs aver that Abrielle's houseparents and Dr. Herr disagreed with the School's decision to prohibit Abrielle from attending graduation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132). Dr. Herr also opposed expulsion, outlining in his records a lengthy list of reasons why Abrielle should be permitted to return to the School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Tragically, ten days after she was discharged from her second off-campus inpatient hospitalization to her father's home, Abrielle took her own life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139, 144). Plaintiffs allege that Abrielle's suicide was preventable and was caused by her compelled return to her father's unstable home rather than to her campus residence, being barred from attending graduation and her houseparents' celebration, and being prohibited from attending the School for at least the first year of high school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 144-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Eastern District transferred the matter to this district pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

We find the latter to be the case, and now hold that the gist of the action doctrine does not bar the tort claims challenged by the School in its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Count III, plaintiffs assert a standard negligence claim against the School. They allege the School exercised year-round custody, care, and control over students and functioned as primary caregiver-providing education, housing, food, clothing, and medical, dental, and psychological care. Plaintiffs aver that the School, in this \"\n   <em>\n    in loco parentis\n   </em>\n   \" status,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   owed Abrielle a duty of care, independent of any contractual obligation, to protect her from harm. Plaintiffs assert that the School breached this duty by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , recommending Abrielle undergo two inpatient hospitalizations so it could expel her rather than continue providing psychological care; permitting Abrielle to be discharged from inpatient care to her parents instead of maintaining custody over her to provide further necessary psychological treatment; failing to develop a care plan for her before she was discharged to her parents; failing to provide adequate psychological care for her prior to her discharge from the second inpatient facility; threatening expulsion or a forced leave of absence simply because Abrielle was suffering from a mental impairment ; and rescinding Abrielle's invitation to attend her graduation and related festivities, exacerbating her depression. These allegations implicate social duties which are broader in scope than applicable contractual obligations. Notwithstanding the existence of the Enrollment Agreement (and any other written policies or guidelines), we conclude that the nature of the duty alleged in plaintiffs' negligence claim is based on custodial care and protection of minor children and exists independent of any contractual obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of the action doctrine does not apply to such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The same is true for plaintiffs' infliction of emotional distress claims in Counts IX and X. Plaintiffs aver that the School negligently or intentionally caused significant emotional distress and physical harm. The alleged conduct includes ignoring Abrielle's serious mental health issues and family-based causative factors, consciously disregarding prior settlement agreements involving discrimination against students with disabilities, threatening to expel Abrielle on the basis of her mental impairments when she was most fragile, discharging Abrielle back to her parents rather than allowing her to return to school to receive ongoing psychological care in her preferred environment, and callously rescinding invitations to Abrielle and her family to attend middle school graduation and related festivities. We reject the School's argument that these claims are grounded in contract. Plaintiffs' allegations may imply that the School violated the Enrollment Agreement or some of its own anti-discrimination policies, but even if this were true it would not transform plaintiffs' emotional distress claims into breach of contract claims. Plaintiffs are alleging that the School inflicted severe emotional distress-either negligently\n   or intentionally-through its purportedly egregious conduct toward Abrielle. The essence of these claims derives from tort law and the broader social policies implicated thereby, not contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty claims are no different. The allegations underlying these claims involve purported wrongdoing by the School outside of any \"contractual\" obligations that may have existed under the Enrollment Agreement or any other written materials provided to Abrielle or her family. For example, plaintiffs aver that School officials and administrators knowingly conspired to endanger the welfare of its students by implementing discriminatory and dangerous mental health policies despite the foreseeable risks such conduct posed to students with disabilities. Plaintiffs also contend that the School made numerous false representations to them regarding the psychological care the School would provide Abrielle while in its custody, inducing reliance on the School's treatment and leading to Abrielle's suicide. Plaintiffs likewise allege that the School breached a fiduciary duty to Abrielle by failing to hire and appoint qualified administrators and board members, failing to implement appropriate institutional policies and controls to prevent discrimination, and failing to comport with previous anti-discrimination settlements and policies. The gravamen of these claims implicates a more fulsome social duty to all individuals not falling within the ambit of any contractual duty that may exist between plaintiffs and the School. Consequently, the gist of the action doctrine does not bar plaintiffs' challenged tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency Challenges Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, the School also challenged the sufficiency of plaintiffs' misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.

Plaintiffs aver that they \"justifiably relied upon [the School's] representations, which caused [Abrielle] to succumb to suicide and to suffer the other\n   damages described herein.\" (Doc. 29 \u00b6 214). This type of conclusory pleading fails to state a claim for relief. Plaintiffs do not explain how their reliance on the School's misrepresentations\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   Abrielle's suicide or other injuries.

Plaintiffs appear to assert intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in a personal capacity as well as on behalf of Abrielle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29 \u00b6 230). As to infliction of emotional distress on Abrielle, plaintiffs aver that due to the School's conduct, she suffered \"physical manifestations of emotional distress,\" \"conscious pain and suffering,\" \"bodily harm,\" and, ultimately, suicide. (Doc. 29 \u00b6\u00b6 139, 193, 226, 230). Allegations of suicide clearly satisfy the \"physical harm\" requirement for an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To the extent plaintiffs assert personal claims for emotional distress, they\n   do not plausibly allege that they experienced any physical harm. The sole injury plaintiffs assert is \"severe physical and emotional distress, including severe mental anguish and horror[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230). This averment, without more, does not suffice under Pennsylvania law. In\n   <em>\n    Abadie v.

Conversely, in\n   <em>\n    Love v. Cramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"909410\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/414/231/\">\n    414 Pa.Super. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"909410\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/414/231/\">\n    606 A.2d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179 (1992) -a case cited by plaintiffs-the complainant alleged physical manifestations including \"nightmares, stress[,] and anxiety,\" which the court found sufficient to state physical injury. Plaintiffs' allegations fail to establish that they suffered physical harm. We will thus dismiss without prejudice plaintiffs' individual claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As for the School's second contention, we find that the conduct as pled rises to the requisite \"outrageous\" level. Plaintiffs aver that the School threatened to expel Abrielle due to her mental impairments and did, in fact, suspend her for at least ninth grade the day after she was discharged from inpatient treatment for severe depression and suicidal ideation. This conduct allegedly occurred on the heels of a settlement with the Department of Justice regarding the School's mistreatment of students with disabilities. The School also purportedly forced Abrielle to be discharged back to her natural family, who had their own mental health, legal, and substance abuse issues that were the driving factors in Abrielle's severe depression. According to plaintiffs, the School knowingly removed Abrielle from her campus home of nine years and put her in the exact environment that was causing her depression and suicidal tendencies. Plaintiffs further allege that the School encouraged Abrielle to get inpatient mental health care while knowing that such treatment would result in automatic expulsion or suspension under the two-hospitalization policy. These allegations, taken together, are sufficiently extreme and outrageous as to be considered \"utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11806154,765959\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/720/745/\">\n    720 A.2d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buczek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679814\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/366/551/\">\n    531 A.2d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
