(collectively, \"Florida's Natural\" or \"defendant\"). Florida's Natural sells a variety of orange juice products (\"products\") that contain trace amounts of glyphosate, an herbicide used to kill weeds. Plaintiff alleges that the use of the term \"natural\" in defendant's brand name is deceptive because glyphosate is not a natural ingredient. Plaintiff brings putative class claims under New York's consumer protection statute on behalf of herself and other New York purchasers. Plaintiff also brings putative common law class claims under the laws of all states on behalf of herself and a putative nationwide class of purchasers. Before the court is defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Because plaintiff fails to assert a plausible claim, defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant is a \"leading producer of premium orange juice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 1. Defendant's products bear the company's brand name, \"Florida's Natural.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)-(e), 15. Axon, a citizen of New York, \"regularly purchased\" Florida's Natural orange juice at a Key Food store located in Brooklyn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12.

Super. LEXIS 11, at *1 (D.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 22, 2017) (denying defendant's motion for reconsideration and noting that\n    <em>\n     In re General Mills\n    </em>\n    \"do[es] not ... constitute binding authority in the District of Columbia or with regard to actions brought under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that\n    <em>\n     In re General Mills\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable from her case because \"[t]here, the court found that the term '100% Natural' applied only to whole grain oats in the product,\" while \"[i]n the present action, the term 'natural' ... appl[ies] ... to the entire Product.\" Pl.'s Opp'n 38 n.18. While the two cases are distinguishable on those grounds, the court disagrees with plaintiff's assumption that bearing the brand name \"Florida's Natural\" is akin to stating that the entire product is \"100% Natural.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
