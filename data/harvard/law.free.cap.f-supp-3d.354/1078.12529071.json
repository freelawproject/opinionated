Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IAC was a nonprofit that matched birth mothers with adopting parents and provided related counseling services to adopting parents. Compl. (dkt. 1) \u00b6 11. Plaintiff Landmark American Insurance Company (\"Landmark\") issued a D &amp; O policy to IAC that was in effect from March 24, 2015, to March 24, 2016 (\"Landmark Policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.

The CDSS Report stated that \"an investigation\n   was going to be conducted regarding\" the allegation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 5. The CDSS investigation triggered IAC to give Landmark a \"notice of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nav. Mot. at 2; Opp'n to Nav. Mot. (dkt. 34) at 6; RJN Ex.

The Trustee also sued Navigators, alleging that the Navigators Policy covered the directors' and officers' liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 16, 2018, the Trustee filed a First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), which is the operative complaint in the Trustee's Suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17; RJN Ex. A (FAC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FAC alleges that IAC's business model depended on the formation of new contracts with adopting parents, as well as the availability of birth mothers. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. It alleges that, in or before 2016, there was a decline in both the availability of birth mothers and new contracts with adopting parents, leading to a disruption in the business model and \"a financial crisis that demanded that the Director Defendants and Officer Defendants take action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. The FAC alleges that \"a confluence of events\" triggered IAC's financial crisis, including: IAC's difficulty locating birth mothers; an extended time period for locating babies; a decrease in the number of new contracts with adopting parents; a rise in overhead; adopting parents complaining that IAC was not providing the services promised; IAC relying on financial reserves; IAC losing money each month, with no turnaround in sight; and insufficient assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The FAC further alleges that IAC had obligations to hundreds of adopting parents who had paid for adoption services but had not been provided with a child, and hundreds of adopting parents who had.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. It alleges that IAC continued to seek and accept fees from newly signed adopting parents, though the directors and officers \"knew or should have known that [IAC] could not perform its outstanding obligations to adopting parents who had already paid the Debtor for adoption services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.

And the FAC alleges that IAC's directors and officers were not knowledgeable about applicable laws and regulations governing the closure of its operations, and shut down without seeking to comply with them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.

Compl. \u00b6 22. Navigators assigned counsel for IAC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. In a letter on July 8, 2017, Landmark agreed to defend the directors and officer under a reservation of rights, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   IAC gave notice of circumstance during the Policy Period in the form of the CDSS Report prompted by a complaint that IAC was not financially able to render the offered services, such that any Claim later made arising out of such facts or circumstances will be deemed first made during the Policy Period. The Trustee's Complaint alleges that IAC had financial difficulties and did not render services to its clients.\n   <em>\n    To that extent, the Trustee's Complaint shares facts or circumstances in common with the acts or circumstances alleged in the CDSS Report\n   </em>\n   .

CDSS was investigating the allegation that IAC was \"not financially able to provide the services which it offers.\" Compl. Ex. 4. The Trustee's Suit elaborates on this same allegation. Many of the allegations in the FAC explicitly mention IAC's financial woes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 37 (decline in birth mothers and number of new adopting parents \"[led] to a financial crisis that demanded that the Director Defendants and Officer Defendant take action\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (listing causes of \"[t]he financial crisis\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 (bankruptcy petition);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (at time of petition, hundreds of adopting parents who had paid adoption fees \"had not yet been able to adopt a child\"). The FAC's allegations against the directors and officer largely pertain to mismanagement in the face of financial crisis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 61 (\"(n) failed to timely acknowledge that [IAC] was facing a financial crisis that threatened the existence of [IAC]\"; \"(o) failed to call and conduct Board and management meetings for the purpose of identifying the financial crisis of the Debtor and taking action to solve the crisis\"; \"(p) failed to document ... the efforts made to resolve [IAC's] financial crisis\"; \"(s) failed to properly plan and budget for future operations in light of the Debtor's financial circumstances in 2015 and 2016.\"). The FAC also accused the directors and officers of failing to perform the services it offered adopting parents during this financial crisis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 38 (\"adopting parents complained that the Debtor was not providing the services promised in the contracts signed by adopting parents\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61 (\"(e) failed to take action to refund advances paid by adopting parents when it was clear that [IAC] would not continue to fulfill its obligations to adopting parents\"; \"(g) failed to find options for fulfilling [IAC's] obligations under contracts with adopting parents\"; \"(h) failed to take steps to cut overhead expenses in order to fulfill obligations to adopting parents\"; \"(j) failed to use [IAC's] assets to make refunds to adopting parents or locate other services to fulfill obligations to adopting parents\"; \"(m) failed to take steps via Chapter 11 ... to fulfill the obligations of [IAC] to adopting parents\"; \"(q) failed to identify and fulfill [IAC's] outstanding obligations to hundreds of adopting parents\"; \"(r) failed to quantify ... the true measure of outstanding obligations that [IAC] owed to adopting parents\"; \"(x) failed to provide earlier notice to adopting parents that [IAC] would not fulfill its obligations\"; \"(z) failed to take steps in 2016 to minimize the ... emotional hardship to adopting parents.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the CDSS report stemmed from the allegation that IAC was \"not financially able to provide the services which it offers,\" Compl. Ex. 4, and the Trustee's Suit includes numerous allegations about IAC not providing the services it offered in light of its financial crisis, the latter \"involv[es]\" the former. Landmark essentially admitted as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nav. Mot. Ex. A (July 8, 2017 Landmark reservation of rights letter) at 12 (\"the Trustee's Complaint shares facts or circumstances in common with the acts or circumstances alleged in the CDSS Report.\").

Cal. Dec. 17, 2009), another case Landmark relies on,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Nav. Mot. at 15, a judge in the Central District held that allegations based on\n   <em>\n    common\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   would be excluded, while allegations of a common scheme would not necessarily. Here, IAC's financial inability to offer the services offered is a common fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, Navigators' Endorsement 4 excludes coverage for the Trustee's Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Policy Exclusion B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Navigators' Policy also includes an Exclusion B, which states that Navigators \"will not be liable ... to make any payment of any Loss in connection with any Claim made against any Insured ... based upon, arising out of, relating to, directly or indirectly resulting from or in consequence of, or\n   <em>\n    in any way involving\n   </em>\n   any Wrongful Act or Related Wrongful Act or\n   <em>\n    any fact, circumstance or situation which has been the subject of any notice given\n   </em>\n   under any other policy of which this Coverage Part is a renewal or replacement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 2 (Navigators Policy) at 17 of 35 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Navigators asserts that Landmark received notice of the CDSS investigation when its policy was in effect, and that the Navigators Policy replaced the Landmark Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nav. Mot. at 9; RJN Ex. C (Declaration of Landmark counsel filed in Bankruptcy Court) at \u00b6 3 (\"Before the Landmark D &amp; O Policy expired, IAC gave notice of an administrative complaint about IAC made to [CDSS]\"). Landmark does not dispute these facts. Navigators also argues that the Trustee's Suit \"does indeed involve the very same fact, circumstance, or situation the CDSS investigated: IAC's financial inability to perform its services.\" Nav. Mot. at 10. It further notes that the exclusion only requires that the Trustee Suit share \"any fact\" with the allegation CDSS investigated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010676206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In keeping with the analysis above, the Court agrees that the Trustee's Suit \"involv[es]\" the fact of IAC's inability to perform services in light of its financial circumstances, which was the subject of a notice given under the Landmark Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, Navigators' Exclusion B independently excludes coverage for the Trustee's Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Ex. 2 (Navigators Policy) at 11 of 35. In addition, the Navigators Policy requires that a Claim be \"first made against an Insured during the Policy Period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010676206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15 of 35.
