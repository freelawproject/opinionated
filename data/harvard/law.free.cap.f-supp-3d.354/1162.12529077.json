(ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 13, 2018, one of the two defendants in the complaint, Warren Stanley, the Commissioner of California Highway Patrol, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. (ECF No. 12.) Shortly thereafter, the other defendant, William D. Gore, the Sheriff of San Diego County, moved to join in the motion. (ECF No. 13.) Plaintiff submitted a response in opposition on October 16, 2018 (ECF No. 17), and Commissioner Stanley filed a reply on November 9, 2018 (ECF No. 19), which was also joined by Sheriff Gore (ECF No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 14, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the matter pursuant to the Chamber's young lawyer rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After consideration\n   of the moving papers, oral arguments, and the applicable law, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    grant in part and deny in part\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

California's Horn Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Since 1905, California has required the installation of a horn or other audible signal device on motor vehicles as necessary safety equipment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1905%20Cal.%20Stat.%20819\">\n    1905 Cal. Stat. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. DCXII, \u00a7 4(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1913, the State introduced its first limitation on the use of car horns, which mandated that \"No ... person shall sound [the vehicle's] bell, gong, horn, whistle, or other device for any purpose except as a warning of danger.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1913%20Cal.%20Stat.%20645\">\n    1913 Cal. Stat. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. 326, \u00a7 12. The modern incarnate of these early statutes inheres in California Vehicle Code sections 27000 and 27001, the former of which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A motor vehicle, when operated upon a highway\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , shall be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of not less than 200 feet, but no horn shall emit an unreasonably loud or harsh sound.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CAL. VEH. CODE \u00a7 27000(a). Section 270001, in turn, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) The driver of a motor vehicle when reasonably necessary to insure safe operation shall give audible warning with his horn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (b) The horn shall not otherwise be used, except as a theft alarm system which operates as specified in Article 13 (commencing with Section 28085) of this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CAL.

Reading the two provisions of the Vehicle Code together, it is apparent that California \"restricts the use of a horn to occasions when it is necessary for safe operation or as a theft alarm.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Plaintiff's Involvement at the Congressman Issa Protests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff lives in Oceanside, California, and has participated in weekly protests at the district office of Congressman Darrell Issa in Vista, California. Those protests regularly occurred on Tuesdays from 10 to 11 a.m., beginning after the November 2016 election and concluding in April 2018, at the office building at 1800 Thibodo Road, Vista, California, 92081, where Representative Issa maintained his Vista office. The office building has no adjacent\n   neighbors, faces a \"main arterial road,\" and is flanked in the back by California Route 78, a six-lane freeway. (ECF No. 1, at 3.) Across the road from the building is \"a wooded slope with houses at the top.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By Plaintiff's account, the Issa protests regularly \"generated noise from both opponents and supporters of Representative Issa.\" (ECF No. 1, at 2.) Indeed, during these protests, Plaintiff observed that \"a supporter of the Representative often employed a sound system with loud speakers across the street from the office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) In addition, \"drivers often sounded their vehicle horns in support of the protest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff arrived at the weekly Issa protest on October 17, 2017 by car and parked it nearby while she participated. During the protest, a number of deputy sheriffs arrived on the scene and \"issued citations to various individuals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Ms. Porter moved her car, and in doing so, drove past the protest and sounded her vehicle horn once to express her support of the protest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Plaintiff was directed by Sheriff's Deputy Klein to pull over. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At that time, Deputy Klein issued her a citation for allegedly violating section 27001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The citation had an appearance date of December 12, 2017, which Plaintiff attended. A hearing to contest the citation was scheduled for February 5, 2018, but when Deputy Klein did not appear, the citation was dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) After Plaintiff dispatched a letter, on November 9, 2017, to Sheriff Gore asking him to \"refrain from enforcing section 27001 against protected speech,\" Sheriff Gore's chief legal advisor advised on November 29, 2017 that \"Ms. Gore's citation was not issued as a content-based regulation of speech but rather as a straight forward violation of the Vehicle Code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the citation was dismissed, Plaintiff continues to harbor a fear that section 27001 will be enforced against her. In that respect, her complaint states that she regularly drives her vehicle in areas of San Diego County where the Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol provide traffic enforcement, and that she is \"censoring herself from using her vehicle horn by refraining from using her vehicle for expressive purposes, ... to express[ ] support for political protests, rallies, or demonstrations\" within that area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff commenced her suit on June 11, 2018, alleging a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim under the First Amendment against both defendants, and a violation of Article I, \u00a7 2 of the California Constitution (pertaining to freedom of expression) against Sheriff Gore only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, on its face, or as applied, section 27001 imposes an overbroad restriction on her right to expression and constitutes a content-based restriction subject to strict scrutiny. In the alternative, if intermediate scrutiny is to apply, she asserts that section 27001 is insufficiently narrowly-tailored. Plaintiff seeks both declaratory and injunctive relief, urging the Court to declare section 27001 unconstitutional as applied to protected expression and to enjoin both Defendants from enforcing the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants move for dismissal on a number of defenses. As an initial matter, they dispute that horn honking is protected\n   under the First Amendment. Even assuming it is protected, Defendants contend that section 27001 is a content-neutral restriction on expressive conduct that must be analyzed under intermediate, not strict scrutiny. On this point, Defendants posit that section 27001 is a valid time, place, manner restriction that serves important state interests in noise reduction, prevention of driver distraction, and the preservation of the efficacy of the horn as a warning device. They assert that no cry of overbreadth may sound when a regulation is a valid time, place, and manner restriction, and that Plaintiff's overbreadth challenge fails as a result. In the alternative, Defendants claim that the horn ordinance passes Constitutional muster as a permissible restriction on speech in a limited public forum. Finally, defendants dispute that Plaintiff's as-applied challenge is ripe for adjudication, and insist that the Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiff's assertions under the California constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition, section 27001 promotes traffic safety in two ways. For one, restricting horn usage reduces day-to-day driver distractions.

As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff contends that Defendants have not met their burden of showing that expressive horn use, such as hers, does any violence to the government's stated objectives.

Plaintiff points out that nothing supports the claimed connection between expressive honks and public safety and noise pollution but the Defendants' ipse dixit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20) and that there is a question of fact-ill-suited for resolution on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion-whether a singular honk in the middle of a political protest on a public street would actually lead to the ills cited in support of section 27001.
