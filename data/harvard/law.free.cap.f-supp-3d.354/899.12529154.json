R. 1-1, Exhibit D (\"the debt reported on the credit report is not accurate\"). It is therefore unclear from the face of the complaint and its exhibits when Fajolu can fairly be said to have discovered the alleged violation. But the Court can imagine a number of scenarios consistent with the allegations in the complaint in which it would be plausible for Fajolu - an insolvent individual whose debt was in default - to initially believe he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   owe the debt outlined in Portfolio's August 7, 2017 letter. Accordingly, the Court does not find that the contents of the August 14, 2017 letter, or any other part of the complaint or its attachments, necessarily precludes the possibility that he did not understand his injury until that or even some later date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, whether the discovery rule ultimately allows Fajolu to overcome the statute of limitations is yet to be determined. But at this stage, the Court will allow it to proceed. The Court notes that, provided the date of discovery was August 14, 2017 or later, the complaint was timely; even assuming an August 14, 2017 accrual date, Fajolu filed his complaint exactly 365 days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson-Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176540\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/757/#p764\">\n    194 F.Supp.3d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (date upon which plaintiff could be said to be on notice of FDCPA claim \"not fodder for a motion to dismiss\" since complaint need not overcome affirmative defenses such as the statute of limitations); Fed.

[w]hen the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time ... exclude the day of the event that triggers the period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Though the argument is not fully developed, Portfolio contends that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6 is not applicable to Section 1692k(d) because it is a jurisdictional statute, and that even if Fajolu's claim accrued on August 14, 2017, his August 14, 2018 complaint is time-barred because it was not \"within\" one year as Section 1692k(d) requires.
