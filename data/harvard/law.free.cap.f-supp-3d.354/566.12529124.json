Conner, Chief Judge, United States District Court\n </history>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff NIBCO Inc. (\"NIBCO\") commenced the above-captioned action against defendant Viega LLC (\"Viega\"), a competitor in the copper press fittings market, asserting violations of federal antitrust and state tort law. Viega moves to dismiss NIBCO's complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court will deny Viega's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   NIBCO is a manufacturer of fittings, valves, and flow control solutions used in residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional construction. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 19). It is\n   headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Viega manufactures and distributes plumbing, heating, and pipe joining systems for use in industrial, commercial, and residential projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Viega is organized under the laws of Delaware, headquartered in Colorado, and has its Northeast Distribution Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The instant litigation arises from allegations that Viega unlawfully conditions sales of its carbon steel press fittings on the purchase of Viega copper press fittings, which unlawfully reduces consumer choice and perpetuates Viega's dominant share of both markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Copper Press Fittings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the complaint, copper pipe is the leading choice among contractors for plumbing, heating, and cooling installations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). NIBCO explains that \"press technology\" is a method of joining copper pipes using copper press fittings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). The technology uses power tools and jaws to \"press or crimp a joint\" and \"create a permanent seal between the fitting and pipe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NIBCO alleges that copper press fittings are unique among all other types of copper pipe connectors for several reasons: (1) they reduce time, budget, and manpower, and use lightweight installation tools; (2) they reduce hazards in the workplace by allowing \"flame-free installations\"; and (3) they are the only type of press fitting compatible with copper piping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 61). NIBCO further alleges that, because of these distinguishing features, copper press fittings are not reasonably interchangeable with other products, and demand for copper press fittings does not respond to changes in price for other types of copper pipe connectors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three manufacturers make up over 90% of the copper press fittings market in the United States: Viega, which controls 71% of the market; NIBCO, which holds 17% market share; and Elkhart Products Corporation, which holds 5% market share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35, 38, 41). In 2016, Viega had net copper press fittings sales of $115,000,000 in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). Based on this figure and the market share percentages, we discern that NIBCO's net sales in 2016 were approximately $27,500,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 38). NIBCO alleges that its copper press fittings are offered at prices as much as 15% lower than Viega's prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Carbon Steel Press Fittings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Black iron pipe is used in the oil and petroleum industry for transporting gas and propane, as well as in water wells, sewage systems, and fire protection systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). Carbon steel press fittings are used to connect black iron pipe in the same manner that copper press fittings are used to connect copper pipe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44). Carbon steel press fittings have the same distinguishing features as copper press fittings,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , superior efficiency and safety in installation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45). Carbon steel press fittings are the only type of press fitting compatible with black iron pipe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). According to NIBCO, there is no equivalent substitute for carbon steel press fittings on the market, and demand for these fittings is not affected by price changes for other black iron pipe connectors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Viega was the first manufacturer approved to sell carbon steel press fittings in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). Viega was the only manufacturer of carbon steel press fittings approved in the domestic market until July of 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49). Viega consequently controls at least 95% of the United States market for carbon steel press fittings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Tying Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Demand for press fittings begins with the creation of a project design incorporating specifications for piping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). An\n   engineer will draft fittings specifications, which, according to the complaint, are often governed by municipal code or state or federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Project specifications are then sent to contractors to solicit bids. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). Contractors, in turn, work with wholesale distributors to source materials for the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Contractors generally work with a single wholesaler distributor as a \"one-stop shop\" for all requirements for a given project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    NIBCO alleges that Viega has wielded its dominance in the carbon steel press fittings market to control the copper press fittings market. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 71). NIBCO avers that Viega has made sale of its carbon steel press fittings contingent on the customer's agreement not to purchase copper press fittings from NIBCO. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 72). NIBCO also avers that, in some instances, Viega charges penalties in the form of lost discounts or outright higher prices to those customers who continue to stock copper press fittings from NIBCO. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 73, 115).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    To illustrate these claims, NIBCO identifies seven examples of wholesale distributors who have purportedly stopped selling NIBCO's copper press fittings in response to Viega's threats. Those examples are:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    \u2022 Weinstein Supply Company (\"Weinstein\"), a wholesaler distributing products throughout the northeast United States, a branch of which stocked NIBCO's copper press fittings until a customer required carbon steel press fittings and Viega forced Weinstein to drop NIBCO's copper press fittings line in order to obtain Viega's carbon steel press fittings;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    \u2022 Moore Supply Company (\"Moore Supply\"), a wholesale distributor with locations throughout Texas, which carried NIBCO's copper press fittings until Viega threatened to cut off supply of its carbon steel press fittings if several Moore Supply branches did not stop carrying NIBCO's copper press fittings line;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    \u2022 Mid-City Supply Co., Inc. (\"Mid-City Supply\"), a wholesale distributor located in Indiana, which stocked NIBCO's copper press fittings until 2015, when it switched to Viega because \"Viega would not sell its carbon steel press fittings unless Mid-City [Supply] agreed to drop NIBCO's copper press fittings from its inventory\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    \u2022 American Pipe &amp; Supply Company (\"American Pipe\"), a wholesale distributor located in Alabama, which dropped NIBCO's copper press fittings in 2015 because customers were in need of carbon steel press fittings and Viega would not supply them unless American Pipe stopped carrying NIBCO's copper press fittings and stocked Viega's instead;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \u2022 Charles D. Sheehy, Inc. (\"Sheehy, Inc.\"), a wholesale distributor in Massachusetts selling product throughout New England, which was forced by Viega to stop carrying NIBCO's copper press fittings and carry only Viega's copper press fittings in order to purchase Viega's carbon steel press fittings to fulfill customer requests;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \u2022 Peabody Supply Company (\"Peabody\"), a wholesale distributor with locations throughout Massachusetts, a branch of which was visited by a Viega representative for an inventory check in March 2017 and during which visit the Viega representative advised Peabody staff \"that Viega would pull its carbon steel press fittings line from all of Peabody's branches if any of them stocked NIBCO's copper press fittings\"; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \u2022 Western Nevada Supply (\"Western Nevada\"), a wholesale distributor\n    with locations in Nevada and California, which Viega forced to convert from NIBCO's copper press fittings to Viega's copper press fittings in order to stock Viega's carbon steel press fittings.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 77-102). NIBCO alleges that it has lost sales with these distributors and others as a result of Viega's conduct. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79, 85, 88, 91, 95, 99, 102, 108-110). NIBCO also alleges that free market competition is harmed by Viega's conduct in that Viega (1) denies competitors free access to the market for copper press fittings not on merit but because of its power in the carbon steel press fittings market, (2) forces engineers, contractors, and wholesale distributors to forego their free choice among manufacturers and to pay a higher price, and (3) deprives consumers of NIBCO's \"pro-competitive and price-lowering influence\" in the copper press fittings market. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 104, 106).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Procedural History\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    NIBCO commenced this action with the filing of a five-count complaint. NIBCO asserts the following causes of action: in Count I, a claim for unlawful tying in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (\"Sherman Act\"),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and Section 3 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (\"Clayton Act\"),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; in Count II, a claim alleging contracts in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; in Counts III and IV, respectively, claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and in Count V, a claim under Pennsylvania law for tortious interference with existing and prospective business relations.

But NIBCO does allege that Viega's net sales in 2016 approximated $115,000,000 and that this figure represents 71% of the copper press fittings market. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 120). NIBCO maintains a 17% share of the copper press fittings market, translating to approximately $27,500,000 in sales.

Viega identifies a handful of cases which have held, at summary judgment or after trial, that when a manufacturer is able to circumvent a tying scheme and nonetheless reach the consumer, the arrangement is not\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    unlawful.

Based on the allegations of the complaint, it is plausible that the ultimate consumer (whether defined as the bidding contractor or the soliciting engineer or designer) is deprived of choice by Viega's endeavor to wield its market power in the carbon steel press fittings market to eradicate competition from the copper press fittings market. And NIBCO's complaint dispenses with Viega's anticipated response-that contractors can simply select a secondary and separate distributor for copper press fittings-by alleging that contractors as a matter of practice are unwilling to work with multiple distributors. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 54).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Viega's argument asks the court to assume, notwithstanding NIBCO's contrary allegations, that NIBCO can sidestep distributors to access consumers. For example, Viega remonstrates that NIBCO's fittings can also be purchased at large retail\n    chains such as Menards, Home Depot, and Lowe's. (Doc. 24 at 19 n.4). Much of Viega's argument in this respect rests on information sourced from beyond the complaint-whether from Viega's own institutional knowledge or from sources such as NIBCO's website-undergirding the court's view that a factual record must be developed to test Viega's claim of a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    We find that NIBCO has stated a plausible claim of\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    tying between the copper press fitting and carbon steel press fitting markets.

Accordingly, the court will deny Viega's motion (Doc. 23) to dismiss NIBCO's complaint. An appropriate order shall issue.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-86\">\n     Viega also filed a request for oral argument on its motion to dismiss. The court finds oral argument unnecessary to disposition of the instant motion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-87\">\n     We note briefly that the authority cited by Viega in support of dismissal is largely inapposite.

Because we find NIBCO's market delineation to be plausible, we reject this aspect of Viega's arguments at this stage without prejudice to Viega's right to reassert the argument at a later phase of this litigation if the record does not support relevant market boundaries as currently defined.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     The only case cited by Viega in support of its assertion that new market entry undermines market power-\n     <em>\n      Barr Labs., Inc. v.
