Orrick, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff SteppeChange LLC (\"SteppeChange\") brings suit against VEON Ltd. (\"VEON\") and Wind Tre S.p.A. (\"Wind\"), alleging that it was never paid for one of two software projects it developed on defendants' behalf. Defendants move to compel arbitration and to dismiss the complaint. In support of their motions to compel arbitration, defendants contend that a contract relating to the other software project delegates questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator and requires that SteppeChange's claims against VEON be sent to arbitration to at least decide this threshold issue. As I find that questions of arbitrability have clearly and unmistakably been delegated to the arbitrator and that VEON's assertion of arbitrability is not wholly groundless, I grant VEON's motion to compel arbitration. This case is stayed as to both defendants to prevent confusion, waste of judicial resources, and inconsistent results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SteppeChange also moves to remand this case back to state court, arguing that removal was untimely.

The parties shall notify the Court (with a copy of the arbitrator's decision attached) within a week of the decision and shall at the same time file a stipulation and proposed order requesting a Case Management Conference at the earliest date practicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. MOTIONS TO SEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In support of VEON's removal of this case, VEON moves to seal portions of the Button Deed containing nonpublic pricing terms, private bank account information and personal identification information of both parties and nonparties. [Dkt. No. 3]. VEON's redactions are narrowly tailored and will not impede the public's interest in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Kamakana v. City &amp; Cty. of Honolulu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856737\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/1172/#p1180\">\n    447 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (9th Cir. 2006). For good cause shown, VEON's motion to seal is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   SteppeChange has also moved to introduce the entirety of the DMP Software Development &amp; Marketing Agreement between Wind and meForo under seal in support of its opposition to Wind's motion to dismiss. [Dkt. No. 47]. Wind supports SteppeChange's motion to seal, arguing that the agreement's confidentiality provision requires its signatories not to disclose the agreement publicly. [Dkt. No. 50]. Wind has previously requested that I take judicial notice of the heavily redacted DMP Software Development &amp; Marketing Agreement in support of its motion to dismiss. [Dkt. No. 36]. As I am staying this matter pending arbitration and denying without prejudice the motions to dismiss, I will deem SteppeChange's motion withdrawn and allow the document to remain under seal temporarily until I consider Wind's motion to dismiss. SteppeChange shall re-file its motion to seal at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   SteppeChange's motion to remand is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   VEON's motion to compel arbitration concerning arbitrability is granted and this matter is stayed pending resolution of the arbitrator's determination concerning arbitrability. Wind's motion to compel arbitration is denied except that SteppeChange's claims against Wind are stayed pending the arbitrator's determination concerning arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants' motions to dismiss are denied without prejudice to re-filing once the stay is lifted. VEON's motion to seal is granted. SteppeChange's motion to seal is deemed withdrawn, the document may remain under seal temporarily until I consider Wind's motion to dismiss, and SteppeChange shall re-file its motion to seal at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    I accept SteppeChange's allegations in the complaint as true for the purposes of this motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Defendants also moved for dismissal for failure to state a claim. [Dkt Nos. 29, 31]. I deny those motions without prejudice because I am granting the motion to compel arbitration, at least as to arbitrability. The motions may be re-noticed after that initial determination has been made by the arbitrator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    VEON requests that I take judicial notice of the Button Deed attached as Exhibit B to the declaration of Matthew Matule in VEON's notice of removal. [Dkt. No. 32]. Although SteppeChange opposes VEON's request for judicial notice of the Button Deed in VEON's motion to dismiss, both parties rely heavily on the Button Deed in their briefing related to VEON's motion to compel arbitration. I take judicial notice of the Button deed pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
