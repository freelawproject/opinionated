(\"Elysium\") filed a complaint (\"Complaint\") against Defendant\n   Chromadex, Inc. (\"CMDX\"), alleging violations of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, as well as state law claims of trade libel, deceptive business practices under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, and tortious interference with prospective economic relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is CMDX's Motion for Summary Judgment based on a claim of immunity under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, CMDX's Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court presumes the parties' familiarity with the details of this case, which were outlined in the Court's prior order (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 44), and writes merely to provide a brief recitation of the facts that are pertinent to Defendant's present Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Elysium sells a product called Basis, an anti-aging dietary supplement comprised of two ingredients, pterostilbene (\"PT\") and nicotinamide riboside (\"NR\"). (Declaration of Troy Rhonemus (\"Rhonemus Decl.\") \u00b6 56, Dkt. No. 51.) CMDX develops, sells, and produces these ingredients in bulk, licensed as NIAGEN\u00ae and pTeroPure\u00ae, for use in consumer products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) CMDX formerly supplied Elysium with these ingredients, but their business relationship soured and ultimately ended in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.) Thereafter, CMDX began selling TruNiagen, its own anti-aging NR product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in approximately August 2017, Elysium manufactured a new version of Basis using NR and PT from an unknown supplier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Around this time, CMDX conducted in-house testing of the new version of Basis, which revealed that the new NR and PT ingredients used by Elysium were chemically different from NIAGEN\u00ae and pTeroPure\u00ae, and that Basis now contained toluene, an industrial solvent that potentially poses \"serious health concerns\" when ingested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 62.) Thereafter, CMDX filed a citizen petition (\"Citizen Petition\" or the \"Petition\") with the FDA, asking the agency to make the following two determinations on the basis of CMDX's in-house testing of Basis;\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   That Elysium's Basis product is adulterated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20342\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (f) based on the undeclared presence of toluene in the product at the level of 96-144 mg/kg; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ii.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   That Elysium's Basis product contains a new dietary ingredient under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 350b for which Elysium had not submitted a New Dietary Ingredient Notification (\"NDIN\"), thereby rendering the product adulterated under \u00a7\u00a7 342(f)(1)(B) and 350(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Declaration of Joseph N. Sacca (\"Sacca Decl.\") Ex. 1 at 2, Dkt. No. 53 (Citizen Petition) (quotation marks omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of its requests, the Citizen Petition noted that the FDA has not set any allowable level of exposure to toluene through oral ingestion of a dietary supplement, and cited a 2015 Center for Disease Control (\"CDC\") publication touting the dangers of toluene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) CMDX also asked the FDA to \"take all appropriate remedial action, including [ordering] that Elysium cease distribution of its Basis product and take other appropriate enforcement action, including seizure of violating products and an injunction against the manufacturers and distributors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20332\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 334.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, Elysium filed a lawsuit on September 27, 2017, alleging that the Citizen Petition was false, misleading, and filed for the sole purpose of harming Elysium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) Elysium's Complaint articulated three bases in support of this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , it alleged that the levels of toluene that CMDX had claimed were contained in Basis were consistent with pharmaceutical standards set forth by the International Conference on Harmonisation if Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (\"ICH\"), a non-profit association under Swiss law that, as its name suggests, makes recommendations about harmonizing competing regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical products, and that the FDA regularly relies on these standards for dietary supplements where no other applicable standards exist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Elysium averred that, based on Certificates of Analysis (\"COAs\") provided by CMDX to its customers, CMDX's pTeroPure\u00ae contains similar levels of toluene, so CMDX could not actually have believed that Basis was unsafe or that the Citizen Petition could be successful on the merits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , it contended that CMDX had no expectation that the FDA would grant its Citizen Petition because CMDX knew (or, as a regulatory consultant, should have known) that the FDA does not grant citizen petitions that seek the commencement of enforcement actions, including actions for seizure or injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-44 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2010.30\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 26, 2017, CMDX moved to dismiss the Complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). As part of that motion, CMDX argued that, even if Elysium could state a viable claim for unfair competition, CMDX's filing of the Citizen Petition qualifies for protection under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which safeguards the First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances by immunizing citizens from liability attending to that right. (Mem. of Law in Supp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss (\"Def.'s MTD\") at 4, Dkt. No. 20.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. I. Elysium countered that CMDX's activity fell under\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   's narrow \"sham exception,\" which denies immunity for one's attempts to influence governmental action where doing so is a \"mere sham to cover an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

(Rhonemus Decl. \u00b6 77;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164740\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/127/#p144\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. Q at 1 (Elysium's comment to Supplemental Petition).) Elysium explained, \"Although [it] believes that\n   the ICH Guidelines establish the safety of toluene at the minimal levels previously found in Basis, Elysium elected to eliminate the presence of toluene from Basis as part of its continuing efforts to ensure superior product quality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 27, 2018, the Court denied in part CMDX's motion to dismiss and converted the remainder of the motion - the argument that CMDX was immune from liability under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine - to a motion for summary judgment, since that particular issue called upon the Court to consider evidence outside the pleadings.

No. 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   That issue is presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the Court noted in its earlier Order, the sole issue to be considered is whether the filing of the Citizen Petition is \"objectively baseless\" and, thus, amenable to\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   's \"sham\" exception, thereby disqualifying it from the doctrine's immunity. Elysium argues that summary judgment is not appropriate, because CMDX has not established that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Citizen Petition was objectively baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The familiar summary judgment standard applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Summary judgment is available only in the absence of a \"genuine issue of material fact\" and where the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Elysium concedes in its comment to the Supplemental Petition that, when it opted to remove toluene from Basis, it did so to help \"ensure superior product quality.\" (Rhonemus Decl. Ex. Q at 1.) Superior product quality appears to be a euphemism for a potentially safer product - in other words, an admission that the presence of toluene in Basis posed potential harm to consumers. Either way, whether CMDX achieved the very outcome that motivated it to file the Citizen Petition, it obtained an outcome that any objective filer of this particular petition would have to view as \"favorable\" - namely, the removal of toluene, a toxin alleged to be potentially injurious to public safety, from a dietary supplement sold directly to consumers.

In that case, the plaintiff, a real estate project developer, was awarded a contract for a project for solar photovoltaic power installations on Long Island by the Long Island Power Authority, pursuant to which the two parties entered into seven lease agreements for the installation and operation of solar carport facilities at various sites.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270014\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270014\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/63/\">\n    at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Citizen Petition states, in no uncertain terms, that it sought to cause the removal of a potentially dangerous product from the market. Thereafter, Elysium removed from Basis the potentially harmful ingredient that gave rise to the Citizen Petition in the first place. CMDX contends that the Citizen Petition accomplished what it sought to do. While Elysium does not expressly attribute to the filing of the Citizen Petition its decision to remove toluene from Basis, denying the connection between the two events would be unreasonable. Based on these straightforward facts, CMDX's conduct cannot be considered a sham. The Court need not speculate as to whether the Citizen Petition was designed to elicit a favorable outcome because the proof is in the pudding - it actually did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The second principle guiding the Court's decision is that case law establishes that a favorable outcome need not materialize at the direction of a government entity or as a result of government action for it to qualify for\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   protection. Various courts, both in this Circuit and in others, have reached this conclusion in the context of settlement, holding that settlement of a purportedly objectively baseless lawsuit constitutes a favorable outcome within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   and therefore insulates the activity from application of the sham exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fresh Del Monte Pineapple\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-Md.-1628 (RMB)(MHD),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%2064189\">\n    2007 WL 64189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (S.D.N.Y.

One of the lawsuits even prompted one of the generic drug manufacturers to agree to \"modify its process for manufacturing its generic tablet,\" earning the defendant a favorable outcome irrespective of a winning verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1357. As part of its opposition to the application of\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   immunity, the plaintiff argued that the outcomes of those lawsuits were not favorable, since they had not come \"from the court itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1357 n.13. The Court rejected this argument, writing that it \"cannot agree with Plaintiffs that a plaintiff who has filed suit and receives the relief sought (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , monetary compensation, a change in conduct, etc.) could only have been deemed to have 'won' under\n   <em>\n    PRE\n   </em>\n   if it continued to litigate the case and received a favorable judgment from the court.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This principle has been reaffirmed by other courts in other contexts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    P.R. Tele. Co. v.

Applying that principle here, it matters not a whit that Elysium removed toluene from Basis acting on its own volition rather than at the direction of the FDA. The critical point is that Elysium acted in response to CMDX's filing of the Citizen Petition, and did so in a manner that scored a win for CMDX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Which leads the Court to the third and final guiding principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine is outcome-focused, not means-focused; courts asking whether petitioning activity was objectively baseless must consider whether it was designed to elicit a favorable outcome irrespective of the propriety of the means by which that outcome was sought. Elysium contends that CMDX's Citizen Petition was objectively baseless because the FDA could not grant all of the relief requested in the Citizen Petition, since seizure and injunctive relief are judicial remedies that do not fall within the scope of relief allowed by a citizen petition. (Mem. of Law. In Opp. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") at 8, Dkt. No. 52.) That CMDX is alleged to have employed arguably improper tactics in seeking this outcome - asking for relief that may have been beyond the purview of the citizen petition process - does not render its efforts any less susceptible to\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As the Supreme Court has instructed, \"[A] 'sham' situation involves a defendant whose activities are 'not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action' at all, not one 'who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means.' \"\n   <em>\n    City of Columbia v.

Whether or not the FDA was empowered to 'grant' the relief requested in the Citizen Petition is therefore beside the point; what matters is whether CMDX's efforts were genuinely aimed at procuring the result it ultimately achieved. Since Elysium has not identified a genuine of issue of material fact to suggest that CMDX acted solely to damage Elysium and without a genuine interest in the removal of toluene from Basis, the sham exception is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Based on the foregoing, CMDX's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Clerk of Court was directed to close CMDX's motion to dismiss at Dkt.

Unfortunately, the Court neglected to tell the Clerk to assign a new motion number to the converted motion. The Clerk is hereby directed to reopen the motion at Dkt.
