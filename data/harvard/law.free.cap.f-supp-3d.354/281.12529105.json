SIRAGUSA, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action challenges Seneca County's ability to impose and collect\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   property taxes on parcels of real estate owned by the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York. The Cayuga Nation contends both that Seneca County cannot impose the property taxes, because the subject properties are \"located within an Indian reservation,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and cannot sue to collect the taxes, because the Cayuga Indian Nation enjoys sovereign immunity from suit. Now before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (Docket Nos. [# 55][# 60] ). On the basis of tribal sovereign immunity from suit, Plaintiff's application is granted and Defendant's application is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The reader is presumed to be familiar with the Court's earlier written decisions in this action which discussed the facts, procedural history and relevant law in detail. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Docket Nos. [# 23][# 44][# 50] ). It is sufficient here to note that in recent years the Cayuga Nation purchased at least five parcels of land in Seneca County. Seneca County imposed property taxes on the Cayuga-owned properties which the Cayuga Nation refused to pay. Thereafter, Seneca County initiated tax foreclosure proceedings against the Cayuga Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to those foreclosure lawsuits, the Cayuga Nation commenced this lawsuit. The Cayugas' Amended Complaint purports to assert two causes of action. The first cause of action alleges that the County's attempts to foreclose on the Cayugas' properties violate federal law, and specifically, the Treaty of Canandaigua, the U.S. Constitution Article I, 8, and the \"Non-Intercourse Act,\" 25 U.S.C. 177. On this point, the Cayugas' pleading alleges that any properties which the Cayugas own in Seneca County are within the geographic boundary of the 64,000-acre Cayuga Indian Reservation that was \"acknowledged [by the United States of America] in the Treaty of Canandaigua, November 11, 1794.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint contends that while the Cayuga Nation purportedly\n   sold all of that 64,000-acre reservation to the State of New York, such sales were\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   since they were never approved by Congress as required by the Non-Intercourse Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the pleading asserts, \"the Nation's 64,000-acre reservation continues to exist to this day,\" and the subject properties are \" 'Indian Country' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1151.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the Cayugas contend that regardless of the reservation status of the subject land, the Cayuga Nation possesses \"tribal sovereign immunity, which bars administrative and judicial proceedings against the Nation and bars Seneca County from taking any assets of the Nation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In sum, the Cayugas' first cause of action is twofold: 1) the subject properties are part of the federally-recognized Cayuga Indian Reservation, and the County therefore cannot foreclose on the properties, because it lacks the authority to interfere with the ownership or possession of federal Indian reservation lands; and 2) the \"Cayuga Indian Nation of New York\" is a \"sovereign Indian nation,\" which is protected from foreclosure lawsuits by the federal doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Cayugas' second cause of action alleges that Seneca County violated two New York statutes -- New York State Property Tax Law 454 and New York Indian Law 6 -- by assessing property taxes on their properties. On this point, the pleading contends that both statutes forbid the imposition of taxes on \"Indian reservation\" lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Amended Complaint [# 9] at 21-22 (\" New York [Real Property Tax Law 454 ] provides that 'real property in any Indian reservation owned by the Indian nation, tribe or band occupying them shall be exempt from taxation[, while] New York Indian Law 6 directs that no taxes shall be established upon Indian Reservation lands.... Pursuant to the aforesaid provision[ ] of state law, taxes should not have been assessed against the Nation-owned properties[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As for relief, the Cayugas' pleading seeks two types. First, the Amended Complaint seeks a declaration that the County cannot foreclose on, or otherwise \"acquire, convey, sell or transfer title\" to, \"Nation-owned properties\" within Seneca County. Second, the Amended Complaint seeks an injunction, prohibiting the County from making \"any further efforts\" to foreclose on, acquire, convey or otherwise sell \"Nation-owned properties in Seneca County;\" prohibiting the County from \"interfering in any way with the Nation's ownership, possession, and occupancy of such lands;\" and requiring the County to \"rescind all acts taken to acquire, convey, foreclose, sell or transfer title to Nation-owned properties within Seneca County to date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the Cayugas commenced this action, they also filed a motion for preliminary injunctive relief barring Seneca County from proceeding with pending foreclosure actions affecting the five parcels identified in the Amended Complaint, on the basis of sovereign immunity. On August 20, 2012, the Court granted such\n   preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v.

However, the Cayuga Nation stresses that the Court may grant its motion based entirely on sovereign immunity from suit and not reach the merits of its other claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Seneca County has cross-moved for summary judgment on various grounds including some which this Court and the Second Circuit have already considered and rejected. The Court understands, however, that Seneca County is asserting these arguments partly in order to make a record for the appeal that will surely ensue following this Court's ruling. In particular, Seneca County maintains that the Cayuga Nation is not entitled to sovereign immunity from suit in this action, and that the County is entitled to summary judgment on the Nation's claims for the following reasons: 1) Supreme Court precedent including\n   <em>\n    City of Sherrill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    County of Yakima\n   </em>\n   \"affirm[s] that State and local taxing authorities may impose and collect real property taxes on non-sovereign properties owned in fee title by Indian tribes\"; 2) the Supreme Court's jurisprudence concerning tribal sovereign immunity from suit does not apply to\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure proceedings;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   3) according to\n   <em>\n    City of Sherill\n   </em>\n   the\n   Cayuga Nation's claim under the Nonintercourse Act is barred by laches; 4) the Nonintercourse Act does not apply to fee-titled lands over which the Nation cannot exercise sovereign authority; 5) the Court should deny the Cayuga Nation's request for an injunction under the Anti-Injunction Act; 6) the Cayuga Nation has abandoned its claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 7) the Cayuga Nation's properties are not exempt from taxation under New York law because the relevant statutes [ New York Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 454 and New York Indian Law \u00a7 6 ] \"do not apply to fee-titled lands over which the tribe is no longer sovereign\"; 8) the Cayuga Nation should be estopped from claiming that Seneca County cannot impose property taxes on the subject parcels since it pays taxes on other properties that it owns in Seneca County; (9 the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state-law claims; and 10) even if the Court reaches the state-law claims the County is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 2, 2018, the Cayuga Nation filed a reply [# 62] addressing the County's arguments. With regard to the argument concerning the Anti-Injunction Act, the Nation contends that the County waived the argument by failing to raise it when opposing the Nation's motion for a preliminary injunction seven years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 20, 2018, the County filed a reply [# 67] in further support of its cross-motion for summary judgment, which reiterates most of its earlier points but withdraws the argument involving the Anti-Injunction Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 6, 2018, counsel for the parties appeared before the undersigned for oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff has moved, and Defendant has cross-moved, for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.
