INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before me is the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Wal-Mart Transportation, Inc. (Doc. No. 156). Filing separately, Plaintiffs Allen and Rita Meadows (collectively, the \"Meadows Plaintiffs\") (Doc. No. 201) and Plaintiffs Barry and Lauren Creagan (collectively, the \"Creagan Plaintiffs\") (Doc. No. 204) opposed. Wal-Mart filed a collective reply to the oppositions. (Doc. No. 211).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Related to this matter and also before me is the Creagan Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss Defendant Kirsch Transportation Services, Inc.'s federal preemption affirmative defense. (Doc. No. 172). Kirsch opposed\n   the motion and moved for judgment on the pleading as to the negligence claim filed against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 183). In response, the Creagan Plaintiffs opposed Kirsch's motion and replied in support of their own. (Doc. No. 187). Kirsch then replied, in turn. (Doc. No. 193).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 14, 2016, a traffic accident occurred on the Ohio Turnpike in Groton Township, Erie County, Ohio. Due to construction at the time, eastbound traffic was reduced to a single lane, causing traffic to slow below the posted speed limit. Failing to timely recognize the reduced speed of traffic, Defendant Chavan Carter, driving a tractor-trailer, initiated a chain collision involving nine vehicles. Among the nine vehicles were that of the Creagan and Meadows Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The tractor-trailer Carter was driving was owned by his employer, Defendant Natex Group, Inc. At the time of the collision, Carter was hauling a shipment of birdseed for Wal-Mart pursuant to an arrangement brokered by Kirsch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because of this accident, the Creagan Plaintiffs and the Meadows Plaintiffs assert claims of negligence against Wal-Mart and Kirsch. (Doc. No. 58; Case No. 18-344, Doc. No. 1). The essence of these negligence claims is that Kirsch and Wal-Mart, in turn, acted negligently when hiring Natex to transport the shipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But Defendants rely on the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Volkova\n   </em>\n   to argue a claim of negligent hiring \"relates to\" the \"service\" of a broker and must be preempted accordingly. I am persuaded by Defendants' argument and the supporting case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While the FAAAA provides no definition of \"services,\" it defines transportation to include \"services related to th[e] movement [of passengers or property], including arranging for\" the transportation of passengers or property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23)(B). A broker does just that - \"arrange for\" the transportation of a shipment by a motor carrier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Regardless of whether the broker's alleged negligence in its choice of motor carrier results in property damage or personal injury, the service remains the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, Plaintiffs' allegation that all personal injury suits are exempt from FAAAA preemption is without merit. Further, because the negligent hiring claim seeks to enforce a duty of care related to how Kirsch (the broker) arranged for a motor carrier to transport the shipment (the service), the claim falls squarely within the preemption of the FAAAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Concluding the claim of negligent hiring does \"relate to\" the broker \"service\" provided by Kirsch, the remaining question\n   is whether the safety regulatory exception applies to \"save\" the claims. The exception provides that FAAAA preemption\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles, the authority of a State to impose highway route controls or limitations based on the size or weight of the motor vehicle or the hazardous nature of the cargo, or the authority of a State to regulate motor carriers with regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibility relating to insurance requirements and self-insurance authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). In support of the argument that the exception applies, the Creagan Plaintiffs argue that to \"concern 'transportation of property' for application of the preemption provision,\" the claim must \"concern 'motor vehicles' for application of the safety exception.\" (Doc. No. 187 at 11). But if this were so, all preempted claims would then be \"saved\" by the exception. As such, I reject this argument. Because the negligent hiring claim seeks to impose a duty on the service of the broker rather than regulate motor vehicles, I conclude this claim is not within the safety regulatory authority of the state and the exception does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Volkova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20741441\">\n    2018 WL 741441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205284616\">\n    2018 WL 5284616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even though the claim is preempted by the FAAAA as it relates to Kirsch as the broker and, through it, Wal-Mart, Plaintiffs are not without judicial recourse. Reading the FAAAA as a whole, it is clear that Natex as the motor carrier may still be liable for negligence here. The FAAAA mandates that to register as a motor carrier, the entity must carry liability insurance in an amount \"sufficient to pay\u2026 for each final judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to property ..., or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013906\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The FAAAA does not impose the same requirement on brokers. Not only does this affirmatively establish that a motor carrier may be liable for these types negligence actions, but also the omission of the same language with respect to broker evinces Congressional intent that brokers not be liable for this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, because the negligent hiring claim is preempted by the FAAAA, I do not find it necessary to address Wal-Mart's arguments regarding duty of care and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I conclude the negligent hiring claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   against broker Kirsch and through it, Wal-Mart, are preempted by the FAAAA. Therefore, Wal-Mart's motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 156) and Kirsch's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. No. 183) are granted, as a matter of law. The Creagan Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss affirmative defense (Doc. No. 172) is denied, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   So Ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Wal-Mart also opposed the motion to dismiss. (Doc.
