(\"Hancock\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) The parties cross-move for summary judgment on the issue of Federal's liability under the terms of the Policy. (ECF Nos. 38, 44.) Federal's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. Fabrique's cross-motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fabrique's Business Arrangement with Hancock Fabrics, Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fabrique has licenses to manufacture and sell finished fabrics and plush goods, such as pillows, dolls, and blankets, bearing the logos of professional sports teams and universities. (Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def. 56.1 Stmt.\"), ECF No. 40-1, \u00b6 2; Pl. Stmt. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (\"Pl. 56.1 Stmt.\"), ECF No. 48, \u00b6 13.) Hancock purchased Fabrique's fabrics for sale in its retail stores for more than forty years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Prior to October 2015, Hancock picked up the fabrics from Fabrique's California warehouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) In October 2015, Fabrique and Hancock met to discuss a new arrangement, under which Hancock would store Fabrique's goods at Hancock's distribution center in Baldwyn, Mississippi (the \"Distribution Center\") and ship the goods to fill orders from other Fabrique customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) As part of this arrangement, Hancock and Fabrique entered a Scan Based Trading Agreement (the \"Agreement\") concerning certain Fabrique plush goods (the \"Goods\"), which identified Hancock as \"Purchaser\" and Fabrique as \"Vendor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agreement provides, among other things, that \"[t]itle to the Goods remains with Vendor until the Goods are sold by Purchaser in the regular course of business, except that Purchaser shall bear the risk of Shrink.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (quoting Decl. of Philip C. Silverberg dated Mar. 9, 2018 (\"Silverberg Decl.\"), Ex. M (\"Agmt.\"), ECF No. 39-13, \u00b6 9.) The term \"Shrink\" is defined as \"loss or damage to Vendor's Goods caused by vandalism, theft, pilferage, or unexplained loss on Purchaser's premises.\" (Agmt. \u00b6 2.) The Agreement further provides that \"Vendor ... shall maintain insurance on the Goods while the Goods are in transit to [D]istribution [C]enter ... and while such Goods are located at the [D]istribution [C]enter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2015, Fabrique requested that Federal add the Distribution Center as a covered location to the Policy that Fabrique had purchased from Federal. (Pl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 1.) In addition to the Goods covered by the Agreement, pursuant to a verbal agreement between Hancock and Fabrique, the Distribution Center was used to store other goods that Hancock shipped to third party retailers. (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fabrique's Insurance Policy with Federal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Policy provided coverage on an \"all risk\" basis, subject to certain exclusions. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 4 (citing Decl. of Andrew N. Bourne dated Apr. 6, 2018 (\"Bourne Decl.\"), Ex. 2 (\"Dubak Depo. Tr.\"), ECF No. 46-2, at 108:2-109:1); Def. Resp. to Pl. Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def. Resp. to Pl. 56.1 Stmt.\"), ECF No. 56, \u00b6 4.) One such exclusion (the \"Willful Misconduct Exclusion\") provides, in relevant part, \"This insurance does not apply to loss, damage or expense caused by or resulting from willful misconduct, fraud or deceit by you, your partners, officers or employees ... or willful misconduct, fraud or deceit by other parties involved in the sale or purchase of merchandise[.]\" (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 10 (quoting Bourne Decl., Ex. 3 (\"Policy\"), ECF No. 46-3, at Federal_001323).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Policy was later modified by an endorsement (the \"Storage Endorsement\") that added \"Additional Coverages,\" including coverage for \"direct physical loss or damage to merchandise in transit caused by or resulting from a covered peril while such merchandise is temporarily in storage ... subsequent to leaving the point of origin for commencement of transit; or... in anticipation of transit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Policy at Federal_001362.) The Storage Endorsement is subject to certain exclusions, including one (the \"Dishonest Acts Exclusion\") for \"loss, damage or expense caused by or resulting from ... any dishonest or fraudulent acts committed alone or in collusion with others by any proprietor, partner, director, trustee, or elected officer of any organization... engaged by you to provide services in connection with the storage of merchandise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Federal_001362-63).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, under a section entitled \"Notice of Claim,\" the Policy states, \"It is a condition of this insurance that you or your assignee promptly report any loss or damage which may give rise to a claim under this insurance in accordance with the instructions shown on the How to Report a Loss form of this policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Federal_001371.) The \"How to Report a Loss\" form states, \"[i]f an Insured has a loss, please contact us by telephone as soon as possible for further assistance\" and provides a telephone number, fax number, mailing address, and email address to which the loss report may be faxed, emailed, or mailed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Federal_001296.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Hancock Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 2, 2016, Hancock filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for District of Delaware. (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 21.) When Hancock filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking leave to conduct store closing sales, Fabrique objected to Hancock's retention of the proceeds from any sales of Fabrique's goods. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 24.) In February 2016, the Bankruptcy\n   Court entered an Order authorizing Hancock \"to continue and conduct Store Closing Sales\" under certain terms and conditions. (Silverberg Decl., Ex. G (\"Store Closing Sale Order\"), ECF No. 39-7, at 5 \u00b6 B(7).) The Order states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [N]othing in this Order shall constitute or be construed to be a decision or ruling by this Court on the validity, priority or extent of the putative consignment arrangements as may be asserted by ... [Fabrique] ... or any of [its] right, title or interest in any goods provided by [it] to [Hancock], and all rights and claims asserted by [Fabrique] in the reservation of rights filed with this Court and any defenses thereto by [Hancock] are hereby preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 23 (quoting Store Closing Sale Order at 3 \u00b6 H).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hancock later commenced an adversary proceeding (the \"Hancock Adversary Proceeding\") against Fabrique seeking, among other things, a declaration that Hancock's interest in the goods was superior to Fabrique's. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 26.) Fabrique answered and counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that the goods were the subject of a bailment (rather than a consignment) and consequential damages from the sale of the goods. (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 28 (citing Silverberg Decl., Ex. I (\"Adv. Pro. Ans.\"), ECF No. 39-9).) In its counterclaims, Fabrique alleged that \"[i]n willful breach of the Agreement, Hancock has sold Goods at prices well below what was agreed to by the parties and without [Fabrique's] consent to such reduced prices.\" (Adv. Pro. Ans. at 10 \u00b6 24.) Fabrique further alleged that \"[i]n willful breach of the Agreement, Hancock has sold Goods and retained all proceeds from the sale of such Goods without remitting anything [sic] proceeds to [Fabrique] in accordance with the Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2017, Hancock and Fabrique entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving the Hancock Adversary Proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Silverberg Decl., Ex. J (\"Settlement Order\"), ECF No. 39-10, at 1-2.) Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Hancock disclaimed liability but agreed to pay Fabrique $250,000, which was to be \"allocated proportionally to [Fabrique's] claims for (a) loss of goods valued by [Fabrique] at $1,172,731.00 based on their wholesale price, and (b) lost profits and consequential damages valued by [Fabrique] at $3,000,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Fabrique's Insurance Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to seeking damages from Hancock for the lost goods, Fabrique also filed a claim for the goods under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Silverberg Decl., Ex. S (\"Property Loss Notice\"), ECF No. 39-19).) Fabrique contends Federal became aware of Fabrique's loss when Fabrique's CEO, Simon Garfinkel, told Michael Abrams of Lawley Westchester Group, LLC (\"Lawley\"), Federal's agent, about Hancock's bankruptcy filing in February 2016. (Decl. of Simon Garfinkel dated April 3, 2018 (\"Garfinkel Decl.\"), ECF No. 45, \u00b6 2; Pl. Resp. to Def. 56.1 Stmt., ECF No. 47, \u00b6 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Fabrique asserts that by March\n   2016, Garfinkel had informed Abrams that Hancock was in possession of Fabrique's goods and was claiming a superior interest in the goods, and that Abrams and Garfinkel had numerous discussions about whether the Policy may provide coverage for the goods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Property Loss Notice prepared by Lawley documenting Fabrique's claim is dated September 6, 2016 and lists the \"Date of Loss and Time\" as \"03/01/2016.\" (Pl. Resp. to Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39; Property Loss Notice.) In a section entitled \"Description of Loss and Damage,\" the Property Loss Notice states, \"Theft of insureds [sic] goods. Please contact insured for additional details.\" (Property Loss Notice.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After receiving notice of the claim, Federal assigned Sharon Direso, its Executive Director for Marine Claims, to adjust the claim and a surveyor, Jim Louis, to conduct an investigation. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 42; Bourne Decl., Ex. 10 (\"Direso Depo. Tr.\"), ECF No. 46-11, at 41:7-42:8.) Louis's preliminary report, issued after a several-week investigation, does not mention willful misconduct, fraud, or dishonesty, (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50), and Louis later testified that his investigation had not uncovered any evidence of willful misconduct, fraud, or deceit by Hancock or anyone else. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (citing Bourne Decl., Ex. 11 (\"Louis Depo. Tr.\"), ECF No. 46-12, at 86:15-88:12).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 16, 2016, Federal sent Fabrique a Reservation of Rights Letter (the \"ROR Letter\"), which reserved Federal's right to deny coverage because \"it is not clear if this loss is the result of a 'theft' by Hancock..., or due to a business transaction/relationship that ended because of Hancock's bankruptcy filing.\" (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 53 (quoting Bourne Decl., Ex. 16 (\"ROR Letter\"), ECF No. 46-17, at Federal_000584).) The ROR letter also states that Federal \"reserve[s] all our rights and defenses in regard to this claim under [the Policy].\" (ROR Letter at Federal_000583.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his response to the ROR Letter, Garfinkel wrote, \"It is 100% clear that Hancock ... stole the inventory under the advice of their counsel when they never had title for these goods and paid invoices for approximately $100,000 for goods they sold in their stores. The rest of the goods were stolen.\" (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 42 (quoting Silverberg Decl., Ex. U (\"Garfinkel Letter\"), ECF No. 39-21).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In an email dated December 28, 2016, Direso informed Fabrique that \"our attorney is of the opinion that coverage does not apply in this instance. This is not a theft, nor conversion[,] as we know where the goods are, so they are not truly 'missing or gone.' \" (Bourne Decl., Ex. 17, ECF No. 46-18.) However, Direso testified that as of the date of the email, Federal was \"not sure we knew the goods were there [in Hancock's possession] a hundred percent.\" (Direso Depo. Tr. at 197:3-198:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 3, 2017, Federal issued a letter (the \"Denial Letter\") denying Fabrique's insurance claim. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 59 (citing Bourne Decl., Ex. 18 (\"Denial Letter\"), ECF No. 46-19.) The Denial Letter states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The available information does not indicate that Hancock converted the [goods]. Rather, Hancock claims a legal right to the [goods], one that is superior to any right in the [goods] held by Fabrique. As such, there has not been 'direct loss or damage' to the [goods], nor has any such loss or damage been fortuitous. Accordingly, there is no coverage available\n   under the Policy based upon current information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Denial Letter at Federal_000002.) The Denial Letter further states, \"All rights and defenses available to us under the terms of the Policy, at law or otherwise are hereby reserved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Federal_000003.) After receiving the Denial Letter, Fabrique commenced this action, alleging that Fabrique \"suffered the complete loss of its merchandise through alleged theft\" and Federal's denial of coverage breached Federal's obligations under the Policy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Federal argues that Fabrique is not entitled to recover under the Policy because the loss did not result from \"direct physical loss or damage\" to the goods, the Dishonest Acts and Willful Misconduct Exclusions apply and, even if Fabrique's loss were not otherwise excluded from coverage, Fabrique's failure to provide Federal with timely notice of its claim bars its recovery. (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def. Mem.\"), ECF No. 40, at 13-22.) Fabrique argues that it is entitled to recover because its loss resulted from the physical loss of the goods, neither exclusion applies, and notice was timely (or, in the alternative, that any delay in notice is excused and/or the Policy's notice requirement has been waived). (Pl. Mem. in Opp'n (\"Pl. Mem.\"), ECF No. 49, at 7-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Mem. at 14 (quoting Property Loss Notice and Compl. \u00b6 2).) Whether an act is \"dishonest\" depends on the facts of what occurred, not on the labels assigned to it by the parties. Neither the Property Loss Notice nor the complaint provide any facts that explain why the loss was characterized as a \"theft.\" Federal's allegation that \"Fabrique's CEO has repeatedly stated that Hancock had 'stolen' its goods\" is similarly conclusory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.

Federal cites testimony in which Garfinkel states that Hancock used the \"scan base ... when they asked me permission if they could take something.... When they stopped and they kept taking the product they were stealing the product without permission.\" (Def. Mem. at 15 (quoting Garfinkel\n   Depo. Tr. at 103:6-7, 10-12).) But the fact that Hancock sold the goods without Fabrique's permission does not mean that Hancock acted dishonestly. Garfinkel subsequently testified that his mention of the occasions when Hancock \"took the goods without permission\" referred to Hancock's conduct \"when they filed [for] Chapter 11 [bankruptcy].\" (Garfinkel Depo. Tr. at 104:3-6.) It is undisputed that Hancock sought leave of the Bankruptcy Court prior to selling the goods, and that the Bankruptcy Court issued an Order authorizing the sales. (Def. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Federal asserts that, notwithstanding the Bankruptcy Court's Order, Hancock acted dishonestly because it could not have held a reasonable belief that it had the right to sell Fabrique's goods. (Mem. in Further Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. and in Opp'n to Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 55, at 8.) To support this assertion, Federal relies on the allegation in Fabrique's complaint that \"[i]n the bankruptcy filings, Hancock never listed the merchandise as an asset of Hancock\" and \"Hancock acknowledged that it: (a) had no ownership interest in the merchandise; and (b) could not borrow against the merchandise because it was not Hancock's asset.\" (Compl. \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7 &amp; n.29 (citing same).) However, Hancock's acknowledgment that it did not hold an\n   <em>\n    ownership\n   </em>\n   interest in the goods does not establish that Hancock acknowledged or believed it held\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   interest in the goods. To the contrary, it is undisputed that, in its complaint in the Hancock Adversary Proceeding, Hancock alleged that it held an interest in the goods that was superior to any interest that Fabrique held. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 26.)

The Policy does not define \"willful misconduct,\" and neither party has introduced any extrinsic evidence as to the intended meaning of the term. However, in the context of marine insurance contracts, the Second Circuit has interpreted that term to include conduct \"measuring up to 'knavery' or 'design.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nw. Mut. Life Ins.

For the reasons explained above, Hancock's actions were not dishonest. Although Federal asserts that \"Hancock's refusal to return the [g]oods is ... a ...fraudulent act,\" Federal cites no evidence in support of its assertion. (Def. Mem. at 20.)

However, the New York Court of Appeals has interpreted a similar exclusion for \"willful acts\" to refer to \"conduct which is tortious in nature,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , wrongful conduct in which defendant willfully intends to inflict harm on plaintiff at least in part through the means of breaching the contract between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Federal argues that Fabrique was aware that it had suffered a \"loss\" on February 2, 2016, when Hancock filed for bankruptcy. (Def. Mem. at 22.) Fabrique contends that even as of March 1, 2016, the date of the loss listed on the Property Loss Notice, \"it was far from clear to Fabrique\" that it had suffered a loss, and that \"when Fabrique was aware that a 'loss' had occurred under the Policy is an unresolved (and perhaps unresolvable) issue of fact.\" (Pl. Mem. at 25.) However, this Court need not resolve the issue of when the Policy's notice provision was triggered, as the undisputed facts demonstrate that Federal had timely notice of all relevant events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because \"an insurance broker is ordinarily the agent of the insured, not the insurer, ... notice to the ordinary insurance broker is not notice to the liability carrier.

Here, it is undisputed that Abrams was Federal's agent. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 38; Def. Resp. to Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Garfinkel asserts that \"[t]hroughout 2016, starting in February, when Hancock went into bankruptcy, [Garfinkel] continuously updated Mr. Abrams regarding the goods at issue and the developments in the bankruptcy proceedings.\" (Garfinkel Decl. \u00b6 2.) Federal does not dispute Garfinkel's assertion that Abrams received these updates. Thus, regardless of whether the \"loss\" occurred when Hancock filed for bankruptcy or at some other point during the bankruptcy proceedings, Abrams had timely notice of the relevant events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Upon receiving notice from Fabrique, under the terms of the Producer Agreement between Lawley and Federal, Abrams was required to report the loss to Federal's office or customer center. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bourne Decl., Ex. 20, ECF No. 46-21, at 3 (stating that Lawley's \"duties and responsibilities\" include, among other things, \"report[ing] all losses and claims promptly, and provid[ing] relevant loss and claim information pertaining to coverages placed with us to our nearest Chubb branch office or customer center\"). Moreover, Abrams demonstrated his awareness of this responsibility by preparing the Property Loss Notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Property Loss Form (stating that the loss was \"Reported By Mike Abrams\").) Thus, although the Property Loss Notice was not prepared until September 2016, any delay in reporting the loss to Federal's office is attributable to Abrams, not Fabrique. Because there is no evidence that Fabrique failed to provide timely notice of its loss to the insurer's agent, the Policy's notice provision does not provide a basis to deny Fabrique's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
