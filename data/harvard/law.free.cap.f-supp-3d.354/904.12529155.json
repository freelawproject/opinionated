(Dkt. 1-2) at \u00b6 1. It has one member: James Atten. (Dkt. 26) at \u00b6 11. Atten is a citizen of Illinois. Id. at \u00b6 12. First American is a Nebraska insurance company with its principal place of\n   business in California. (Dkt. 1) at \u00b6 9; see also (Dkt. 26) at \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about November 30, 2012, Wheaton Theatre acquired title to the real estate known as 119-127 North Hale Street, Wheaton, Illinois 60187 (the \"Premises\"). (Dkt. 1-2) at \u00b6 4. First American issued Wheaton Theatre a marked title commitment at closing, followed by Insurance Policy Number 2306396 (the \"Policy\") on December 10, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The clean and marked title commitment are attached to Wheaton Theatre's response as Exhibits C and D.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 19-1) at Ex. C &amp; D. The Policy is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 1-2) at Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime around November 7, 2013, Wheaton Theatre received a notice from the Wheaton Sanitary District indicating that unpaid sanitary district liens remained against the title stemming from a lien by the Sanitary District that was recorded on June 28, 2010, which First American failed to include in the title commitment or Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Wheaton Theatre tendered the Sanitary District liens to First American in December 2013, and the parties began to work to clear the liens (although not without issue).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-13. Ultimately, Wheaton Theatre incurred attorneys' fees over the next few months in working to clear the liens and avoid water shut offs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During this time, Wheaton Theatre asked its counsel to research the correct legal description of the Premises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Wheaton Theatre's attorney discovered in July 2014, and concluded in September 2014, that a portion of the Premises (the \"Disputed Property\") had been dedicated to the City of Wheaton on or about February 2, 1948 and improperly included as part of the insured Premises under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. Wheaton Theatre sent First American a demand letter tendering a claim for damages regarding the Disputed Property in November 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. In May 2015, First American offered to settle the title claim for $ 20,500.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. More than one year later, in October 2016, Wheaton Theatre made a written policy demand, which First American rejected in November 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. More than one year later, in January 2018, Wheaton Theatre made a reduced demand of $ 120,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. First American again rejected the demand, making a counteroffer of $ 20,500.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, Wheaton Theatre brought suit (1) seeking a declaration that First American is obligated to pay attorneys' fees incurred by Wheaton Theatre as a result of the Sanitary District lien and prior conveyance of the Disputed Property (Count I), (2) claiming that First American breached the Policy by (a) failing to timely resolve the Sanitary District liens and denying Wheaton Theatre's demand for the attorneys' fees it incurred in resolving those liens and (b) including the Disputed Property as insured under the Policy (Count II), and (3) claiming that First American negligently misrepresented the Sanitary District liens and Disputed Property issue by failing to accurately address these items in the title commitment and Policy-by omitting the Sanitary District liens and including the Disputed Property in the legal description (Count III). First American moves to dismiss Count III.

To state a claim for negligent misrepresentation under Illinois law, a plaintiff must establish: (1) a false statement of material fact, (2) carelessness or negligence in ascertaining the truth of the statement by the party making it, (3) an intention to induce the other party to act, (4) action by the other party in reliance on the truth of the statement, (5) damage to the other party resulting from such reliance, and (6) a duty on the party making the statement to communicate accurate information.\n   <em>\n    First Midwest Bank, N.A. v.

(Dkt. 1-2) at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 46. On this point, Wheaton Theatre alleges that it was foreseeable that Wheaton Theatre might need the Disputed Property to realize the full development potential of its purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. That is, the information about the liens and the Disputed Property were material facts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. In getting these matters of public record wrong in the commitment and Policy, Wheaton Theatre alleges that First American acted negligently and caused damage to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Thus, in Count III, Wheaton Theatre seeks to recover losses from the inability to use the Disputed Property and work to resolve the liens on a tort concept. In moving to dismiss Count III, First American does not argue that the Complaint fails to sufficiently allege the elements of negligent misrepresentation. Instead, First American argues that Wheaton Theatre cannot maintain such a claim against it under Illinois law.

Jan. 9, 2018) (claim for negligent misrepresentation failed because \"like a title insurer, a malpractice insurer is not supplying information when it issues an insurance policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But in response to First American's Motion, Wheaton Theatre makes three arguments to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   First, Wheaton Theatre argues that it received something more akin to an abstract of title than a title commitment and policy based on the amount it paid for the policy and miscellaneous \"title services,\" the language of the Commercial Sales Contract between Wheaton Theatre and Suburban Bank &amp; Trust, and the degree to which it relied on those documents, thereby raising First American's duty to supply accurate information. (Dkt. 19-1) \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. However, this theory is not pled in the Complaint nor is it consistent with the allegations there, which only reference the title commitment and Policy and nothing further. (Dkt. 1-2) at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 17, 42-48, 50;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Med. Benefits Trust v. Walgreen Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086352\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/436/#p448\">\n    631 F.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"a plaintiff may not amend [its] complaint in [its] response brief\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205876567\">\n    2015 WL 5876567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (court can consider additional facts set forth in plaintiff's brief so long as those facts are consistent with the pleadings). In addition, even if it were in the Complaint, the fact that Wheaton Theatre paid for \"title services\" without more does not allege that First American provided it with an abstract of title or anything more than a commitment and policy. Further, Wheaton Theatre's expectations as to what the title commitment and Policy would provide cannot alter the nature of those documents without additional information indicating that something above and beyond a commitment was bargained for and provided. In other words, Wheaton\n   Theatre cannot simply substitute its subjective beliefs for the objective terms of the title commitment and Policy, which only state the coverage of risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 19-1) at Ex. C (\"We agree to issue a policy to you according to the terms of this Commitment.\"); (Dkt. 1-2) at Ex. A (providing insurance against loss or damage sustained by reason of \"[t]itle being vested other than as stated in Schedule A,\" or \"[a]ny defect in or lien or encumbrance on the Title,\" among other things). Therefore, at this time, these arguments do not serve to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Wheaton Theatre attempts to narrow\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title's\n   </em>\n   holding that a title insurer is not in the business of supplying information to apply to only Schedule B of a title commitment. This is because Wheaton Theatre alleges here that \"First American carelessly and negligently made false statements of material facts by tendering to Wheaton Theatre the Title Commitment and Title Policy without identifying the Wheaton Sanitary District liens [in Schedule B], and inaccurately including the Disputed Property in the inaccurate legal description [in Schedule A].\" (Dkt 1-2) at \u00b6 48. According to Wheaton Theatre, the language in Schedule A, particularly, \"[t]he land referenced to in this Commitment is described as follows,\" raises First American's duty to provide accurate information, placing it within the third exception to the\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Unfortunately, Wheaton Theatre does not substantiate this claim with any legal basis to sever and treat portions of a title commitment differently as a matter of law. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   held that \"nowhere does the commitment contain any guarantee concerning the performance of a title search.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5735885\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/218/326/#p334\">\n    218 Ill. 2d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=300%20Ill.%20Dec.%2069\">\n    300 Ill.Dec. 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=843%20N.E.2d%20327\">\n    843 N.E.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Wheaton Theatre's Policy specifically insures against loss or damage if the \"[t]itle being vested is different than as stated in Schedule A.\" (Dkt. 1-2) at Ex. A. Thus, if Wheaton Theatre was provided with an inaccurate legal description of the property, the appropriate recourse is to bring a breach of contract claim, which is contained in Count II and which First American tellingly has not moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Overall, the Complaint alleges only that First American supplied Wheaton Theatre with a title commitment and title policy. Under\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   , then, in supplying these documents First American was not in the business of supplying information for the guidance of a business transaction. Instead, it was issuing terms for a title insurance policy and insuring against undiscovered defects, liens, and encumbrances. Accordingly, the contracts define the scope of First American's liability and Count III fails to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a final matter, Wheaton Theatre argues that Count III is not precluded by\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   because First American contemplated liability for a negligent misrepresentation claim in the title commitment based on certain language in the title commitment: \"Any claim, whether or not based on negligence, which you may have against us concerning the title to the land must be based on this Commitment and is subject to its terms.\" (Dkt. 19-1) at Ex. C. But this language simply does not allow the Court to disregard the Illinois Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, First American's Motion to Dismiss Count III (Dkt. 16) is granted. Since Wheaton Theatre has attempted to bring additional allegations in support of its claims in its response brief that indicate a possibly different theory of events, the Court will allow Wheaton Theatre the opportunity to file an amended complaint consistent with this opinion, to the extent that it\n   can do so. Any amended complaint shall be filed on or before December 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
