While federal law controls for this by mandating restitution for all trafficking victims, the government does not routinely request it and courts rarely award it in sex trafficking cases. According to one study that reviewed all human trafficking cases filed in federal court between 2009 and 2012, only 36% resulted in restitution awards to the victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 J.L. Econ. &amp; Pol'y at 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Adding insult to injury, only 31% of sex-trafficking victims received restitution, compared to 94% of labor-trafficking victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Even the average amounts awarded to sex-trafficking victims were lower, checking in at a quarter of that awarded to labor-trafficking victims for all cases filed, and in cases where the court awarded restitution, the average amount was $228,201.82 for labor trafficking and $151,076.58 for sex trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   &amp; n.112. At least one commentator explained this disparity by conceding there is a \"certain blame-the-victim attitude prevalent in the administration of justice when it comes to the victims of sex trafficking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There is no place for victim-blaming in the law, especially when the full extent of victims' suffering is so hard to grasp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1717. Victims' abusers take away their childhoods, their self-conception of their own innocence, and their \"freedom from the kind of nightmares and memories that most others will never know.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The legislative branch did its job to address this public health crisis; now it is time for the executive and judicial branches to step up and do theirs. Otherwise, this Act will remain mandatory in name only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Curiously, the government started by not seeking an award at all (Dkt. 83) and only after the Court reminded it that restitution was mandatory (Dkt. 84) did it request approximately $15,000 to cover the victims' future mental health needs caused by the defendant (Dkt. 85). Now, following the defendant's sentencing, the government recommends that the Court enter a restitution order for $246,286.59. (Dkt. 92.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    This case involves the actual individual that sexually trafficked these children so proximate cause is not an analytical problem. Conversely, in child pornography cases:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    Proximate cause is generally at issue when the defendant is one of many end-users (as opposed to the producer), and it is not clear that the defendant's conduct is either a but-for or proximate cause of the victim's loss.

In child pornography terms, Whitley was not one of thousands of \"end-users\"; instead, he was the sole \"producer\" that victimized these minors.
