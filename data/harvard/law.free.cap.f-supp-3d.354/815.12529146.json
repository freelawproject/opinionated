(Doc. 32). Plaintiffs and County Defendants have informed the Court that the state proceedings requiring abstention under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   are completed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 33 and 34).

Plaintiffs allege that from November 23, 2016 to December 20, 2016, they were denied their fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, control, companionship, and management of Minor Siefert, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 96, 127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2015, the Plaintiffs learned that Minor Siefert was suffering from depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). The Plaintiffs had their long-time pediatrician treat Minor Siefert with medication and therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29). On August 11, 2016, Minor Siefert informed Plaintiffs that Minor Siefert considered themselves to be a transgender child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). Minor Siefert emailed HCJFS on November 11, 2016 and informed HCJFS that they were experiencing transgender thoughts and that Plaintiffs were unsupportive and abusive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). On that same day, Defendant Butler of HCJFS visited Plaintiffs' home and asked Mrs. Siefert questions regarding conditions in the home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). On November 13, Plaintiffs took Minor Siefert to Children's Liberty Township location for psychological evaluation regarding suicidal ideations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). Minor Siefert was ultimately transferred to Children's psychiatry facility at the College Hill location. Plaintiffs went to visit Minor Siefert at Children's College Hill facility on November 15, and received a welcome package that included information regarding Children's policies and guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). The Children's hospital policy provided to Plaintiffs includes a grievance process for handling disagreements with the hospital regarding issues of treatment and discharge. (Doc. 12, Ex. B - Children's Hospital Policy).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that the\n   welcome packet did not include a nineteen-page document titled \"Psychiatry Impatient Admission, A Family Guide,\" which stated that Children's could tell parents that they were not to take their child home if Children's found it unsafe for the child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Plaintiffs allege that they were not told of this policy at the time Minor Siefert was admitted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over the next few weeks, Plaintiffs consulted with HCJFS regarding Minor Siefert's treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). At Plaintiffs' first conference with Defendant Butler, she allegedly explained to Plaintiffs that Children's would not send Minor Siefert home without permission from HCJFS, and if Plaintiffs could not take care of Minor Siefert, HCJFS \"would step in and do it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). Plaintiffs claim they did not \"agree to allow [Children's] and HCJFS to keep Minor Siefert at Children's without their consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 22, a Children's doctor met with a doctor from Humana Behavioral Health (\"Humana\"), the insurance provider for Minor Siefert's treatment, to discuss Minor Siefert's case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46, 51). Based on the meeting with the doctor, Humana determined that Minor Siefert \"had no acute symptoms that require 24 hour care (sic) ... [Minor Siefert] is not a danger to [Minor Siefert] or others. [Minor Siefert] is not aggressive. [Minor Siefert] is medically stable. [Minor Siefert] is not manic.\" Based on this finding, Humana denied coverage for further treatment of Minor Siefert by Children's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On that same day, Plaintiffs met with Children's regarding Minor Siefert's discharge. Plaintiffs allege that Butler and Minor Siefert were supposed to attend the meeting, however Children's told Plaintiffs that Butler would not be available until November 28. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). Plaintiffs complain that Butler was available and was in regular telephone contact with Children's and met with Minor Siefert on November 23. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that starting November 23, Mr. Siefert began leaving voicemail messages with Children's and left calls with HCJFS attempting to have Minor Siefert discharged from Children's to the Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60, 61). Eventually, Kimberly Stephens of Children's spoke with Mr. Siefert by telephone and informed him that Minor Siefert could not be discharged because Minor Siefert was not \"medically cleared\" and that Mr. Siefert would have to contact HCJFS to obtain Minor Siefert's discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65). Plaintiffs allege that on that same day, a Children's doctor wrote in his notes that HCJFS \"gave clear recommendations to not allow patient to be discharged to parents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). While HCJFS allegedly told Plaintiffs that it was \"actively pursuing\" the case throughout the relevant time period, HCJFS never attempted to obtain a court order of custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 28, Plaintiffs, HCJFS, and Children's held another meeting to discuss Minor Siefert's discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69-77). During this meeting, Mr. Siefert asked what the Plaintiffs had to do to have Minor Siefert discharged, and Butler responded, \"[i]t does not work that way,\" and that when Plaintiffs cannot take care of their child, HCJFS has to \"step in.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). In response, Mr. Siefert allegedly demanded that Minor Siefert be discharged and argued that he could go down the hall and take Minor Siefert home, but Children's informed the Plaintiffs that that was not allowed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs had another meeting with Butler and Young of HCJFS on November 30. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-91). Young allegedly explained HCJFS's policy preventing parents from having custody or association with their children when Children's or HCJFS does not approve of releasing the\n   child to the parents, even without the parents' consent or a court order, and that HCJFS has to \"go by what the doctors say.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90). Ultimately, Minor Siefert did not leave Children's until December 20, 2016 when HCFJS and Plaintiffs entered into a voluntary \"Safety Plan\" releasing Minor Siefert to the child's maternal grandparents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the County Defendants violated their procedural and substantive due process rights and violated federal and state civil conspiracy laws. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although Plaintiffs have a strong interest in maintaining familial association with Minor Siefert, Plaintiffs did not lose custody over Minor Siefert during the relevant time period, Plaintiffs voluntarily took Minor Siefert to Children's at their pediatricians' urging, and Children's allowed Plaintiffs to visit Minor Siefert if the child consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regarding the third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the government clearly has a strong interest in protecting children who are at risk. Here, it is undisputed that Minor Siefert reported to HCJFS that Minor Siefert was being abused by the Plaintiffs; that Minor Siefert suffered from depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation ; and that Children's doctors had found that Minor Siefert was not \"medically cleared\" to be discharged. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26, 65). Therefore, County Defendants had a strong interest in protecting Minor Siefert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the Court must consider the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used. \"[T]he state must provide clear and effective procedures in ensuring that a parent's interest in their children is not unduly obstructed.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Ohio Dec. 14, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   There is no dispute that Minor Siefert was voluntarily admitted to Children's on November 13, 2016. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32). Plaintiffs do not allege that County Defendants had legal custody or attempted to obtain legal custody of Minor Siefert during the time in question. However, Plaintiffs contend that they were prevented from having Minor Siefert discharged from Children's starting on November 23, 2016 until December 20, 2016 when the Plaintiffs and HCJFS entered into a voluntary safety plan giving Minor Siefert's grandparents custody of the child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96). Plaintiffs were allegedly told that Minor Siefert could not be discharged because she was not medically cleared and HCJFS recommended against discharge to the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   County Defendants note that, although Plaintiffs allege they communicated with HCJFS and Children's throughout the relevant time period that they wanted Minor Siefert discharged, they do not allege that they actually tried to remove Minor Siefert, that they made written demands for her release, or that they filed a grievance under the hospital policies that they received upon Minor Siefert's admission to Children's, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37; Doc. 12, Ex. B - Children's Hospital Policy), or made a written request for Release of Voluntary Patients pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 5122.03. (Doc. 12 at 8-9). County Defendants contend that if any of these steps had been taken by the Plaintiffs, HCJFS would have requested an emergency order from Hamilton County Juvenile Court, but, pursuant to Ohio Juv. R. 6, HCJFS was not allowed to seek an emergency order while Minor Siefert was hospitalized at Children's. Thus, County Defendants argue that Plaintiffs inaction amounts to implied consent to Minor Siefert continuing to reside at Children's, especially because Plaintiffs placed Minor Siefert at Children's out of concern for her safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Williams-Ash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703436\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/596/\">\n    520 F.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2008) is instructive here. In that case, the defendant, an HCJFS employee, removed the Smiths' children from their home without affording the Smiths a hearing. The defendant argued that the Smiths consented, through a safety plan, to removal of their children. The Sixth Circuit cited favorably to Judge Posner's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Dupuy v. Samuels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261022\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/757/\">\n    465 F.3d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2006) in finding that \"hearings are required for deprivations taken over objection, not for steps authorized by consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261022\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/757/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261022\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/757/\">\n    at 761-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Williams-Ash\n   </em>\n   differs in important ways from this action - in particular, in that case, the parents and HCJFS actually entered into a voluntary safety plan, which did not occur here until approximately four weeks after Plaintiffs sought Minor Siefert's discharge from Children's - it is the precedent with the most similar fact pattern to this matter. In both cases, the parents' initial action to relinquish control of their children was voluntary, both set of parents were provided with information necessary to challenge the policies that deprived them of their parental rights, both set of parents retained custody of their children throughout the relevant time period, and a hearing did not occur in either case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sixth Circuit ultimately found that, because the Smiths voluntarily consented to enter into the safety plan and did not utilize the safety plan's clear mechanisms for rescinding the plan, the defendant provided the Smiths\n   with the process they were due. In that case, the court did not even reach the issue of qualified immunity because the appellate court found that the defendant had not violated the Smiths' procedural due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs are unable to meet their burden of demonstrating that the County Defendants violated a clearly established constitutional right. The Plaintiffs fail to cite any case law supporting their theory that a social worker violates a parents' procedural due process rights (1) by not seeking a court custody order to prevent parents from removing a child from the hospital or (2) by investigating child abuse allegations while a child is hospitalized. Considering the Sixth Circuit's finding in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Williams-Ash\n   </em>\n   , this Court cannot conclude that County Defendants have violated a clearly established procedural due process right. The County Defendants therefore are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

The Eighth Circuit provides a helpful explanation for considering qualified immunity for social workers accused of substantive due process violations: \"The need to continually subject the assertion of this abstract substantive due process right to a balancing test which weighs the interest of the parent against the interests of the child and the state makes the qualified immunity defense difficult to overcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomason v.

As discussed earlier, County Defendants were presented with allegations that Plaintiffs had abused Minor Siefert, that Minor Siefert was potentially suicidal, and that doctors at Children's had not medically cleared Minor Siefert for discharge.
