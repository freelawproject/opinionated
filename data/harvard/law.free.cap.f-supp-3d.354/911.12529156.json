One of its affiliates is Carpenters Local 250, which negotiates and administers collective bargaining agreements covering the work performed by employees within Lincolnshire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carpenters represent at least one employee who resides in Lincolnshire, as well\n   as employees who work in the Village.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   O'Brien is a member of Local 150, while Cook is a member of Carpenters Local 250.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Village Board of Trustees and Mayor comprise the corporate authority for Lincolnshire-six Trustees and the Mayor sit on the Village Board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Under Illinois law, the \"corporate authority of each municipality may provide for joining the municipality in membership in the Illinois Municipal League.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; 65 ILCS \u00a7 5/1-8-1. Illinois law describes the IML as \"an unincorporated, nonprofit, nonpolitical association of Illinois cities, villages and incorporated towns\" and states that each municipality \"may provide for the payment of annual membership dues and fees\" to the IML.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IML contains over 1,000 Illinois municipalities as members. [40] \u00b6 20. It collects dues from each of its member municipalities and charges dues payments based upon each municipality's population.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; [40-1] at 3. Lincolnshire pays its dues and other fees to the IML from its general tax revenue. [40] \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Lincolnshire pays dues and other fees to the IML out of its General Fund, the revenue of which comes from a variety of taxes, including utilities taxes, sales taxes, and income taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Between January 1, 2013, and February 12, 2018, Plaintiffs claim Lincolnshire paid the IML at least $ 5,051.00 in dues and fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that although Illinois law describes the IML as a \"nonprofit, nonpolitical association,\" the IML has engaged in targeted lobbying and \"other political activities,\" including making political contributions, that exceed its statutorily authorized purpose. 65 ILCS \u00a7 5/1-8-1 ; [40] \u00b6\u00b6 29-36. For example, Plaintiffs allege that the IML advertises its lobbying efforts, as well as its annual \"Lobby Day\" in Springfield.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; [40-2]. Plaintiffs also point to an e-mail that the IML sent in March 2015 as evidence of impermissible political activities; in the e-mail, the IML allegedly urged Illinois units of government to support Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner's \"Turnaround Agenda\" by adopting local ordinances that would legalize local \"right-to-work\" zones. [40] \u00b6\u00b6 30-33. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the IML acknowledged its correspondence with the Governor's office with these words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Governor's office has asked that we follow-up with mayors and managers on the Turnaround Agenda information and provide a resolution ... that is supportive of his administration's effort to address collective bargaining, unfunded mandates, prevailing wage requirements, workers' compensation costs and legal empowerment zones, among other things noted in the attachment ... [i]f you do adopt it locally, please send me a copy electronically ... and mail me a copy to the Governor's office....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Lincolnshire remains the only local government unit in the state to adopt such a \"right-to-work\" zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intern.

In January of 2018, O'Brien sent a letter to Lincolnshire Mayor Elizabeth Brandt formally requesting a refund of his portion of tax money that funded any lobbying or other political activities, \"including but not limited\n   to his share of dues paid to the IML.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.

Specifically, the court found that the following facts justified applying the government speech doctrine to the MAA: (1) the association was comprised of state municipalities; (2) nearly 100 percent of the state's municipalities were municipal members; and (3) the association's executive committee was comprised exclusively of municipal members, as was its legislative policy committee.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%209246553\">\n    2013 WL 9246553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. And while the\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs argued that the association could not be considered the instrumentality or agent of its members because not all of its members agreed with its policy positions, the court found this argument unpersuasive, because each member was \"entitled to influence the association's policies through internal governance structures, and each member implicitly consent[ed] to be represented by the association simply by joining it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *22. Moreover, \"any municipality that wished to \"terminate its membership in MMA based on a policy disagreement or for any other reason [was] free to do so.\" \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the IML's speech is government speech. The IML exists as a statutorily authorized, unincorporated association comprised solely of elected officials acting on behalf of their\n   municipalities. 65 ILCS \u00a7 5/1-8-1. The relevant Illinois statute explicitly says that the \"member cities, villages, and incorporated towns\" act \"by, through and in the name of such instrumentality ... for the purpose of improving local government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In short, the text of the statute itself demonstrates that the IML is not a private entity, but instead a formal vehicle through which elected officials act together on behalf of their government entities. And like the MAA, the IML's Executive Committee and Legislative Committee are comprised exclusively of municipal members. [40-1] at 4-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that not all municipalities approve of every IML position, making it similar to a private association. [53] at 9. But, as the court in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   emphasized, each municipal member implicitly consented to the IML's representation and can terminate its membership based upon a policy disagreement.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%209246553\">\n    2013 WL 9246553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22. As in any large government entity or organization, the association does not need unanimity on any given policy position to effectively advocate on behalf of its members.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%209246553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to plead private involvement in any of the IML's decisions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   [40]. The organization's actions were entirely within municipal officials' control. 65 ILCS \u00a7 5/1-8-1 ; [40-1] at 4-13. Thus, the IML is not analogous to a private entity subject to the compelled-subsidy doctrine, as in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , and the government speech doctrine applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Speech Does Not Warrant an Exception to the Government Speech Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court turns now to whether the specific speech at issue warrants an exception to the government speech doctrine. Plaintiffs argue that because the IML engaged in political speech, it exceeded its statutory authorization and therefore requires First Amendment scrutiny. [53] at 9. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that \"Lincolnshire's utilization of Plaintiffs' tax dollars to fund the IML's lobbying activities\" is \"not germane to a broader regulatory scheme,\" and thus it must be subject to the compelled-subsidy doctrine under\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   , which held that the State Bar of California could only \"constitutionally fund activities germane to\" its goals of \"regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    496 U.S. at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's assertion of an exception to the government speech doctrine fails to withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After generally describing the IML as a \"nonpolitical\" \"association,\" the Illinois statute explicitly provides that member municipalities (like most local government entities) \"may provide and disseminate information and research services,\" and \"may do all other acts for the purposes of improving\" local government. 65 ILCS \u00a7 5/1-8-1 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ries v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289041\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/242/205/#p215\">\n    242 Ill.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215-216,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=351%20Ill.%20Dec.%20135\">\n    351 Ill.Dec. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=950%20N.E.2d%20631\">\n    950 N.E.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ill. 2011) (\"If [statutory] language is clear and unambiguous, we are not at liberty to depart from the language's plan meaning.\"). As such, the law permits the IML members to take public policy positions on, and disseminate information about, methods of improving local government (including here, portions of the Governor's legislative agenda, supposedly designed to improve local government).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Page v.

City of Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464810\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/620/#p625\">\n    462 F.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (6th Cir. 2006) (declining to carve out an election-based exception to the government speech doctrine in a case where a city council spent public funds to oppose a series of ballot initiatives);\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%209246553\">\n    2013 WL 9246553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *22 (\"[I]t is undisputed that MMA's advocacy activities [lobbying against citizen initiatives to control or limit state and municipal taxes] related to initiatives that it perceived would have serious consequences for municipal governments\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In short, the operative complaint fails to allege unauthorized political speech for purposes of the compelled-subsidy doctrine. If the Village of Lincolnshire's residents disagree with its decision to join the IML based upon this activity, they can express this opinion at the ballot box, or limit the conduct of elected officials by law, regulation, or practice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Southworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/\">\n    529 U.S. at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the government speaks ... it is, in the end, accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This Court finds the IML's speech exempt from first Amendment scrutiny as government speech, and thus dismisses with prejudice Plaintiffs' First Amendment free speech and concomitant association claim (Counts I and II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition to their First Amendment theory, Plaintiffs bring an equal protection claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that because \"under existing federal law, union members are able to object to and opt out of paying union dues spent on political causes with which they disagree,\" Lincolnshire \"denies Plaintiffs equal protection of the law by compelling them to support political activities with which they disagree while allowing others to refuse to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-53. Plaintiffs' equal protection claim thus remains dependent upon this Court finding that Lincolnshire unconstitutionally compelled them to support political activities with which they disagreed. But because Plaintiffs First Amendment claims fail for the reasons discussed above, they failed to establish that they are not legally required to pay their municipal taxes to Lincolnshire. Therefore, Plaintiffs' equal protection claim must also be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiffs' State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The \"general rule is that, when all federal-law claims are dismissed before trial,\" the pendent claims should be left to the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Associated Insurance Cos. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840572\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/1244/#p1252\">\n    29 F.3d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1252 (7th Cir. 1994). When determining how best to exercise its discretion regarding the application of this general rule, this Court considers \"the nature of the state law claims at issue, their ease of resolution, and the actual, and avoidable, expenditure of judicial resources,\" among other factors.\n   <em>\n    Timm v. Mead Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844466\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/273/#p277\">\n    32 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (7th Cir. 1994). Given that Plaintiffs' federal claims have been dismissed before trial, and the ease with which an Illinois court can address Plaintiffs' remaining state law claims, this Court declines to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over their remaining state law claims (Counts IV and V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons explained above, this Court grants Defendants' joint motion to dismiss with prejudice. [50]. All dates and deadlines are stricken. Civil case terminated.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    On December 4, 2018, the parties filed a joint memorandum to address the fact that Plaintiff O'Brien moved outside of Lincolnshire after filing the TAC on June 19, 2018. [82] at 1. Specifically, O'Brien moved outside of Lincolnshire village limits on August 29, 2018.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844466\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/273/#p277\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The parties do not dispute, however, that O'Brien was a resident taxpayer at the time the alleged injuries occurred.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844466\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/273/#p277\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And as discussed below, this Court finds that O'Brien, as a resident taxpayer, has standing to bring suit against Defendants. Thus, this Court finds that O'Brien's recent change in residence does not affect standing for purposes of the motion to dismiss.

An organization has associational standing if: \"(1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\"\n    <em>\n     Milwaukee Police Ass'n v.

Here, the first two prongs are easily met, as O'Brien and Cook are members of the Unions, and right-to-work zones directly implicate Unions. Similarly, the third prong is met where, as here, \"the organization seeking standing is joined in suit with its members who have Article III standing.\"\n    <em>\n     Flynn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275918\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/636/#p639\">\n     863 F.3d at 640\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
