D.E. 1-3, \u00b6 1; D.E. 38 \u00b6 1; D.E. 1-2 p. 19-21. In the Article, BuzzFeed described the Dossier as a compilation of memoranda assembled \"for political opponents of Trump by a person who is understood to be a former British Intelligence agent.\" D.E. 1-2 p. 20. One memorandum, dated December 13, 2016, contains statements about Plaintiffs. As published by BuzzFeed, the pertinent portion of that memorandum appeared as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Redacted] reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership. Entities linked to one Alexei GUBAROV\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [sic] were involved and he and another hacking expert, both recruited under duress by the FSB,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Seva KAPSUGOVICH were significant players in this operation.

It was important in this event that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that cyber and other operators were stood down/able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces. (We reported earlier that the involvement of political operatives Paul MANAFORT and Carter PAGE in the secret TRUMP-Kremlin liaison had been exposed in the media in the run-up to Prague and that damage limitation of these also was discussed by COHEN with the Kremlin representatives).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   D.E. 1-3. \u00b6 26, D.E. 1-2 p. 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Article included the following disclaimers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The dossier, which is a collection of memos written over a period of months, includes specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations....

D.E. 1-3 \u00b6 27. Plaintiffs also allege that although BuzzFeed tasked its reporters with investigating the allegations, Defendants never contacted Plaintiffs to determine whether the allegations that they hacked the Democratic Party had merit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, D.E. 38 \u00b6 28. Plaintiffs assert that because Defendants could not verify the Dossier and knew that it contained \"some clear errors,\" Defendants published it without reasonable care for, or with reckless disregard as to the truth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. They go on to allege that Defendants' decision to publish the Dossier defamed them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants assert, among other affirmative defenses, that Plaintiffs are public figures and thus are required to prove actual malice.

D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 3. Over the next decade or so, Gubarev and his team grew Webzilla and started other computer hosting companies, including Servers.com.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. All of these companies operate under the umbrella of XBT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beginning in 2012, XBT and Webzilla began to circulate press releases using a London-based company, Marketwired, which circulates press releases worldwide. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 19. In a 2014 press release, Webzilla described itself as a peer of giant companies like Netflix, Google, and Akamai.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. That same year, XBT issued a press release about its acquisition of a website called DDoS.com, which it described as improving XBT's ability to deal with online security threats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Then in 2015, XBT issued a press release about a service called SecureVPN, which it described as a \"unique version of online safety and help with internet protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2015, Servers.com hired a public relations firm, Cutler PR, to generate publicity. D.E. 211-2. \u00b6 9. It was the first of XBT's subsidiaries to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Servers.com let Cutler decide what media they would target.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Cutler proposed drafting articles for industry trade publications. D.E. 211-12, p. 61. Cutler described the articles as \"not generally profile stories of the company,\" but rather, representative of \"the company's views (as articulated through a senior executive) on a particular topic in the industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Their purpose was to show that Servers.com and its executives were experts in the field of data hosting and thus to add to their credibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Cutler persuaded several publications to publish op-ed style articles promoting Servers.com. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 30. One publication, called\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   , described Servers.com as one of \"18 Tech Companies to Get Excited About,\" and noted that Servers.com \"boasts super-secure servers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Cutler claimed responsibility for that publicity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Servers.com was unsatisfied with Cutler's efforts, and so suspended its services after only five months. D.E. 211-2. \u00b6 16. Four months after that, Servers.com retained a new public relations firm, KGlobal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. KGobal was retained for the sole purpose of increasing Servers.com's sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As with Cutler, Servers.com deferred to KGlobal's advice about public relations strategy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Part of this strategy involved trying to convince various publications to write profiles Gubarev.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Gubarev specifically requested that his name be included in the articles. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 52. To some publications, KGlobal called Gubarev \"a great resource for stories about the Russian tech, startup and business scene....\" D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 19; D.E. 211-14, p. 2. To others, it simply referred to him as the CEO of Servers.com and offered to introduce the publication to that company's services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These efforts resulted in interviews with\n   <em>\n    AppMasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Business Insider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    VentureBeat\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Tech Insider. Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20; D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 55. KGlobal provided training to Gubarev and other executives on \"how to talk to a journalist.\" D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 50. KGlobal also assisted Servers.com in issuing press releases; some of which were republished by online publications. D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The relationship between Servers.com and KGlobal lasted only about three months; Gubarev terminated it after concluding that KGlobal was not generating sufficient publicity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Besides these two relationships with public relations firms, Gubarev and XBT's various subsidiaries have been referenced in a few other publications which discussed a photography app that they created and Gubarev's professional success.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; D.E. 211-15. They have also won awards as hosting providers and were interviewed by internet hosting trade publications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25. Additionally, Gubarev and XBT's subsidiaries appeared at or sponsored events related to their businesses. D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Business Outreach In Russia\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In or around 2015, as XBT began expanding its business into Russia, that country enacted a data privacy law. D.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   212-2 \u00b6 32. Gubarev thought the new law was a business opportunity for XBT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. XBT issued a press release describing its entrance into the Russian data storage market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35; D.E. 212-49. Gubarev and other XBT executives spoke to the press about the Russian law and XBT's entrance into Russia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. In interviews, Gubarev mentioned that botnets were infecting cloud servers with increasing frequency and that control and security were key factors in choosing a server host.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Gubarev also gave a press conference announcing the launch of Servers.com in Russia, which received coverage from one Russian website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39; D.E. 212-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Gubarev also spoke at a 2016 conference called the Russian Internet Forum about trends in global and Russian internet infrastructure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Servers.com (using its Russian name, Servers.ru) was a sponsor of the forum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     The AWMOpen Conference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Beginning in the early 2000s and ending in the early 2010s, one of Gubarev's companies organized and operated a conference for adult webmasters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 26; D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 4. Gubarev and other XBT executives attended the conference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 26. And in 2006, Gubarev started a company that founded\n   <em>\n    AWMOpen Magazine. Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Webzilla sponsored the conference. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 6. Other sponsors included (at various times) a company called McColo and another called 3fn.net.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Public Statements During and After the 2016 Election\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The\n     <em>\n      Slate\n     </em>\n     Article\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 31, 2016,\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   published a story about possible communication between a computer server associated with the Trump campaign and computer servers associated with a Russian bank called Alfa Bank. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 56. On November 1, a\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   reporter to whom Gubarev had previously promoted Servers.com contacted Gubarev.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57; D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 29. He asked Gubarev, \"as a specialist,\" to help him \"sort out [the] technical details\" of the cyber-contacts described in the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.E 212-90. Gubarev asked an employee of XBT to analyze the technical claims in the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article (Gubarev himself lacked expertise on the issue) and then forwarded the reporter what he described as an \"expert conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85; D.E. 211-2 \u00b6 31. Gubarev said, \"[o]ur opinion is that the story was far-fetched f* *k.\" D.E. 212-90. The opinion doubted that the sources cited in the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article could have had access to the full server logs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After providing the requested analysis, Gubarev asked the reporter, \"[w]ill there be a reference for us in the article?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The reporter responded that he would use the provided quotes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And indeed, when\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   published the article it credited Gubarev with raising the question of whether the sources cited in the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article based their conclusions on full and complete server logs. D.E. 212-83. The\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   article did not cite Gubarev's opinion in support of any other statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The White Ops Report\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In December 2016, a cybersecurity firm called White Ops published a report detailing an alleged fraud perpetrated by Russian cybercriminals, which it dubbed \"Methbot.\" D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 64; 212-93. The White Ops report alleged that Russian cybercriminals were siphoning millions of dollars in advertising revenue from U.S. media companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The report generated media coverage in several publications including\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fortune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    CNN.

XBT realized that it could face significant reputational damage if journalists discovered that it owned those servers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Accordingly, it rehired KGlobal to help minimize any bad press.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KGlobal advised that in light of the recent controversy over Russian hacking in the presidential election, it was important to \"get in front of the story.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   XBT instructed KGlobal to reach out to White Ops and a journalist who had written about the report to say that Plaintiffs were also victims of the Methbot scam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.

Plaintiffs argue that the controversy should be defined as an international conspiracy of the FSB to enlist computer hackers to infiltrate the Democratic Party in an attempt to undermine the 2016 presidential election. They also argue that the Court could take a broader view of the controversy and define it as Russia's attempts to interfere with the 2016 election.

The first is an article written in 2006, which discusses, among other things, how certain Russian individuals make money selling pornography, music, and spam mailing services. D.E. 212-21.

D.E. 212-123-213-130; 212-130. The NCCIC report goes beyond the DNC hack to detail Russian cyber interference with governmental, political, and private entities to interfere with the 2016 election. D.E. 212-130. Additionally, several articles from the early and mid-2000s discuss child pornography websites and the difficulties of policing them. D.E. 212-131-212-134; 212-142.

The record reveals only one instance where Plaintiffs commented on that controversy: Gubarev's statement, published by\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   , calling into question whether the sources cited in the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article based their conclusions on full server logs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 212-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To recap, in October 2016,\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   published an article about possible communications between a computer server associated with the Trump campaign and servers associated with a Russian bank. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 56.

D.E. 212-90. Gubarev had an XBT employee analyze the technical claims and provided the reporter with his opinion that the\n   <em>\n    Slate\n   </em>\n   article was far-fetched.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507043,1287924\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/627/1287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   reporter subsequently published the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Alexey [sic] Gubarev, chief executive officer of Luxembourg-registered XBT holding, which owns the infrastructure-as-a-service provider Servers.com, told me there was no legitimate way to get access to the full server logs of a server that you do not control.

Rather, it is a technical opinion about whether someone could have reviewed the full logs of a campaign server, which may have been in communication with the servers at a Russian bank. This one technical opinion cannot reasonably be read as an attempt to influence the outcome of the public debate\n   about Russian interference in the election.

Those cases are unpersuasive because each of the plaintiffs there was significantly more involved in the controversy than Plaintiffs here. In\n   <em>\n    Colodny v. Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano &amp; Hatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653810\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/936/917/\">\n    936 F.Supp. 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. 1996), for example, the relevant controversy was the Watergate scandal and the plaintiff wrote a book about it. In\n   <em>\n    Faltas v. State Newspaper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464527\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/928/637/\">\n    928 F.Supp. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.S.C. 1996),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20F.3d%20557\">\n    155 F.3d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1998), the controversy was what should be taught about homosexuality and whether the rights of homosexuals could be restricted. The plaintiff there wrote a newspaper op-ed arguing that homosexuality was rarer than science suggested. Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Diaz v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of S. Brunswick\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A.05-4667( ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203490339\">\n    2006 WL 3490339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.N.J. Dec. 1, 2006), the controversy was the 2004 presidential election, and the plaintiff gave interviews for two newspaper articles and appeared on the Fox News television program \"Good Morning America\" where she claimed to have been fired for her political views. In each of these cases, the plaintiffs' public statements were not only more extensive than Gubarev's but were also aimed more precisely at the heart of the relevant controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants have also proffered substantial evidence of other public statements by Plaintiffs that were not related to Russian interference in the election. The Court will briefly address those statements and explain why they are not germane. First, Plaintiffs' public statements related to cybercrime and cybersecurity do not relate to Russian interference in the election. As discussed above, Defendants argue that the controversy should include cybersecurity and cybercrime generally. Accordingly, they argue that all of Plaintiffs' efforts to publicize their expertise, market share, and secure servers made them intimately involved with those controversies. If the public controversy was defined so broadly, then Defendants would stand on firmer ground. But the controversy is narrower than that. Plaintiffs' public involvement in cybersecurity and cybercrime issues, therefore, is not germane unless it is tied to Russian interference with the election. And, with the exception of Gubarev's comments published in\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   , they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The same goes for Plaintiffs involvement with the AWMOpen Conference. Even assuming that Defendants' version of the facts is correct-that the conference was for online pornographers and that some of\n   the participants were involved in cybercrime (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 212-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4-18)-general involvement with the online pornographic industry (legal or otherwise) is not germane to Russian interference with the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Likewise, Plaintiffs' efforts to minimize reputational damage after the White Ops report are not germane. The White Ops report alleged that Russian cybercriminals were stealing advertising revenue from U.S. media companies. D.E. 212-2 \u00b6 64. Although relevant to cybercrime in general, it is not relevant to Russian interference with the 2016 election. In sum, with the exception of the\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   article, Defendants have not identified any other public involvement by Plaintiffs in the relevant controversy. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not public figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     The Alleged Defamation Is Germane to Plaintiffs' Participation in the Controversy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because Plaintiffs were only tangential participants in the relevant controversy, the final prong of the limited-public figure test is largely a moot point, but in the interest of completeness, the Court will briefly address it. The final prong asks whether the alleged defamation was germane to Plaintiffs' participation in the controversy.\n   <em>\n    Silvester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549936\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/1491/#p1494\">\n    839 F.2d at 1494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The standard is whether it is \"wholly unrelated.\"\n   <em>\n    Waldbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507043,1287924\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/627/1287/\">\n    627 F.2d at 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To recap, the alleged defamation here is the following statement from the Dossier:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Redacted] reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership. Entities linked to one Alexei GUBAROV [sic] were involved and he and another hacking expert, both recruited under duress by the FSB, Seva KAPSUGOVICH were significant players in this operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   D.E. 1-3. \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs' participation in the relevant controversy was Gubarev's one statement published in\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg.\n   </em>\n   D.E. 212-83;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV, above. The alleged defamation and Gubarev's statement are both related to Russian interference in the election, even though their relation to one another is remote. But again, because Plaintiffs were only tangential participants in the controversy, they are not limited public figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiffs' Motion (D.E. 208) is GRANTED; Defendants' Motion (D.E. 225) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    18th\n   </em>\n   day of December, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    FSB refers to the Russian intelligence service.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \"COHEN\" refers to Michael Cohen, then-candidate Donald Trump's lawyer.

D.E. 212-6, 115:10-14. And one of the conference announcements attached to Defendants' statement of facts says that conference welcomes attendees from \"various areas of online businesses.\" D.E. 212-11, p.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Indeed, it would be impossible to analyze the second\n    <em>\n     Gertz\n    </em>\n    factor without first isolating the controversy at issue and determining Plaintiffs' involvement in it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Moreover, they are not controversies in the normal sense of that word.
