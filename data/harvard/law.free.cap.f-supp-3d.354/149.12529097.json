BULSARA, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jose Sanaicela Lemache (\"Sanaicela\") commenced this action against Tunnel Taxi Management, LLC, Millennium Taximeter Corp., Skilman Consulting Corp., Taxopark Garage Inc., Evgeny A. Friedman, and Mamed Dzhaniyev on October 17, 2017 seeking damages for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and the New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\"). (Compl., Dkt. No. 1). No Defendant appeared and the Clerk of Court entered a default\n   against all Defendants on March 12, 2018. (Entry of Default, Dkt. No. 16). Sanaicela then moved for a default judgment against all Defendants on August 15, 2018. (Mot. for Default Judgment, Dkt. No. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 23, 2018, Attorney Raymond J. Cardinelli filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Defendant Dzhaniyev. (Notice of Appearance, Dkt. No. 22). On September 21, 2018, Sanaicela and Dzhaniyev filed a Stipulation withdrawing the motion for default judgment against Dzhaniyev only, vacating the Clerk's default against him, and extending his time to answer the Complaint. (Stipulation, Dkt. No. 24). The Court approved the Stipulation on September 27, 2018, (Stipulation and Order, Dkt. No. 25), and Dzhaniyev subsequently filed an Answer, (Dkt. No. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 26, 2018, the motion for default judgment was referred by the Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall to the undersigned for report and recommendation. Therefore, the Court has before it a motion for default judgment pending against several non-appearing parties, while one party, Dzhaniyev, is actively litigating. For the reasons stated below, the Court recommends that the motion for default judgment be denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Frow v. De La Vega\n   </em>\n   , decided in 1872, the Supreme Court explained that in a multi-defendant case where defendants are alleged to be\n   <em>\n    jointly\n   </em>\n   liable, entering a default judgment runs the risk of inconsistent judgments.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    82 U.S. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    15 Wall. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    21 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1872). That is, there is a risk that the defaulting party is held liable, while the non-defaulting party that litigates is found not liable. Such a result is inconsistent because joint liability requires all defendants to be liable for any one of them to be liable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If the court in such a case as this can lawfully make a final decree against one defendant separately, on the merits, while the cause was proceeding undetermined against the others, then this absurdity might follow: there might be one decree of the court sustaining the charge of joint fraud committed by the defendants; and another decree disaffirming the said charge, and declaring it to be entirely unfounded, and dismissing the complainant's bill.\"). The proper course in such a situation is to postpone decision on the default judgment until the case against the litigating party concludes; if the litigating party loses, the default judgment can then be entered against the non-appearing party, and if the litigating party wins, the default judgment motion should be denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[I]f the suit should be decided against the complainant on the merits, the bill will be dismissed as to all the defendants alike-the defaulter as well as the others.

But what is\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   liability? A claim is one for joint liability where \"as a matter of law, no one defendant may be liable unless all defendants are liable, or ... when the nature of the relief demanded is such that, in order to be effective, it must be granted against each and every defendant.\" 10 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 55.36 (3d ed. 2018). Said differently, \"[j]oint or common liability arises when a tortious act is committed by several persons acting in concert.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Uranium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386880\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/1248/#p1257\">\n    617 F.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1257 (7th Cir. 1980).

When one defendant defaults on a joint liability claim, entering the default judgment prematurely raises the spectre of an inconsistent judgment. Although the defaulting defendant is found liable, the other litigating defendant could subsequently be found not liable, even though the nature of the claim requires each and every defendant to be liable for any one of them to be liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Frow\n   </em>\n   rule-that in a multi-defendant case, a default judgment should not be entered until litigation has completed against all parties-does not apply simply because there are multiple defendants in the case. In this Circuit, \"at most,\n   <em>\n    Frow\n   </em>\n   controls in situations where the liability of one defendant necessarily depends upon the liability of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Controls Corp. v.

The \"several\" in \"joint and several\" liability refers to individual liability, a liability not dependent on the actions of others.\n   <em>\n    In re Uranium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386880\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/1248/#p1257\">\n    617 F.2d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A claim alleging \"joint and several liability\" is one where any defendant can be liable to the plaintiff in two ways: (1) regardless of whether any other defendant is liable (\"several\" or individual liability) or (2) where the defendant acted in concert with each and every defendant (\"joint\" liability). When a claim alleges joint and several liability and one defendant is found liable and other defendants are not, the two judgments are not inconsistent. That is because although the theory of \"joint\" liability has failed, the theory of \"several\" liability permits one defendant to be liable, even when the others are not.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386880\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/1248/#p1257\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"When [joint and several] liability coexist in a single claim, ...

Such a finding of liability as to nine defendants is not inconsistent with a finding of no liability as to the other twenty, because liability is potentially 'several' as well as 'joint.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The present action is a FLSA case alleging a theory of joint and several liability, namely that all Defendants were joint employers of Sanaicela.

For example, the corporate Defendants could be liable for FLSA violations, even though the individual Defendant Dzhaniyev is not because he lacked sufficient control over the corporation to be deemed Sanaicela's employer.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salinas v.

As a consequence, this case does not fit neatly within\n   <em>\n    Frow\n   </em>\n   , since it alleges joint and several liability-not exclusively joint liability-and it is possible and consistent to hold the defaulting corporations liable even if Dzhaniyev is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Courts in this Circuit have routinely declined to apply\n   <em>\n    Frow\n   </em>\n   in cases asserting joint and several liability, and proceeded to decide the default judgment motion while other parties are litigating.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bleecker v.

Were the Court to decide the default judgment motion, it would be in the position of calculating damages twice: first in resolving the default judgment application and then, if Dzhaniyev is found liable, at the completion of his case. This is both inefficient and potentially leads to two awards of unpaid wages that are at odds, even though it would be based on the same work performed by Sanaicela.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viznai v.

A determination of liability against the defaulting Defendants does nothing for Sanaicela. Without a damages calculation to accompany the liability determination, no final judgment could be entered in his favor, and there could be no enforceable judgment that Sanaicela could attempt to collect. It would only be a partial resolution of the pending motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, no discernable prejudice accrues to Sanaicela, since resolving liability against the defaulting Defendants does not assist him in litigating the case against Dzhaniyev. He would still have to prove that Dzhaniyev himself violated FLSA by failing to pay him overtime. In other words, Sanaicela would still have to prove that Dzhaniyev employed him and Dzhaniyev violated FLSA by not paying proper wages. The allegations in the Complaint that treat Defendants collectively may be accepted as true for purposes of default judgment, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 6 (\"Defendants failed to maintain accurate recordkeeping of [plaintiff's] hours worked, and failed to pay Plaintiff Sanaicela the additional overtime premium for any hours worked over 40.\") ), but they would not be assumed true for the purposes of litigation between Sanaicela and Dzhaniyev. Any liability determination on default is based solely on the complaint and made solely for the purpose of calculating damages. Such a liability determination has no collateral estoppel or law of the case effect on the parties who are actually appearing.\n   <em>\n    Associated Int'l Ins. Co. v.

Here, the default judgments were entered against the Defaulting Defendants for failure to respond, and in no way constitute decisions on the merits of Maersk's claims. And, while Magistrate Eaton properly accept[ed] as true all of the facts alleged ... he did so merely for purposes of determining damages.
