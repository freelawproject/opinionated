TIGAR, United States District Judge\n   On November 19, 2018, the Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the implementation of a joint interim final rule promulgated by the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security. ECF No. 43. That rule allows asylum to be granted only to those who cross the southern border under conditions set by the President. Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection Claims,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 55,934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 9, 2018) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 208, 1003, 1208) (the \"Rule\"). Combined with the terms of a concurrently-enacted Presidential Proclamation, the Rule denies asylum to anyone who crosses the southern border anywhere besides a designated port of entry, even if he or she has a meritorious asylum claim. The Court concluded that the Rule is probably invalid because it directly conflicts with a statute passed by Congress; that there were serious questions whether the Rule was passed without the required procedural protections; and that allowing the Rule to go into effect would harm both asylum seekers with legitimate claims and the organizations who represent them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants now ask the Court to stay its ruling and allow the Rule to go into effect while they appeal the Court's temporary restraining order to the Ninth Circuit. The law provides that the Court should only grant a stay if the Defendants can show they are likely to win their appeal or if the balance of harms tips in their favor. Defendants have not met this burden. They still have not shown that the Rule is a lawful exercise of Executive Branch authority or that any significant harm will accrue from continuing to implement the existing immigration laws passed by Congress, which is what the temporary restraining order requires. Nor have Defendants rebutted the significant harms that will be suffered by asylum seekers with legitimate claims and the organizations that assist them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion for stay will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A district court has the power to stay proceedings \"incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for [the] litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    Landis v.

In exercising its discretion, the Court must consider four factors: \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the movant \"must show that irreparable harm is probable and either: (a) a strong likelihood of success on the merits and that the public interest does not weigh heavily against a stay; or (b) a substantial case on the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in the [movant's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Leiva-Perez v.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their motion for stay, Defendants argue that they are likely to prevail on appeal for two main reasons: (1) the case is not justiciable because the Plaintiff Immigration Organizations do not have standing to bring their claims; and (2) the Court incorrectly found that the Rule was probably invalid. The Court is not persuaded by these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to the first point, Defendants have not carried their burden to show a substantial case that this action is not justiciable. First, Defendants argue that any injury is not traceable to the Rule because the Rule does not cause the \"metering\" practices that interfere with the Immigration Organizations' functions. ECF No. 52 at 6-7. The Court rejects this argument because a litigant \"need not eliminate any other contributing causes to establish its standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnum Timber Co. v. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090871\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/894/#p901\">\n    633 F.3d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (9th Cir. 2011). Moreover, the express purpose of the Rule is to \"channel [asylum seekers] to ports of entry,\" by removing alternative avenues to apply for asylum, thereby exposing asylum seekers to the Government's practices.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 55,934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55,934 (Nov. 9, 2018). Defendants also suggest - with no citation to any authority - that it is irrelevant whether this interferes with the Immigration Organizations' ability to provide their services, so long as they can still do so to some degree. ECF No. 52 at 6-7. This overlooks well-established binding precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833485\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/936/#p943\">\n    657 F.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc);\n   <em>\n    Constr.

As an initial matter, Defendants assert that this argument was improperly raised for the first time on reply. ECF No. 52 at 5-6. As noted in the Court's temporary restraining order, Defendants neither requested an opportunity to respond nor raised an objection at the hearing on the TRO, even though Plaintiffs not only made these\n   points in their reply brief but argued them at the hearing. ECF No. 43 at 7 n.8; ECF No. 45 at 50:9-51:6. The Court therefore exercised its discretion to consider the Immigration Organization's third-party standing argument. ECF No. 43 at 7 n.8. The Court likewise now exercises its discretion to consider Defendants' prudential standing objections raised for the first time in their stay motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contest only whether there is \"some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Powers v.

Any asylum seeker who enters the United States in violation of the Rule in order to contest its validity undertakes a substantial risk of forfeiting an otherwise meritorious asylum claim. As Justice Scalia noted in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \"where threatened action by government is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    549 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). On the other hand, an asylum seeker who endures the wait to apply for asylum at a designated port of entry complies with the Rule - and may therefore lack standing to challenge its validity. Therefore, as a matter of logic, the only way for an asylum seeker to assert the invalidity of the Rule is to risk summary removal or to forego applying for asylum for the lifespan of the litigation. And the Supreme Court has permitted\n   attorneys to assert their clients' rights without naming them as parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/\">\n    491 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   623 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, notwithstanding their citations to various jurisdictional provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Defendants do not argue that they preclude review of Plaintiffs' claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").
