Plaintiffs entered into its most recent food services contract with the Government in July of 2016.

It also appears that the total bid is potentially meaningless. Under the Government's indefinite delivery-indefinite quality (\"IDIQ\") contract, Plaintiffs are paid monthly based on the number of meals served. The contract price is not paid based on the bid itself and by necessity varies with the number of meals served and the locations at which they are served. The Government gives as its reasoning for not exercising the third-year option on Plaintiffs' contract on the fact that the projected monthly cost would exceed the total bid over the full thirty-five-month period. Again, based on the evidence obtained by the Court, this situation appears to arise from the Government's failure to project accurately the number of meals served and the number of locations. At this point it further appears from the evidence, at least as to the number of meals to be served, that it is again underestimated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, it does not appear to the Court that the competitive range as to the overall price has been accurately projected, thus making the Government's determination procedurally deficient as well as substantively questionable. The importance of the requirement that the Contracting Officer meet with the Plaintiffs is made clear by Mr. Lee's testimony that based upon current information, the number of meals, and potentially the number of locations, may have been substantially understated in the Government's projections. The Government argues that it will potentially cost the Government a significantly extra monthly cost based upon Plaintiff's existing contract as opposed to the lower bid of the proposed new contract. In weighing the evidence on this issue, the Court should consider the prospective meal costs under the existing contract, the proposal Plaintiff's proposal for a new contract, as well as under the bid which the Government proposes to accept\n   effective January 1, 2019. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs and Defendant to furnish that information as to Plaintiffs' current contract as well as its bid for the new contract by Tuesday, December 11, 2018.
