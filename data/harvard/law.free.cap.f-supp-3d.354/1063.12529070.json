Plaintiffs assert claims under the California Unfair Competition Law, Ca. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"UCL\"), based on Chase's alleged violation of a California law requiring mortgage lenders to pay interest to mortgagors on funds held in escrow accounts for residential mortgages. Currently pending before the Court is Chase's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay the case. Docket No. 38 (\"Mot.\"). For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES as moot\n   </strong>\n   the motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Consolidated Class Action Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiffs took out mortgage-secured loans from Washington Mutual Bank (\"WaMu\"), a federal savings bank, between 2005 and the end of 2007. Docket No. 37 (Consolidated Class Action Complaint, hereinafter \"Con. Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9, 13. When WaMu failed in 2008, its assets, including Plaintiffs' mortgages, were acquired by Chase via the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; Mot. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The mortgage agreements at issue required Plaintiffs to make payments into escrow accounts held by the lender, in order to cover any potential taxes and\n   assessments, leasehold payments, and insurance premiums on the property. Con. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10, 14. Plaintiffs have each made payments into the escrow accounts as required, but have never received any interest on the escrow funds from Chase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11, 14. The mortgage agreement contains a provision addressing interest on escrow accounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds [in the escrow account], Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Docket No. 38-2, Exhs. A-F \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Chase's failure to pay escrow interest on their mortgage accounts violates California Civil Code \u00a7 2954.8 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d(g). Con. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37. According to Plaintiffs, these violations constitute \"unlawful\" conduct within the meaning of the UCL. They also assert that Chase's alleged conduct violates the \"unfair\" prong of the UCL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff McShannock and Plaintiff Chandler initially filed separate class action suits against Chase asserting the same underlying claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19 (Motion to Relate Case). The parties stipulated to consolidate the two cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33. In the ensuing Consolidated Complaint, Plaintiffs proposed the following class for certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All mortgage loan customers of Chase (or its subsidiaries), whose mortgage loan is for a one-to-four family residence located in California, and who paid Chase money in advance for payment of taxes and assessments on the property, for insurance, or for other purposes relating to the property, and to whom Chase failed to pay interest as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202954.8\">\n    Cal.

Compl. \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Chase now moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) on two bases: first, that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the provisions in their mortgage contracts requiring them to provide Chase with notice and an opportunity to cure alleged misconduct before bringing a judicial action; and second, that Plaintiffs' state law claims are preempted by the Home Owners' Loan Act. In the alternative, Chase seeks to stay the case pending the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Lusnak v.

Mot. at 4. Under the terms of the notice and cure provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party ... of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Docket No. 38-2, Exhs.

A-F \u00a7 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Consolidated Complaint does not contain any allegation that Plaintiffs have complied with the notice and cure provisions in their Deeds of Trust. Plaintiffs state in their opposition to the motion to dismiss that McShannock and Meky sent notices of dispute to Chase\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Chase moved to dismiss the original complaint and before Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiffs contend Meky gave Chase notice \"on behalf of the class\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he filed his complaint\" because he was not a part of the original action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). According to Plaintiffs, \"Chase rejected these opportunities to cure the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Chase points out, however, Plaintiffs cannot fix their pleading deficiencies by alleging new facts in their opposition brief. \"In determining the propriety of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, a court\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   look beyond the complaint to a plaintiff's moving papers, such as a memorandum in opposition to a defendant's motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Broam v.

Wash. Mar. 8, 2006) (rejecting plaintiff's argument \"that his post-lawsuit notice to Defendant is somehow 'substantial compliance' with the provision\");\n   <em>\n    Kim v. Shellpoint Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15CV611-LAB (BLM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201241541\">\n    2016 WL 1241541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2016) (explaining that accepting plaintiff's notice to defendant \"during the pendency of this action\" would \"gut the 'notice and cure' provision, the purpose of which is to give each party an opportunity to cure problems and prevent the need for litigation\"). McShannock's post-suit notice is therefore ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nor would the purported notice given by Meky \"on behalf of the class\" suffice, even though he joined as a plaintiff after the original complaint was filed. The notice and cure provision in Plaintiffs' Deeds of Trust specifies that no borrower \"may commence,\n   <em>\n    join, or be joined\n   </em>\n   to any judicial action (as either an individual litigant or\n   <em>\n    the member of a class\n   </em>\n   )\" prior to giving notice. Docket No. 38-2, Exhs. A-F \u00a7 20 (emphases added). The notice provision thus applies to borrowers like Meky who \"join\" the suit after it is initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question therefore becomes whether Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the notice and cure provisions warrants dismissal of their suit. Chase contends that such failure is \"fatal\" to their claims. Mot. at 4. Plaintiffs respond that their \"claims are not predicated on any violation of the mortgage contract, but only on violations of \u00a7 2954.8\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the UCL, and thus the notice and cure provision does not apply. Docket No. 41 (\"Opp.\") at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs' threshold argument that their \"statutory rights under Civil Code section 2954.8(a) and the UCL ... are unwaivable as a matter of public policy\" is without merit. Opp. at 3. Providing notice to Chase pursuant to the notice and cure provision does not foreclose Plaintiffs from vindicating their statutory rights. \"The purpose of this provision is 'to give the allegedly breaching party an opportunity to cure its breach.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sigwart v. U.S. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412965\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/713/535/#p537\">\n    713 F. App'x 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Higley v.

Or. 2012) ). If Chase had been put on notice of its breach and failed to take corrective action, Plaintiffs could then bring suit under \u00a7 2954.8(a) and the UCL. Plaintiffs make no showing that providing such notice would be so burdensome as to impede enforcement of their statutory rights. Requiring compliance with the notice and cure provision therefore is not the equivalent of a coerced waiver of those statutory rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Turning to the merits of the notice and cure question, courts have reached differing conclusions. In\n   <em>\n    Giotta v. Ocwen Financial Corporation\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs sued the defendant companies for allegedly working in concert to charge inflated fees for servicing mortgage loans that were billed through to the homeowners. No. 15-CV-00620-BLF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204447150\">\n    2016 WL 4447150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2016). The plaintiffs' Deeds of Trust contained notice and trust provisions identical in wording to those in this case, and the plaintiffs did not allege that they\n   complied with the provisions before suing the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The district court in\n   <em>\n    Giotta\n   </em>\n   concluded that all of the plaintiffs' claims-including those under the UCL-\"fall squarely within the ambit of the notice-and-cure provision\" because they all \"arise from the property inspections and BPOs obtained by [a defendant] and charged to Plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the Deed of Trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In an unpublished, non-precedential memorandum, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, writing that the suit was a 'judicial action ... that\n   <em>\n    arises from\n   </em>\n   the other party's actions\n   <em>\n    pursuant to\n   </em>\n   this Security Instrument' \" because \"the Deed of Trust authorized property inspections and valuations to protect the Lender's interest in the property and to pass the fees for those services on to the borrower.\"\n   <em>\n    Giotta v.

In\n   <em>\n    Gerber v. First Horizon Home Loans Corporation\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that his mortgage lender charged him a fee not included in his mortgage agreement, and brought causes of action for both breach of contract and violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act. No. 05-1554P,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20581082\">\n    2006 WL 581082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 8, 2006). The court distinguished the causes of action. It dismissed the breach of contract claim for failure to satisfy the notice provision, since the very purpose of the provision was \"to promote the resolution of contractual disputes without the expense of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. In contrast, it found that the state statutory cause of action \"involves allegations of deceptive business practices, clearly exists independent of any contract between the parties,\" and was thus not barred by the plaintiff's failure to give notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Next, the court in\n   <em>\n    Kim v. Shellpoint Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   , held that the notice and cure provision in the plaintiff's deed of trust did not require dismissal of plaintiff's claims under the UCL and the California Homeowners' Bill of Rights because those claims, which challenged mortgage servicing fees, \"arise under statute, not the agreement.\" No. 15CV611-LAB (BLM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201241541\">\n    2016 WL 1241541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.

While the nature of Plaintiffs' claim in this case is somewhat more complicated, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they were not required to give notice to Chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Per the notice and cure provision, Plaintiffs are obligated to give notice in two circumstances: first, where their grievance \"arises from\" Chase's \"actions pursuant to\" the Deeds of Trust, and second, where they \"allege[ ] that [Chase] has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of,\" the Deeds of Trust. Docket No. 38-2, Exhs. A-F \u00a7 20. As to the first prong, the Deeds of Trust provide that, \"Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds [in the escrow account], Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the funds.\" Docket No. 38-2, Exhs. A-F \u00a7 3. The \"Applicable Law\" here is \u00a7 2954.8, which requires lenders to pay two percent interest on escrow funds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202954.8\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 2954.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Deeds of Trust, by incorporating \u00a7 2954.8, arguably require Chase to pay escrow interest to Plaintiffs. Thus, there is a fair argument that Chase's alleged non-payment of escrow interest is not \"pursuant to\" the Deeds of Trust, and Plaintiffs were therefore not required to give notice before bringing this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As to the second prong, Plaintiffs allege that Chase is not complying with its duty to pay escrow interest under \u00a7 2954.8 and the UCL. This statutory duty \"exists independent of any contract between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20581082\">\n    2006 WL 581082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. It is therefore not \"owed by reason of\" the Deeds of Trust. This conclusion comports with the purpose of the notice and cure provision, which is to give the defendant an opportunity to correct conduct that is violating the terms of a contract. As in\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Beyer\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs' claim has an independent basis in statute, not the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, to the extent there is any ambiguity regarding the scope of the notice and cure provision, it must be construed against Chase, the drafter of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201654\">\n    Cal.
