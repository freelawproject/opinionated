CHUTKAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1990, Congress created the EB-5 Immigrant Investor program, which grants the U.S. Department of State (\"State\") the authority to issue visas to foreign investors who contribute a specific amount of capital to U.S. companies and create at least ten U.S. jobs per investment. The statute creating EB-5 visas provides a path towards permanent residency, but it also sets various limits on the number of visas that may be issued each fiscal year. It also accords accompanying spouses and children of EB-5 principals (or those following to join the principals) the same status and order of consideration as the principal investors. Since 1990, State has counted these derivative spouses and children of principal immigrant investors toward the yearly caps on EB-5 visas. Since that time, there have been no legislative, regulatory or judicial objections to State's counting policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, who contend that this counting policy is unlawful, are thirteen Chinese EB-5 investors provisionally representing a class consisting of:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   children of investors who have lost or will lose their status as derivative children (i.e., age out) and the class members they provisionally represent; and American Lending Center LLC (\"ALC\"), which is a U.S.-based regional center sponsor of projects funded with EB-5 investment capital. The Defendants are Michael R. Pompeo, in his official capacity as Secretary of State, Edward J. Ramotowski, in his official capacity as\n   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services, the U.S. Department of State (\"State\"), and the United States of America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for a Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 2 (\"Pls.

By retaining the language pertaining to derivatives from the 1965 Act, Congress signaled that it was not making a monumental shift in immigration law with regard to derivatives. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Lorillard,\n   </em>\n   \"where, as here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186066\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/575/#p580\">\n    434 U.S. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186066\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/575/#p580\">\n    98 S.Ct. 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    b. Legislative History Supports Defendants' Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The legislative history of the 1990 Act further supports the conclusion that Congress intended to continue State's twenty-five-year interpretation of the 1965 Act by counting derivatives towards the caps. Each chamber passed its own bill. The Senate's version of INA \u00a7 203 included a subsection 203(c), which repeated the language on derivatives in the 1965 Act and applied it to each of the preference categories. Immigration Act of 1989, S. 358, 101st Cong. \u00a7 203(c) (as passed by Senate, July 13, 1989), 135 Cong. Rec. S8639-04,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%20181548\">\n    1989 WL 181548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The House bill, however, took a different approach. Importantly, it explicitly exempted derivatives from the cap for employment-based immigrants. Section 101 of the House bill provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (b) ALIENS NOT SUBJECT TO NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS.- The following aliens are not subject to the worldwide levels or numerical limitations of subsection (a): ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (3) An alien who is provided immigrant status under section 203(d) as the spouse or child of an immigrant under section 203(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defs. Opp. at 28. Thus, the Senate version continued to count derivatives towards the cap while the House version explicitly excluded derivatives from the cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   These conflicting approaches are also reflected in the different numerical cap proposals in the House and Senate bills. The Senate proposed 150,000 annual visas. Immigration Act of 1989, S. 358, 101st Cong. \u00a7 201(d) (as passed by Senate, July 13, 1989), 135 Cong. Rec. S8639-04,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%20181548\">\n    1989 WL 181548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The House proposed 65,000 principals. If, as Defendants suggest, each principal brings one or two derivatives,\n   Defs. Opp. at 29-30, it appears that the two chambers were considering similar yearly total numbers of employment-based immigrants; the difference was in whether or not to count derivatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Conference Committee incorporated the Senate's approach and rejected the House's language that specifically exempted employment-based principals' spouses and children from the cap. The Conference Committee also set the employment-based cap at 140,000-just 10,000 fewer than the 150,000 initially proposed by the Senate. The Conference Report explained that the House's proposed cap was based solely on principals and did not include derivative spouses and children. H. Rep. 101-955, 136 Cong. Rec. H13203-01, H13236,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20290409\">\n    1990 WL 290409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 26, 1990) (\"The comparable House number for employment-based immigrants was 187,500, based on 75,000 principals. The House amendment allocated 65,000 employment-based visas during FY1991-96 and 75,000 thereafter (not including numerically exempt derivative spouses and children) ...\"). These references to the House's methodology, based on principals but not derivatives, show that the Committee intended to adopt a methodology for counting based on principals and derivatives. Thus, the court concludes that Congress was aware of, grappled with and ultimately rejected the House's proposal to not count derivatives towards the yearly cap. Although Plaintiffs point the court to various statements made by members of Congress suggesting that derivatives were excluded from the yearly cap, these isolated floor statements carry little weight relative to the decisive language in the Conference Committee Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    c. Because EB-5 Derivatives Are Counted Towards The Country Caps, They Must Also Be Counted Towards The Worldwide Cap\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As noted above, the INA imposes a country cap as well as a worldwide cap. INA \u00a7 202(b) determines which country derivative spouses and children should be assigned to, for purposes of the \u00a7 202(a)(2) country cap, if they are \"accompanying or following to join,\" their investors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20290409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 202(b) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (b) Rules for chargeability\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Each independent country ... shall be treated as a separate foreign state for the purposes of a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2).... For the purposes of this chapter the foreign state to which an immigrant is chargeable shall be determined by birth within such foreign state except that (1) an alien child, when accompanied by or following to join his alien parent or parents, may be charged to the foreign state of either parent if such parent has received or would be qualified for an immigrant visa, if necessary to prevent the separation of the child from the parent or parents, and if immigration charged to the foreign state to which such parent has been or would be chargeable has not reached a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) for that fiscal year; (2) if an alien is chargeable to a different foreign state from that of his spouse, the foreign state to which such alien is chargeable may, if necessary to prevent the separation of husband and wife, be determined by the foreign state of the spouse he is accompanying or following to join, if such spouse has received or would be qualified for an immigrant visa and if immigration charged to the foreign state to which such spouse has been or would be chargeable has not reached a numerical level established under subsection (a)(2) for that fiscal year....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This rule necessarily presumes that derivatives are counted toward the per county\n   cap; otherwise, the question of chargeability would be irrelevant. Because the country cap is a subset of the worldwide caps, the worldwide caps also apply to derivatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   While Plaintiffs agree that EB-5 derivative spouses and children are counted toward the country cap, they dispute that they are also counted toward the worldwide levels. \"[T]here is no statutory reason to suppose that just because spouses and children count against the per country limits of Section 202, they also count against the worldwide limits specified by Section 203.\" Pls. Rep. at 16. However, the court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that derivatives should be counted in the country caps, which are a subset of the worldwide cap, but not in the worldwide caps themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the weakness of this argument, Amicus Curiae Invest in the USA argues that not all derivatives are counted even towards the per country caps because the country caps apply only to derivatives who receive status under INA \u00a7\u00a7 203(a) and 203(b), and not those who receive status under INA \u00a7 203(d). Amici Curiae in Supp. of Pls. (\"Amicus Brief\") at 4-5, ECF No. 27. This argument fails because \u00a7 203(d) does not provide an independent status for derivatives; it accords derivatives the \"same status\" as their principals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In an attempt to show that the country cap applies to some derivatives other than those identified in \u00a7 203(d), Amicus points to minor children and spouses of Legal Permanent Residents (\"LPRs\") in INA \u00a7 203(a)(2)(A). But the family members described in \u00a7 203(a)(2)(A) are not derivatives, and the provision does not contain the language \"accompanying or following to join,\" which is the language \u00a7 202(b) and \u00a7 203(d) use to describe derivatives. Section 203(a)(2)(A) describes children as family-sponsored principal beneficiaries, not as derivatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Amicus also points to spouses and children of special immigrants described in INA \u00a7 101(a)(27). A special immigrant is an employment-based category under \u00a7 203(b)(4). Because \u00a7 101(a)(27) includes the derivative-type language of \"accompanying or following to join\" the principal, Amicus argues that this derivative language would be redundant if \u00a7 203(d) derivatives counted toward the caps. However, this argument fails because the derivative-type language in the special immigrant provision has an independent purpose: It gives certain relatives a greater eligibility to immigrate than they would have if their eligibility depended solely on \u00a7 203(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Are Not Likely To Succeed On The Merits Of Their Argument That State Did Not Comply With The APA's Notice And Comment Requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"Defendants' Counting Policy is also invalid because it does not comply with the APA's procedural notice-and-comment requirements.\" Pls.

First and primarily, they allege that without an injunction their families will be separated because their derivative children will age out and become ineligible for derivative status by the time visas are available and will be unable to join their parents in the United States. Pls. Mot. at 27. Second, Plaintiffs allege irreparable harm to their families' finances, career prospects, and their investments\n   unless the court issues a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs have not carried their considerable burden of demonstrating irreparable harm. Most importantly, they provide no support for their argument that the prospect of family separation constitutes an irreparable harm. Plaintiffs argue that once investors' children age out, the investors are faced with the choice of either immigrating to the United States without their children or staying in China and forgoing the benefit of the EB-5 visa. Pls. Mot. at 26 (\"The parent investor must then face the prospect of immigrating to the United States without her entire family or give up the prospect of immigrating to the United States altogether.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs cite one case in support of their family separation argument,\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12192165\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/1151/#p1169\">\n    847 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (9th Cir. 2017), and their reliance on that case is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , some visa holders were detained and not allowed back in the United States. The Ninth Circuit found that \"[t]he impact of the Executive Order was immediate and widespread. It was reported that thousands of visas were immediately canceled, hundreds of travelers with such visas were prevented from boarding airplanes bound for the United States or denied entry on arrival, and some travelers were detained.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12192165\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/1151/#p1169\">\n    847 F.3d at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those extreme circumstances are far different from the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs proffer three examples of potential family separation in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mot. at 26. First, Plaintiff Fang Wang alleges that after visiting the United States in 2012, his daughter wanted to study, live, and work there. ECF No. 2-2, Ex. 2 to Pls. Mot. (\"Wang Decl.\") at \u00b6 3. In 2014 Wang made an investment through the EB-5 program because he \"wished to provide [his] daughter with a path to U.S. residency and citizenship as a derivative EB-5 applicant, so that she could realize her dreams of living in the U.S.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4-5. Wang states that when he filed an I-526 petition, he believed that his family would be living in the United States before his daughter aged out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Wang and his child are currently living in China.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. But Wang's Declaration does not demonstrate that he will imminently face family separation. The possibility that Wang's daughter might age out does not show that the family will be imminently and irrevocably separated. The other two examples, plaintiffs Jiahong Yang and Hongmei Xiao, both have children who are currently studying in the United States. ECF No. 2-3, Ex. 3 to Pls. Mot. (\"Xiao Decl.\"); ECF No. 2-4, Ex. 4 to Pls. Mot. (\"Yang Decl.\"). While it does appear that Yang's and Hongmei's children will age out, this harm is not \"beyond remediation,\"\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the families can reunite in China if they choose, a solution that is neither unfeasible nor unsafe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   State's counting policy does not, in and of itself, cause family separation. Rather, the causal connection is between the counting policy and the choice investors face if their children age out by the time EB-5 visas become available. Plaintiffs cite no law for the proposition that choosing between immigrating to the United States without their entire families or not immigrating and staying with their entire families constitutes irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that children's aging out irreparably harms family finances and career prospects, that the backlog harms investors' career prospects, and that the counting policy harms the investments themselves. Pls. Mot. at 27-28. These claims are insufficient to establish irreparable harm.

ALC claims that State's counting policy threatens to put it out of business because it relies on Chinese investors to stay in business. Pls. Mot. at 29-30 (\"Without demand for ALC's services from Chinese nationals, the company will be unable to stay in business.\"). Furthermore, ALC argues that the demand among Chinese nationals for EB-5 visas has decreased and attributes this decline in interest to the visa backlog caused by State's counting policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717178,448229\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/259/921/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This argument is unconvincing. While it may be true that ALC has historically relied on Chinese investors, ECF No. 2-5, Ex. 5 to Pls. Mot. (\"Aff. of John Shen\") at \u00b6 6, ALC fails to explain why its business can operate only with Chinese investors. In fact, statements from Plaintiffs indicate that ALC realized the advantage of seeking EB-5 investors in other countries over a year ago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12 (\"In fact, as a result of the drastic fall off of investment from China, we have spent over one million dollars to recruit investors from other countries between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018.\").

The public benefits not just from diversity among countries, but also from the types of visas that are allocated.
