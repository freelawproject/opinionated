The matter is presently before the court on the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, filed by Plaintiff on November 27, 2017 (Dkt. No. 10), and by Defendant on January 19, 2018 (Dkt. No. 11). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion is granted and the Commissioner's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND and FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Michael Anthony McGee (\"Plaintiff\"), brings this action pursuant to the Social Security Act (\"the Act\"), seeking review of the Acting Commissioner of Social Security (\"the Commissioner\" or \"Defendant\") decision denying his application for Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") benefits under Title II of the Act, and Social Security Disability Insurance (\"SSDI\") benefits under Title XVI of the Act, together (\"disability benefits\"). Plaintiff, born on April 22, 1987(R. 78),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges that he became disabled on July 1, 2011, when he sustained injuries from a gunshot wound to his head. (R. 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's application for disability benefits was initially denied by Defendant on December 12, 2011 (R. 78), and, pursuant to Plaintiff's request, administrative hearings were held before Administrative Law Judge Donald T. McDougall (\"ALJ McDougall\" or \"the ALJ\"), on March 11, 2013 and June 17, 2013, in Buffalo, New York, at which Plaintiff, represented by Justin Goldstein, Esq. (\"Goldstein\") appeared and testified. (R. 40-59). Plaintiff's grandmother Helene McGee (\"Ms. McGee\"), also appeared and testified (R. 59-64), along with vocational expert Esperanza Distefano (\"VE Distefano\"). ALJ McDougall rendered a decision denying Plaintiff's claim on June 17, 2013 (R. 23-33), the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review on December 31, 2014 (R. 1-4), and on September 22, 2015, following the filing of Plaintiff's action 15-cv-170S (Dkt. No. 1) on February 26, 2015, challenging Defendant's denial of benefits, upon stipulation by both parties the case was remanded to the Appeals Council. (R. 567-69). On October 22, 2015, the Appeals Council vacated the ALJ's decision, finding that the ALJ's determination that Plaintiff's schizoaffective disorder and adjustment disorder were severe impairments\n   inconsistent with the ALJ's alternate finding that such disorders resulted in only mild limitations to Plaintiff's activities of daily living, and his abilities to maintain social functioning, concentration, persistence or pace. The Appeals Council also ordered the ALJ to evaluate Plaintiff's mental impairments in accordance with the special technique under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.04 paragraph B, further consider the opinion of Aman Sharma, M.D. (\"Dr. Sharma\"), and Plaintiff's residual functional capacity, obtain testimony from a medical expert if necessary, provide rational specific evidence to support the ALJ's assessed limitations, conduct further proceedings, and, if warranted, determine whether Plaintiff's drug and alcohol use were contributing factors to the ALJ's finding of disability. (R. 573-74). On October 27, 2016, ALJ Sharon Seeley (\"the ALJ\" or \"ALJ Seeley\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducted an administrative hearing where Plaintiff and vocational expert Susan J. Rowe (\"the VE\" or \"Rowe\"), testified. (R. 509-43). ALJ Seeley issued a decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   denying Plaintiff's claim on April 4, 2017. (Ex. A, 5-28). No exceptions to the ALJ's decision were filed and the ALJ's decision became the final administrative decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.984\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). On June 5, 2017, Plaintiff filed the instant action alleging that the ALJ erred by failing to find him disabled. (Dkt. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (\"Plaintiff's motion\"), accompanied by a memorandum of law (Dkt. No. 12-1) (\"Plaintiff's Memorandum\"). On January 19, 2018, Defendant filed Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (\"Defendant's motion\"), accompanied by a memorandum of law (Dkt. No. 14-1) (\"Defendant's Memorandum\"). Plaintiff filed a reply to Defendant's motion on the pleadings on February 21, 2018 (\"Plaintiff's Reply Memorandum\") (Dkt. No. 17-1). Oral argument was deemed unnecessary. Based on the following, Plaintiff's motion for remand is GRANTED and the matter remanded for calculation of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A district court may set aside the Commissioner's determination that a claimant is not disabled if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence, or the decision is based on legal error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. 405(g) ;\n   <em>\n    Green-Younger v.

That Plaintiff meets the criteria for \u00a7 12.04A is not disputed. To meet the criteria of \u00a7 12.04B, a disability claimant's depressive, bipolar or related disorder must result in an extreme limitation to one of the following or a marked limitation to two of the following abilities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. Understanding, remembering, or applying information; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. Interacting with others; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3.

A, 5), the ALJ found the criteria under \u00a7 12.04B were not met because Plaintiff's disorder resulted in only mild limitations to Plaintiff's ability to understand, remember, or apply information, and adapt or mange himself, and moderate limitations to his ability to interact with others, concentrate, persist, or maintain pace. (Ex. A, 9-10). A plain reading of the record, however, reveals substantial evidence the Plaintiff is at least markedly limited in his abilities to interact with others (\u00a7 12.04B2) and in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace. (\u00a7 12.04B3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As relevant here, 20 C.F.R., Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.04B2, interacting with others refers to the ability to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Relate to and work with supervisors, co-workers, and the public.... cooperating with others; asking for help when needed; handling conflicts with others; stating own point of view; initiating or sustaining conversation; understanding and responding to social cues (physical, verbal, emotional); responding to requests, suggestions, criticism, correction, and\n   challenges; and keeping social interactions free of excessive irritability, sensitivity, argumentativeness, or suspiciousness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   20 C.F.R. 404, Subpt.

Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App.1 \u00a7 12.00F2d, and are considered \"extreme\" when there is no ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively on a sustained basis. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App.1 \u00a7 12.00F2e. In this case, the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff's psycho-affective disorder did not result in a marked difficulty to Plaintiff's ability to interact with others under \u00a7 12.04B2, is without support of substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In particular, on July 5, 2012, Physician Assistant Theresa Mellas (\"P.A. Mellas\"), completed a Medical Examination for Employment Assessment Disability Screening form, and evaluated Plaintiff with a very limited ability to maintain socially appropriate behavior without exhibiting behavior extremes and appropriately interact with others. (R. 313). On September 16, 2013, Lixin Zhang, M.D. (\"Dr. Zhang\"), a neurologist with Dent Neurologic Institute (\"Dent\"), completed a seizure evaluation of Plaintiff and noted that Plaintiff's mother reported that Plaintiff was withdrawn, stayed home and never left the house. (R. 767). On December 12, 2013, Alanna C. Castaldo, P.A. (\"P.A. Castaldo\"), a physician assistant at Dent, completed a follow-up examination of Plaintiff, noting that Plaintiff's mother stated that Plaintiff was depressed, had no social life, was withdrawn, slept for 12 hours each night, and diagnosed Plaintiff with anxiety and depression. (R. 764-65). On February 20, 2014, Masashi Ohira, M.D. (\"Dr. Ohira\"), evaluated Plaintiff with very limited ability to interact appropriately with others. (R. 665). On December 31, 2015, Dr. Ohira evaluated Plaintiff with very limited ability to interact appropriately with others, moderately limited ability to maintain socially acceptable behavior without exhibiting behavior extremes and that Plaintiff's work would require limited social interactions secondary to Plaintiff's schizoaffective disorder. (R. 733). On September 26, 2016, Fahim Tazwar, M.D. (\"Dr. Tazwar\"), evaluated Plaintiff with very limited ability to maintain socially appropriate behavior without exhibiting behavioral extremes, and interact appropriately with others, noting that Plaintiff's impairments were permanent. (R. 736). At Plaintiff's initial hearing Plaintiff's grandmother testified that without her encouragement Plaintiff would not go anywhere or do anything other than stay inside the house, testimony that the ALJ does not discredit. (R. 64). Substantial evidence thus supports that Plaintiff's mental impairment results in marked difficulties to Plaintiff's ability to interact with others and Plaintiff meets the criteria for disability under \u00a7 12.04B2. The court next considers whether Plaintiff's mental impairment meets the criteria for disability under \u00a7 12.04B3,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's ability to concentrate, persist or maintain pace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The \"ability to concentrate, persist or maintain pace refers to the ability to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Focus attention on work activities and stay on task at a sustained rate. Examples include: Initiating and performing a task that you understand and know how to do; working at an appropriate and consistent pace; completing tasks in a timely manner; ignoring or avoiding distractions while working; changing activities or work settings without being disruptive, working close to or with others without interrupting or distracting them; sustaining an ordinary routine and\n   regular attendance at work; and working a full day without needing more than the allotted number or length of rest periods during the day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 12.00E3 (\"\u00a7 12.00E3\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff's mental impairment results in only moderate limitations to Plaintiff's ability to concentrate, persist, or maintain pace is also without support of substantial evidence in the record because, as Plaintiff testified, his grandmother helped him with everything including giving Plaintiff his daily medications as Plaintiff was not able to remember to take his medications (R. 57), and his testimony is consistent with the medical evidence in the record. In particular, as early as July 5, 2012, P.A. Mellas evaluated Plaintiff with a very limited ability to maintain attention and concentration, function in a work setting at a consistent pace, and carry out instructions. (R. 313). On February 14, 2013, Dr. Sharma completed a Vision Impairment Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire and opined that Plaintiff's visual impairments resulted in moderate to severe limitations to Plaintiff's ability to perform daily activities, that Plaintiff was incapable of avoiding ordinary hazards in the workplace such as boxes on the floor, doors ajar, and approaching people or vehicles, that Plaintiff was unable to work with large objects and lift and carry more than 10 pounds, that Plaintiff's vision impairments would frequently interfere with Plaintiff's attention and concentration, and that Plaintiff's history of headaches, seizures, monocular vision and poor depth perception affected Plaintiff's ability to work at a regular job on a sustained basis. (R. 435-37). On February 20, 2014 and December 31, 2015, Dr. Ohira evaluated Plaintiff with very limited ability to function in a work like setting at a consistent pace. (R. 665, 733). On September 26, 2016, Dr. Tazwar evaluated Plaintiff with very limited ability to maintain concentration and attention, make simple decisions, and function in a work setting at a consistent pace. (R. 736). Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff's psycho-affective disorder and visual impairment resulted in marked limitations to Plaintiff's ability to concentrate, persist and maintain pace as a basis for disability pursuant to \u00a7 12.04B3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Substantial evidence thus establishes that Plaintiff's mental impairment results in marked limitations to two of the four criteria necessary to be deemed disabled under \u00a7 12.04B, specifically \u00a7 12.04B2 and \u00a7 12.04B3.

Pt. 404 and 416).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The court acknowledges evidence in the record that Plaintiff was seizure-free for more than a year from 2015 until June 7, 2016 (R. 751), and testified on October 27, 2016, that he no longer required his grandmother's help managing his medication (R. 525). Although such evidence considered by ALJ Seeley,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1-1 at 18, may support Plaintiff's medical improvement, determining whether Plaintiff's condition improved such that Plaintiff is no longer disabled is the Commissioner's responsibility.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20425\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 425\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Such evidence supports that prior to the onset of improvements in Plaintiff's condition, Plaintiff was thus in fact disabled pursuant to \u00a7 12.04B, a necessary implication overlooked by the ALJ.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
