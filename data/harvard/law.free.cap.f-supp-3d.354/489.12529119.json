The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs are a Jordanian businessman and a Lebanese holding corporation. They own a 24% stake in LCB. LCB, which is both a plaintiff and nominal defendant in this action, is a corporate entity based in Lebanon. LCB was forced into liquidation as a result of its managers' money laundering. At its peak, LCB had assets of approximately $ 5 billion, but now has less than $ 400 million. Defendant Abou Jaoude is the former Chairman and General Manager of LCB, who served as the Chair of LCB's Anti-Money Laundering Committee. Defendant Hamdoun is the former Deputy General Manager of LCB and served as the Vice Chair of LCB's Anti-Money Laundering Committee. Abou Jaoude and Hamdoun own, or control entities that own, 76% of LCB. They used LCB to orchestrate the money laundering scheme that resulted in multiple U.S. government investigations and the eventual collapse of LCB. Defendant Safa is the former Assistant General Manager responsible for overseeing all LCB branches, and directed LCB's day-to-day money laundering operations. In 2010, Safa left LCB to serve on the Central Bank of Lebanon's\n   Banking Control Commission, which regulates financial institutions. These Defendants exert influence over the Central Bank of Lebanon, which turned a \"blind eye\" to their scheme, failed to punish their wrongdoing and has its own ties to Hizballah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following Defendants have not appeared. Oussama Salhab is a Hizballah operative who controls a network of money couriers based principally in West Africa. Ayman Saied Joumaa directs an international drug trafficking and money laundering network that sells multi-ton shipments of South American cocaine to West Africa, substantially for Hizballah's benefit. Joumaa is designated by the U.S. Department of Treasury as a Drug Kingpin and works with Mexican drug cartels. Hassan Ayash is a Hizballah operative who facilitates bulk cash transfers and money laundering for Joumaa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2002, Algeria granted Plaintiffs a banking license, which Plaintiffs used to found Trust Bank Algeria (\"TBA\"). In 2005, as TBA looked for a strategic partner to increase capital, Abou Jaoude approached Abu Nahl about the possibility of LCB investing in TBA. To help fund the transaction, Abou Jaoude proposed a separate transaction in which he would sell a minority stake of LCB to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs entered into a series of transactions between 2005 and 2007, acquiring 24% of LCB for approximately $ 57 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During these negotiations, Plaintiffs were unaware that Abou Jaoude and Hamdoun wanted control of TBA to further a money laundering scheme to benefit Hizballah and enrich themselves. In short, the money laundering operation worked as follows. Abou Joude, Hamdoun and Safa used LCB to wire large amounts of U.S. dollars to used car buyers throughout the United States. The money moved through correspondent accounts in five New York banks: New York Mellon, Standard Chartered, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Mashreq. Typically, the amount of each wire transfer was tens of thousands of dollars, and some of the car purchasers in the United States received hundreds of such transfers. Between 2007 and 2011, LCB made over 3,500 such wire transfers to 30 car purchasers in twelve states -- Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee -- totaling almost $ 250 million. After receiving wire transfers, the car purchasers bought used cars in the states where they operated and shipped them to West Africa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once the cars arrived in West Africa, Joumaa and Salhab's networks, which owned and operated used car lots in West Africa, purchased the cars using bulk currency generated from narcotics sales in Europe and Africa. After the cars were resold in West Africa, Salhab's money couriers moved the proceeds by land or air from West Africa to Lebanon. Upon arrival in Lebanon, Hizballah operatives provided security to ensure the money reached LCB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Couriers deposited most of\n   the cash into LCB or other entities controlled by Defendants, which circumvented the Central Bank of Lebanon's disclosure requirements for cash deposits greater than $ 10,000. The money laundering operation deposited at least $ 200 million in cash per year into LCB, allowing Hizballah to funnel the proceeds of narcotics sales and other illicit operations into the legitimate banking sector. Hizballah used this money to fund violations of international law, which included, among other things, acting as Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's \"muscle,\" and conducting terror attacks against, and summary executions of, civilians during the Syrian Civil War. Throughout the relevant period, Plaintiffs attempted to implement better corporate governance at LCB to prevent money laundering, but were thwarted by Abou Jaoude and Hamdoun, who controlled LCB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Forfeiture Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2011, LCB sold certain of its assets and liabilities to another Lebanese Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Banque au Liban S.A.L. (\"SGBL\"), for $ 580 million. SGBL placed $ 150 million of the purchase price in another Lebanese financial institution (the \"Escrow Institution\"). Also in 2011, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a Treasury Finding that identified LCB as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern, stating that Abou Joude and Hamdoun were the scheme's architects and had \"frequent -- in some cases even daily -- communication\" with drug trafficking and money laundering networks. In August of 2012, the United States seized $ 150 million from the U.S. correspondent accounts of the Escrow Institution as money \"traceable to the assets of LCB.\" The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York then filed a civil forfeiture complaint against LCB. In 2013, Abou Joude and Hamdoun, as trustees responsible for LCB's liquidation, settled the forfeiture action with the U.S. on behalf of LCB for $ 102 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The ATA and ATS are reconcilable; the ATA provides a private right of action to domestic plaintiffs for damages caused by financing terrorism, while the ATS provides a parallel cause of action to foreign plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The crux of Defendants' argument is that\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   demands the conclusion that the ATA preempts the ATS; for two reasons, it does not. First, the portions of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defendants cite (i.e., sections II.A.2 and II.B.2) reflect the views of only three Justices. See\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 1393. Unlike the precedents above, the\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   plurality's discussion of preemption is not binding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    N.Y. State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass'n, Inc. v. Cuomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358143\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/242/#p265\">\n    804 F.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"[B]ecause the test set forth by the\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   plurality has not been adopted by the Supreme Court as a whole, we are not required to apply it.\"). Second, to the extent that the\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   plurality -- which focused on ATS jurisdiction over foreign corporations for money laundering on behalf of terrorists -- is relevant, it does not suggest that the ATA preempts the ATS; to the contrary, the\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   plurality stated, \"It has not been shown that corporate liability under the ATS is essential to serve the goals of the statute.... [P]laintiffs\n   <em>\n    still can sue the individual corporate employees\n   </em>\n   responsible for a violation of international law under the ATS.\" 138 S.Ct. at 1405 (emphasis added). The plurality therefore did not contemplate that the ATA forecloses ATS claims against individuals who launder money to finance terrorists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Violation of the Law of Nations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In analyzing the first ATS requirement -- a violation of the law of nations -- courts apply a two-part test.

Second, even if it is proper to engage in the\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Proposed Complaint does not support ATS liability because it is not sufficiently specific, universal\n   and obligatory.

First, Defendants point to the \"confusing pack of over 104 reservations and declarations\" made by parties to the Terrorism Financing Convention, especially those that \"relate to whether certain actions should be regarded as legitimate conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jordan (\"Jordan does not consider acts of national armed struggle and fighting foreign occupation in the exercise of people's right to self-determ[in]ation as terrorist acts within the context of paragraph 1(b) of article 2 of the Convention.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This argument fails, because the specific conduct of Hizballah alleged in the Proposed Complaint -- i.e., Hizballah's \"integral role in the continued violence the Assad regime is inflicting on the Syrian population,\" including, for example, \"summary executions of civilians\" -- falls within the behavior criminalized by the Terrorism Financing Convention and outside of the ambit of the reservations and declarations. The Terrorism Financing Convention defines \"terrorism\" to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [A]ct[s] intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Terrorism Financing Convention, at 2.1(b). Attacks on Syrian civilians meet this definition, and do not constitute \"acts of national armed struggle and fighting foreign occupation.\" Accordingly, even considering the declarations and reservations, the Terrorism Financing Convention criminalizes Defendants' alleged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the Terrorism Financing Convention cannot sustain an ATS claim because the \"ostensible\n   underlying norm\" -- i.e., \"terrorism\" -- is not sufficiently well-defined to support ATS liability.

First, whether the \"underlying norm\" of \"terrorism\" is well-defined is irrelevant; by abstracting up to the level of \"terrorism,\" Defendants obfuscate the precise issue -- whether a scheme to finance Hizballah's atrocities in the Syrian Civil War constitutes a sufficiently well-defined violation of the Terrorism Financing Convention to sustain an ATS claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almog\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3796752\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/471/257/#p277\">\n    471 F.Supp.2d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n this case, there is no need to resolve any definitional disputes as to the scope of the word 'terrorism,' for the Conventions expressing the international norm provide their own specific descriptions of the conduct condemned. Although the Conventions refer to such acts as 'terrorism,' the pertinent issue here is only whether the acts as alleged by plaintiffs violate a norm of international law, however labeled.\"). Because Defendants allegedly engaged in a money laundering scheme to finance Hizballah attacks intended to \"cause death or serious bodily injury\" to Syrian civilians, Plaintiffs have stated a valid ATS claim predicated on the norm articulated in the Terrorism Financing Convention -- regardless of whether Hizballah's actions are given the \"terrorism\" moniker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, to the extent that the underlying norm of \"terrorism\" must be well-defined,\n   <em>\n    Licci II\n   </em>\n   suggests that it is. In\n   <em>\n    Licci II\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that money laundering -- also committed by LCB in support of Hizballah -- provided a sufficient basis for an ATS claim brought by the victims of rocket attacks in Israel, because the plaintiffs adequately pleaded that the defendants \"aid[ed] and abet[ed]\" \"[g]enocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes [which] certainly constitute violations of the law of nations....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056201\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/201/#p213\">\n    834 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   213 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kadic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926046\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/232/#p242\">\n    70 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   236 ; and then citing\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862480\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/692/#p732\">\n    542 U.S. at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862480\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/692/#p732\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in part and in judgment) ). This holding illustrates that terrorism -- at least under the rubric of crimes against humanity and war crimes -- can form the basis for a valid ATS claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Third, in\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit carefully circumscribed its holding's temporal reach, stating, \"no universal norm against 'terrorism' existed under customary international law (i.e., the 'law of nations')\n   <em>\n    as of September 11, 2001.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863898\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/118/#p125\">\n    714 F.3d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Given that the ATS is pegged to a moving target -- i.e., international law norms that are \"specific, universal, and obligatory\" at the time of the alleged tort -- it is possible that, as the \"War on Terror\" has stretched\n   on, the norm of \"terrorism\" has crystalized. That approximately 178 nations were parties to the Terrorism Financing Convention by 2010 -- compared to just 43 on September 11, 2001, and 190 in 2018 -- suggests that this is the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3. State Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' ATS claim fails because they do not allege that state actors committed the relevant tort. This argument is unpersuasive. As stated by the Second Circuit in 1995:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   We do not agree that the law of nations, as understood in the modern era, confines its reach to state action.

First, as discussed above, the Terrorism Financing Convention constitutes sufficient proof that Defendants' alleged conduct violates norms of universal concern, and the Convention expressly extends these norms to \"[a]ny person\" who commits the proscribed conduct, Terrorism Financing Convention, at 2(1). As the Convention does not define \"person,\" the word is construed to have its ordinary meaning,\n   <em>\n    see,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

Second, the Proposed Complaint alleges that Defendants operated \"in concert\" with a foreign state, i.e., the Central Bank of Lebanon, which allegedly turned a \"blind eye\" to LCB's scheme, \"frustrated Plaintiffs' ability to obtain redress in Lebanon\" and has its own ties to Hizballah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     In Pari Delicto\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants argue that LCB -- in this derivative action brought on behalf of LCB by two of its shareholders -- cannot maintain a suit because the Proposed Complaint alleges that \"LCB was itself the perpetrator -- not a victim -- of the ostensible international law violations.\" This argument is unpersuasive.

SGBL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The settlement agreement between LCB and the United States makes clear that \"LCB, as part of the settlement set forth herein, shall forfeit to the United States for disposition according to law all of LCB's right, title, and interest in the Seized Funds,\" which totaled $ 102 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   It was therefore LCB -- not SGBL -- that forfeited money, and LCB remains a viable corporation in Lebanon. LCB's shareholders lost money as a result of the enforcement action; SGBL actually received $ 60 million as a result of the forfeiture agreement. Accordingly, it appears that SGBL is not even a necessary party -- let alone an indispensable party -- to this action, which seeks to recover monies that LCB forfeited to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants argue that, in selling substantially all of its assets to SGBL, LCB transferred its right to sue on its own behalf and, as a result, that there can be no derivative suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series S. Portfolio v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274481\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/247/377/#p409\">\n    247 F.Supp.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"[A] plaintiff who asserts a derivative cause of action must establish the existence of a cause of action in the party whose rights are sought to be enforced. A cause of action cannot be derived from a source in which it does not exist.\"). In the asset sale, LCB transferred \"all rights, titles and interests of the Seller in and to the Properties, assets, and rights of every nature, kind and description ... as at the Completion Date.\" LCB used the cash from the SGBL asset sale to pay the $ 102 million settlement with the federal government -- cash that would have been paid out to LCB shareholders in the absence of the forfeiture. LCB did not convey to SGBL the right to the very proceeds of the asset sale in the asset sale agreement; put differently, LCB is suing for an injury incurred after its sale of \"all rights, titles, and interests ...\n   <em>\n    as at the Completion Date\n   </em>\n   \" to SGBL. The right to sue for that injury was therefore not transferred. LCB's shareholders were injured when LCB was forced to pay $ 102 million from the asset sale to compensate the United States for LCB's past money laundering. SGBL has no interest in the claim asserted in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Central Bank\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants argued that the Central Bank of Lebanon is an indispensable party to this action, and that it cannot be joined because it enjoys sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic of Philippines v.

The Central Bank is neither a necessary nor an indispensable party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The allegations in the Proposed Complaint that the Central Bank turned a \"blind eye\" to LCB's money laundering and \"frustrated Plaintiffs' ability to obtain redress in Lebanon\" do not make the Central Bank a necessary party. The Proposed Complaint does not purport to sue or seek recovery from the Central Bank as a joint tortfeaser, and -- even if it did -- \"[i]t has long been the rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Temple v.

Jan. 10, 2014). Complete relief can be afforded in the Central Bank's absence, and the Central Bank's rights will not be impaired by the outcome of the action. Defendants argue that the Central Bank has an interest in this action because the Proposed Complaint disparages its conduct. That argument is not persuasive as it does meet Rule 19's definition of a necessary party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This argument is unpersuasive. Both the Supreme Court's\n   opinion in\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   and the Second Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kiobel I\n   </em>\n   focused exclusively on whether a corporation can be an ATS defendant, not a plaintiff.
