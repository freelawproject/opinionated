The term \"operation\" in the Act means that the vendor must \"manage\" or \"direct the working of\" the cafeteria. Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). Nothing in the Randolph-Sheppard Act requires a vendor to participate in every activity of the cafeteria in order to \"manage\" or \"direct the working of\" the cafeteria. Where a vendor is responsible for all the functions of the cafeteria aside from those performed by military personnel-such as supervisory, administrative, and sanitation-related functions-the vendor can be said to \"manage\" the cafeteria even if the vendor is not preparing the food. Indeed the cafeteria would not be able to operate without the vendor performing these functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Some contracts may be limited to discrete tasks so as not to entail overall \"operation\" of the cafeteria, but that characterization would not apply to all \"dining facility attendant\" contracts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Despite the ED's interpretation of the RSA, Defendant claims that a letter to a member of Congress \"is not the kind of action that establishes a definitive interpretation of a statute entitled to deference from a reviewing court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues this letter is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   In stark contrast, Plaintiff contends the letter should be given deference, but is less specific as to what sort of deference the letter is due.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that \"[e]ven if the Opinion were not controlling, the court may still consider the\n   Opinion according to its persuasive power.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Plaintiff asserts that even if the letter is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, the letter would still be entitled to\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court must determine what level of deference, if any, the Opinion Letter is afforded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is well established that \"considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is not absolute. \"The fair measure of deference to an agency administering its own statute has been understood to vary with circumstances, and courts have looked to the degree of the agency's care, its consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and to the persuasiveness of the agency's position.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework, \"[i]f Congress 'has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,' we 'must give effect to [its] unambiguously expressed intent'; on the other hand, 'if the statute is silent or ambiguous,' we must defer to the agency's interpretation so long as it is 'based on a permissible construction of the statute.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    a. Whether the Statute Is Ambiguous\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The first question is whether Congress has directly spoken as to the RSA's applicability to contracts for discrete cafeteria services. The RSA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   For the purposes of providing blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities of the blind, and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting, blind persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized to operate vending facilities on any Federal property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This plainly lists the RSA's purpose as providing blind persons with lucrative employment, increasing economic opportunity, and fostering self-sustainability. It then authorizes a blind individual \"to operate vending facilities on any Federal property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute does not facially distinguish between categories of cafeteria contracts, specifically the military's categorization of cafeteria contracts as either for FFS or DFA Services. Nor does the statute does not make any distinctions on the application of the RSA to mess attendant services or other contracts for discrete services. In a similar fashion, the corresponding federal regulations\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   do not appear to restrict the applicability of the act to only FFS contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While a plain reading of the statute does not appear to limit the application of the RSA, the use of the word \"operate\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is hotly contested. The heavily disputed language originates in this context: \"blind persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized\n   to\n   <em>\n    operate\n   </em>\n   vending facilities on any Federal property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   The central issue is whether a contract for DFA services requires the contractor to \"operate\" a vending facility. If so, the contract is subject to the RSA, and the blind vendor receives priority in the bidding process. This is not a question unique to this motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sister courts faced with this same dispute have struggled with the meaning of \"operate\" and \"operation\" in the context of the RSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This court has already engaged in an extensive analysis in its prior Order regarding the meaning of \"operate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   To address this question of statutory interpretation, the court examined the plain language of the RSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that the RSA's definitional section does not define \"operate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a review of the definition of \"operate\" in\n   <em>\n    The Merriam-Webster Dictionary\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    The Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   the court is not persuaded that the plain meaning of the word \"operate\" resolves the issue of the RSA's applicability to DFA Services contracts. On one hand, the word \"operate\" could be read to include all necessary tasks to the functioning of a cafeteria. On the other hand, \"operate\" could signify only those who exert a level of authority over the cafeteria. Neither the language of the RSA, nor the definitions found in\n   <em>\n    The Merriam-Webster Dictionary\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    The Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   clarify what level of executory function is necessary to \"operate\" a cafeteria. The definitions appear to be inconsistent, and both interpretations of the parties appear reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This court then looked to whether congressional directives showed a clear intention by Congress to narrow the scope of the RSA, thereby excluding DFA services contracts from its reach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a review of the documents and sources cited by Defendant, this court declined to interpret the RSA in such a narrow fashion without a substantial showing of congressional intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Despite this Order, Defendant again argues that the RSA cannot be construed as applying to DFA services contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant offers three arguments in support of such a contention: (1) the terms \"operate\" and \"operation\" have \"a more limited meaning when applied in the full context\" of the RSA\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) the court misconstrued the John Warner Act in the prior Order\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (3) Congress's failure to implement policies set forth in a report issued in 2006 (\"2006 Joint Report\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not a rejection\n   of such policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court rejects Defendant's first argument. Defendant cites to the use of the terms \"operate\" and \"operation\" throughout the RSA and its accompanying regulations, insisting \"the terms are used in a way that makes sense only if the blind vendor would be operating the entire vending facility ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court already considered the use of the terms \"operate\" and \"operation\" in the prior Order and reiterates concern about the level of control necessary to qualify as a vendor who \"operates\" a cafeteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is possible that multiple vendors could collaborate to fulfill the cafeteria's purpose of providing food. The court declines to adopt a narrow understanding of those terms when ambiguity remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition, Defendant opposes this court's analysis in the prior Order, where the court reasoned that \"[b]y prohibiting the poaching of already-existing JWOD contracts, the provision suggests that the RSA could apply to a contract for ancillary reasons.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also takes issue with the court's analysis that Congress's failure to implement policies as set forth in the 2006 Joint Report \"suggests a reject of these policy recommendations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that Congress did not take legislative action for two reasons: (1) it was not asked to do so with these particular policy recommendations; and (2) it was unnecessary to enact legislation, as the RSA's inapplicability to DFA services contracts was already reflected in the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The court need not address these arguments. First, as this court and Defendant has already pointed out, statements drafted following the enactment of legislation are of limited value in determining the meaning of a provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another glaring issue is that the JWA and the 2006 Joint Report do not reflect\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   , if any, congressional intent. The court will not restrict the applicability of the RSA in the absence of clear congressional intent. The court sees no persuasive reason to stray from its previous analysis. The statutory language is ambiguous and fails to resolve the issue at hand. Accordingly, Congress has not \"directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    b.

United States Department of the Army, Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    \"Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an example of a qualifying DFA services contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the arbitration panel held in favor of the blind vendor and concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Where the tasks to be performed by a contract for DFA services includes tasks that constitute an integral element of providing food service at a military cafeteria facility, or pertain to the operation of a cafeteria, or tasks that without which the cafeterias would not be able to function, fall within the definition included in the RS Act, and its implement regulations, and are entitled to RS Act priority when awarding said contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Simply put,\n   <em>\n    Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that if a DFA services contract includes tasks instrumental to providing cafeteria services, these contracts are subject to RSA priority. The ED's consideration of the matter and reference to a previous arbitration decision is thorough.\n   <em>\n    Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   gives additional clarity, as it provides a real-world application of the RSA to a contract for DFA services. In addition to its persuasive nature, the Opinion Letter promotes consistency in future arbitration and court decisions. The ED's reasoning is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant argues that the Opinion Letter \"offers no detailed analysis\" to support Plaintiff's assertion that the RSA applies to all DFA services contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant adds that Plaintiff's position-that the RSA applies to this specific contract on the grounds that the DFA vendor performs all other services than those performed by military personnel-is an \"overly broad and illogical interpretation of this correspondence and of the RSA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, Plaintiff does not propose that all DFA services contracts are subject to the RSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it argues this particular DFA services contract is subject to the RSA according to the Opinion Letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Defendant ignores the fact that the ED administers the RSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ED has provided a well-reasoned interpretation and an example of a qualifying DFA services contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sees no reason to conclude that such an interpretation is overly broad, particularly in light of the RSA's goal to \"enlarge[ ] the economic opportunities of the blind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Furthermore, the Opinion Letter is entirely consistent with this court's prior Order. For instance, the ED and this court agree that \"operate\" means that a vendor must \"manage\" or \"direct the working\" of the cafeteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court also concluded\n   that a \"case-by-case approach\" was appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is congruent to the ED's conclusion that \"[s]ome contracts may be limited to discrete tasks so as to not entail overall \"operation\" of the cafeteria, but that characterization would not apply to all 'dining facility attendant' contracts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both this court and the ED agree that whether the RSA applies to a certain contract for DFA services depends on the nature and tasks of the contract itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Opinion Letter is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference. Unfortunately, such a conclusion does not resolve the entirety of this matter. The court must next consider whether this Solicitation falls within the reach of the RSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Whether the RSA Applies to the Specific Solicitation at Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   , the RSA applied where the DFA services contract consisted of \"tasks that constitute an integral element of providing food service at a military cafeteria facility, or pertain to the operation of a cafeteria or tasks that without which the cafeterias would not be able to function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   panel concluded that the tasks in the Performance Work Statement (\"PWS\") \"constitute an integral element of providing service, pertain to the operation of the cafeteria, and without which the cafeterias at Fort Riley would not be able to function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following tasks were illustrative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Performance Work Statement (PWS), at 3.1.2, requires that the contractor execute and maintain a quality control plan\n   <strong>\n    in support of dining facility operations\n   </strong>\n   . Also, at 3.2.1., the PWS required that the contractor shall clean and sanitize food service equipment and surfaces to\n   <strong>\n    support dining facility operations\n   </strong>\n   . Additional requirements also appear: prepare, maintain and clean dining areas to afford each diner a clean area to eat\n   <strong>\n    without delay\n   </strong>\n   and keep appropriate condiments available\n   <strong>\n    without delay\n   </strong>\n   ; spills are to be cleaned, soiled dinnerware occasionally left by diners are to be removed, and soiled trays are to be bussed\n   <strong>\n    within five minutes of occurrence\n   </strong>\n   ; tray carts are to be bussed and replaced during meal serving period and space made available for soiled trays,\n   <strong>\n    without diner delay 100% of the time\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The relation of the tasks to the dining facility operations is key.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Solicitation in the instant case appears identical to the\n   <em>\n    Fort Riley\n   </em>\n   contract. The PWS specifies that \"[t]his contract includes all functions, tasks, and responsibilities normally performed by a Food Service Operation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n   It includes tasks necessary to the operation of a cafeteria: providing and cleaning dinnerware, utensils and trays \"without delay 100%\" during the meal period\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; cleaning food and beverage spills during meals \"within 5 minutes of occurrence\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; emptying garbage cans\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and bussing trays \"within 5\n   minutes of occurrence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the PWS includes other tasks, such as cleaning curtains and draperies, the PWS clearly includes tasks that are \"an integral element of providing food service at a military cafeteria facility, or pertain to the operation of a cafeteria, or tasks that without which the cafeterias would not be able to function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   A cafeteria cannot function if diners are not given silverware, spills are not mopped up, and leftover food is not wiped away. The Solicitation falls within the reach of the RSA, as it involves instrumental cafeteria tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant argues the RSA still does not apply to this particular Solicitation, strongly opposing Plaintiff's characterization of the Solicitation as \"full and robust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's word choice is inapposite. The question is whether this Solicitation contains tasks that are integral to the cafeteria's functioning. Even the Panel suggests that this DFA services contract includes services integral to the operation of the cafeteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n   Russell D. Campbell, Army Sustainment Command Food Program Manager, testified \"that services in a DFA contract cover a portion of the operation of a cafeteria and that DFA services are an inherent part of the operation of a cafeteria.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Panel also found the PWS includes \"all functions, tasks and responsibilities normally performed by a Food Service Operation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendant nevertheless maintains that the RSA does not apply in this case, as the \"services performed by the contractor do not include the preparation or service of food.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is mistaken. The ED explicitly rejected this argument, stating that \"the vendor can be said to 'manage' the cafeteria, even if the vendor is not preparing the food.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also argues the Solicitation does not fall within the RSA's reach, as the PWS's tasks are \"generally\" duties related to \"facility maintenance and sanitation, in essence busboy and other cleanup services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Generally\" is not the standard. The question is whether the Solicitation includes \"tasks that constitute an integral element of providing food service at a military cafeteria facility, or pertain to the operation of a cafeteria or tasks that without which the cafeterias would not be able to function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   Supporting cafeteria services-such as \"busboy services\"-are integral to the functioning of a cafeteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant points to\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Department of Rehabilitative Services v. United States\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support the proposition that courts have not \"traditionally ... applied the RSA to these types of contracts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a statement is a shallow understanding of the court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Department of Rehabilitative Services.\n   </em>\n   In that case, the court looked at prior decisions, where arbitration panels had applied the case-by-case approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n   The courts\n   upheld the arbitration decisions under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n   An important distinction between those decisions and the Panel's decision is that the panels had considered the specific contracts at issue and looked at the facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is in stark contrast to the Panel's decision here, as it is based on a legal conclusion that the RSA does not apply to all DFA services contracts. The court in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Department of Rehabilitative Services\n   </em>\n   noted, after reviewing other decisions, that it \"may\" conclude that the RSA does not apply to \"busboy and other cleanup services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, it also acknowledged that the meaning of \"operation\" was still an open question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In sum, the Secretary of Education has issued a letter entitled to\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference, resolving the exact dispute at hand. The Opinion Letter is well-reasoned and offers an answer to years of uncertainty. As the Solicitation in this case includes tasks that are integral and necessary to the operation of cafeterias, the Solicitation is subject to RSA priority. Notably, such an understanding furthers the RSA's goal of \"providing blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities of the blind, and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Motion for Summary Judgment is thus\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As the court considered the filing under the summary judgment standard, Defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant also moves to remand any remaining issues to the Panel, specifically whether the Army improperly imposed a limitation on the operation of a cafeteria without first seeking approval by the ED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts the issue should only be remanded to the Panel if the court finds that the RSA does not apply to the Solicitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this court has found the RSA applies, no issues remain for the Panel's consideration.
