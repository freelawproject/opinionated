The lead plaintiff in this case is Matthew Atkinson, an individual who bought shares in Northern Oil during the class period. Doc. 20 at 7.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 134-39. Second, Defendants knowingly used Northern's staff, space, and resources to help Reger and Dakota Plains, including by facilitating some of Reger and Dakota Plains's misconduct.

The Court continues to reject Plaintiff's argument for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The SAC, however, contains new allegations in support of Plaintiff's theory that Defendants misled by omission. Plaintiff argues that in its 2016 Q1 and Q2 quarterly reports to the SEC, Northern Oil misled investors by minimizing its and Reger's role in Dakota Plains. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 134, 137. Specifically, Northern Oil made the following disclosure in its 2016 Q1 Form 10-Q:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   General and administrative expense was $ 4.3 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $ 4.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Lower compensation expense in 2016 ($ 0.4 million) was offset by higher legal and professional expense ($ 0.5 million). The reduction in compensation expense resulted from 2015 third quarter staff reductions and lower incentive plan amounts. The increase in legal and professional expense was primarily due to the Company engaging outside legal counsel to assist it in complying with requests from the SEC relating to an ongoing investigation of 2012 trading patterns in the securities of Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. (\"Dakota Plains\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Michael Reger, our chief executive officer, was an initial investor in Dakota Plains in 2008. The Company has never owned any interest in Dakota Plains. Based on the information available to it, the Company does not believe that it, or any conduct by the Company, is the focus of any investigation by a governmental agency regarding this matter.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   SAC \u00b6 134 (emphasis in original). Northern Oil made the same disclosure in substance in its Q2 Form 10-Q. SAC \u00b6 137. Plaintiff contends that, having \"broached the subject of the SEC's investigation into Reger's activities at Dakota Plains,\" Northern Oil had a duty to disclose that (1) Northern Oil's operations, personnel, and resources were heavily comingled with Dakota Plains; (2) Reger was not just an investor but a control person at Dakota Plains; (3) the government was investigating Reger's illegal conduct, partly facilitated by Northern Oil resources, at Dakota Plains; and (4) as a result, many of Northern Oil's public statements were false or misleading. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 136, 139. Because it failed to do so, Plaintiff argues, Defendants' statements (1) amounted to a false denial that Reger had participated in illegal conduct and (2) misled investors about the SEC investigation into Dakota Plains, results which are actionable under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The Court addresses both these theories in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, Defendants' statements did not amount to a denial of illegal conduct. A reasonable investor would not interpret Northern Oil's description of Reger as an \"initial investor\" of Dakota Plains-an accurate description-to preclude Reger from having done criminal acts. Describing someone as an initial investor of a company does not suggest that that is the beginning and end of his or her relationship with that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants' statements are distinct from those in prior cases in this district that were found to function as denials of illegal conduct.

Thus, in both\n   <em>\n    In re Sotheby's\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Banco Bradesco\n   </em>\n   , the companies did not just fail to fully disclose the underlying illegal behavior, but made statements that strongly implied there was no illegal conduct. Defendants' statements, unlike those made in\n   <em>\n    In re Sotheby's\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Bradesco\n   </em>\n   , did no such thing. Defendants' statements did not amount to a denial of illegal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, Defendants made no statements in Northern Oil's Form 10-Q that amounted to an \"opinion that, absent disclosure, misleads investors about material facts underlying that belief,\"\n   <em>\n    Menaldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338925\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/568/#p581\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff attempts to characterize Northern Oil's statement that it was not \"the focus of any investigation by a governmental agency regarding\" Dakota Plains as such, but fails. Most obviously,\n   Defendants' statement is not an opinion, but a fact. The SEC indeed was not investigating Northern Oil. Plaintiff's statement is thus unlike that in\n   <em>\n    DoubleLine Capital LP v.

But more pointedly, Defendants' statement did not mislead investors about any underlying material facts. A reasonable investor would not understand the fact the SEC is not investigating Northern Oil to mean that Northern Oil did not do anything wrong. Plaintiff's argument that the moment Defendants acknowledged the SEC investigation into Reger and Dakota Plains, they became obliged to disclose all of Northern Oil's uncharged, related wrongdoing, runs in the face of the general rule in this district that \"[c]orporations do not ... have a duty 'to disclose uncharged, unadjudicated wrongdoing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Menaldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338925\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/164/568/#p581\">\n    164 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   580 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Pontiac Policemen's &amp; Firemen's Ret.

In the SAC, Plaintiff adds new allegations purporting to show scienter. Plaintiff purports to proceed under both theories of scienter, alleging both that Defendants \"were personally motivated to make false statements and omit material information necessary to make the statements not misleading\" and that Defendants did so \"willfully or with reckless disregard for the truth.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 169, 170. Plaintiff's new allegations all come from \"CW1,\" a confidential witness who reported directly to Reger while working at Northern. Among these new allegations, highlighted in Plaintiff's briefing, are that (1) Dakota Plains used Northern Oil lawyers to draw up the papers to take Dakota Plains public, (2) Dakota Plains officers held meetings at Northern Oil offices, (3) Northern's employees were frequently required to perform tasks for Dakota Plains, and (4) Northern's board members knew that its resources were being allocated to Dakota Plains. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 66-68, 70-71, 72, 73. These\n   and other allegations, Plaintiff argues, show that Defendants knew that Reger's activities at Dakota Plains implicated Northern in the SEC investigation into Dakota Plains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But none of that has to do with whether Defendants made the allegedly misleading statements intentionally. Plaintiff confuses the question of whether Defendants believed that their statements were misleading with whether Defendants were aware of the facts that they, under Plaintiff's theory, had to disclose to prevent their statements from being misleading. The SAC cites no facts showing that Defendants engaged in conscious or reckless behavior in making the contested Form 10-Q disclosures. Indeed, CW1's allegations all concern events occurring years before the allegedly misleading statements were made. The SAC also alleges that Defendants were personally motivated to commit fraud, SAC \u00b6 170, but only in a conclusory fashion-Plaintiff cites no facts that would make that theory of scienter plausible. Consequently, as it did for the FAC, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to establish the requisite scienter under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because Plaintiff has failed to allege an actionable misstatement or omission and to plead the requisite scienter for such a misstatement or omission, Plaintiff's \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 20(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Liability for a \u00a7 20(a) violation is derivative of liability for a \u00a7 10(b) violation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re eSpeed, Inc.

Over two years into this litigation, Plaintiff has not been able to cite any misleading statements or omissions by Defendants, much less adequately allege that Defendants made such statements and omissions intentionally.
