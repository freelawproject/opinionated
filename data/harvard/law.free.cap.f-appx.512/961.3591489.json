On appeal, Vargas-Perdo-mo argues that, in denying his application for special rule cancellation of removal, the IJ erred by determining that his prior marriage never existed and that he was not a spouse of a lawful permanent resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>dent because a Florida court had annulled his marriage. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.8d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s determination was based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007). In a case like this one, where the BIA issues a single judge, non-precedential decision and does not rely on any precedent in reaching its decision, we do not give the decision any deference under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a single judge, non-precedential BIA opinion is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference where it does not rely on existing BIA or federal court precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2), which provides a \u201cspecial rule for battered spouse or child\u201d aliens, the Attorney General has discretion to cancel the removal of an alien who demonstrates: (1) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent who is or was a lawful permanent resident; (2) continuous physical presence in the United States for at least three years preceding the date of the application; (3) good moral character during that period; (4) a lack of certain criminal convictions; and (5) that removal would result in extreme hardship to the alien, the alien\u2019s child, or the alien\u2019s parent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In Florida, a marriage may be annulled by a party who was the victim of a marriage ceremony procured by fraud and deception of the other party, and when the marriage had not been consummated. <em>Cooper v. Cooper, </em>120 Fla. 607, 163 So. 35, 37 (1935). A marriage procured by fraud generally is voidable only, and thus, is valid and binding on the parties until annulled by a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>Tyson v. State, </em>83 Fla. 7, 90 So. 622, 623 (1922). However, when a marriage is void, it is treated as if no marriage had ever taken place. <em>See Kuehmsted v. Tumwall, </em>103 Fla. 1180, 138 So. 775, 777 (1932). Regardless of whether state law indicates that an annulment rendered a marriage void or voidable, the BIA has provided that in some cases, under the relation back doctrine, the annulment of a voidable marriage may be treated as if the marriage never existed if \u201cthe purposes of justice are deemed to require.\u201d <em>See Matter of T </em>\u2014 , 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">As an initial matter, we are only reviewing the BIA\u2019s final decision in this case since the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Further, because the BIA\u2019s decision is a single judge, non-precedential opinion, and the BIA did not rely upon a prece-dential opinion, we do not owe the BIA\u2019s opinion <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Regardless, the BIA did not err in denying Vargas-Perdomo\u2019s application for special rule cancellation of removal. We recognize that under Florida law, a marriage procured by fraud is generally voidable, and thus, is valid until the time it is annulled. <em>Tyson, </em>90 So. at 623. Despite this general rule, however, a Florida state court declared in a Final Judgment of Annulment that upon the annulment of Vargas-Perdomo\u2019s marriage his status was restored to \u201cnever married.\u201d Since the Florida court specifically declared that Vargas-Perdomo was \u201cnever married,\u201d as a legal matter, there never was any marriage in existence between Vargas-Perdo-mo and his now annulled former spouse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number><em>Kuehmsted, </em>138 So. at 777. It therefore follows that Vargas-Perdomo was never the spouse of a lawful permanent resident, which is one of the requirements for special cancellation of removal under the statute. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A). Because he does not meet this requirement, the BIA did not err in finding him statutorily ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
