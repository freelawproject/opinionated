On appeal, Conejo argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain its 8-month upward variance. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider .the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">The district court must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (requiring the district court to, at the time of sentencing, state in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence). Although the district court must consider the 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>\u00a7 3558(a) factors, it is not required to \u201cincant ... specific language\u201d or \u201carticulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d so long as the record reflects the court considered the factors. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">If the district court imposes a variance, it must also include a reason for the variance, <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190, and the \u201cjustification for the variance must be \u2018sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (requiring the sentencing court, if the chosen sentence is outside the guidelines range, to state \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from\u201d the guidelines range and to state that reason with specificity in the statement of reasons form). The district court\u2019s reason need not be lengthy; a brief explanation may suffice when the context and the record indicates the reasoning behind the chosen sentence. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1195.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Here, the district court explained in open court its reasons for imposing a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. Specifically, the district court stated that it had considered the \u201cthe guideline calculation as well as the [3553(a) ] factors, which include the nature and circumstances of the instant offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to promote respect for law, and provide adequate deterrence.\u201d The district court then stated that \u201c[hjaving looked at and considered each of those factors, it\u2019s the judgment of the Court that a sentence outside and above the otherwise applicable guideline range is appropriate in this case.\u201d The district court then detailed Conejo\u2019s extensive criminal history. The district court noted, among other things, that Conejo\u2019s criminal history began when he was 20 and included, in addition to his multiple prior convictions, charges of carrying a concealed weapon and two counts of first degree murder that were not ultimately pursued. The district court also stated in its written statement of reasons that Conejo\u2019s criminal history justified a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range. The district court\u2019s stated reason for the 8-month variance \u2014 Conejo\u2019s criminal history \u2014 is sufficient to allow for meaningful appellate review and satisfied the district court\u2019s obligations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Defendant Conejo argues that the district court\u2019s sentence required further explanation because, during the sentencing, the district court took \u201cconflicting actions\u201d when it \u201cgranted\u201d Conejo\u2019s \u201cMotion for Variance,\u201d but then imposed a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. When we examine more closely the basis for each of the district court\u2019s actions, however, we find no conflict between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Prior to the sentencing hearing, Defendant Conejo filed a \u201cMotion for Variance.\u201d Conejo\u2019s motion sought a downward variance based on the computation of his criminal history score in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Specifically, the PSI assigned 2 criminal history points for Conejo\u2019s July 2009 convictions for driving without a license and possession of cocaine (Case No. 09-CF-415). According to the PSI, Conejo originally entered into the drug court program for these offenses, but, after Conejo failed to appear at a drug court review, he was adjudicated guilty in 2011 and sentenced to nine months. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Based on this nine-month sentence, the PSI assigned 2 criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) (providing that 2 points are added for sentences of at least sixty days but not more than one year). Based on a total of 7 criminal history points, the PSI gave Conejo a criminal history category of IV, which with an offense level of 10, yielded an advisory guidelines range of 15 to 21 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Conejo\u2019s motion for a variance contended that the only reason he failed to appear, and thus received the nine-month sentence for the July 2009 convictions, was that he had been deported. Conejo argued that, absent the nine-month sentence, he would have received only 1 criminal history point for his July 2009 convictions, for a total of 6 criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c) (assigning 1 point for a sentence of less than sixty days). With 6 criminal history points, Conejo\u2019s criminal history category would have been III, which in turn would have lowered his advisory guidelines range to 10 to 16 months. Accordingly, Conejo\u2019s \u201cMotion for Variance\u201d asked the district court to sentence him within that 10-to-16-month range.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">At sentencing, the district court heard argument on Conejo\u2019s motion for a variance. The district court then stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make a difference in any event because it\u2019s my intention to consider the 3553 factors and sentence outside of the guidelines, anyway. So in order to moot this point for appellate purposes, I\u2019m going to grant the variance and reduce that to one point.\u201d The district court then stated that Conejo\u2019s offense level of 10 and criminal history category of III resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 10 to 16 months. The district court then explained why it was imposing a 24-month sentence, outside the 10-to-16-month advisory guidelines range, namely by reviewing Conejo\u2019s extensive and continuous criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">There is some question as to what precisely the district court did when it ruled on Conejo\u2019s \u201cMotion for Variance.\u201d Although Conejo contends that the district court granted a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 downward departure for over-represented criminal history, the district court\u2019s oral pronouncements and written statement of reasons suggest that the district court recalculated Conejo\u2019s criminal history score under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 and determined that Conejo\u2019s criminal history category was III, rather than IV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regardless of how the district court\u2019s actions are characterized, the district court\u2019s decision to assign only 1 criminal history point for Conejo\u2019s July 2009 convictions does not conflict with the district court\u2019s subsequent decision to vary upward by eight months based on Conejo\u2019s entire criminal history, which included not only his other convictions, but also other criminal conduct not resulting in convictions. Because the district court\u2019s actions were not inconsistent, the record is more than adequate to conduct appellate review, and the district court sufficiently explained and justified its above-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-13\">. Conejo\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court did not sufficiently explain its decision to impose an 8-month upward variance. Conejo does not raise any other procedural error at his sentencing or argue that his 24-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court sufficiently explained its sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b953-6\">. The district court\u2019s written statement of reasons: (1) adopted the PSI, with the exception of the determinations under Chapter Four of the Sentencing Guidelines (i.e., criminal history score and category); (2) assigned \"1 point for Case No. 09-CF-415\u201d; and (3) found that the criminal history category was Ill and the advisory guidelines range was 10 to 16 months. The district court never mentioned \u00a7 4A1.1 at sentencing and did not complete the portion of the statement of reasons form relating to departures authorized by the guidelines or check the box for \u00a7 4A1.3 departures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
