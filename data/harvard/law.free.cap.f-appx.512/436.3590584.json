California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Anderson has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Anderson\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Specifically, while the magistrate judge and plea agreement incorrectly advised Anderson concerning the relevant statutory minimum and maximum terms, the district court informed Anderson of the correct sentencing terms and provided him the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea during the sentencing hearing. Anderson persisted in pleading guilty, however, thereby confirming the voluntariness of his plea and demonstrating that the misstatement concerning the sentencing terms did not affect his decision. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the AP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>PEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
