We dismiss Septelici\u2019s petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Septelici, a native and citizen of Moldova, entered the United States as a nonim-migrant exchange visitor with authorization to remain until September 12, 2009. On November 2, 2009, he filed an application for asylum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But Septelici failed to appear at his asylum interview, so the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings, charging him as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) as an alien who remained in the country longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Along with his application, Septelici submitted the United States Department of State\u2019s 2009 Country Report for Moldova, which provided background information on ethnic tensions between Romanian-speaking and Russian-speaking Moldovans. The report also discussed the country\u2019s political climate, including unrest that peaked after an April 2009 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">At a hearing before an IJ, Septelici testified that he was a student in Moldova in April 2009 when communists were re-elected to political office through what many believed to be a fraudulent election. Two days after the election, Septelici gathered with thousands of other students to protest. He and his peers spoke and held banners bearing slogans such as \u201cdown with the communists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The following evening, Septelici was returning home from class when four masked individuals attacked him. He testified that his attackers beat him with their fists and hard objects because he \u201cwant[ed] to be united with Europe\u201d and \u201cto have the Romanian language spoken\u201d in Moldova. They also said \u201cthat they were going to teach all of us students how to stay in class instead of go out and protest.\u201d During the attack, Septelici briefly lost consciousness. Afterwards, at a hospital, a doctor noted that Septelici had signs of a beating on his body and face. He spent the next two weeks afraid to leave home, and during that time media reports indicated that other students were attacked, some by masked police. Medical records show that Septelici\u2019s injuries had completely healed within a month. Based on these events, Septelici testified that he was afraid to return to Moldova.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">The IJ found Septelici\u2019s testimony credible but denied his asylum application, concluding that the evidence did not establish Septelici had suffered persecution. Specifically, the IJ concluded that the isolated attack, which occurred during a period of extreme civil unrest, did not amount to the harm required to constitute persecution. And the IJ found that there was no connection between the attack and Septelici\u2019s political opinion. The IJ did not discuss whether Septelici had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">Septelici appealed to the BIA, and did not address whether he feared future persecution. The BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s past-persecution decision but also, <em>sua sponte, </em>determined that Sep-telici lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution. This is Septelici\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">\u201cWe review only the [BIAj\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion, so we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual determinations under the highly deferential substantial-evidence test, affirming the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288-84. We will only reverse a finding of fact where the record compels it, not if it merely supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341,1351 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">An asylum applicant must meet the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d which includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, to meet this definition, the applicant must demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Septelici did not argue to the BIA that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution, even though the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>addressed the topic, we are precluded from reviewing that issue. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). We therefore dismiss the portion of Sep-telici\u2019s petition pertaining to future persecution and address only whether the IJ and BIA erred in concluding that Septelici did not demonstrate past persecution on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions that Septelici failed to demonstrate past persecution. Persecution is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated instances of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Further, verbal threats \u201cin conjunction with [a] minor beating\u201d do not compel the conclusion that a petitioner suffered persecution. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Djonda, </em>we held that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner\u2019s beating was minor when the BIA relied on medical documents indicating that, after being beaten, kicked, and detained for 36 hours by police, the petitioner suffered only \u201cscratches and bruises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Septelici\u2019s medical records \u2014 on which the IJ and BIA relied \u2014 indicated that he suffered only bruising and contusions from the beating. Just as in <em>Djonda, </em>therefore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions that Septelici\u2019s beating was minor and, even when combined with the attackers\u2019 verbal threats, did not constitute persecution. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we deny his petition based on past persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">. Septelici also initially filed applications for withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Because he does not meaningfully challenge the denial of these forms of relief, he has abandoned these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. Because we conclude that Septelici's attack did not amount to persecution, we need not address whether substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions that Sep-telici failed to establish a nexus between the attack and his political opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
