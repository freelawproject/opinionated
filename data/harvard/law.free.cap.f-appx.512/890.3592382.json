BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Bray researches shipwrecks. Specifically, he tries to determine the location of wrecked ships that are believed to hold treasure. One such yet-undiscovered shipwreck is that of the <em>Merchant Royal, </em>a British ship that sank off the English coast in 1641 while transporting cargo speculated to be worth close to $500 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Odyssey is an underwater salvage company that shares Bray\u2019s interest in potentially valuable shipwrecks. Bray alleges that on a trip to Paris he met Greg Stemm, Odyssey\u2019s co-chairman, and that during the course of their meeting Stemm orally agreed on Odyssey\u2019s behalf to pay Bray a seven and one-half percent share of the <em>Merchant Royal\u2019s </em>recovery value\u2014 should it be found and salvaged \u2014 in exchange for Bray\u2019s notes and research regarding the wreck. Bray further alleges that Stemm later attempted to back out of this oral agreement, offering in writing to give Bray \u201ca cash payment of [\u00a311,000] in lieu of the previous agreement for a percentage of the net recovery of the <em>Merchant Royal.\u201d </em>Bray accepted the cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">Sometime after paying Bray for his research, Odyssey announced that it had located a shipwreck in the general area where Bray predicted the <em>Merchant Royal </em>went down. To determine the identity of the wrecked ship, Odyssey removed a portion of its cargo for testing. When it learned that the ship was <em>not </em>the <em>Merchant Royal, </em>Odyssey abandoned the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Odyssey\u2019s discovery of the unidentified ship, however, caused Bray to believe that Stemm induced him to give up his share of the <em>Merchant Royal\u2019s </em>spoils \u2014 estimated by Bray to be worth $87.5 million \u2014 in exchange for a cash buyout worth far less. Asserting that Odyssey \u201cknows the location of the <em>Merchant Royal,\u201d </em>and \u201cintends to return to th[at] location,\u201d Bray sued to \u201crescind[] the second contract, [and] return[ ] the parties to the positions they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>held before the second agreement was entered into.\u201d Specifically, Bray alleged claims of \u201cmutual mistake,\u201d \u201crescission,\u201d and \u201cfraud in the inducement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Odyssey moved for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, summary judgment. In response, Bray requested, and was granted, leave to amend his complaint. Bray\u2019s amended complaint was substantially similar to his original complaint, except that it added a claim for relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">After Bray filed his amended complaint, Odyssey moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Bray responded in opposition to Odyssey\u2019s motion to dismiss, but did not request leave to further amend his complaint. The district court granted Odyssey\u2019s motion, dismissing Bray\u2019s allegations of mutual mistake, rescission, and fraud in the inducement for failure to state a claim. The district court also dismissed Bray\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment because it determined that as to that count Bray had \u201cfail[ed] to establish an Article III \u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u201d All claims except Bray\u2019s request for declaratory relief were dismissed with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">On appeal, Bray argues that the district court was mistaken in its determination that his declaratory judgment action failed to establish an Article III case or controversy, and that his remaining actions failed to state claims under Rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bray also argues that even if dismissal of his complaint was proper, the district court should not have dismissed his mutual mistake, rescission, and fraud in the inducement claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">A. FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER RULE 12(b)(6)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion <em>de novo.. Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[A] court should only grant a motion to dismiss [under- Rule 12(b)(6) ] where the defendant demonstrates that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057. \u201cMoreover, when ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>court may properly dismiss a complaint with prejudice where the plaintiff has failed to request leave to amend, or if the complaint could not be more carefully drafted to state a valid claim. <em>See Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">\n<em>1.Bray\u2019s Mutual Mistake Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Bray argues that the district court erred in dismissing his allegation of \u201cmutual mistake.\u201d However, Florida law does not recognize mutual mistake as a claim for which a plaintiff may obtain relief. <em>See CJM Fin., Inc. v. Castillo Grand, LLC, </em>40 So.3d 863, 864-65 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) (indicating that although \u201ca mutual mistake may be a ground for reformation or rescission of a contract,\u201d to simply \u201csay that \u2018mutual mistake\u2019 has occurred is a statement without legal significance\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Rather, \u201cmutual mistake\u201d is \u201can avoidance\u201d pleaded by a party when sued on a contract. <em>Id. </em>at 865. Therefore, Bray\u2019s allegation of \u201cmutual mistake\u201d is not a legally cognizable cause of action, and would fail to state a claim even if more carefully drafted. Thus, the district court properly dismissed this count with prejudice. <em>See Wagner, </em>314 F.3d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">\n<em>2.Bray\u2019s Rescission Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Bray also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his rescission claim. Florida law does recognize a cause of action for rescission. <em>See Billian v. Mobil Corp., </em>710 So.2d 984, 990 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998). To state a claim for rescission of a contract under Florida law, a plaintiff must plead, among other things, \u201can offer to restore ... benefits\u201d furnished under the contract by the defendant, \u201cif restoration is possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 991. Here, as noted by the district court, Bray failed to plead a cognizable claim for rescission because he offered to restore only \u201cfunds paid by ODYSSEY to BRAY in excess of that which ODYSSEY owed to BRAY\u201d without also pleading that restoration of the full \u00a311,000 he received under the written contract was impossible. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the district court properly dismissed Bray\u2019s rescission count for failure to state a claim. <em>See id. </em>The district court properly dismissed this count with prejudice because Bray\u2019s complaint was counseled; the district court had previously admonished Bray regarding the elements of a rescission claim; Bray had already been allowed to amend his complaint in response to Odyssey\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings; and Bray did not request the opportunity to further amend his complaint in response to Odyssey\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Wagner, </em>314 F.3d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">\n<em>3.Bray\u2019s Fraud in the Inducement Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">To state a cognizable claim for fraud in the inducement, Florida law requires that a plaintiff plead an injury \u201c[r]e-sulting [from] acting in justifiable reliance on [a fraudulent] representation.\u201d <em>See Lou Bachrodt Chevrolet, Inc. v. Savage, </em>570 So.2d 306, 308 (Fla. 4th DCA 1990). The district court dismissed Bray\u2019s fraud in the inducement claim for failure to plead \u201ca resulting injury.\u201d Specifically, the district court determined that because the written agreement with Odyssey \u201cchanged only the consideration due\u201d for services that Bray already rendered, \u201c[t]he written agreement was simply a modification and produced no legal detriment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Here, Bray argues that the district court\u2019s analysis was mistaken because it failed to consider the fact that his interest in the recovery of the <em>Merchant Royal </em>was alienable and could have been sold to investors, presumably for an amount greater than the \u00a311,000 he received from Odyssey. Nowhere in Bray\u2019s complaint, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>er, did he plead facts sufficient to establish that a market exists for such a speculative commodity, let alone facts sufficient to establish that even if such a market <em>did </em>exist, his contingent recovery share would command a sum greater than that which he already received from Odyssey. Therefore, in keeping with the decision of the district court, we conclude that Bray has failed to plead \u201ca resulting injury\u201d and his claim was properly dismissed. And, as before, because Bray had already been allowed to amend his counseled complaint, and did not request to amend his complaint further upon Odyssey filing its motion to dismiss, the district court properly dismissed this claim with prejudice. <em>See Wagner, </em>314 F.3d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">B. FAILURE TO STATE AN ARTICLE III CASE OR CONTROVERSY</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Bray\u2019s final claim was for a declaratory judgment rescinding his written agreement with Odyssey, and reinstating the prior oral agreement. The district court dismissed this claim without prejudice, determining that Bray had \u201cfail[ed] to establish an Article III \u2018case or controversy\u2019 \u201d as required to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Bray argues that the district court was mistaken in this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The Declaratory Judgment Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">In a case of <em>actual controversy </em>within its jurisdiction, ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (emphasis added). The Declaratory Judgment Act\u2019s \u201cactual controversy\u201d requirement is jurisdictional and, thus, \u201ca threshold question in an action for declaratory relief must be whether a justiciable controversy exists.\u201d <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Caulkins Indiantoum Citrus Co., </em>931 F.2d 744, 747 (11th Cir.1991). To establish a case or controversy sufficient to invoke a court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a party must, \u201c[a]t an irreducible minimum,\u201d show: \u201c(1) that they personally have suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the alleged conduct of the defendant; (2) that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action; and (3) that it is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (same). Where, as here, a district court dismissed a request for declaratory relief for lack of an Article III case or controversy, our review is <em>de novo. See U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>931 F.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Bray\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his declaratory judgment action reduces to an assertion that \u201ca real, substantial controversy [exists] between adverse parties\u201d because it is \u201csufficiently likely that ... Odyssey has already or will soon find and salvage the <em>Merchant Royal.\u201d </em>We are not persuaded. As explained by the district court, until such time that Odyssey (1) discovers the wrecked <em>Merchant Royal </em>and (2) refuses Bray\u2019s attempts to collect on the alleged oral agreement guaranteeing him a share of the salvage, Bray\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment remains \u201ca premature and hypothetical [attempt] to pre-empt Odyssey\u2019s contingent defense in Bray\u2019s contingent lawsuit to establish Bray\u2019s contingent entitlement to a 7.5% share in the event of the contingent salvage of the <em>Merchant Royal.\u201d </em>This piling-on of contingencies falls far short of the requirements for establishing an actual case or controversy for purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, <em>see U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>931 F.2d at 747, and would render an attempt on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>part to adjudicate the merits of Bray\u2019s claim an impermissible advisory opinion. <em>See Friends of the Everglades v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, </em>699 F.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cHypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgment \u2014 which comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.\u201d) (quoting <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1016, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)). Thus, the district court properly dismissed this claim without prejudice, subject to future developments sufficient to create an actual case or controversy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-12\">. This is the second time we have been asked to determine whether the district court properly dismissed Bray's complaint. Previously, we reversed the district court's dismissal of Bray's action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and remanded for further proceedings, holding that Bray's contract claims were cognizable in federal admiralty jurisprudence because his contracts with Odyssey \"were by their terms entered in connection with maritime commercial venture.\u201d <em>See Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. v. Unidentified, Shipwrecked Vessel or Vessels, </em>636 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2011) [hereinafter <em>Odyssey </em>7] (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. Alternatively, Bray suggests that the district court was mistaken to dismiss his claims because in reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in <em>Odyssey I, </em>we implicitly endorsed the merits of his complaint. This argument fails. In <em>Odyssey I, </em>our review was limited to the question of subject-matter jurisdiction only; we gave no indication \u2014 express or otherwise- \u2014 as to whether Bray\u2019s action, although cognizable for purposes of subject-matter jurisdiction, could withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>See generally Odyssey I, </em>636 F.3d at 1338-41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. The terms of the written contract between Odyssey and Bray provide that \u201d[t]he laws of the State of Florida shall govern this Agreement.\u201d Although our jurisdiction is in admiralty and, generally, \"maritime law is federal law,\u201d we review the sufficiency of Bray\u2019s contract action under Florida law because we recognize that parties to a maritime contract may set the terms of the agreement between them, including choice-of-law, \"provided that the application of state law does not frustrate national interests in having uniformity in admiralty law.\u201d <em>See Coastal Fuels Mktg., Inc. v. Fla. Express Shipping Co., Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also King v. Allstate 1</em>1th Cir. 1990) (\u201cThere being no public policy problem whatsoever in parties to a maritime ... contract setting the terms of the [agreement] between them, we uphold their freedom to do so.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b918-16\">. Bray does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his claim to an alienable interest in the <em>Merchant Royal's </em>recovery was also insufficient to establish a case or controversy within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act. A legal claim or argument that is not briefed on appeal is deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
