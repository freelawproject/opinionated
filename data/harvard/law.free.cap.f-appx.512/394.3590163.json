He was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Castillo filed a motion to compel the Government to file a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). The district court denied Castillo\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">On appeal, Castillo asserts that his motion filed in the district court was intended to be a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He asserts that he intended to allege that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal and that his sentence is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Castillo\u2019s claims are unavailing. Castillo\u2019s motion filed in the district court only argues that he is entitled to a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) because he provided substantial assistance to the Government. Castillo\u2019s motion does not allege any constitutional claim concerning the validity of his conviction or sentence or a claim concerning his past or present desire to file a direct appeal. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>94 F.3d 989, 995 (5th Cir.1996). Even with liberal construction, there was no indication that Castillo\u2019s intent was to file a \u00a7 2255 motion and not a motion to compel the Government to file a Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Additionally, Castillo\u2019s appellate brief does not set forth any legal arguments or authority or factual analysis challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to compel the Government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. By failing to set forth and brief any issues relating to the district court\u2019s ruling on this motion, Castillo has waived review of any such claims. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
