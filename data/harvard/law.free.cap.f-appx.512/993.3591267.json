Rojas-Barron argues, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court elicited an opinion about its proposed sentence from the government. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">The district court did not plainly err. A district court is expected, in fashioning an appropriate sentence, to \u201callow both parties to present arguments as to what they believe[] the appropriate sentence should be.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 53, 128 S.Ct. 586, 598, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After the district court proposed to sentence Rojas-Barron to a term of imprisonment below the advisory guideline range that would run consecutive to a sentence imposed by a state court, the court reasonably elicited the opinion of the government about the proposed sentence. Rojas-Barron argues that the district court \u201csought to mete out a sentence that was agreeable to the government\u201d and treated the opinion of the government as a sentencing factor, but the district court explained that it selected a sentence that \u201crecognize[d] the existence of a significant state sentence!,] ... the extent to which ... service of that sentence contribute[d] to the satisfaction of the statutory purposes of sentencing!,] ... and also ... recogni[zed] ... [the] transgression of ... distinct federal interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">We AFFIRM Rojas-Barroris sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
