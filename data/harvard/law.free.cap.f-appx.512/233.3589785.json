We hold that summary judgment was inappropriate, and thus vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">As we write for the parties, we set forth only those facts necessary to our opinion. Appellants Shenecqua Butt, Tanya Mitchell, Theresa Howard, and Ellen Bronson are female, African-American carpenters. They brought suit against their union \u2014 the Metropolitan Regional Council of Carpenters, Southeastern Pennsylvania, State of Delaware and Eastern Shore of Maryland, United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America (\u201cthe Union\u201d) \u2014 as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>its Business Agent, Mark Durkalec, and its Business Manager, Edward Coryell. Appellants allege that, in making job referrals, Defendants discriminated against them on the basis of race and gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and because of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. They also allege retaliation under both provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In support of their discrimination claims, Appellants provided statistics comparing the annual hours worked by men and women in the Union. Although the numbers were not subjected to any expert statistical analysis, we note that there were many instances in which each individual Appellant\u2019s annual hours exceeded the average hours worked by male <em>and </em>female carpenters, and all five Appellants exceeded both averages in 2006. However, the average annual hours worked by women dropped significantly in the years 2007 and 2008 while the hours worked by men remained relatively constant from the preceding years.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Appellants also offered testimony regarding statements made by Defendants. Specifically, Butt testified that Durkalec informed her on multiple occasions that \u201cT got these jobs but.... I can\u2019t give them to you,\u2019 \u201d Butt Dep. 251:7-252:21, Feb. 11, 2011, and that she was instead offered jobs \u201c[t]hat the men don\u2019t want,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 203:9-205:25. Moreover, Bronson testified that, in response to job queries, Durkalec replied that \u201cmy people are still out of work.\u201d Bronson Dep., 29:1-11, May 3, 2011. Bronson interpreted this comment \u201cto mean [she] was not a white man and those were the ones that [were] his people,\u201d and that she \u201cwas not a part of that [clique].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30:1-4. She \u201cfelt as though [she] was being discriminated against because of that fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30:4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Appellants \u2014 excluding Bronson \u2014 allege that this drop in hours also was in retaliation for their protected activities, which included filing charges of discrimination against the Union with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, making complaints directly to the Union, and testifying before the Philadelphia Mayor\u2019s Advisory Commission on Construction Industry Diversity. Additionally, following Butt and Mitchell\u2019s testimony before the May- or\u2019s Commission, Durkalec forwarded a letter to the media explaining that the two had been laid off previously for poor work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The District Court had original jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">\u201cWe exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment....\u201d <em>Zavala v. Wal Mart Stores Inc., </em>691 F.3d 527, 545 (3d Cir.2012) (citation omitted). \u201cWe will affirm if our review shows \u2018that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sweeney, </em>689 F.3d 288, 292 (3d Cir.2012) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). When determining whether there is any such genuine issue of material fact, the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Height</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>ened Independence &amp; Progress, Inc. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>693 F.3d 345, 351 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Title VII makes it unlawful for a labor organization to \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d or \u201cfail or refuse to refer for employment any individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities ... because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(c)(1) \u2014 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The District Court concluded that the Appellants had not made out their <em>prima facie </em>case because they had not exhibited any \u201ccausal nexus between Defendants\u2019 conduct and the \u2018adverse employment actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butt v. United Broth., of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., </em>No. 09-4285, 2012 WL 360554, at *8 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 26, 2012). Specifically, the Court concluded that even if the statistics did indicate an illicit hiring preference, there were no facts implicating the Union in any disproportionality, and that there was no empirical evidence suggesting favoritism based on race. The Court instead opined that the \u201cPlaintiffs seem to be pursuing the wrong defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As for the retaliation claims, the Court found sufficient protected activities, but concluded that Appellants had failed to present \u201cevidence tending to show that the putative adverse employment actions were taken or even influenced by <em>Defendants.\u201d Id. </em>at *11 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Although the District Court applied a pretext analysis pursuant to <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), we see no reason why the Appellants could not have proceeded at this stage under a mixed-motive discrimination theory pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m). <em>See Makky v. Chertoff, </em>541 F.3d 205, 213 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cA Title VII plaintiff may state a claim for discrimination under either the pretext theory ... or the mixed-motive theory....\u201d). In either event, we see at least one genuine dispute of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment: Defendant Durkalec\u2019s statement that his people were still out of work. Although the District Court interpreted this \u201cseemingly inappropriate\u201d statement to mean \u201cmerely that Durkalec did not personally identify with black female carpenters,\u201d <em>Butt, </em>2012 WL 360554, at *9, this conflicted with Appellant Bronson\u2019s interpretation, which appears to be the only interpretation we can find in the record. In light of this genuine dispute, summary judgment was inappropriate on the claims of race and gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Remand is also appropriate to address the issue of Title VII retaliation. The District Court reasoned that an adverse employment action was limited to \u201ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *11 (quoting <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). This standard \u2014 pertaining to direct employers \u2014 failed to account for actions that a labor organization could take \u201cto dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 70, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Though the record contains almost no information about the letter Durkalec forwarded to the press, that action arguably could have sufficed as a retaliatory action under the law, and more factual analysis is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We thus vacate the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">.
