LaRavia was later removed from his position as Program Director and filed suit against defendants in Louisiana State court, raising several different claims. Defendants removed to federal district court, in which they moved successfully for summary judgment. That judgment is not in dispute here; this appeal concerns only the costs borne by defendants that the district court ordered LaRavia to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On January 13, 2011, defendants filed a Bill of Costs, seeking reimbursement for $12,073.60 of expenses. LaRavia objected on January 20, 2011, challenging only $1,093.60 of the costs sought. On June 15, 2012, a deputy clerk of the district court filed a Taxation of Costs, concluding that LaRavia owed $11,488.60 to defendants\u2014 only $585.00 less than they requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Nearly one month later, on July 12, 2012, plaintiff moved for leave to file a concededly late motion to review the Taxation. The motion did not explain why plaintiff failed timely to move for review. On July 16, 2012, plaintiff also filed a notice of appeal from the Taxation of Costs. The district court dismissed plaintiffs motion for leave \u201cin view of the pending appeal and untimely filing, with no cause for its lateness.\u201d On appeal, LaRa-via contends that the district court abused its discretion in taxing costs to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) authorizes a court clerk to \u201ctax costs on 14 days\u2019 notice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district \u201cmay review the clerk\u2019s action\u201d on \u201cmotion served within the next 7 days.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LaRavia conceded below and does not challenge here that he did not timely move for review of the Taxation of Costs. Nor does he challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for leave. \u201c[A] party\u2019s failure to seek review of a clerk\u2019s costs order in the district court constitutes a waiver of the right to challenge that order on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s taxation of costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
