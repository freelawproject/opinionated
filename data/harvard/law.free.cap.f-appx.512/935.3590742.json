App. C, amend. 750 (Nov. 2011). Among other things, Defendant Johnson does not dispute that his prior convictions qualify him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">I. SECTION 3582(c)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). As such, when a crack cocaine defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) because those amendments did not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number><em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (involving Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"AJum\">II. JOHNSON\u2019S ORIGINAL SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"ALi2\">At his sentencing, Johnson was designated a career offender, and his base offense level of 37 was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Johnson\u2019s total offense level was 34. With a criminal history category of VI, Johnson\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"AfUQ\">The district court, however, granted Johnson two downward <em>departures: </em>(1) a five-offense-level downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance; and (2) a one-criminal-history-category downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) because his criminal history category over-represented his criminal history. These two departures changed Johnson\u2019s advisory guidelines range to 140 to 175 months.</p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">The district court then granted Johnson a downward <em>variance </em>from that 140-to-175-months range and imposed a 120-month sentence. Johnson did not appeal his 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AReW\">III. JOHNSON\u2019S \u00a7 3582(c)(2) MOTION BASED ON AMENDMENT 750</p>\n<p id=\"AkPi\">In December 2011, Johnson filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion seeking a further reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 750, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AYty\">Because Johnson was designated a career offender, we agree with the district court that Amendment 750 did not have any effect on Johnson\u2019s offense level or his applicable guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. Thus, under <em>Moore, </em>the district court did not have the authority to grant Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. Although Johnson argues that <em>Moore </em>was abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), this Court has rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012) (concluding that, even after <em>Freeman, Moore </em>remains binding precedent in our Circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"A0ki\">We recognize that Johnson also argues that, despite his admitted career offender status, he is still eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because his <em>ultimate </em>120-month sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d his career offender range of 267 to 327 months. Johnson calculates what his original base offense level and guidelines range would have been, not as a career offender, but under the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Johnson calculates his base offense level as 30 under the drug quantity tables, which, with his acceptance of responsibility reduction and his original criminal history category of V, yields an original advisory guidelines range of 120 to 150 months. Johnson argues that by granting him two downward departures and a downward variance and ultimately sentencing him within that 120-to-150-month range, the sentencing court implicitly found that Johnson was not a career offender, and thus he should benefit from Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"AY1\">Johnson\u2019s argument lacks merit for several reasons. First, Johnson\u2019s argument ignores his status as a career offender, which was the basis of his 262 to 327 month advisory guidelines range. The only way Johnson got the 120-month sentence was due to downward departures and a variance. Second, and in any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>under the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d that must be lowered in order to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined ... <em>before </em>consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) (requiring any reduction to be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Third, we also reject Johnson\u2019s argument that he falls within any potential exception discussed in dicta in <em>Moore.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 4A1.3(b) criminal history downward departure was not to his offense level, but to his criminal history category. Thus, the possible exception discussed in <em>Moore </em>does not apply to Johnson. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-31. In any event, <em>Moore </em>was decided in 2008, and the guidelines commentary, effective November 1, 2011, makes clear that to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, the amendment must lower the guidelines range determined <em>before </em>any departure or variance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">In sum, because Johnson\u2019s advisory guidelines range was based on his career offender status, Johnson\u2019s sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d a subsequently lowered sentencing range, as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the district court lacked the authority to grant Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-11\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.

There is a threshold question of whether <em>Moore </em>created any exception to the general rule that crack cocaine defendants sentenced as career offenders are ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions based on recent amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), such as Amendments 706 and 750. <em>Moore </em>simply distinguished two district court cases in other Circuits in which career-offender defendants received \u00a7 4A1.3 criminal history downward departures that directly reduced their offense levels (not their criminal history category) and also received \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions based on Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
