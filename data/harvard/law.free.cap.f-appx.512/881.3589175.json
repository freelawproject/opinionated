BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">On June 22, 2011, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Kelly and fourteen codefendants with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and various substantive offenses related to that conspiracy. Specifically, Kelly was charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a methamphetamine mixture, and 50 grams or more of actual methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(viii), and 846 (Count I); three counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in -violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (Counts III, V, and XI); and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a) (Count XII).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">On August 2, the government filed notice that pending Kelly\u2019s conviction of \u201cthe drug offenses charged in the Indictment\u201d \u2014 including the drug conspiracy offense (Count I) \u2014 it intended to seek an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, based on Kelly\u2019s prior felony conviction for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Two days later, on August 4, Kelly entered into a written plea agreement with the government providing that he would plead guilty to Counts I and XII (the conspiracy charge and the gun charge, respectively), and in return the government would move to dismiss Counts III, V, and XI (the possession -with intent to distribute charges). The plea agreement stated, among other things, that Count I carried \u201ca mandatory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, [and] a maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d It also provided that \u201cthe sentence to be imposed is left solely to the discretion of the District Court,\u201d and that \u201cthe District Court\u2019s discretion in imposing sentence is limited only by the statutory maximum sentence and any mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by statute for the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">At Kelly\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the district court explained the potential sentencing consequences of pleading guilty. As to Count I, the court noted that the government had provided notice of its intent to seek an enhanced sentence and emphasized that if the enhanced sentence applied, Kelly would face \u201ca mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison.\u201d The district court then questioned Kelly to be sure that he understood that his sentence on Count I would vary depending upon whether it was enhanced, and that the ultimate decision as to sentencing remained with the district court. Kelly repeatedly affirmed that he understood the potential sentences that he faced, and also that he had sufficient time to talk to his lawyer about his possible sentences. Having determined that Kelly understood the charges, the plea agreement, and the sentencing possibilities, the district court adjudicated him guilty on Counts I and XII, and dismissed Counts III, V, and XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">The Probation Office prepared a presen-tence investigation report (PSI) that calculated Kelly\u2019s guideline sentence to be 121 to 151-months imprisonment based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of II. However, due to application of the \u00a7 851 enhancement, Kelly\u2019s minimum sentence on Count I was 240-months imprisonment. At sentencing, Kelly did not object to the recommendations in the PSI; instead he requested a sentence below the mandatory minimum based upon his acceptance of responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>and assistance to the government. The district court rejected Kelly\u2019s request, and sentenced him to 240-months imprisonment on Count I, and 240-months imprisonment on Count XII, to be served concurrently, which the court believed was the \u201cmandatory sentence required by statute.\u201d Kelly did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Kelly then appealed, arguing that he should have received a reduced sentence for having provided substantial assistance to the government, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. While his appeal was pending, Kelly filed a Motion for Relinquishment of Jurisdiction and Remand for Resentenc-ing, arguing that he was illegally sentenced to 240-months imprisonment on Count XII because the statutory maximum for that charge is 120-months, and requesting that his sentence on Count XII be vacated and his case remanded for re-sentencing <em>de novo. </em>We granted this motion in part, vacating Kelly\u2019s sentences as to Counts I and XII, and remanding for resentencing, but leaving to the district court\u2019s discretion \u201c[t]he decisions as to whether to conduct a resentencing hearing and as to the scope of any such hearing.\u201d <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>No. 11-15241 (11th Cir. Mar. 27, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Before resentencing, the Probation Office revised the PSI, again determining that Kelly\u2019s guideline range was 121 to 151-months, based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of II. The revised PSI also stated, as before, that Kelly faced a minimum term of 240-months imprisonment on Count I, based on the \u00a7 851 enhancement. For Count XII, however, the revised PSI indicated that Kelly faced a maximum term of only 120-months imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The PSI concluded that \u201c[bjecause the statutorily required minimum sentence as to Count 1 (240 months) is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range (151 months), the statutorily required minimum sentence of 240 months becomes the guideline sentence pursuant to [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Kelly objected to the revised PSI, arguing that under the terms of his plea agreement he was ineligible for the \u00a7 851 enhancement on Count I. He also objected to the length of his sentence compared to those of his codefendants, and argued that his drug addiction was a disability. Kelly reiterated these objections at his resen-tencing hearing, and urged the district court to determine <em>de novo </em>whether the enhancement should apply to Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">After verifying that Kelly did not object to the \u00a7 851 enhancement at his plea hearing or his original sentencing hearing, or raise it as an issue on appeal, and that Kelly was warned regarding the possibility of the enhancement during his plea colloquy, the district court held that it was \u201cnot going to revisit the application of the enhancement\u201d because there was \u201cample opportunity for that to have been raised ... and it was not done.\u201d Turning to Count XII, the district court determined that the statutory maximum of 120-months imprisonment was appropriate, given \u201cthe seriousness of the presence of a firearm\u201d in Kelly\u2019s drug distribution operation, and that Kelly had disregarded \u201cthe law that prohibits convicted felons from having firearms.\u201d In sum, the district court determined that a term of 240-months in prison \u2014 consisting of 240-months on Count I and 120-months on Count XII, each to run concurrently \u2014 was sufficient, but not greater than necessary \u201cto comply with the statutorily defined purposes of sentencing.\u201d As before, Kelly did not object. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqri\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Kelly\u2019s first argument is that the district court erred as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>when it determined that his plea agreement \u201cdid not by its explicit terms void the earlier filed enhancement information.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.2009). The guidelines provide, in pertinent part, that \u201c[wjhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.7(b). Here, as required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1), the government filed notice of its intent to seek an enhanced sentence on Count I based on Kelly\u2019s prior felony drug conviction. Kelly\u2019s prior drug conviction exposed him to a mandatory minimum sentence of 240-months imprisonment on Count I, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Once the district court accepted Kelly\u2019s guilty plea as to Count I, it was obligated to sentence him to the 240-month mandatory minimum if it determined that he had previously been convicted of a felony drug offense as alleged in the government\u2019s notice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 851(d)(1) (\u201c[I]f the court determines, after hearing, that the person is subject to increased punishment by reason of prior convictions, the court shall proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Clark, </em>274 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe sentencing guidelines make clear that where a guidelines range falls entirely below a mandatory minimum sentence, the court must follow the mandatory statutory minimum sentence.\u201d); <em>of. United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cpermitted courts discretion as to the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences\u201d). Kelly does not dispute that he was previously convicted of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, a felony drug offense. Therefore, the district court did not err in sentencing Kelly to the mandatory minimum 240-month term of imprisonment on Count I, due to the \u00a7 851 enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Kelly also argues that his revised, guideline sentence of 120-months imprisonment on Count XII is unreasonable. We review a sentence imposed by the district court for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Kelly concedes that the district court\u2019s calculation of his guideline range was procedurally correct. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d). He argues, however, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was out of proportion to sentences received by his codefendants, failed to account for his \u201cefforts to cooperate\u201d with the government, and also failed to account for his methamphetamine addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In determining whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, we are guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThese factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We are not persuaded by Kelly\u2019s argument that his guideline sentence on Count XII is substantively unreasonable. In arriving at its sentencing determination, the district court expressly considered Kelly\u2019s conduct compared to his codefendants, as well as his drug addiction. The record is equally clear that the court heard argument regarding Kelly\u2019s cooperation with the government, even if that cooperation was not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for a reduced sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. In sum, however, the court determined that these factors were outweighed by other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide just punishment. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. On this record we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that a high-end guideline sentence was appropriate on Count XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">For these reasons, Kelly\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-5\">. The government responds initially that we lack jurisdiction to consider this argument because in remanding Kelly's case for resen-tencing, we limited the district court\u2019s mandate to correcting the illegal sentence on Count XII, and thus the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the sentencing enhancement issue. This argument has no merit. In accordance with our precedent, our order unambiguously vacated Kelly's \"sentences,\u201d not just his sentence for Count XII, and left to the discretion of the district court \"whether to conduct a resentencing hearing\u201d and to determine \"the scope of any such hearing.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>No. 11-15241; see <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir. 1996) (\"[Wjhen a criminal sentence is vacated, it becomes void in its entirety; the sentence \u2014 including any enhancements \u2014 has been wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 169 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that a district court, on remand for resentencing, has discretion to avoid \"redofing] that which had been done correctly at the first hearing\u201d). Because our remand order gave the district court discretion to consider whether the sentencing enhancement was properly applied, and because we undoubtedly have jurisdiction to hear \"appeal[s] from-... resentencing upon remand,\u201d <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Fiallo-Jacome, </em>874 F.2d 1479, 1481 (11th Cir.1989), we have jurisdiction to consider Kelly\u2019s argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Alternatively, the government urges that Kelly waived the sentencing enhancement issue by failing to raise it at his initial sentencing hearing or on appeal. Because Kelly\u2019s claim fails on the merits, we need not decide the issue of waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. Nothing in Kelly\u2019s plea agreement relieved the district court of its statutory obligation to impose the mandatory minimum sentence, nor could it. <em>See Clark, </em>274 F.3d at 1328. Beyond that, nothing in the agreement made it reasonable for Kelly to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>that he would not be subject to the \u00a7 851 enhancement, if the court determined that the information in the government\u2019s notice was accurate. This is so because Kelly's plea agreement never mentioned the previously filed enhancement notice, but instead expressly provided for the possibility of \"any mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by statute for the offense,\" and included an integration clause stating \"[t]here are no other agreements between the [government] ... and Jack Allen Kelly.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1192-93 (11th Cir. 2008) (noting the inclusion of an integration clause in the plea agreement to reject the appellant's argument that he reasonably understood the government to have implicitly agreed to certain terms).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
