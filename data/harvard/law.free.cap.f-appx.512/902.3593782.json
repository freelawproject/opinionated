This appeal follows from the denial of Frazier\u2019s <em>second </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In this appeal, Frazier argues that the district court erred in determining that it did not have the authority to reduce his term of imprisonment. After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir. 2008). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, made permanent an amendment lowering the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. These amendments altered the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) so that a base offense level of 36 applies to cases involving at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>See id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Generally, a district court may not make new findings of fact in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s refusal to re-examine the number of marijuana plants involved in the offense). However, a district court conducting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not make an \u201cimpermissible new finding of fact\u201d simply by holding a defendant responsible for a crack cocaine amount that was set forth in the factual determinations of the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and adopted by the original sentencing court. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">When the district court ruled on Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion in this case, it did not err by relying on facts contained in the PSI showing that Frazier\u2019s drug trafficking convictions were based on conduct involving at least 2.8 kilograms of crack cocaine. Indeed, not only were the facts found in the PSI, but, at sentencing, the district court determined that they were supported by the trial evidence, and incorporated them into Frazier\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, paragraph eight of the PSI said that Hopkins, Frazier\u2019s co-conspirator, had delivered quarter kilograms of cocaine base to Frazier twice a week for three months at the end of 1990. This equates to a total of six kilograms on these deliveries alone, and the PSI also detailed similar transactions with similar drug quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">While <em>Davis </em>may be factually distinguishable from the instant case (since Davis did not object to the relied on PSI facts, while Frazier did), that distinction bears no legal significance here. The district court expressly overruled Frazier\u2019s objections, adopted the PSI, and incorporated the PSI\u2019s explicit factual findings concerning high volume drug trafficking into his sentence, which we affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>107 F.3d 23 (11th Cir.1997). Furthermore, the narrow scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings would not permit Frazier to challenge the factual findings contained in the PSI in the instant proceeding. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1562-63. Thus, Frazier remains bound by the original sentencing court\u2019s adoption of the factual determinations contained in the PSI. While we expressed doubt as to the record\u2019s clarity in Frazier\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we never have determined that the district court erred when it concluded that Frazier was sentenced based on at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and our later decision in <em>Davis </em>made clear that such a determination was not erroneous. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>343 F. App\u2019x 523, 524 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">In short, Frazier\u2019s base offense level, post-Amendment 750 and based on his trafficking of at least 2.8 kilograms of crack cocaine, would be at least 36, resulting in a total offense level of 44 and a guideline sentencing range of life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). As a result, the district court did not err when it determined that it did not have the discretion to reduce Frazier\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range, which remained life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-13\">. In addition, we DENY Frazier\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal because the document he seeks to add to the record is not relevant to the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
