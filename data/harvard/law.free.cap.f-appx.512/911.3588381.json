Royal American contends that Liberty Mutual materially breached the insurance contract by improperly handling the claim and therefore it is excused from reimbursing Liberty Mutual for what it paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Royal American purchased an insurance policy from Liberty Mutual that covered workers compensation claims made in 2001 by Royal American\u2019s employees. The policy had a deductible of $300,000 per occurrence and Royal American was also responsible for reimbursing Liberty Mutual for all allocated loss adjustment expenses that Liberty Mutual incurred with each claim, even if the total amount was greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>than the $300,000 deductible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whenever Liberty Mutual paid a claim, it advanced the amount of the claim and billed Royal American for the deductible and allocated loss adjustment expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In October 2001 Ricky Thomas, an employee of Royal American, hurt his back and pinched a nerve in his hip when he \u201cstepped wrong\u201d off a ladder at work. Royal American filed a report with Liberty Mutual detailing that injury, and Liberty Mutual initially estimated the claim to be valued at around $10,000. Thomas received a back surgery as treatment for that injury, and in May 2002 he was medically cleared to go back to work. At that time, the doctors reported that Thomas had reached maximum medical improvement even though he still had a 7% impairment rating. Based on that information, Liberty Mutual decided to close Thomas\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">By December 2003, however, Liberty Mutual had reopened Thomas\u2019 claim because he was continuing to receive pain management treatment related to his back injury. That treatment continued from 2003 to 2006. During that time, Liberty Mutual continued to pay for Thomas\u2019 pain treatments and Royal American continued to reimburse Liberty Mutual for those amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In April 2006 Thomas\u2019 leg gave out while he was at home, which caused him to fall and injure his left shoulder. Liberty Mutual began to pay for injections to treat his shoulder injury but did not initially order an independent medical examination or otherwise question whether those injections were covered under the policy. In February 2007 Thomas\u2019 doctor told a Liberty Mutual claims adjuster that Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury was unrelated to his on-the-job back injury. In April of that year an American Royal employee e-mailed the Liberty Mutual claims adjuster who was handling Thomas\u2019 claim and instructed him to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re not paying for the shoulder,\u201d because American Royal believed that the shoulder injury was not job-related. Even after Liberty Mutual received that e-mail, however, it continued to pay for Thomas\u2019 shoulder-treating injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">In December 2007 Thomas retained his own counsel who formally petitioned Liberty Mutual for treatment from an orthopedic specialist for his shoulder injury. Liberty Mutual took the position that the treatment was not covered because Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury was not work-related. To resolve the coverage dispute, Liberty Mutual and Thomas entered into mediation. In February 2008 Liberty Mutual ordered an independent medical examination to determine whether Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury was related to his on-the-job back injury. According to the report from the independent medical examination, Thomas\u2019 back injury caused his leg to give out and that caused him to fall and injure his shoulder, so Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury and on-the-job back injury were \u201cdirectly related.\u201d Liberty Mutual then concluded that Thomas\u2019 claim for treatment of the shoulder injury was covered under the policy and settled the claim for $185,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Royal American refused to reimburse Liberty Mutual for the amounts that it had paid and the allocated loss adjustment expenses associated with Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury claim. Liberty Mutual filed a lawsuit against Royal American to recover those amounts, alleging one count of breach of contract. Royal American as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>serted as an affirmative defense that Liberty Mutual had breached \u201cthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d by failing to investigate whether Thomas\u2019 injury was job-related and settling his claim for an unreasonably high amount. After a bench trial, the district court entered a final judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual in the amount of $195,243. This is Royal American\u2019s appeal of that final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings after a bench trial, and we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Levy, </em>541 F.3d 1102, 1110 (11th Cir.2008). Royal American contends that Liberty Mutual materially breached the insurance contract\u2019s implied duty of good faith by failing to timely investigate Thomas\u2019 claim for treatment of his left shoulder injury and by settling the claim for much more than Royal American thought it was worth. According to Royal American, those breaches were material and excuse the duty it would otherwise have to reimburse Liberty Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The insurance contract between Liberty Mutual and Royal American obligated Liberty Mutual to defend Royal American against all claims made under the policy. As part of that obligation, Liberty Mutual also had the \u201cright to investigate and settle\u201d claims made under the policy. It stated in the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">We have the right and duty to defend at our expense any claim, proceeding or suit against you for benefits payable by this insurance. We have the right to investigate and settle these claims, proceedings or suits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Under Florida law, when an insurance contract gives an insurer that right, the \u201cinsurer, handling the defense of claims against its insured, has a duty to use the same degree of care and diligence as a person of ordinary care and prudence should exercise in the management of his own business.\u201d <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Gutierrez, </em>386 So.2d 783, 785 (Fla. 1980). As part of that duty, the insurer must \u201cinvestigate the facts, give fair consideration to a settlement offer that is not unreasonable under the facts, and settle, if possible, where a reasonably prudent person, faced with the prospect of paying the total recovery, would do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Royal American contends that Liberty Mutual breached that duty by paying for Thomas\u2019 injections without first investigating whether his shoulder injury was related to his on-the-job back injury and by continuing to pay for Thomas\u2019 injections even though Thomas\u2019 doctor had told a Liberty Mutual claims adjuster in February 2007 that the shoulder injury was unrelated to the on-the-job back injury and even though Royal American had asked Liberty Mutual in an April 2007 e-mail to stop paying for Thomas\u2019 shoulder treatment. Royal American also complains that by continuing to make those payments, Liberty Mutual waived the right to contest coverage for Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury, which waiver resulted in a settlement that was higher than the claim warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Even if Liberty Mutual\u2019s handling of Thomas\u2019 claim was unreasonable and a breach of its duty to Royal American, the district court did not err by entering judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual on its breach of contract claim. Royal American was excused from its contractual duty to pay the deductible only if Liberty Mutual\u2019s breach was material. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Curran, </em>83 So.3d 793, 813-14 (Fla. 5th DCA 2011) (stating that in determining whether a breach of an insurance contract excuses performance, \u201cFlorida courts focus on the materiality and willfulness of the breach\u201d). A materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>al breach is \u201ca breach causing prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80S; <em>see also Bankers Ins. Co. v. Macias, </em>475 So.2d 1216, 1218 (Fla.1985) (holding that neither an insured\u2019s failure to timely report a claim nor breach of its duty to cooperate with the insurer is a material breach unless there is prejudice to the insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">There is no evidence that Royal American was prejudiced by the way Liberty Mutual handled Thomas\u2019 claim. Liberty Mutual ordered an independent medical examination that concluded that Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury was related to his on-the-job back injury. Under Florida law, an independent medical examination is binding on the insurer and the employee. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.13(5). Liberty Mutual was therefore obligated to pay expenses related to Thomas\u2019 shoulder injury and neither its failure to conduct an investigation before it began paying those expenses nor its continued payments after Thomas\u2019 doctor informed the claims adjuster that the shoulder injury might not be covered caused any prejudice to Royal American. There is also no evidence that if the independent medical examination had been performed when Thomas first injured his shoulder in 2006 the conclusion would have been any different, and therefore there is no evidence that Liberty Mutual would have been able to settle the claim for a lower amount if it had handled the claim differently. Accordingly, the district court did not err by entering judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">. The policy defines allocated loss adjustment expenses as \"claim adjustment expensefs] directly allocated by [Liberty Mutual] to a particular claim,\u201d which include attorney\u2019s fees, court costs, and expenses for medical examinations and medical diagnostic tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
