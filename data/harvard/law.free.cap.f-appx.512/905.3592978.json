The district court reviewed Hill\u2019s original complaint as well as her amended complaint. The district court also noted Hill\u2019s intervening attempt to amend her complaint, when she failed to attach any proposed complaint. The district court found the initial complaint failed to state a claim and the first attempt to amend was deficient for failing to attach a proposed amended complaint. While the district court granted Hill's motion for leave to amend, it found the proposed amended complaint to be deficient as well. The court dismissed the action with prejudice because \u201c[b]ased on [Hill's] counsel\u2019s first three efforts at drafting a complaint, the court ha[d] no reason to believe that any additional opportunity to amend would be more fruitful.\u201d Hill\u2019s argument on appeal is that the district court was wrong to dismiss her complaint with prejudice, i.e. without further leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-24\">Hill filed her first complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County on July 29, 2011. BOA removed the action to federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>court. The complaint asserted that Hill got a mortgage from \u201cCountry Wide Home Loan\u201d in October of 2005 for $464,000. In early 2009, Hill learned about \u201ca federal mortgage relief program called [the] Making Home[s] Affordable Program.\u201d Apparently, Hill applied to BOA to join the program, \u201c[b]ut, instead of offering to lower her payments, they offered to increase her payments which certainly [was] contrary to the purpose and intent of the program.\u201d By January of 2010, Hill got notice from BOA that she was delinquent on her payments and that her home would be foreclosed on in March.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Hill claims she wrote BOA in October of 2010 requesting a loan modification. She says she received a letter thanking her for participation in the loan modification program, but nothing else happened. In February of 2011, she submitted another loan modification application but it was denied and she later got an e-mail saying the loan was in underwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The complaint goes on to explain \u201c[o]n May 3, 2011[,] Plaintiff [requested to confirm default amount $511,000. Notice foreclosure anticipated.\u201d Hill later received notice that her loan was \u201cin its final stage for Trial Payment Notification\u201d and was told that the loan was \u201cwaiting for Trial Payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">After setting out these facts, Hill alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">the offer to Plaintiff to modify the loan was accepted when she submitted her application. BOA had an obligation to promptly attend to it and to guide Plaintiff through the process. When she was told not to make the December and January payments, which was contrary to the plan, BOA breached the contract between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj1\">\u201cCount Two\u201d of the complaint makes a claim for \u201cdeceptive trade practices.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For this Count, Hill complains that BOA did not honor its verbal promises and lost her written materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Once in federal court, BOA moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). BOA argued that Hill violated Rule 8(a) because her complaint failed to provide a short, plain statement of the claims. BOA also argued that insofar as Hill alleged breach of contract claims, her claims would fail under Georgia\u2019s Statute of Frauds requiring that land contracts be in writing. And finally, BOA argued that the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act does not apply to residential mortgage transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">After filing a short response to BOA\u2019s motion asking the court to construe her complaint to do \u201csubstantial justice,\u201d Hill moved to amend her complaint but failed to provide an amended complaint, as is required. <em>See Long v. Satz, </em>181 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir.1999). Hill then filed another motion for leave to amend, this time attaching a new amended complaint in which she purported to add as many as eight more defendants who engaged in a \u201cpattern and practice of deceptive conduct\u201d in violation of Georgia\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1-370 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of a case. <em>Catron v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>658 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2011). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for leave to amend the complaint. <em>Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of Marietta, Ga., </em>654 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), a plaintiffs complaint must be \u201cplausible\u201d in that it must plead facts that support a reasonable inference that there has been some wrongdoing. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974, <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Where a litigant fails to provide the court with the amendment it proposes, however, a court does not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend. <em>Long, </em>181 F.3d at 1279-80. A court may also deny leave to amend where the plaintiff fails to show that the amended complaint satisfies Rule 8(a). <em>United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, </em>470 F.3d 1350, 1362 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, there are situations in which courts \u201c[do] not abuse [their] discretion by dismissing ... complaint[s] with prejudice, i.e., without leave to amend.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Hill argues that she should have been allowed leave to amend her complaint again, and further that the court should have given her \u201cinstructions to correct the deficiencies.\u201d Hill argues her complaint \u201cshould not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appeared beyond a doubt that she could not have proven through any set of facts to support her claim that would entitle her to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Hill\u2019s arguments are without merit. First, she fails to provide legal authority to support the idea that a Court can <em>never </em>dismiss with prejudice a complaint after three unsuccessful attempts to meet Rule 8(a)\u2019s very low threshold. Indeed, we have precedent to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Long, </em>181 F.3d at 1279-80; <em>McInteer, </em>470 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Second, to the extent that Hill suggests that the district court did not review her amended complaint, she is clearly incorrect. Indeed, the district court reviewed Hill\u2019s \u201cmotion to amend complaint and for leave to file amended complaint\u201d and said so: \u201c[t]he court has reviewed Plaintiffs proposed amended complaint.\u201d It simply found the amended complaint to be as deficient as the first one.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Third, our <em>de novo </em>review of the initial complaint and the amended complaint brings us to the same conclusion as the district court: that the complaints should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. The district court got it right when it said \u201cthat [Hill\u2019s] initial complaint was wholly insufficient in the manner in which it pled facts and alleged causes of action\u201d and that the proposed amended complaint was similarly deficient, merely \u201ccontain[ing] sweeping generalizations about the sufficiency of mortgage servicing operations of the proposed defendants\u201d and \u201cmak[ing] not one specific allegation about Plaintiff, Janet Hill, and what happened to her loan or her application.\u201d As such, it was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Based on our <em>de novo </em>review of Hill\u2019s filings, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-8\">.
