First, Edwards argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his preliminary injunction requesting transfer to the custody of Miami-Dade County. Second, he argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim because he demonstrated that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated the Constitution by restraining him in state prison based on an erroneously entered judgment. Finally, he argues that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to grant him leave to amend his complaint prior to dismissal. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Troville v. Venz, </em>303 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2002). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Once a final judgment is rendered, an appeal is properly taken from the final judgment, not the preliminary injunction. <em>Burton v. Georgia, </em>953 F.2d 1266, 1272 n. 9 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">In <em>Hutcherson v. Riley, </em>468 F.3d 750 (11th Cir.2006), we explained the differences between a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action and a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-21\">The line of demarcation between a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action and a \u00a7 2254 habeas claim is based on the effect of the claim on the inmate\u2019s conviction and/or sentence. When an inmate challenges the \u201ccircumstances of his confinement\u201d but not the validity of his conviction and/or sentence, then the claim is properly raised in a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983. However, when an inmate raises any challenge to the \u201clawfulness of confinement or [the] particulars affecting its duration,\u201d his claim falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>solely within \u201cthe province of habeas corpus\u201d under \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 754. In addition, declaratory or injunctive relief claims that raise habeas corpus claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1066 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We have held that even when the plaintiff did not seek leave to amend until after final judgment, where a more carefully drafted pleading might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint prior to dismissal. <em>Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991). With respect to counseled defendants who failed to request leave to amend, we overruled this holding. <em>See Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc) (\u201cA district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d). But <em>pro se </em>litigants are held to a less stringent standard, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), and our decision in <em>Wagner </em>did not disturb our decision in <em>Bank </em>with respect to a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s right to amend. <em>See Wagner, </em>314 F.3d at 542 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Edwards\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The district court rendered final judgment, and therefore, Edwards\u2019s appeal is properly taken from the final judgment, not the preliminary injunction. <em>Burton, </em>953 F.2d at 1272 n. 9. Because Edwards challenges the fact that he is being held in the custody of the Florida State Prison system, on the basis of the underlying judgment, his claim must be raised in a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, not a \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Hutcherson, </em>468 F.3d at 754. If a court were to conclude that Edwards\u2019s commitment to the Florida State Prison system based on his conviction was unconstitutional, this would necessarily imply that his conviction was invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Edwards\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint. Furthermore, the district court properly declined to grant Edwards leave to amend his complaint because even a more carefully drafted complaint could not state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Bank, </em>928 F.2d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Based on these considerations, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">. Even if we were to accept that Edwards's \u00a7 1983 claim is based on the place of his confinement, Edwards's claim would still fail to state a claim for relief. The Supreme Court has held that \"the Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 221, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005) (citing <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976)); <em>see also Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 248, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
