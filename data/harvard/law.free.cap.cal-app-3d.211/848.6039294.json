(HGS; collectively, defendants)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seek to overturn respondent court\u2019s order dated November 21, 1988, granting summary adjudication of certain issues. By a second and a supplemental (or third) petition for such relief (B039704), defendants seek, inter alia, to overturn or modify the court\u2019s orders dated January 20 and 30, 1989, in which the court barred discovery sought by defendants by reason of the November 21 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We grant the initial petition as to Eleanor. The second and supplemental petitions are dismissed as to Eleanor on the ground of mootness. We deny all of the petitions as unmeritorious with respect to the remaining defendants. The alternative writs issued by this court in conjunction with those petitions are discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">In passing on the petition in B038583 this court resolves an issue of first impression under federal and California law: Do the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions of sections 580a and 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> apply to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code? We hold they do not. By statute, the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions apply only to judicial foreclosure sales (\u00a7\u00a7 725a, 726) and nonjudicial foreclosure sales (\u00a7 580a). A sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code is neither a judicial nor a nonjudicial foreclosure sale under California law. Moreover, the application of the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is not compelled by California\u2019s principles of equity. (Cf. <em>Butner </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 48, 55-56 [59 L.Ed.2d 136, 141, 99 S.Ct. 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Factual Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Jack Singer (Singer) was the principal shareholder of Atlas Finance and Realty Corporation, Ltd. (Atlas). Pursuant to a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d dated March 6, 1981, and its addendum (March 6 Agreement), Atlas agreed to loan Zoetrope a total of $8 million as interim financing for the production of a motion picture entitled \u201cOne From the Heart\u201d (picture), which loan was to be repaid only out of the gross proceeds from the exploitation of the picture. That loan was to be delivered \u201con the date of closing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">At certain intervals prior to the closing date, however, Atlas made four advances to Zoetrope in the sums of $1 million, $1 million, $500,000, and $500,000, respectively, for a total of $3 million. Each of these advances was evidenced by a separate promissory note executed by Zoetrope as the borrower and guaranteed by Esquire Holding Company (Esquire) and Francis. Esquire\u2019s guaranty was secured by a deed of trust on the subject real property (the Studio Property). At all relevant times prior to February 10, 1984, either HGS or Esquire owned the Studio Property. Darion Development Corporation (Darion), as agent for Atlas, was \u201cthe lender, payee and beneficiary, respectively,\u201d of the advances, notes, and deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Pursuant to the March 6 Agreement the notes were to be cancelled upon closing under that agreement and the advanced $3 million would be considered part of the $8 million loan. If no closing occurred, then Atlas had no duty to loan Zoetrope the $8 million, and Zoetrope\u2019s obligation to repay the $3 million remained payable pursuant to the promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">\u201cClosing\u201d would occur \u201cat a mutually agreeable place and time upon satisfaction of the Conditions of Closing . . . , but in no event later than [\u2018. . . the expiration of six (6) days after the day of the Fourth Advance.\u2019]\u201d The \u201cFourth Advance\u201d was made on March 26, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">As a condition to closing, Zoetrope, HGS, and Esquire agreed to deliver to Atlas the consent of Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase) to the terms of the March 6 Agreement. Chase had loaned approximately $10.6 million as of that date for the production of the picture. Pursuant to the March 6 Agreement, Chase would agree, inter alia, that Atlas would be in first position, <em>pari passu </em>with Chase, with respect to the right to recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">According to the March 6 agreement, in the event of a failure to meet a \u201cCondition of Closing,\u201d the notes were payable \u201cone month after the latest permissible closing date\u201d or \u201cone month after written demand by Atlas,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>whichever event occurred first. On their face, however, the four notes were payable \u201cnot later than two months after demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It is undisputed that Chase\u2019s consent to the terms of the March 6 Agreement was never obtained and that there was no \u201cclosing\u201d under the March 6 Agreement. It is also undisputed that the remaining $5 million of the proposed loan was never delivered to Zoetrope and that none of the $3 million advanced to Zoetrope pursuant to the subject four notes has been repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Procedural Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In July, 1983, HGS, owner of the Studio Property, was the debtor in an involuntary chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to an order dated December 22, 1983,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court granted the request of HGS, as debtor-in-possession, to sell its assets free and clear of all liens and to set a minimum bid of $12.2 million for the Studio Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">At the February 10, 1984, auction of the assets of HGS, Darion purchased the Studio Property for $12.3 million. By order of the same date the bankruptcy court confirmed the sale and ordered that title to the property was to vest \u201cfree and clear of all liens, encumbrances and claims of any and all persons and entities whomsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">On January 31, 1985, the bankruptcy proceeding against HGS was dismissed on HGS\u2019s motion. There has been no adjudication that any debt HGS owed to Darion has been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">On February 1, 1985, Singer, Darion, and Atlas ('collectively, plaintiffs) filed the underlying action for a money judgment based on the debt evidenced by the four promissory notes, not on the March 6 Agreement, and on February 19, 1985, filed a first amended complaint. On October 18, 1985, Francis, Eleanor, and Zoetrope filed a joint answer. Also on that date Zoetrope and HGS filed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">By court order HGS was added as a Doe defendant in the second amended complaint filed January 27, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">On February 21, 1986, defendants answered the second amended complaint by generally denying its material allegations and by asserting various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>affirmative defenses including breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement and a defense referred to by defendants as \u201ceconomic duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Following a hearing on November 21, 1988, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of 16 issues as specified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On December 1, 1988, defendants filed their first petition for a writ of mandate or other extraordinary relief (B038583), which challenged the November 21, 1988, order with respect to all the issues as to Eleanor but only issues 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 as to the remaining defendants. We issued an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>On January 20, 1989, the respondent court granted the motion of plaintiffs to stay discovery regarding the fraud and economic duress issues on the ground that those issues were disposed of by the November 21, 1988, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On January 31, 1989, defendants filed a supplemental petition for a writ of mandate or other extraordinary relief (B039704) in which they sought to have the January 20 order vacated or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">By order filed February 14, 1989, this court consolidated the petitions for extraordinary relief in B038583 and B039704 and issued a second alternative writ of mandate regarding the order dated January 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">I. <em>Initial Petition (B038583)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> In their first petition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defendants contend that the court\u2019s order dated November 21, 1988, was erroneous in all respects as to Eleanor and erroneous as to the remaining defendants only with respect to issues 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">\u201cIn reviewing an order declaring an issue \u2018without substantial controversy\u2019 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, we are bound by the rules generally applicable to review of summary judgments.\u201d <em>(Tauber-Arons Auctioneers Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 268, 273 [161 Cal.Rptr. 789].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Summary judgment is proper only if the evidence presented by the moving party is sufficient to sustain a judgment in his favor and his opponent does not by evidence show facts sufficient to present a triable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>issue.  The evidence of the moving party is strictly construed and that of the responding party liberally construed, and doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion must be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>(Varco-Pruden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hampshire Constr. Co. </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 654, 659 [123 Cal.Rptr. 606].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Mindful of the foregoing principles, we first address the propriety of granting summary adjudication of the 16 issues against Eleanor and then address the propriety of granting issues 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 against the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">2. <em>Propriety of Order Summarily Adjudicating Issues Against Eleanor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">It is clear from the record and applicable law that the order granting summary adjudication of issues is erroneous as to Eleanor. Eleanor was not a party to the March 16 Agreement, nor did she execute or guarantee any of the notes. Moreover, she did not own the subject property. Plaintiffs conceded in their answers to interrogatories that her sole connection with the subject of this action<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is her community property interest in the defendant corporations, which is insufficient, as a matter of law, to charge her with the 16 adjudicated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">3. <em>Issues 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 as to the Remaining Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">a. <em>Issues 7 and 9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">With respect to issue 7 the court found to be established the fact that \u201c[t]he Notes became fully payable by their own terms on or about December 26, 1981, two months after demand was made.\u201d As for issue 9, the court found to be established the fact that \u201c[n]o part of the principal sum of the Notes or the interest thereon has ever been paid by any defendant, either as principal debtor or as guarantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">We deem defendants\u2019 assignments of error with respect to the above issues to be meritless inasmuch as their claims are not supported by pertinent argument or authority. (See, e.g., <em>Strutt </em>v. <em>Ontario Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 866, 873-874 [105 Cal.Rptr. 395].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">b. <em>Issues 10 and 11</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">As for these issues the court found, respectively, that the first cause of action for breach of contract and the fourth cause of action based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>guaranties are \u201cnot barred by [the four-year and three-month limitation periods] set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 337.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The challenge of HGS to this finding is based in part on its claim that HGS was not added as a defendant until after the four-year limitation period had expired. Specifically, it contends that such limitation period \u201cexpired on May 26, 1985, at the latest\u201d while HGS was not added as a new defendant until January 23, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We find no statute of limitations bar under the four-year period of section 337 as to HGS. The fallacy of its position lies in its premise that HGS was added as a \u201cnew\u201d defendant in the second amended complaint filed in 1986. That premise is incorrect. HGS was substituted in as a Doe defendant, and thus, its presence in the action related back to the filing of the original complaint on February 1, 1985. (See, e.g., <em>Barrington </em>v. <em>A. H. Robins Co. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 146, 150 [216 Cal.Rptr. 405, 702 P.2d 563].) The propriety of the order adding HGS as a Doe is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The position of the other remaining defendants, joined in by HGS, concerns the three-month limitation period for bringing an action for a deficiency judgment under California law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See \u00a7\u00a7 337, par. 1, 580a, 726, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Defendants argue that the underlying action was untimely filed for the reason that the sale of the Studio Property to Darion occurred on February 10, 1984, and this action was not filed until February 1, 1985, more than three months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">We reject defendants\u2019 contentions. Based on our analysis, <em>post, </em>we point out that the subject property was sold at auction pursuant to a bankruptcy court order based on the Bankruptcy Code, not pursuant to California law governing nonjudicial and judicial foreclosure sales of real property. Accordingly, we find defendants\u2019 reliance on the three-month limitation periods of sections 337, paragraph 1, 580a and 726, subdivision (b), to be patently misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>c. <em>Issue 15</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">With respect to issue 15, the court found to be established the fact that \u201c[t]he \u2018fair value\u2019 provision of . . . section 580a provides no defense to plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Cause of Action [for breach of the guaranty] against Francis ... as guarantor.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">(1) <em>A Sale \u201cFree and Clear of </em>Liens\u201d <em>Under the Bankruptcy Code Is Not a Foreclosure Sale Under California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In challenging the finding on issue 15 defendants\u2019 threshold premise is that the sale of the Studio Property to Darion \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under authority of section 363, subsection (f) of title 11 of the United States Code (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(f)), is the equivalent of a foreclosure sale pursuant to the most senior lien under California law. In support they cite <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(4th Cir. 1921) 272 Fed. 117, 118; <em>Federal Land Bank of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Kurtz </em>(4th Cir. 1934) 70 F.2d 46, 47 and <em>In re Cook </em>(D.Mass. 1924) 7 F.2d 888, 889. Based on this premise they assert that the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions of sections 580a and 726,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which apply to foreclosure sales under California law, must therefore apply to the subject sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Defendants, however, \u201cconcede that there does not appear to be any state or federal authority on the question of whether . . . Sections 580a and 726 apply following a \u2018sale free and clear of liens\u2019 pursuant to [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(f)].\u201d Instead, they invite<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this court, for the first time, to construe a sale of real property, which is subject to a deed of trust or mortgage, \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d pursuant to 11 United States Code section 363(f) to be the equivalent of a nonjudicial or a judicial foreclosure sale, under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">After careful scrutiny of the applicable law, we find the contrary conclusion to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The sale of a debtor\u2019s real property \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code cannot be equated with either a nonjudicial or judicial foreclosure sale under California law. The material attributes and procedures of such a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d and a foreclosure sale under California law are substantially different. We therefore hold that a sale of real property, which is subject to a deed of trust or mortgage, \u201cfree and clear of lien\u201d under authority of 11 United States Code section 363(f) is not a foreclosure sale under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">a) <em>Foreclosure Sales Under California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">1) <em>Nature of Remedies Available</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\u201cIn the absence of a statute to the contrary, a creditor [whose note is] secured by a trust deed or mortgage on real property may recover the full amount of the debt upon default. He may realize the security or sue on the obligation or both; the obligation is an independent undertaking by the debtor to pay. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Roseleaf Corp. </em>v. <em>Chierighino </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 35, 38 [27 Cal.Rptr. 873, 378 P.2d 97]; accord, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 729, 733 [111 Cal.Rptr. 897, 518 P.2d 329].)  Alternatively, the creditor may seek a personal judgment against any guarantor for the full amount of the note since a guaranty is an obligation separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>and independent from that binding the principal debtor. <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1940) 41 Cal.App.2d 219, 221 [106 P.2d 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201cIn California, as in most states, a creditor\u2019s right to enforce a debt secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property is restricted by statute.\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 733.) The creditor has the choice of three remedies upon the debtor\u2019s default: he can sue for a personal judgment in the full amount of the debt; (2) he can conduct a private trustee\u2019s sale, i.e., foreclose the security through the power of sale under the deed of trust or mortgage (nonjudicial foreclosure); or (3) he can initiate an action for a judicial foreclosure sale. (See, e.g., <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Gradsky </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 40, 43 [71 Cal.Rptr. 64].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The creditor\u2019s election of remedies determines the nature and scope of his recovery. If the creditor chooses to foreclose, then \u201c[u]nder California law \u2018the creditor must rely upon his security before enforcing the debt. [Citations.] If the security is insufficient, his right to a judgment against the debtor for the deficiency may be limited or barred by sections 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 729, 733.) If the creditor does not first proceed against the security then he is deemed to have waived his right to do so. <em>(Cornelison </em>v. <em>Kornbluth, supra, </em>Cal.3d 590, 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">A \u201cdeficiency judgment\u201d is a personal judgment against the debtor for the difference between the debt and the proceeds received by the creditor from the sale of the security at a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 193, 198 [259 P.2d 425].)  \u201cSection 580d, enacted in 1939, prohibits any deficiency judgment when a creditor elects to foreclose on its real property security by nonjudicial sale. Deficiency judgments are not prohibited after judicial foreclosures, but the debtor retains a statutory right of redemption for one year. (\u00a7\u00a7 725a, 729.030.) The purpose of section 580d is \u2018to put judicial enforcement on a parity with private enforcement. ... If the creditor wishes a deficiency judgment, his sale is subject to statutory redemption rights. If he wishes a sale resulting in nonredeemable title, he must forego the right to a deficiency judgment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walter E. Heller Western, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bloxham (1985) 176 </em>Cal.App.3d 266, <em>271 [221 </em>Cal.Rptr. 425]; fn. omitted.) The Legislature could have given the debtor a right to redeem after a sale under the power of sale. \u201cThe right to redeem, like a proscription of a deficiency judgment, has the effect of making the security satisfy a realistic share of the debt. [Citation.] By choosing instead to bar a deficiency judgment after private sale, the Legislature achieved its purpose without denying the creditor his election of remedies.\u201d <em>(Roseleaf Corp. </em>v. <em>Chierighino, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 35, 43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>The deficiency judgment bar of section 580d,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on its face, applies only to debts evidenced by a \u201cnote\u201d secured by a deed of trust or mortgage. The \u201cfair value\u201d limitation on deficiency judgments in section 580a does not therefore apply where the debt is evidenced by a note. However, where the obligation is evidenced by something other than a promissory note, e.g., a lease, the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation does apply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Willys of Marin Company </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 826, 831 [296 P.2d 25]; cf. <em>Walter E.

As applied, the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions limit the creditor\u2019s right to a \u201cdeficiency judgment after exhaustion of the security to the difference between the fair value of the property at the time of the sale (irrespective of the amount actually realized at the sale) and the outstanding debt for which the property was security.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Cornelison </em>v. <em>Kornbluth, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 590, 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">2) <em>Foreclosure Procedures Under California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">A judicial foreclosure proceeding may be initiated at any time after a default on the secured obligation. <em>(Lincoln </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1934) 2 Cal.2d 127, 129 [39 P.2d 405].) It is commenced by filing a complaint in the superior court of the county in which the real property is situated. (\u00a7\u00a7 86, 392; Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 10; <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1918) 178 Cal. 574, 576-577 [174 P. 42].)  In its \u201cdecree for the foreclosure\u201d the court, inter alia, directs the sale of the encumbered property, determines the amount to be paid the creditor-plaintiff, determines the personal liability of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>defendant, e.g., debtor and guarantor, for payment of the debt, names the defendants against whom a deficiency judgment may be ordered, or declares that there shall be no deficiency judgment. (\u00a7\u00a7 725a, 726.) If the right to a deficiency judgment is not waived or barred, the property is sold subject to the right of redemption as provided in sections 729.010 to 729.090. (\u00a7 726, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The method of sale is through the execution of a writ of sale. (\u00a7\u00a7 716.010 et seq., 726, subd. (e), 729.010-729.090; Civ. Code, \u00a7 2931.) The sale is at auction to the highest bidder (\u00a7 701.570, subd. (b)) and terminates upon acceptance of the last and highest bid or when the sale proceeds are sufficient to satisfy the money judgment (i.e., the debt). (\u00a7 701.570, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">If the sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the amount of indebtedness, then the creditor may apply to the court within three months of the date of the sale for a deficiency judgment subject to the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation of section 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">A nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the power of sale in a deed of trust or mortgage, on the other hand, must be conducted in strict compliance with its provisions and applicable statutory law. A trustee\u2019s powers and rights are limited to those set forth in the deed of trust and laws applicable thereto. (See, e.g., <em>Fleisher </em>v. <em>Continental Auxiliary Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 136, 139 [30 Cal.Rptr. 137]; <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Redwood Empire Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 347, 366 [99 Cal.Rptr. 373].)  No court order authorizing or approving the sale is involved. A sale under the power of sale in a deed of trust or mortgage is a \u201cprivate sale.\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 736.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The statutory procedures governing the conduct of such sales are found in Civil Code sections 2924, 2924a-2924h, which set forth the time periods in which to comply with certain requirements, the persons authorized to conduct the sale, the requirements of notice of default and election to sell and for cure of default and reinstatement, inter alia.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The sale is concluded when the trustee accepts the last and highest bid.

(See <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Nourse </em>(8th Cir. 1934) 70 F.2d 482, 484; see also, <em>Federal Land Bank of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Kurtz, supra, 70 </em>F.2d 46, 47.)  Once the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court has been invoked, the creditor\u2019s options of a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale are barred by the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 (a)(4) [estate property] and (a)(5) [property of the debtor].) The creditor may request relief from the stay. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 (d)); however, the decision whether to lift the stay lies in the discretion of the bankruptcy court. (See, e.g., <em>In re Gellert </em>(Bkrtcy. 1985) 55 B.R. 970, 974-975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">If relief from the stay is granted unconditionally, then the creditor, at its election, may proceed with a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the property under the procedures of state law. If relief from the stay is not granted, disposition of the property must then be determined under bankruptcy law. One available means is a sale of the property \u201cfree and clear of liens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Under the former 1898 Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy court had inherent power, under its express power to administer bankruptcy estates, to order the sale of property \u201cfree and clear of liens,\u201d even over the objection of lienholder creditors. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Hooten Enterprise, Inc. </em>(Bkrtcy. 1982) 21 B.R. 499, 502; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Union Central Ins. Co. </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 502, 517 [82 L.Ed. 1490, 1501-1502, 58 S.Ct. 1025]; <em>Reconstruction Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(5th Cir. 1954) 214 F.2d 606, 607; <em>In re Gish </em>(D.C.Ky. 1928) 32 F.2d 322, 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">It was a well-established rule that a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d would ordinarily be ordered only if the sale of the property would bring in more than the aggregate of encumbrances and sale expenses. <em>(Hoehn </em>v. <em>McIntosh </em>(6th Cir. 1940) 110 F.2d 199, 201-202; <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(10th Cir. 1950) 179 F.2d 773, 777.) The fact that the sale did not actually bring in enough to satisfy lienholders, however, did not preclude the court from confirming the sale. <em>(In re Beardsley </em>(D.Md. 1941) 38 F.Supp. 799, 803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Also well established was the rule that where the property was sold \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d the creditors, after the sale, could not assert any further claim or lien against the property; instead, their respective rights were transferred to the proceeds of the sale. It then became the duty of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>to rank all claims and supervise the distribution and payment of the sale proceeds. <em>(Drybrough </em>v. <em>Ware </em>(6th Cir. 1940) 111 F.2d 548, 550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">From the foregoing it is clear that a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the former 1898 Bankruptcy Act was in the nature of a \u201cjudicial sale,\u201d i.e., conducted under authority and supervision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">After October 1, 1979, the effective date of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which repealed the 1898 bankruptcy act and adopted the Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the nature of a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d was changed. Under the Bankruptcy Code a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d became authorized by statute. (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(f).) It is not a judicial sale if it is conducted by the bankruptcy trustee without a court order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (See <em>Matter of Hooten Enterprise, Inc., supra, </em>21 B.R. 499, 501, at fn. 4; <em>In re Gabel </em>(Bkrtcy. 1985) 61 B.R. 661, 667.) However, it remains a judicial sale<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>if it is conducted pursuant to a court order. (See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 (a).) There is no right of redemption following the sale in either instance.

(11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 (a).) This includes the authority to sell property of the estate \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(f). <em>(Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson Bronze Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1985) 758 F.2d 137, 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">No actual or formal hearing is required, merely an opportunity for objections. A formal hearing is required only if objections exist. (758 F.2d at p. 140; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1); see also, 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 363.03, pp. 363-17 to 363-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">It is clear from the plain language of 11 United States Code 363 that the option of a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d belongs solely to the bankruptcy trustee or the debtor-in-possession, as the case may be.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In other words, if either does not choose to hold a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens,\u201d a creditor, who is not authorized to make such an election, cannot force such a sale. (See, e.g., <em>In re Calvary Temple Evangelistic Ass\u2019n </em>(Bkrtcy. 1984) 47 B.R. 520, 524-525; see also, <em>In re Sawilowsky </em>(S.D.Fla. 1922) 284 Fed. 975, 976.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">On the other hand, a creditor may object to a proposed sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d if the creditor and debtor-in-possession cannot agree to the terms and conditions of such a sale. \u201cA motion to sell under \u00a7 363 is a very different type of proceeding than an adversary proceeding .... A motion to sell, in general, involves a need by the debtor or [creditor] to be able to negotiate rather freely.\u201d <em>(In re Calvary Temple Evangelistic Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>47 B.R. at p. 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Where the creditor objects to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d such sale may nonetheless take place if so ordered by the bankruptcy court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>court has express authority to prohibit the sale or to so condition the sale \u201cas is necessary to provide adequate protection of [the creditor\u2019s] interest.\u201d (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(e); see also, <em>In re Burke Mountain Recreation, Inc. </em>(Bkrtcy. 1985) 56 B.R. 72, 72-73; see also, <em>In re George Ruggiere Chrysler-Plymouth </em>(11th Cir. 1984) 727 F.2d 1017, 1019.)  If ordered by court, the sale is a \u201cjudicial sale\u201d as opposed to an \u201cexecution sale.\u201d <em>(Matter of Hooten Enterprises, supra, </em>21 B.R. 499, 501; <em>In re A.H.\u2014R.S.

(See, e.g., <em>In re American Magnestone Co. </em>(S.D.Ill. 1929) 34 F.2d 681, 682; <em>In re Beardsley, supra, </em>38 F.Supp. 799, 803; <em>In re Bowen </em>(E.D.Pa. 1942) 46 F.Supp. 631, 637.) The rights of creditors, including lienholders, are transferred from the <em>res to </em>the sale proceeds. <em>(Gotkin </em>v. <em>Korn </em>(D.C. Cir. 1950) 182 F.2d 380, 382 [86 App.D.C. 372].)  A sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is thus favored if the debtor has equity in the real property and the sale is in the debtor\u2019s best interest. <em>(Matter of Investors Funding Corp. of New York </em>(2d Cir. 1979) 592 F.2d 134, 135.) It is thus in the debtor\u2019s best interest to obtain the highest price possible at the sale, i.e., a price as close as possible to fair market value of the property. <em>(See Allebach </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(4th Cir. 1927) 16 F.2d 853, 854-855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">If it is a private sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d the trustee or debtor-in-possession sets the minimum bid and the amount of the incremental bids thereafter.  If it is a judicial sale \u201cfree and clear of liens,\u201d then it is the court which determines those matters.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">\u201cConfirmation\u201d is a device for the protection of the debtor\u2019s estate. (See, e.g., <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1st Cir. 1951) 189 F.2d 76, 78.) In a judicial sale an accepted bid at the sale has no legal significance until the sale is confirmed by the bankruptcy court. (See, e.g., <em>In re Klein\u2019s Rapid Shoe Repair Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1931) 54 F.2d 495, 496; <em>In re Susquehanna Chemical Corporation </em>(W.D.Pa. 1950) 92 F.Supp. 917, 919-920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The bankruptcy court has discretion to refuse to confirm a sale to the highest bidder where the sale price is grossly inadequate. <em>(In re Muscongus Bay Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1979) 597 F.2d 11, 12; see also, <em>In re Gabel, supra, </em>61 B.R. 661, 667.)  \u201c \u2018[G]ross inadequacy is said to exist when\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>apart from situations involving fraud or unfairness, . . . there is a substantial disparity between the highest bid and the appraised or fair market value, and \u201cthere is a reasonable degree of probability that a substantially better price will be obtained by a resale . . .

By virtue of its familiarity with the property and circumstances surrounding the sale the bankruptcy court is in the best position to evaluate the evidence concerning the fair market value of the property and its reasonableness. <em>(In re Muscongus Bay Co., supra, </em>597 F.2d at p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">c) <em>Foreclosure Sales under California Law Vis-\u00e1-Vis Sales \u201cFree and Clear of </em>Liens\u201d <em>Under the Bankruptcy Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">From our review of the substance and procedures applicable to the three types of sales, <em>ante, </em>it is clear that they are dissimilar in material respects. For example, a nonjudicial foreclosure sale is a private sale held pursuant to a power of sale in the deed of trust or mortgage. Although a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is a private sale when conducted by a trustee or debtor-in-possession without a court order, it is a sale under the authority of 11 United States Code section 363(f), and not under a power of sale in a deed of trust or mortgage.  A judicial foreclosure sale is not a \u201cjudicial sale,\u201d albeit a court issues a \u201cdecree for foreclosure\u201d of the property. Instead, it is an \u201cexecution sale\u201d since the property is sold by execution of a writ of sale. In contrast, when a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is ordered by the bankruptcy court, such sale is a \u201cjudicial sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The creditor has an election of remedies in the case of a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale. The creditor, however, cannot elect a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code. Only the trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession has that right. The motivating factor in a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale is to ensure that the sale produces enough proceeds to satisfy the creditor seeking the sale. On the other hand, the motivating factor in a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is to realize as much money as possible for the benefit of all creditors and the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">(2) <em>As a Matter of Statutory Law, the \u201cFair </em>Value\u201d <em>Limitation Provisions Do Not Apply to a Sale \u201cFree and Clear of </em>Liens\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">We further hold that the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions of sections 580a and 726 do not apply to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code since such a sale is neither a judicial nor a nonjudicial foreclosure sale under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>The \u201cfair value\u201d limitations, by statute, apply only to a judicial foreclosure sale (\u00a7 726) or a nonjudicial foreclosure sale (\u00a7 580a) under California law.

As authority, they rely primarily on <em>Butner </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>440 U.S. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In <em>Butner </em>the court announced: \u201cProperty interests are created and defined by state law. Unless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Uniform treatment of property interests by both State and federal courts within a state serves to reduce uncertainty, to discourage forum shopping, and to prevent a party from receiving \u2018a windfall merely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy.\u2019 [Citation.] The justifications for application of state law are not limited to ownership interests; they apply with equal force to security interests . . . .\u201d (440 U.S. at p. 55 [59 L.Ed.2d at pp. 141-142].)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">We have no quarrel with defendants\u2019 citation of authority. The fallacy of defendants\u2019 premise is their claim that their right under California law to be protected against a double recovery by the creditor suffers from unequal protection if a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code is not subject to the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation provisions of sections 580a or 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The protection of defendants\u2019 rights under the Bankruptcy Code is equivalent to that under California law. The issue is simply one of an election of remedies, i.e., a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d by the trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession, on the one hand, or a foreclosure sale, judicial or nonjudicial, by the creditor, on the other. The incentive to obtain a sale price which is approximately the fair market value of the property exists under a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d as well as under a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, or a judicial foreclosure sale, albeit the incentives differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">The \u201c[f]air value provisions are designed to prevent creditors from buying in at their own sales at deflated prices and realizing double recoveries by holding debtors for large deficiencies. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Roseleaf Corp. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>Chierighino, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 35, 40.) The \u201cfair value\u201d provisions of both sections 580a and 726 operate as an incentive for the creditor to ensure the accepted bid approximates the fair market value of the property, because he would be barred from recovering any amount in excess of the difference between the amount of the indebtedness and the fair market value of the property. In other words, the creditor would be unable to collect the unpaid balance of the indebtedness to the extent that the fair market value exceeded the sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d on the other hand, the incentive to obtain the highest possible price is to protect the equity of the debtor and to obtain as much money as possible to pay all creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The purpose of the \u201cfair value\u201d limitations of sections 580a and 726, moreover, would not be furthered by applying such a limitation to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code. The election of such a sale is at the option of the trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession, not the creditor. The minimum amount of the bid and incremental bids thereafter are matters determined either by the trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession or the bankruptcy court, not the creditor. Moreover, the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to refuse to confirm the sale or set aside the sale if the accepted bid is too much less than the fair market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Whether the protection of the Bankruptcy Code or state law is to be invoked rests with the debtor-in-possession or trustee in bankruptcy not the creditor. If the debtor-in-possession elects a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens,\u201d then the burden rests with him to ensure that the accepted bid approximates the fair market value of the property. On the other hand, if he allows the creditor to proceed with a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale, then the burden rests with the creditor to ensure that the accepted bid approximates the fair market value of the property. In either case, the debtor is protected against a double recovery by the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Based on the foregoing we hold that equity does not compel the application of the \u201cfair value\u201d limitations (\u00a7\u00a7 580a, 726) to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">No different conclusion is mandated where a junior lienholder buys the property at a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens.\u201d In a nonjudicial foreclosure situation a junior lienholder who buys at a senior\u2019s sale is subject to the \u201cfair value\u201d limitation of section 580a on equity grounds: \u201c[I]t is equitable to apply the fair value limitations to him. Any loss to him as creditor by his own underbidding is gained by him as purchaser for a bargain price. [Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>tion.] \u2018To so limit the deficiency judgment right is consistent with the general purpose of section 580a, <em>viz., </em>to protect against a lienor buying in the property at a deflated price, obtaining a deficiency judgment, and achieving a recovery in excess of the debt by reselling the property at a profit. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walter E. Heller Western, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bloxham, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 266, 273-274; see also, <em>Bank of Hemet </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 643 F.2d 661, 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Equity does not compel the application of the \u201cfair value\u201d limitations to a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d where the property is bought by a junior lienholder. Again, in such a sale the minimum bid is set by either the debtor-in-possession, bankruptcy trustee, or bankruptcy court, not by a creditor. It is in the best interests of the debtor\u2019s estate for the minimum bid to approximate the fair market value of the property. If the accepted bid did not approximate the fair market value, the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction not to confirm the sale or to vacate the sale. The junior lienholder therefore would not be gaining the property \u201cfor a bargain price\u201d due to \u201chis own underbidding,\u201d unlike the situation in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Equity also does not dictate that the \u201cfair value\u201d limitations should apply where the creditor sues the guarantor of the obligation following a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens.\u201d A sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d is unlike the situation facing the court in <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Gradsky, supra, 265 </em>Cal.App.2d 40, wherein the court held that equity demanded the application of the bar of section 580d in an action by the creditor against the guarantor for a deficiency judgment. The <em>Union Bank </em>court reasoned that it was fair to limit the creditor\u2019s recovery against the guarantor in this manner, because the creditor\u2019s election of a trustee\u2019s sale against the debtor destroyed the guarantor\u2019s rights against the debtor, i.e., no right of redemption would be available following a trustee\u2019s sale. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 44.) In the case of a sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d it was the debtor-in-possession or bankruptcy trustee, not the creditor, who made the choice of such a sale. (Cf. <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 204, 211 [193 Cal.Rptr. 322].)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">(4) <em>Posture of Present Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">In the present case the sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d was held at the instance of HGS, the debtor-in-possession. The bankruptcy court by order filed December 22, 1983,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> approved the election by HGS to sell the Studio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Property free and clear of liens, set the minimum bid at $12.2 million, and required each subsequent bid to be at least $100,000 above the prior bid. The subject real property and specified personal property was required to be sold as a unit rather than separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Darion purchased the Studio Property \u201cfree and clear of liens and encumbrances\u201d at the auction sale for $12.3 million. Darion. was authorized, both by the December 22, 1983, order and under 11 United States Code section 363(k) to \u201ccredit bid\u201d the amount of its security interest in the Studio Property. At oral argument Darion represented that it did not do so. Instead, it paid cash. That representation was not contested by defendants. Accordingly, Darion acquired the Studio Property in the posture of a stranger who had no security interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">After such a sale the secured creditors cannot assert any claim of lien against the real property. Instead, their respective rights thereto are transferred to the proceeds of the sale. It is then incumbent on the bankruptcy court to determine the rank of all claims with respect to the proceeds and to supervise the distribution and payment accordingly. <em>(Drybrough </em>v. <em>Ware, supra, </em>111 F.2d 548, 550.) Darion made the further representation at oral argument that it received nothing from the sale proceeds. That representation was also not contested by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We therefore conclude that defendants\u2019 complaint as to the unfairness, if any, of the purchase price of the real property at the sale \u201cfree and clear of liens\u201d must be addressed in the bankruptcy proceeding before the bankruptcy court and not in this state court. HGS has, in fact, filed an action on February 10, 1989, in the United States District Court, for a declaration that the Bankruptcy Court order dated February 10, 1984, is a nullity and that HGS owns the Studio Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">This disposition renders it unnecessary to address defendants\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">II. <em>The Second and Supplemental Petitions (B039704)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">In B038583 let a peremptory writ of mandate issue, commanding respondent court to vacate its order of November 21, 1988, as to Eleanor.
