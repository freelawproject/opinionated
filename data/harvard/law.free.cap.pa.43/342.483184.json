The said J. W.

A writ of <em>levare facias </em>was issued out of the said court, No. 5 of May Term 1860, upon the said judgment, by virtue of which writ the sheriff of Snyder county levied upon, and on the 21st day of May 1860 sold the said demised premises to George Schnure and John Hummel, and afterwards, on the 27th day of September 1860, by his deed acknowledged on this last-mentioned day before the said Court of Common Pleas of Snyder county, granted and conveyed the said demised premises unto the said George Schnure and John Hummel and their heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">George Garrett raised on the said demised premises six hundred and seventy-three bushels and fifty pounds of red wheat, and one hundred and ninety-nine bushels and fifty-four pounds of white wheat, which was sown in the month of September 1859, and harvested and put in the mow in the barn on the said premises in the month of July 1860, and was thrashed during the months of October and November of the same year; also seven hundred and sixty bushels of oats, which was sown in the month of April 1860, and harvested and put in the mow in the barn on the said premises in the month of July of the same year, and thrashed during the months of October and November of the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">On th\u00e9 1st day of August 1860, William L.

Dewart the landlord\u2019s share of the said wheat or oats, or any part thereof. The said red wheat is of the value of $1.10 per bushel, the said white wheat is of the value of $1.18 per bushel, and the said oats is of the value of twenty-five cents per bushel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-11\">The parties also agree to the following facts, to be considered by the court in the decision of this cause, to wit: \u2014 The conditions of the above-mentioned sheriff\u2019s sale, made the 21st day of May 1860, as aforesaid, were that \u201c 30 per cent, of the purchase-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>money should be paid when the property was struck down, and the balance at the September court (then) next, when a deed would be acknowledged and delivered by the sheriff to the purchaser.\u201d And the said demised premises were purchased at the said sheriff\u2019s sale by the said George Schnure and John Hummel, on the above-mentioned conditions. On the 26th of May 1860 the sheriff paid into court $14,340, the amount of the purchase-money after deducting the expenses of sale, &amp;c.; and on the same day the said court, on the application of the counsel for the execution-creditor, J. W. Bassler, appointed an auditor to distribute the fund in court to and among the lien-creditors of the said William L. Dewart. On the 25th September 1860 the said auditor made report to the said court of the distribution of the said fund to and among the said creditors, which report on the same day was read and confirmed <em>nisi </em>by the said court, and was confirmed absolutely by the court on the 25th October 1860. On the 26th June 1860, William L. Dewart filed in said court exceptions to the said sheriff\u2019s sale, and the court granted a rule on the parties interested to show cause why the said sale should not be set aside. After argument, the court, on the 27th September 1860, overruled the said exceptions, discharged the said rule to show cause, and ordered the said deed to be acknowledged, and the said sheriff\u2019s deed was acknowledged and delivered the same day as above stated. The said defendant, George Garrett, continued in possession of the said demised premises under the above-mentioned demise and lease until the 1st of April 1861, when he accepted a new lease from the said George Schnure and John Hummel. It is also agreed between the said parties, that the said George Schnure and John Hummel, shortly after the day of the said sheriff\u2019s sale, and before any of the said grain was cut, notified the said George Garrett that they claimed the landlord\u2019s share of the said grain by virtue of their purchase of the said demised premises at the said sheriff\u2019s sale, and required him the said George Garrett not to pay or deliver the said rent to the plaintiff, but to pay and deliver it to them, and that they still claim the same of the said George Garrett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">If the court shall be of opinion that said plaintiff was entitled to receive of and from the said defendant the one-half part of the said wheat and oats, then judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $677.30, with interest from the 13th November 1860, and costs of suit. But if the court shall be of opinion that the said plaintiff was entitled to receive of and from the said defendant the one-half part of the said wheat, but no part of the said oats, then judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $487.30, with interest on the same from the 13th of November 1860, with costs of suit.

Oomly, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbY\">As the mortgage of William L. Dewart to Bassler was executed and recorded prior to the extension of the lease by Dewart and Garrett on the 1st of April 1859, the purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale of the mortgage premises sold upon the judgment recovered upon the mortgage, and the acknowledgment and delivery of <em>the </em>sheriff\u2019s deed <em>to </em>them, had the option to affirm or disaffirm the lease as they pleased. If they had disaffirmed the lease, they would have had not a reversion, but a right to the land in possession, and would have been without pretence of claim to any part of the grain in dispute: Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, 9 Watts 436; Hemphill <em>v. </em>Tevis, 4 W. &amp; S. 541. Had they evicted Garrett, he might have defended against the claim for rent for the then current year on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of tbe eviction, but would not thereby have been relieved from his obligation to pay the rent for the previous year, which expired on the 1st of April 1860. He would still have been liable to deliver to the plaintiff the landlord\u2019s share of the wheat, the value of which is claimed in this action. They did not disaffirm the lease, but on the contrary affirmed it. After the delivery of the sheriff\u2019s deed to them and their affirmance .of the lease, Schnure and Hummel became seised of the reversion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">\u201c The wheat was sown in September 1859, and belonged to the tenancy of the year, which ended on the 1st of April 1860, before the sheriff\u2019s sale, and therefore the purchasers are not entitled to any share of the grain as rent. It was a sale after the expiration of the term out of which the rent accrued, and the rent did not go with the reversion: Borrell <em>v. </em>Dewart, 1 Wright 134-138.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">The oats were sown in April 1860, and belonged to the tenancy of the year, which ended on the 1st of April 1861. Garrett had possession of the demised premises during this year under the lease, and was bound to deliv\u00e9r the landlord\u2019s share of the oats to either Dewart, his lessor, or to Schnure and Hummel, as owners of the reversion. The sheriff\u2019s deed for the premises to Schnure and Hummel was acknowledged on the 27th of September 1860, and before that day they were not entitled to either the possession or the rents or profits: Hawk <em>v. </em>Sterich, 5 S. &amp; R. 157-161; Morrison <em>v. </em>Wurtz, 7 Watts 438; Storch <em>v. </em>Carr, 4 Casey 135; Act of 16th June 1836, \u00a7 <em>119; </em>Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, 9 Watts 436; Fullerton <em>v. </em>Shauffer, 2 Jones 220. In the cases of Bank <em>v. </em>Wise, 3 Watts 394, and Braddee <em>v. </em>Wiley, 10 Id. 362, the rent is expressly stated to have become due after the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed in each case. By the terms of the lease and notice, the landlord\u2019s share of the oats became deliverable on the 1st of September 1860; it was rent payable on that day, and never was rent \u201c accruing at or after the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Afl7\">November 17th 1862,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b347-9\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">We are of opinion that the rent which is in controversy in this case had accrued before the acknowledgment and delivery of the deed to the purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale. By the terms of the lease, the grain in which the rent was payable was to be delivered to the landlord in the mow or corncrib. Then, that is, after its delivery, the tenant was under obligation to thrash it, and deliver it at some storehouse; and he covenanted to thrash and deliver all the grain except corn, whenever, in each year, he might be directed by the landlord to do it. The dispute in this case relates to the wheat and oats. The wheat was sown on the demised premises in September 1859, and the oats were sown in April 1860. Both crops were harvested and put in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>mow in July 1860. On the 1st of August, in that year, the landlord gave notice to the tenant to thrash and deliver the crops by the 1st of September then next following, but they were not thrashed until October and November. Now, if it be conceded that the time of delivery in the mow was not the time fixed for the payment of the rent, it is not to be questioned that the rent was payable when the landlord directed the grain to be thrashed and delivered. It matters not what the custom of the country is in regard to the time of thrashing. The parties did not leave the time to be determined by custom. They defined it by their contract. Nor has it anything to do with the case, that the grain may not in fact have been so delivered as to vest the ownership in the landlord, so as to enable him to maintain replevin. The inquiry in hand does not relate to the ownership of the grain. It is, when was it deliverable or payable according to the contract ? for when the rent became due and payable, then it had accrued. In every aspect of the case, therefore, the rent must be considered as having accrued by the 1st of September 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The sheriff\u2019s deed of the landlord\u2019s interest in the farm was acknowledged and delivered on the 27th of September 1860, after the rent had accrued or become due and payable. The purchasers at the sheriff\u2019s sale are not then entitled to the grain, unless their position is improved by the other facts found in the case stated, to which we will now refer. The sheriff\u2019s sale was made on the 21st of May 1860, and the conditions of the sale were that \u201c thirty per cent, of the purchase-money should be paid when the property was struck down, and the balance at the September court then next, when a deed would be acknowledged and delivered to the purchaser.\u201d Upon these conditions the property was struck down. The purchasers appear to have paid the whole amount of their bid at once, and to have notified the tenant that they claimed the landlord\u2019s share of the grain. Exceptions to the confirmation of the sale were filed by the landlord, but they were overruled, and the deed was acknowledged and delivered at the time appointed in the conditions of sale. The tenant continued in possession of the demised premises under the lease until the 1st of April 1861, when a new lease was made to him by the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It hardly needs be said that the payment of all'the purchase-money before it wra.s made payable by the conditions of sale gave the purchasers no greater interest in the land than they would have had without an anticipated payment. By the contract, they were not entitled to a deed until the September court, and it may fairly be presumed that they bid less because the delivery of the deed was to be so long delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The argument of the plaintiff in error is, that when the property was struck off to the purchasers (May 21st 1860), they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>acquired an inceptive interest in the farm ; that when the deed was subsequently made to them, their title related back to its inception; and that they became the owners of the reversion from that time. It is true that it has been held that a bidder at a sheriff\u2019s sale, to whom the property has been struck down, has an inceptive interest in it which may be bound by the lien of a judgment, even before the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed. Yet it by no means follows from this, that after he has obtained his deed his title relates to the date of his bid in any such sense as to divest from that time the ownership of the debtor whose land has been sold. Undoubtedly it does not. Until the sale has been consummated by the acknowledgment and delivery of the deed, the debtor is entitled to the possession with all its attendant advantages. Until then, the purchaser cannot move a step towards dispossessing the debtor or his tenant; and though he may have a possible or inceptive interest, like a purchaser by articles who has paid no money, he has acquired no title to the present enjoyment. His' rights, as against a tenant of the execution defendant, are clearly defined in the 119th section of the Act of June 16 th 1836, entitled \u201cAn Act relating to Executions.\u201d It is there declared that he shall be deemed, upon receiving a deed for the land, \u201c the landlord of such tenant, lessee, or other person, and shall have the like remedies to recover any rents or sums <em>accruing subsequently to the acknowledgment of a deed to him,\u201d </em>as the defendant might have had if no such sale had been made. Decided cases also recognise the right of a purchaser to no other rents than such as accrue after the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed and its delivery: Scribner <em>v. </em>Stanley, 2 Rawle 278; Boyd <em>v. </em>McCombs, 4 Barr 146. In cases where the mortgage or judgment under which the property has been sold is paramount to the lease, he has the option to affirm or disaffirm the lease. If he disaffirms it, he can claim no rent: Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, 9 Watts 436. If he affirms it, he becomes landlord only from the time when he receives his deed. In this case the tenancy was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The fact that the mortgage under which the sale was decreed and made wras anterior to the renewed lease to the tenant, does not strengthen the claim of the purchasers to the rents which had accrued when the sale was made. The profits of land belong to the person who is in rightful possession by himself or his tenants. The mortgage did not disturb the mortgagor\u2019s right to the possession. That was done only by the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">It follows that there was no error in giving judgment for the plaintiff on the case stated. There appears, however, to have been an error in the amount, which we correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Judgment affirmed for $624. 18, with interest from November 4th 1861.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
