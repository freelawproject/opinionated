The contract of sale being valid, it was not necessary for the court to instruct the jury that the silence of the principal for four years was a ratification of the sale by his agent: but as this mistake could have had no influence on the verdict, it was unimportant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-12\">3. The instruction of the court below that regular conveyances of land reciting the full payment of the purchase-money, and not accompanied by any suspicious circumstances, are no evidence that the vendee has actually paid the purchase-money, so as to enable him to stand <em>primd facie </em>as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser as against a previous unrecorded contract of sale, doubted:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-13\">4.

But where the vendor in the articles of agreement had subsequently sold and conveyed the land by deed to another whose vendees had entered upon the land and out timber, the vendee under articles was not bound to tender the purchase-money before bringing ejectment for the land: and if entitled to specific performance, he is entitled to an account of the timber taken from the land and a deduction of its value from the price to be paid, the amount of the purchase-money to be fixed by a conditional verdict.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-17\">Error to tho Common Pleas of <em>Clearfield county.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-18\">This was an action of ejectment, brought in the court below, to January Term 1859, by John Dubois against Andrew Baum, A. Deitz, J. Y. Thompson, William Dixon, Iliram Fry, Alonzo Dixon, John E. Hoffman, Ethan McCullough, and John Voinchet, for five hundred and twenty acres of land in Brady township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-19\">Both parties claimed under Thomas L. Batdorff, in whom it was conceded the title to the land in controversy formerly vested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-20\">The plaintiff claimed under a purchase from Jamos T. Leonard, who, as agent for Batdorff, sold the tract to Dubois by articles of agreement under seal, bearing date the 25th June 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-21\">The defendant claimed under an agreement, dated the 7th of November 1853, by which Batdorff covenanted to convey the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tract in dispute to Bassler and Boyer. In pursuance of this agreement Batdorff and wife executed a deed to Basslor for the premises, which bore date the 25th March 1854, and was entered in the office for recording of deeds in Clearfield county, on the 10th November 1858. On the 10th November 1858, Bassler, by agreement in writing, sold the tract to John Y. Thompson. This agreement was recorded on the 13th October 1859. Thompson afterwards assigned to Baum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The defendants alleged that they were <em>bond fide </em>purchasers for value, without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s title, and that having put their title upon record, they were entitled to hold as against Dubois, who had, as they alleged, failed to give such notice as the law requires to protect him against subsequent purchasers from the same vendor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">On the trial in the court below, the plaintiff offered to prove by James T. Leonard that he was the agent of Thomas L. Batdorff, duly constituted by writing to sell this land, and to have a general supervision of it; that he sold it to the plaintiff by articles of agreement, and notified Batdorff thereof, to be followed by the written contract of John Dubois, the plaintiff, and proof of actual possession taken and maintained thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\">To this the defendant objected that the agent for the sale of real estate is not competent to prove his own authority. But the objection was overruled, and the offer admitted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">The plaintiffs then offered a letter of Thomas L. Batdorff to James T. Leonard, dated February 16th 1846, which was objected to because the contents are irrelevant to the issue. This objection was also overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-10\">The letter was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-11\">\u201c Myerstown, February 16th 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-12\">\u201c James T.

Leonard, of Clearfield county, as agent of Thomas L. Batdorff, and John Dubois.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">Objected to, because it is a contract under seal, and the agent exceeded his authority.

Batdorff, of the one part, and John Dubois, Jr., of Lycoming county, and state aforesaid, of the other part, as follows: The said James T. Leonard, as agent, agrees to sell and convey unto the said John Dubois, Jr., all that certain tract or parcel of land situate in Brady township, Clearfield county, and known as No. 13, containing five hundred and twenty-one acres, more or less, in the name of Christian Lower; for which the said John Dubois, Jr., agrees to pay to the said Thomas L. Batdorff the sum of $626, at any time a deed is executed for the same, the money to be paid to James T. Leonard, or deposited to his credit in the Commercial Bank in Philadelphia. As witness our hands and seals the day and year aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">James T.

A. Wallace, his counsel, what he, as attorney of Dubois, had communicated to Thompson concerning this land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\">To which defendants\u2019 counsel objected that at the time the witness was acting as the attorney of Basslcr &amp; Thompson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-13\">The court admitted the offer, restricting it however to what witness said, and not permitting him to state anything communicated to him by Bassler &amp; Thompson, or any knowledge obtained from them at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-14\">After the plaintiff had closed, the defendants offered, <em>inter alia, </em>to prove that the land was worth from $3 to $4 per acre when Judge Leonard sold to John Dubois, and that such was the current price for land in that neighbourhood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that it is not relevant to this stage of the cause, which objection was sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-16\">The plaintiff requested the court, among other things, to instruct the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-17\">3. The contract of 25th June 1849. made by James T. Leonard as the agent of Thomas L. Batdorff with John Dubois, for the sale and conveyance of tract No. 13, is a valid and binding one, and the silence of Thomas\u2019 L. Batdorff for the period of four years after that sale with the possession delivered thereunder to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the vendee, constitute John Dubois the vendee of Thomas L. Batdorff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">4. If the jury believe that the plaintiff took the possession of the land under the contract, and has paid the taxes thereon, and has always maintained that possession until the ouster by Baum and others before the bringing of this action, then the plaintiff is entitled to have the possession without payment or tender of the purchase-money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">7. By the terms of the contract the execution of a deed was a condition precedent to the payment of the money, and if the jury believe that Dubois, the vendee, demanded his deed, and. was always ready to pay upon its being tendered, and 'that no such tender was ever made, he is entitled as against these defendants to recover the possession of the land without payment of the purchase-money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">The defendants also requested the court to charge\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">1. That James T. Leonard, as the agent of Thomas L. Batdorff, had no power (his authority not being under seal), to execute the agreement with John Dubois, in evidence in this case, and that said agreement is therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-10\">The court below (Linn, P. J.) affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s third and fourth points in terms, and affirmed the seventh, adding \u201cif the jury relieve the plaintiff was ousted of the possession acquired under the agreement.\u201d The instruction prayed for in defendants\u2019 first point was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-11\">The court further instructed the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-12\">\u201c If you believe that, Leonard had written authority to sell, and did sell to the plaintiff on the terms set forth in the written agreement in evidence, that Batdorff was informed of the sale by Leonard, and made no objection thereto, his acquiescence up to the time of the sale to Bassler would amount to a ratification of Leonard\u2019s act, and he cannot after so long acquiescence refuse to recognise it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-13\">\u201c If, in addition to this, you believe that Dubois took possession in pursuance of his purchase by leasing the land to a tenant, and has always been ready to comply with the terms of his agreement, he is entitled to recover the land against Batdorff and his heirs, and all claiming under him or them by subsequent purchase, except such as show that they are <em>bond fide </em>purchasers for value, without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-14\">Under these instructions there was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Whereupon the defendants sued out this writ, and assigned for error the admission of James T. Leonard as a witness to prove his authority to sell real estate; the affirmative answer given to plaintiff\u2019s third, fourth, and seventh points; the refusal of the court below to affirm the defendants\u2019 first point; and the instruction given to the jury as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Swope $ MelSnally, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASD\">denied both the facts and the law asserted in plaintiff\u2019s third point, and insisted, first, that the contract was not valid and binding on Batdorff; and, secondly, that no possession had been delivered either by its terms or by the acts or with, the knowledge of Batdorff; and that if any such thing could be inferred from the evidence, it was for the jury and not for the court to make the inference. They denied further that any of the facts therein referred to \u25a0were brought to the knowledge of Batdorff before the-sale to the other party was consummated, or that the court had any right to assume acquiescence from his silence, while the facts respecting his silence were uncertain;, and further, they denied that either of those facts, or all of them together, authorized the court to affirm that John Dubois was the vendee of Batdorff. The agreement under seal bound Leonard and Dubois, but not Batdorff: citing Story on Contracts, \u00a7 141; Kent\u2019s Com., vol. 2, \u00a7 631; Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 147, 161; Bellas <em>v. </em>Hays, 5 S. &amp; R. 427; Hopkins <em>v. </em>Mehaffy, 11 Id. 128; Devinny <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 1 W. &amp; S. 332. As to the alleged subsequent ratification, they cited Hays <em>v. </em>Bellas, 5 S. &amp; R. 427; 2 Greenl.

Wallace, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_G\">The important facts of the case were fully and fairly left to the jury. Of the authority of Leonard to sell this land, there can be no doubt, nor any as to his power to bind his principal by writing <em>not </em>under seal. Can it be that the addition of a seal vitiates the contract ? The true test is, in whose name (as gathered from the writing) was the contract made ? Story on Contracts 141; Hefferman <em>v. </em>Adams, 7 Watts 116; 1 Am. Leading Cases, 4th ed., 605; Derning <em>v. </em>Bullitt, 1 Blackford 241, 242; 6 B. Monroe 612, 620; 10 New Hampshire Rep. 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">In. the case of Bellas <em>v. </em>Hoyt, 5 S. &amp; R. 427, the principal was not named by the contracting agent. Hopkins <em>v. </em>Mehaffy, 11 S. &amp; R. 128, was that of the agent of a corporation undertaking to bind the corporation by his own name and seal. Devinny <em>v. </em>Reynolds is not at all in point. The ink seal does not vitiate the contract if otherwise valid: Deckard <em>v. </em>Case, 5 Watts 22; Hennessy <em>v. </em>The Western Bank, 6 W. &amp; S. 301; 1 Am. Lead.

Y.) 160; Crozier <em>v. </em>Carr, 11 Texas 376; Giddens <em>v. </em>Byers, 12 Id. 75; Story on the Constitution, \u00a7 138.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">As to the question of subsequent ratification, he argued that the facts amounted to a ratification in law: citing 2 Greenl. Ev. 67; 1 Am. Lead. Cases 594. Being in possession under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>original owner, and being illegally ousted, the defendant in error was entitled to recover possession without tender of the purchase-money: D\u2019Arras <em>v. </em>Keyser, 2 Casey 249; see also 2 S. &amp; R. 354; 9 W. &amp; S. 208; 10 S. &amp; R. 37: especially where, as in this case, the plaintiff in error has failed to show that he is a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser: Lynch <em>v. </em>Lloyd, 4 Casey 419.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0T\">October 10th 1862,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b265-7\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">We might find some difficulty in managing an action of <em>covenant </em>on this agreement, but we can -have none in regarding it as a valid contract for the sale of land, since it is \u201cin writing,\u201d and signed by the parties, or their agents thereto lawfully authorized by writing. That the agent\u2019s warrant is not sealed, and the contract made by him <em>is, </em>avoids only his sealing and not his contract in writing, and is of no importance in this form of action. We find no essential defect in the evidence that the agent was authorized by writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">There being, therefore,'sufficient proof of a sale in writing, it must have been by reason of some oversight or confusion of thought that the counsel and the court thought it necessary to say that the silence of a principal for four years amounted to a ratification of the sale by his agent. The sale, as proved by the same witnesses who give this evidence of ratification, was valid of itself, and needed no ratification. If it did it was because of a defect of authority, and that defect could be supplied only by a written ratification, or by evidence of acts of such a character as to lead the purchasers to make such expenditures on the faith of the contract as would constitute a ground of equitable estoppel. But we do not discover that this mistake could have had any influence on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We should not like to affirm, with the court below, that regular conveyances of land reciting the full payment of the purchase-money, and not accompanied by any suspicious appearances, are no evidence that the vendee has actually paid the purchase-money, so as to entitle him to stand <em>primd facie </em>as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, as against a previous unrecorded contract of sale. We have noticed this question several times lately. But wdiere, as here, the previous purchaser had a tenant in possession under a lease from him, and the subsequent title is-by conveyance to one who had notice of the previous one, and then by executory agreement to another who also had notice, and then by assignment to a third who seems to be without notice, we cannot regard the title as being so regular and unsuspicious as not to need support by other evidence of the payment of the purchase-money. Supposing, therefore, that the court below was wrrong in laying down so broad a rule, no harm was done, for its only effect was to require further evidence, and that was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>But we do not think that Dubois had any right to the possession under his contract, and there is no evidence that Batdorff ever delivered it to him or authorized its delivery. The article says nothing about delivery. It contracts for a present sale, with a present delivery of the deed and payment of the price. That by no means involves a right in the vendee to enter before payment or deed delivered. Where payment is to be made by instalments at distant times a different inference may be proper. But it would be especially improper in relation to timber lands, the chief value of which may be abstracted before payment is made, if delivery were assumed to follow from the mere contract to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Nor did Dubois put Batdorff in any default by demanding performance of the contract. He talked to the agent about the deed, and professed to be ready to pay; but he knew that the agent had no authority to make the deed, and that, therefore, the principal was the only proper person to apply to for that. He can make nothing out-of the stipulation that the money should be paid to the agent, for that stipulation could be of no validity as against the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The duty of Dubois, under these articles, was to show, within a reasonable time, that he wanted to have them performed, and this he ought to have done by tendering the purchase-money and demanding the deed (for these were to be simultaneous acts), and then he would have been in a condition to sue for specific performance. But, if he had not lost his right to this by his <em>laches, </em>we do not see that he was bound under the circumstances that now appear to tender the price before he brought this suit; because the vendor\u2019s successor to the legal title had, before this suit was brought, entered into the possession and taken off timber, and for this the plaintiff would be entitled to an account, and a deduction from the price of land. The defendant has, therefore, by his own act, rendered the amount to be tendered uncertain, and is not entitled to demand a previous tender. If the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance now, the amount of purchase-money due by him must be fixed by a conditional verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
