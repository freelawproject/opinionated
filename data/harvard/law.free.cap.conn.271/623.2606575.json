Franco, and the defendant, East Shore Development, Inc. (East Shore), East Shore assigned all its right, title and interest in any arbitration award to the appellant, Laurel Woods, Inc. (Laurel Woods). The arbitrator thereafter rendered an award in favor of East Shore. East Shore and Laurel Woods filed an application to confirm the award pursuant to \u00a7 52-417 and a motion to join Laurel Woods as a party to the confirmation proceeding. The trial court denied the motion for joinder, and Laurel Woods appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion. <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore Development, Inc., </em>73 Conn. App. 303, 315, 807 A.2d 1039 (2002). We granted Laurel Woods\u2019 petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of [Laurel Woods\u2019] motion to join the proceedings in the trial court?\u201d <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore Development, Inc., </em>262 Conn. 924, 814 A.2d 378 (2002). We conclude that Laurel Woods was entitled to intervene in the confirmation proceeding and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following undisputed facts and procedural history that are necessary to our resolution of this appeal. \u201cOn September 24, 1992, [Franco and East Shore] entered into a contract (agreement). According to the terms of the agreement, Franco was to manage a nursing facility that East Shore was going to build, own and operate. East Shore completed the facility and leased it to Laurel Woods. Thereafter, Franco managed the facility from 1993 to 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201c[In] . . . 1998, a dispute arose between Franco and East Shore concerning Franco\u2019s compliance with his obligations under the agreement. On or about June 1, 1998, Franco filed a demand for arbitration, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to the arbitration clause of the agreement, claiming that East Shore had breached the agreement by actually terminating, attempting to terminate or threatening to terminate the agreement. By way of letter on July 23, 1998, East Shore formally terminated the agreement with Franco alleging that Franco violated the agreement because he had failed to pay a payroll withholding tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201cOn September 8,2000, while the arbitration proceedings were pending, East Shore assigned all its right, title and interest in any arbitration award to Laurel Woods. East Shore also filed a counterclaim on or about November 12, 1998, alleging that Franco had breached the agreement. The arbitrator issued a decision on February 9, 2001, that denied Franco relief and awarded East Shore damages totaling $432,794.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cOn March 8,2001, Franco filed an application [pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to vacate the arbitration award. On March 29, 2001, East Shore and Laurel Woods filed a motion for joinder and to confirm the arbitration award. The motion was comprised of two components. Laurel Woods, as the assignee of East Shore, sought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-101<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 52-103<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to be joined as a party in interest to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>proceedings. Further, East Shore and Laurel Woods sought an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 and 52-420<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> confirming the arbitration award. Franco filed an objection to the motion for joinder on May 2, 2001. [In addition, while these various motions were pending, Franco exercised an option to become an 80 percent shareholder of East Shore.]</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201cOn May 11, 2001, the [trial] court denied [the] . . . motion for joinder. The court stated that \u2018Laurel Woods had no written contract with [Franco] . . . for arbitration. Laurel Woods was not [the] assignee of the actual contract between [Franco] and East Shore, but merely the assignee of any award proceeds from the arbitration. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 and 52-418 provide that only a party to the arbitration may be a party to the court actions seeking to confirm or [to] vacate the award. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 308, </em>171 Conn. 420, 370 A.2d 996 (1976). The fact that the award may result in a benefit or a detriment to another person or entity is immaterial to party status. Id.\u2019 The court also entered an order staying the proceeding to confirm or to vacate the arbitration award pending an appellate decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>denial of [the] . . . motion for joinder.\u201d <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore Development, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 304-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Laurel Woods appealed to the Appellate Court, which, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for joinder. The Appellate Court noted, first, that, \u201calthough Laurel Woods has appealed only from the court\u2019s denial of its motion to join as a party, the original motion was both a motion to join and to confirm the award. In view of that combination, it is evident that Laurel Woods\u2019 ultimate goal was to join the case as a party and then to argue the motion to confirm the award in the hope of protecting the award it had been assigned. In light of that goal, [the Appellate Court] focus [ed] on Laurel Woods\u2019 ability to participate in the confirmation proceedings in deciding whether the [trial] court properly denied the motion for joinder because if Laurel Woods could not properly participate in those proceedings, then granting the motion for joinder for the purpose of arguing the motion to confirm would be improper.\u201d Id., 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The Appellate Court then reviewed the language of \u00a7 52-417, which governs the judicial confirmation of arbitration awards, and concluded that, under \u00a7 52-417, only \u201ca party to the arbitration\u201d may seek to confirm an arbitration award. Id., 307. On the basis of its interpretation of \u00a7 52-417, the Appellate Court further concluded that, \u201cthe [trial] court\u2019s decision denying the motion for joinder was correct because Laurel Woods was not a \u2018party,\u2019 as defined by \u00a7 52-417, and therefore did not have the right to seek to confirm the arbitration award.\u201d Id., 311. The Appellate Court acknowledged the \u201charsh result [of its] decision ... on Laurel Woods\u201d; id., 313; but nevertheless concluded that that result was mandated \u201con the basis of controlling arbitration statutes and law . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Chief Judge Lavery dissented from the majority opinion of the Appellate Court. See generally id., 315-18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(Lavery, <em>C. J., </em>dissenting). Treating the motion to join the confirmation proceeding as a motion to intervene pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-107,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Chief Judge Lavery first noted his disagreement with the underlying assumption of the Appellate Court majority, namely, \u201cthat . . . for an individual or entity to intervene in an action, it must have the standing necessary to have brought the original action itself.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 315 (Lavery, <em>G. J., </em>dissenting). Although Chief Judge Lavery \u201cagree[d] with the majority\u2019s determination that Laurel Woods, as a nonparty to the [arbitration] . . . could not apply to the court pursuant to ... \u00a7 52-417 for an order confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award\u201d; id. (Lavery, <em>C. J., </em>dissenting); he \u201cdiffered] ... as to the relevance of that determination to the disposition of Laurel Woods\u2019 motion to intervene.\u201d Id., 315-16 (Lavery, <em>C. J., </em>dissenting). Specifically, Chief Judge Lavery concluded that, \u201c[t]o support intervention, a prospective intervenor must show that it has some legally protected inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>est in the subject matter of the litigation. 59 Am. Jur. 2d 594-95, Parties \u00a7 176 (2002). \u2018A proposed intervenor must allege sufficient facts, through the submitted motion and pleadings, if any, in order to make a showing of his or her right to intervene. The inquiry is whether the claims contained in the motion, if true, establish that the proposed intervenor has a direct and immediate interest that will be affected by the judgment.\u2019 <em>Washington Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>241 Conn. 734, 747, 699 A.2d 73 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cNonetheless, there is no requirement that a prospective intervenor, in its motion to intervene, assert the <em>same </em>claim as the plaintiff in the original action. . . . \u2018[S]uch a restriction on intervention finds no support ... in common sense. The whole point of intervention is to allow the participation of persons with interests distinct from those of the original parties; it is therefore to be expected that an intervenor\u2019s standing will have a somewhat different basis from that of the original plaintiffs.\u2019 . . . <em>[State Board of Education </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>21 Conn. App. 67, 75, 571 A.2d 148 (1990)].</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201c \u2018To hold otherwise would be to conclude that an intervenor must allege the exact issues as those alleged by the original plaintiffs, and would, therefore, be in direct opposition to and in contradiction with the requirement that in order for intervention to be warranted, the prospective plaintiffs must show that their rights are not adequately represented by the present parties. . . .\u2019 Id., 75-76 .... Therefore, the fact that Laurel Woods could not join East Shore in the motion to confirm the arbitration award should not have been fatal to Laurel Woods\u2019 attempt to intervene in the confirmation proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore Development, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 316-17 <em>(Lavery, C. J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For the reasons set forth by Chief Judge Lavery in his dissent, we conclude that Laurel Woods was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to intervene in the trial court proceeding. We see no reason why \u00a7 52-417 bars Laurel Woods from intervening in the pending confirmation proceeding. Although \u00a7 52-417 does not address the issue of intervention, \u00a7 52-107<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\u201cThe decision whether to grant a motion for the addition of a party to pending legal proceedings rests generally in the sound discretion of the trial court. ... It must be kept in mind, however, that the rules of intervention should be liberally construed, in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and settle all related controversies in one action. ... A proposed intervenor must allege sufficient facts, through the submitted motion and pleadings, if any, in order to make a showing of his or her right to intervene. The inquiry is whether the claims contained in the motion, if true, establish that the proposed intervenor has a direct and immediate interest that will be affected by the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schaghticoke Tribal Nation </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>264 Conn. 829, 838-39, 826 A.2d 1102 (2003); see also <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>187 Conn. 187, 195, 445 A.2d 579 (1982) (\u201c[a]n applicant for intervention has a right to intervene . . . whe[n] the applicant\u2019s interest is of such a direct and immediate character that the applicant will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In light of Laurel Woods\u2019 status as assignee of East Shore\u2019s right, title and interest in the arbitration award, Laurel Woods had a direct and immediate interest in that award sufficient to warrant its intervention in the confirmation proceeding under \u00a7 52-107 as a matter of right.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, Laurel Woods\u2019 intervention in the pending confirmation proceeding is neither inconsistent with \u00a7 52-417 nor unfair to Franco.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 52-417 permits a \u201cparty\u201d to an arbitration <em>to apply for an order confirming an arbitration award, </em>there is nothing in the language of \u00a7 52-417 to suggest that a nonparty to the arbitration is prohibited from <em>intervening in a pending confirmation proceeding </em>in accordance with \u00a7 52-107. In other words, in the absence of any indication that \u00a7 52-417 was intended to supersede or to nullify \u00a7 52-107, we read the two provisions to give both of them effect. See, e.g., <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Allied Van Lines, Inc., </em>246 Conn. 170, 179, 717 A.2d 195 (1998) (we construe statutes to avoid \u201cconflict that would result in a nullification of one by the other\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Moreover, as the Appellate Court itself observed, \u201cLaurel Woods, as an assignee . . . may pursue the arbitration award in a common-law contract action. See <em>Spearhead Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>39 Conn. App. 122, 130, 132, 665 A.2d 86 (procedures in [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 52-417 to 52-419 are not the exclusive means for judicial enforcement of an arbitration award and [i]n the absence of a motion to confirm the award, the parties would be left to their common law remedies), cert. denied, 235 Conn. 928, 667 A.2d 554 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>Development, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 314. The fact that a nonparty to an arbitration agreement may commence a common-law action to enforce an arbitration award undermines the Appellate Court\u2019s assertion that it would be \u201cunfair to [allow] Franco . . . [to] be forced into an adversarial relationship with Laurel Woods\u201d; id., 311-12 n.7; a nonparty to the arbitration agreement, by allowing Laurel Woods to intervene in the confirmation proceeding. See footnote 10 of this opinion. Because Laurel Woods would be entitled to pursue its interest in the arbitration award in a common-law action against Franco, it reasonably cannot be maintained that it is unfair to allow Laurel Woods to raise that same claim in the pending confirmation proceeding. Under the circumstances presented, however, to require Laurel Woods to initiate a separate common-law action to confirm the arbitration award would be inconsistent with \u201cthe essential purpose of arbitration, namely, to avoid the expense and delay of litigation\u201d; <em>New England Pipe Corp. </em>v. <em>Northeast Corridor Foundation, 271 </em>Conn. 329, 337, 857 A.2d 348 (2004); and with the related purpose of our intervention rules, namely, \u201cto avoid multiplicity of suits and settle all related controversies in one action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schaghticoke Tribal Nation </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 52-417 does not bar Laurel Woods from intervening in the confirmation proceeding. We further conclude that Laurel Woods is entitled to intervene in that proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 52-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to join Laurel Woods as a party to the confirmation proceeding and to remand the case to that court with direction to grant that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 provides: \u201cAt any time within one year after an award has been rendered and the parties to the arbitration notified thereof, any party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for an order confirming the award.

See <em>Franco </em>v. <em>East Shore Development, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 312 (stating that trial court \u201ccorrectly denied the <em>motion to intervene </em>because Laurel Woods could not properly participate in the motion to confirm the award\u201d [emphasis added]). As Chief Judge Lavery explained in his dissent, \u201c[although . . . [the motion was] captioned ... as one for joinder, its substance is that of a motion to intervene. \u2018 [Intervention is a proceeding by which a person, not originally a party to an action, is permitted to and does become a party to the pending proceeding for the protection of some right or interest alleged by him to be affected by the proceeding .... \u201cJoinder\u201d is a method by which one may be compelled to become a party, whereas \u201cintervention\u201d is a method by which an outsider with an interest in a lawsuit may come in as a party on his or her application.\u2019 59 Am.
