On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>evening of June 24, 1999, the defendant, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, brutally bludgeoned to death Robert Lysz, a Roman Catholic priest, inside St. Matthew\u2019s Church in Bristol. The defendant was discovered the next morning hiding in the church rectory, wearing the victim\u2019s pants and in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet, credit card, and driver\u2019s license. Initially, the defendant told the police that he had killed the victim in self-defense, but subsequently raised the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect and the alternative affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">After the defendant\u2019s arrest, defense counsel moved, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for an evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>of the defendant to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. The trial court granted the motion and, on July 15, 1999, the defendant was examined by a team of mental health professionals from the department of mental health and addiction services (department). Following their examination of the defendant, the members of the evaluation team unanimously concluded that, due to psychiatric impairment, the defendant did not have the capacity either to understand the charges against him or to assist in his own defense but that, with appropriate treatment, there was a substantial probability that the defendant could be restored to competency. The trial court thereafter found that the defendant was not competent to stand trial and remanded him to the custody of the department for treatment designed to restore him to competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Over the next nine months, the defendant was evaluated for competency on three separate occasions. On the first two occasions, the members of the evaluation team concluded that, although the defendant was making progress toward competency, he had not yet been restored to competency. On April 20, 2000, however, after a third examination of the defendant, the evaluation team unanimously concluded that he was competent to stand trial. Thereafter, on the basis of the evaluation team\u2019s report and without objection from either party, the trial court found the defendant competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>At trial, the defendant did not dispute that he had killed the victim but asserted that, due to his mental illness, he had been incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct. Alternatively, the defendant claimed that he had killed the victim while under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. The trial court found that the state had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had killed the victim with the intent to do so by repeatedly striking the victim on the head with a heavy, four foot long, brass candlestick holder. The trial court also found that, although \u201cat various times over the years the defendant has displayed . . . the symptoms of mental illness,\u201d the defendant nevertheless had failed to establish either of his affirmative defenses,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which, the court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>concluded, had been contrived by the defendant, after the murder, in an attempt to shirk responsibility for the crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court failed to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial was knowing, voluntary and intelligent as required by the federal and state constitutions. The defendant\u2019s claim is twofold. First, he contends that his right to a jury trial guaranteed under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass him adequately, in light of his history of mental illness, regarding his waiver of a trial by jury. Second, the defendant contends that his rights under article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article four of the amendments,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> were violated because the court did not inform him of certain rights to which he was entitled under the state constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We reject both of these contentions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. On August 1, 2001, the defendant, through counsel, informed the court that he wished to forgo his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>a jury trial and be tried by a three judge court. At that time, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThe Court: Good afternoon, Mr. Ouellette.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: Good afternoon, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: The record should indicate we did have discussions in chambers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]:\u2014this morning. And, it\u2019s my understanding [that] the defendant wishes to change his election as to the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And, I believe he\u2019s prepared for the canvass on that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">\u201cThe Court: Please proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor. [The defendant] wishes to be tried by a three judge panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-14\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Ouellette, [do] you understand you have a right to be tried by a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-16\">\u201cThe Court: You have chosen a three judge panel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-18\">\u201cThe Court: And, was that with the advice of your client\u2014I mean your attorney has advised you in regard to these matters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-20\">\u201cThe Court: And are you satisfied with his advice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-22\">\u201cThe Court: Very well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The six day trial commenced on October 23, 2001. Before the presentation of evidence, the state renewed its motion to consolidate certain other charges with the murder charge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected, claiming that, according to his recollection of the hearing on August 1, 2001, the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial only as to the murder charge. The parties agreed to proceed with the trial and to have the court defer a ruling on the motion to consolidate until the transcript of the August 1, 2001 hearing could be obtained for review by the trial court. The state then proceeded with its first witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Immediately after the lunch recess, the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to consolidate the charges, stating that it had reviewed the transcript of the hearing at which the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial and that the transcript indicated that the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial only as to the murder charge. Immediately thereafter, the trial court made the following inquiry of the defendant regarding his decision to forgo his right to a jury trial on the murder charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: . . . And just so the record is clear, Your Honor, my understanding is . . . that the defendant continues in his waiver of a jury trial as to the murder case. There\u2019s no question that that was his intention at the time that he made his waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: If that\u2019s a question posed to counsel, that\u2019s correct. Yes, that\u2019s our position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u201c[The Court]: All right. And you understand what we\u2019re doing here, Mr. Ouellette?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201c[The Court]: And there\u2019s no question that you prefer to be tried by three judges and have the judges make the decision rather than a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201c[The Court]: You know you had a right to a jury before you waived it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201c[The Court]: And you\u2019re going to continue with your waiver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">\u201c[The Court]: All right. And that\u2019s on the basis of the advice of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-12\">\u201c[The Court]: Are you satisfied with your lawyer\u2019s advice with regard to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe right to a jury trial in a criminal case is among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>those constitutional rights which are related to the procedure for the determination of guilt or innocence. The standard for an effective waiver of such a right is that it must be knowing and intelligent, as well as voluntary. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>[412 U.S. 218, 237, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973)] .... Relying on the standard articulated in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938), we have adopted the definition of a valid waiver of a constitutional right as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. . . . This strict standard precludes a court from presuming a waiver of the right to a trial by jury from a silent record. . . . [S]ee <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). In determining whether this strict standard has been met, a court must inquire into the totality of the circumstances of each case. . . . [S]ee <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 278, 63 S. Ct. 236, 87 L. Ed. 268 (1942). When such a claim is first raised on appeal, our focus is on compliance with these constitutional requirements rather than on observance of analogous procedural rules prescribed by statute or by the Practice Book.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 371-72, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s canvass failed to satisfy federal constitutional requirements because of the defendant\u2019s known history of mental illness. In essence, the defendant claims that the trial court was obligated to conduct a more thorough canvass than otherwise would have been required because the court was aware of the defendant\u2019s history of mental illness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">It is undisputed that an accused who is competent to stand trial also is competent to waive constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 398-99, 113 S. Ct. 2680, 125 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1993). Thus, \u201cany criminal defendant who has been found competent to stand trial, ipso facto, is competent to waive the right to [a jury trial] as a matter of federal constitutional law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 824, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Because the defendant was found competent to stand trial, and because that determination has not been challenged on appeal, the defendant also was competent to waive his right to a juiy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The determination of whether a defendant is competent to waive his right to a jury trial, however, is only the first of two steps necessary to determine whether the relinquishment of that right is constitutionally valid. \u201cIn addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to [waive a constitutional right] is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver ... is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>supra, 509 U.S. 400. \u201c[I]n this sense, there is a \u2018heightened\u2019 standard for [the waiver of a constitutional right], but it is not a heightened standard of competence.\u201d Id., 400-401. Moreover, it is the same standard that is applicable to all criminal defendants who have been found competent to stand trial. Under this standard, \u201c[t]he determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of [a constitutional right] must depend, in each case, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra, 304 U.S. 464; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>252 Conn. 274, 296, 746 A.2d 150 (\u201c[i]n considering the validity of [a] waiver, we look ... to the totality of the circumstances of the claimed waiver\u201d), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that the defendant was competent to stand trial. Although it is true that the defendant required treatment to restore him to competency, at no time after the evaluation team rendered its conclusion that the defendant was competent did defense counsel, the state or the trial court express any concern whatsoever about the defendant\u2019s competence. Indeed, the defendant waived a formal competency hearing in light of the evaluation team\u2019s competency finding. Furthermore, the defendant was apprised of his right to a jury trial in plain and clear terms and he affirmatively waived that right. In fact, the defendant was canvassed twice in regard to that election and, on each such occasion, expressed his desire to be tried by a three judge court in lieu of a jury. The defendant also indicated that he was satisfied with the advice that he had received from defense counsel. The record therefore establishes that the defendant, having been informed of his right to a jury trial, freely and intelligently elected to be tried by a three judge court instead.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s canvass was inadequate for purposes of article first, \u00a7 19, of the state constitution, as amended by article four of the amendments,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because he was not apprised of certain rights provided under that provision that are not afforded under the federal constitution. See footnote 13 of this opinion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In <em>State </em>v. Marino, 190 Conn. 639, 645-46, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983), this court considered, and rejected, a claim that, because article first, \u00a7 19, of the state constitution provides rights above and beyond those afforded under the federal constitution, a waiver of that state constitutional right to a jury trial, to be valid, must reflect that the accused knowingly and voluntarily waived those additional rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In rejecting this claim, we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cBoth General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b (b) and [what is now] Practice Book \u00a7 [42-1]<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> require that the judge advise the defendant at the time he pleads of his right to a trial by jury. We have indicated that a literal compliance with these provisions is not essential if the record affirmatively discloses that the defendant intelligently and knowingly did waive his right to trial by jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shockley, </em>188 Conn. 697, 711, 453 A.2d 441 (1982). Neither the statute nor the rule specifies the precise content of the advice to be given a defendant who seeks a non-jury trial. The colloquy with the court . . . does establish that, with counsel present, [Joseph Marino, the] defendant voluntarily chose to be tried by a three judge court rather than a jury. The federal standard for jury waiver set forth in [rule 23 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], which has frequently been held constitutionally adequate, accomplishes nothing more by way of assurance of a knowing and intelligent waiver on the part of a defendant. It is not unreasonable to infer such a waiver from the free expression by a defendant of his election of a non-jury trial especially whe[n] he is represented by counsel. <em>See Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>rel. McCann, </em>[supra, 317 U.S. 269] (an accused, without counsel by his own election, may voluntarily waive right to jury if capable of determining his own best interest). We, therefore, find no violation of the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to a jury trial. <em>We also see no reason to demand as a constitutional necessity a more elaborate procedure for an effective waiver of the right of jury trial as guaranteed by our state constitution. </em>Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>supra, 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The defendant nevertheless asks us to reconsider our state constitutional holding in <em>Marino. </em>He contends that reconsideration is appropriate because <em>Marino </em>was decided prior to <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), in which we identified with specificity, for the first time, the analytical tools to be used in construing the contours of our state constitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">It is true, of course, that <em>Marino </em>predated <em>Geisler, </em>and it also is true that we did not undertake a lengthy analysis of the state constitutional claim in <em>Marino. </em>See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 645-46. The defendant, however, has provided no persuasive federal or sister state precedent to support his contention that our conclusion in <em>Marino </em>was incorrect. In the absence of any substantial reason to revisit our holding in <em>Marino, </em>we decline to do so.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>We therefore conclude that the record is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. \u201cFirst, there is no evidence to suggest that the defendant was not of ordinary intelligence or educational background.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 372. The defendant, moreover, was represented by counsel, he was advised of his right to a jury trial in open court on two separate occasions and, on each of those occasions, he responded affirmatively when asked by the court whether he understood that he was giving up his right to a trial by jury. Finally, \u201c[w]e cannot assume that in performing his duty of competent representation [defense] counsel did not advise the defendant of the consequences of his choice, even to the extent of the refinements the defendant now demands.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 646. In addition, we will not assume that the defendant did not fully discuss the decision to forgo a jury trial with defense counsel. Under the circumstances, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim that his waiver of his right to a jury trial was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defendant next claims that his waiver of the probable cause hearing was constitutionally infirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>because the trial court, <em>Gaffney, J., </em>failed to canvass the defendant adequately in regard to that waiver. The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on two purported deficiencies with that canvass. First, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s explanation of the nature of a probable cause hearing was inadequate. Second, the defendant contends that the canvass occurred so soon after the defendant was found competent to stand trial that the defendant\u2019s waiver of the probable cause hearing was not valid. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the canvass was constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim. Immediately after the defendant was found competent to stand trial, the state\u2019s attorney informed the court that the defendant wished to waive his right to a probable cause hearing. Thereafter, the following colloquy between the court and the parties ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: The next issue . . . would be normally a probable cause hearing. It\u2019s my understanding from talking to [defense counsel] that he and his client have decided, after discussing this matter, that they wish to waive [the] probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Ouellette, do you understand what was just said?</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">\u201cThe Court: You have a right to a probable cause hearing, and the burden in connection with that hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>is upon the state, or it would have been. The state has the burden of proving that there was probable cause, based on the underlying facts, to arrest you and charge you with the offense with which you stand charged, and the state would put on evidence to support that claim. You would not have to put on any evidence of your own. You have the right to simply sit by with your counsel and listen to what is presented by the state. . . . It\u2019s my understanding, based on what was just represented by [defense counsel] and confirmed, I guess, by the state\u2019s attorney, that you don\u2019t wish to contest or to require the probable cause hearing to go forward?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. So that you\u2019re waiving that right which you have?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">\u201cThe Court: And that there\u2019s no question that you\u2019re doing it understandingly and knowingly of your rights as I\u2019ve explained them to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution, as amended by article seventeen of the amendments, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be held to answer for any crime, punishable by death or life imprisonment, unless upon probable cause shown at a hearing in accordance with procedures prescribed by law . . . .\u201d The procedures governing probable cause hearings are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which provides in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>relevant part that a defendant \u201cmay knowingly and voluntarily waive\u201d his right to a probable cause hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">We conclude, contrary to the claim of the defendant, that his waiver of the probable cause hearing satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 54-46a (a) and was constitutionally valid. After informing the defendant of his right to a probable cause hearing, the trial court explained that, at any such hearing, the state would have the burden of establishing probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed the offense with which he was charged. The record further discloses that the defendant had discussed the matter with defense counsel and, when asked if he understood what he was waiving, the defendant personally affirmed that he did. We see no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a probable cause hearing was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The defendant contends, however, that the waiver was invalid because it occurred immediately after the trial court had found the defendant competent to stand trial. In support of this contention, the defendant asserts that the temporal proximity of the waiver to the finding of competency gives rise to a serious concern that the defendant did not have a meaningful opportunity to discuss the waiver issue with defense counsel prior to the canvass. Because the defendant was competent to stand trial, however, he also was competent to waive his rights. See part I A of this opinion. The timing of such a waiver is irrelevant as long as the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>competent when the waiver occurred, and there is no dispute that the defendant was competent to stand trial when he waived his right to a probable cause hearing. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant did not have ample time to discuss the waiver issue with counsel after he was restored to competency. Indeed, as we have indicated, the mental health professionals responsible for evaluating the defendant reported on April 20,2000, that he was competent. Thus, the record belies the defendant\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a probable cause hearing was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass him regarding his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> violated his constitutional right to due process. In support of this contention, the defendant relies primarily on <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 803 A.2d 287 (2002),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in which \u201cwe conclude [d], in the exercise of our supervisory authority over the administration of justice,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that in all future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>cases in which a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and the state substantially agrees with the defendant\u2019s claim of mental disease or defect, with the result that the trial essentially is not an adversarial proceeding, the trial court must canvass the defendant to ensure that his plea is made voluntarily and with a full understanding of its consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Id., 329. Neither the conclusion nor the rationale of <em>Duperry </em>supports the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass the defendant with respect to his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect implicated his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Because the defendant relies heavily on <em>Duperry, </em>we commence our review of the defendant\u2019s claim with a discussion of that case. Adam Duperry was arrested and charged with arson and manufacturing bombs in connection with the explosion of a pipe bomb at the Institute of Living in Hartford. Id., 312-13. Thereafter, two psychiatrists who had examined Duperry at the request of his counsel concluded that, at the time of the offense, Duperry had been suffering from a severe mental illness and, as a consequence, had lacked the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions and to conform his conduct to the law. Id., 313; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a). In light of these evaluations, the state ultimately agreed not to oppose a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and Duperry, through counsel, agreed to waive a jury trial and not to contest the state\u2019s prima facie case regar ding the underlying charges. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 313. Duperry subsequently pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, elected to be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>by a court, and, in accordance with their agreement, the state and Duperry presented their respective cases without opposition. Id., 314. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the trial court found Duperry not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and subsequently ordered that Duperry be committed to the custody of the psychiatric security review board; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1); and that he be confined in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities for a maximum term of twenty-five years. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Duperry thereafter sought a writ of habeas corpus, alleging, inter alia, that his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions were violated by virtue of his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect because he was not apprised of and did not fully understand the consequences of his plea. See id., 315. In essence, Duperry claimed that, in light of the rights that he was waiving as a result of the interposition of his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, and to ensure that he was giving up those rights knowingly and voluntarily, the trial court was required to canvass him in the same manner that it is required, under <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 238,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to canvass an accused who pleads guilty. See <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 316, 317-18. After a hearing, the habeas court concluded that the requirements for the acceptance of a guilty plea apply equally to the acceptance of a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. Id., 315-16. Upon noting that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court had canvassed Duperry in a manner analogous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>to that required under Practice Book \u00a7 39-19,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which sets forth the procedure for canvassing a defendant who pleads guilty, the habeas court also concluded that Duperry\u2019s plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was involuntary because Duperry did not understand the consequences of that plea. Id., 316. The habeas court therefore rendered judgment granting the petition. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The state appealed, and we reversed the judgment of the habeas court, concluding, inter alia, that that court improperly had established a new constitutional rule in a collateral proceeding in contravention of the principle announced in <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 316, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1989).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 326, 336. Specifically, we determined that, in light of <em>Teague, </em>Duperry could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>prevail on his habeas claim because, as of December, 1988, when Duperry entered his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, applicable precedent did not compel the trial court to canvass Duperry in regard to that plea.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See id., 324; see also footnote 32 of this opinion. Having concluded that the principle enunciated in <em>Teague </em>barred the habeas court from establishing a new constitutional rule in Duperry\u2019s habeas proceeding, we expressly declined to \u201caddress whether the substance of the habeas court\u2019s holding was proper, i.e., whether the principle of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 242-44, that due process requires a plea of guilty to be knowing and voluntary, applies equally to a plea of not guilty by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>mental disease or defect.\u201d <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 326 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Notwithstanding our determination in <em>Duperry </em>regarding the habeas court\u2019s improper resolution of the constitutional issue, we nevertheless concluded that it was \u201cappropriate, in light of concerns of fundamental fairness, to consider the substance of this issue pursuant to our supervisory authority for the purpose of providing guidance to trial courts in future cases.\u201d Id., 326-27. Upon such consideration, we adopted a rule requiring trial courts to canvass defendants who elect to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Id., 329. We limited the rule, however, in two respects, both of which are particularly important for purposes of this appeal. First, the rule is prospective in nature, and second, it applies to cases in which \u201cthe state substantially agrees with the defendant\u2019s claim of mental disease or defect, with the result that the trial essentially is not an adversarial proceeding . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>As we observed in Duperry; id., 327; and as courts in a number of other jurisdictions also have recognized; e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>848 F.2d 1312, 1320 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 890, 109 S. Ct. 224, 102 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>428 F.2d 1100, 1102-1103 (D.C. Cir. 1970); there are certain practical similarities between guilty pleas and pleas of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect or by reason of insanity. We know of no court, however, that has required, as a matter of <em>constitutional law, </em>a <em>Boykintype </em>canvass of a defendant who pleads not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect or by reason of insanity. Moreover, those courts that have required such a canvass have done so not as a matter of constitutional mandate but, rather, on the basis of prudential considerations; e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 1103-1104; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shegrud, </em>131 Wis. 2d 133, 138, 389 N.W.2d 7 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1037, 107 S. Ct. 891, 93 L. Ed. 2d 843 (1987); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanley, </em>41 Cal. App. 3d 846, 856, 116 Cal. Rptr. 446 (1974); <em>Legrand </em>v. <em>United States, </em>570 A.2d 786, 792-94 (D.C. App. 1990); and even then, only in circumstances in which the state has not opposed the defendant\u2019s claim or in which the facts are not otherwise in dispute. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 1103; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanley, </em>supra, 853; <em>Legrand </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 788; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shegrud, </em>supra, 135. Indeed, in truly contested cases, we reasonably may presume that, in light of the adversarial nature of the proceeding, defense counsel will be particularly diligent in advising the defendant of the effect that a claim of mental disease or defect is likely to have on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the defendant\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In the absence of any precedent or other authority to indicate that a court is constitutionally required to canvass a defendant who pleads not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and in view of the fact that the state vigorously contested the defense raised by the defendant, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were not implicated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass him regarding his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for a presentence psychiatric examination pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. After the trial court found the defendant guilty of murder but prior to sentencing, the defendant filed a motion for a diagnostic evaluation in accordance with \u00a7 17a-566. The trial court denied the motion without comment, and the defendant filed a motion for articulation. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and, in its articulation, stated in relevant part: \u201cThe court heard the . . . testimony of numerous defense witnesses, both lay and expert, on the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental condition. These witnesses included representatives of Whiting Forensic Institute. The court has read the reports entered by the defendant as full exhibits, including the four reports from the [department] and the four different versions of the report of [the physician who examined the defendant at the request of defense counsel]. Although the reports from the [department] were prepared for the purpose of determining the competence of the defendant to stand trial, the findings of the defendant\u2019s mental condition contained therein supplemented by the trial testimony are relevant for sentencing purposes as well. The court concludes that it has sufficient evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition to make an informed sentencing decision. Therefore, the court finds that an additional diagnostic evaluation would not be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The applicable legal principles are settled. \u201cA court may order a psychiatric evaluation of a defendant only if it appears to the court that such person has apsychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>disability and is a danger to himself or others. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-566. The trial court, acting on a motion pursuant to ... \u00a7 17a-566, may rely on evidence such as psychiatric reports, the defendant\u2019s personal history and background, as well as the defendant\u2019s testimony and demeanor at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 62, 671 A.2d 323 (1996). It is within the discretion of the trial court to grant or [to] deny such a motion. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 241, 511 A.2d 310 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Relliford, </em>63 Conn. App. 442, 450, 775 A.2d 351 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cThe purpose of an examination under [\u00a7 17a-566] is not to determine competency to be sentenced. That section presumes that a convicted defendant will be sentenced. The purpose of an examination under [\u00a7 17a-566] is to allow the commissioner of mental health to make recommendations as to certain offenders concerning the sentence to be imposed and the place of confinement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Moreover, the use of \u00a7 17a-566 to obtain a psychiatric evaluation of a defendant in advance of sentencing \u201cpresupposes that the court does not have access to sufficient medical information to permit it to make an informed judgment as to the defendant\u2019s mental condition.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>198 Conn. 397, 404, 503 A.2d 163 (1986). Thus, when \u201cthe court has adequate psychiatric documentation of the defendant\u2019s mental condition, there is no need for it to utilize the statutory provisions concerning further examinations. . . . The presence of some degree of mental illness does not prevent or avoid the imposition of sentence by the court nor does it necessarily require that the court blindly and automatically implement the statutory machinery providing for psychiatric examinations.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In the present case, the trial court had ample information pertaining to the defendant\u2019s psychiatric history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>and mental illness at the time of sentencing. Not only had the court heard detailed testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense, but also had reviewed psychiatric reports pertaining to his competency to stand trial. Although the trial court, in its discretion, reasonably might have ordered an examination pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566, in light of the extensive and timely information and material already available to the court regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition, we see no reason to second-guess the trial court\u2019s determination that there simply was no need for such an examination. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the court abused its discretion in declining to order a presentence psychiatric examination under \u00a7 17a-566.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">\u201c(b) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, mental defect or other mental abnormality is admissible, in a prosecution under subsection (a) of this section, on the question of whether the defendant acted with intent to cause the death of another person. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-82 (b) provides: \u201cIf the accused is charged with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for life and elects to be tried by the court, the court shall be composed of three judges to be designated by the Chief Court Administrator, or his designee, who shall name one such judge to preside over the trial.

At the hearing, however, the parties agreed, in light of the conclusion of the evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>team, that the defendant was competent to stand trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not conduct a formal evidentiary hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial but, rather, made a finding of competency on the basis of the report of the evaluation team and the following colloquy between the court and the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Ouellette, you understand that today\u2019s matter was to be a hearing on your competency to stand trial, that is, a determination as to whether or not you understood the nature of the proceedings that we were concerned with and whether you were capable of assisting your counsel ... in your own defense.

In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. Although the defendant is entitled to review of his claim because he has satisfied the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>he nevertheless cannot prevail on his claim because, for reasons set forth more fully hereinafter, he has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\"> The defendant also was charged separately with burglary and theft of a credit card.

We disagree. The second canvass, which makes reference to the first canvass, is relevant to the extent that it informs our understanding of what the parties themselves understood with respect to the import of the first canvass. Moreover, under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b (b), \u201cif a judge acting on motion made by the accused witMn ten days after judgment finds that [the] waiver [of the right to a jury trial] was made when the accused was not fully cognizant of his rights or when, <em>in the opinion of the judge, the proper administration of justice requires it, </em>the judge shall vacate the judgment and cause the proceeding to be set for jury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, although the second canvass occurred after the defendant\u2019s trial had commenced, it occurred at a time when the court still could have acted to remedy any waiver that was invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\"> As a matter of state law, \u201c[t]he standard we use to determine whether a defendant is competent ... to stand trial is that set forth in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (test for competence to stand trial is whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him). The <em>Dusky </em>standard has been codified at [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-56d (a), which provides that [a] defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. For the purposes of this section, a defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 785-86, 785 A.2d 573 (2001); see footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> The defendant relies primarily on two cases, namely, <em>United States </em>v. <em>David, </em>511 F.2d 355 (D.C. Cir. 1975), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>18 F.3d 822 (9th Cir. 1994), to support his contention that the trial court failed to canvass him adequately regarding his waiver of the right to a jury trial in light of his history of mental illness. Neither of these cases constitutes persuasive precedent for the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In <em>David, </em>the record reflected a significant possibility that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent due to the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the purported waiver; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>David, </em>supra, 511 F.2d 358-59; and, in fact, defense counsel expressed serious concerns about the defendant\u2019s competency at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>that time. Id., 358. Moreover, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately determined that the canvass in that case was inadequate not because of the defendant\u2019s mental condition but, rather, because his responses to the trial court\u2019s canvass were equivocal, at best. Id., 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>Christensen </em>also is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Christensen, </em>the defendant sought and received several continuances of his trial because his counsel had expressed concern that he was not competent to stand trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>supra, 18 F.3d 823 and n.2. No competency hearing ever was held, however, and, after the conclusion of the trial, a psychiatrist testified at the sentencing hearing that the defendant suffered from a mental illness that \u201ccould result in uncontrollable mood swings during which a person might not be able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her own behavior.\u201d Id., 824. The trial court in <em>Christensen, </em>therefore, in contrast to the trial court in the present case, did not have the benefit of a recent and comprehensive evaluation of the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the jury trial waiver. Thus, although we agree with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Christensen </em>that a more extensive colloquy generally will be required of a mentally ill defendant who seeks to waive his right to a jury trial; see id., 825-26; there is nothing in the record of the present case to suggest that the trial court\u2019s canvass of the defendant was inadequate because of his history of mental illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\"> See footnote 12 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\"> The canvass in <em>Marino </em>consisted of the following relevant colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">\u201cThe Clerk: . . .

With respect to <em>Miller, </em>we noted that, although, in that case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had recognized the similarities between a guilty plea and a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the court\u2019s holding was limited to a determination that, in light of those similarities, the state is equally obligated, under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), to disclose exculpatory information to defendants who plead guilty <em>and </em>to defendants who plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 322, 323; see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 1320. With respect to <em>Broum, </em>we observed that, in that case, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals had extended the canvass requirement to a defendant who stipulates to all of the issues at trial except sanity. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 323; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 1103-1104. We noted, however, that the holding in <em>Brown </em>did not appear to rest on constitutional footing but, rather, upon the court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory authority. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 324; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 1102-1103. We therefore concluded that neither <em>Miller </em>nor <em>Broum </em>\u201cestablished the principle that the trial court <em>must, </em>as a constitutional requirement, canvass a defendant who enters [a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect] to ensure that the plea is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 323.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> With respect to the parameters of the inquiry, we stated: \u201cThe scope of the canvass should be similar to that of the canvass prescribed by Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 for a defendant who pleads guilty. Specifically, the canvass must, at a minimum, establish that the defendant enters his plea with the knowledge that: (1) he is waiving his right to a jury trial; (2) he is waiving his right not to incriminate himself; (3) he is waiving his right to confront the witnesses against him; (4) he is exposing himself to the possibility of commitment to the jurisdiction of the board and of confinement in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities; (5) he must remain committed during any term of commitment imposed by the trial court unless the court finds that the defendant is a person who should no longer be committed and orders his discharge; (6) the maximum term of commitment ordered by the court can be equal to the maximum sentence that could have been imposed if the defendant were convicted of the offense, with a statement of that actual sentence; and (7) any term of commitment imposed by the trial court may be extended, potentially for an indefinite duration, as a result of a civil commitment proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593.\u201d <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> Because our opinion in <em>Duperry </em>was not released until after judgment had been rendered by the trial court in the present case; see footnote 27 of this opinion; <em>Duperry, </em>by its express terms, does not apply to this case. See <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 329 (rule announced applies only in \u201cfuture cases\u201d). <em>Duperry </em>also is inapplicable because, in the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the state did <em>not </em>agree with the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of mental disease or defect; see id. (rule applies only in cases in which \u201cstate substantially agrees with the defendant\u2019s claim of mental disease or defect\u201d); indeed, the state <em>successfully </em>challenged the defendant\u2019s claim at trial. Furthermore, the defendant in the present case, unlike Duperry, did not waive his right to a jury trial in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement not to contest his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b791-5\"> We note that certain other claims or defenses available to criminal defendants also tend to reduce the burden on the state to prove one or more elements of a particular offense. For example, the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, like the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, necessarily carries with it the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that he committed the prohibited acts but that he did so with a less culpable mental state. Similarly, a claim of self-defense presupposes that the defendant committed the acts alleged by the state. No canvass of the defendant is required\u2014constitutionally or otherwise\u2014however, in cases involving claims of extreme emotional disturbance or self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We further note that, because the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance is not a complete defense to the offense charged, a defendant who prevails on that claim still faces criminal sanctions for any lesser included offense of which he may be convicted. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). Insofar as a defendant who prevails on such a defense nevertheless may be exposed to a period of incarceration, the potential consequence of that successful defense is not altogether dissimilar from the consequence likely to flow from a successful claim of mental disease or defect, namely, a period of confinement pursuant to an order of commitment. See <em>Connelly v. Commissioner of Correction, 258 </em>Conn. 394, 405, 780 A.2d 903 (2001) (observing that order of commitment \u201cis no less a deprivation of liberty [to an insanity acquittee] than that of a prison sentence [to a convicted felon]\u201d). Although a defendant who establishes the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance remains exposed to a potential term of incarceration upon conviction of a lesser offense, we do not require a canvass of that defendant for the purpose of ensuring that he is aware of the ramifications of his successful assertion of that defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> Ifurthermore, although we reaffirm the supervisory rule that we adopted in <em>Duperry </em>in recognition of certain similarities between guilty pleas and pleas of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, in <em>Duperry, </em>we expressly limited the applicability of that rule to future cases and to cases in which the trial essentially is not an adversary proceeding. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 329. As we have explained, the <em>Duperry </em>rule is unavailing to the defendant for both of those reasons.
