At a separate sentencing hearing for the two counts of capital felony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the same jury considered further evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict with regard to the imposition of the death penalty on either of the charges. The trial court thereafter denied the state\u2019s motion for mistrial of the penalty hearing and rendered judgment sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ing the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from his conviction to this court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state appealed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s judgment sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction on all charges, but we reverse the judgment imposing a sentence of life imprisonment and remand the case for a new penalty hearing on both capital felony counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court: (1) improperly instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of a capital felony based upon a theory of conspiratorial liability under <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(1946); (2) improperly charged the jury on an element of conspiratorial liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine by failing to instruct the jury that, in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, it must find that the coconspirator intentionally caused the victims\u2019 deaths; (3) deprived the defendant of his federal and state constitutional rights to confront witnesses and to present a defense by refusing to disclose certain medical, drug treatment and psychiatric records of a state\u2019s key witness for the purpose of cross-examination; (4) violated his constitutional rights to be present at all stages of his trial and to presence of counsel when it conducted two ex parte proceedings with the attorney for a key witness for the state; and (5) violated the Code of Judicial Conduct when the presiding judge failed to recuse himself, sua sponte, after conducting those two ex parte proceedings. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s first, second and fifth claims are without merit. Furthermore, even if we assume that the defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims are valid, we nevertheless conclude that the improprieties were harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction portion of the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The second appeal is the state\u2019s appeal from the sentencing portion of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Specifically, the state appeals from: (1) the trial court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial, its dismissal of the penalty phase proceedings, and the subsequent imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release; and (2) the trial court\u2019s subsequent denial of the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying permission to appeal, after concluding, among other things, that a deadlocked jury can reach a lawful verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The state further argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying its motion for a mistrial after improperly instructing the jury that if it remained deadlocked, the trial court would be required to impose a sentence of life imprisonment \u201cwithout the benefit of release.\u201d Such an improper instruction, the state argues, was not only based upon an unsound legal premise, but tainted the jury deliberations by: (1) leading the jury to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or put to death did not rest solely in its discretion; and (2) increasing the likelihood that the jury would remain deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In response to the state\u2019s claims, the defendant presents four alternate grounds for affirmance. The defendant argues that the judgment of the trial court, sentencing him to life imprisonment, should be affirmed because: (1) \u00a7 53a-46a (b) does not permit a trial court to impanel a new juiy after the original jury becomes deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital case; (2) principles of vicarious liability cannot be used to prove aggravating factors, and, therefore, the state presented insufficient evidence to prove any of the aggravating factors necessary for the imposition of the death penalty; (3) the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the particularized mental state required by each aggravating factor; and (4) <em>Pinkerton </em>liability cannot be used to prove aggravating factors, and therefore the state presented insufficient evidence to prove any aggravating factors. We agree with the state\u2019s arguments and reject the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release and remand the case for a new penalty hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the late 1990s, the defendant and his brother, Adrian Peeler (Adrian), operated a large-scale drug trafficking network that sold crack cocaine (crack) throughout the city of Bridgeport. In 1997, the defendant partnered with Rudolph Snead, Jr., to produce and distribute the crack. Snead\u2019s responsibilities included providing the defendant with powdered cocaine, which the defendant, with the help of several associates, processed into crack and then sold on the streets. The partnership began to sour when, in 1997, the defendant accused Snead of overcharging him for the powdered cocaine. Snead responded to the accusation by \u201cshooting up\u201d a building on Benham Street in Bridgeport that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the defendant used as a \u201ccrack house.\u201d According to one of the defendant\u2019s associates, the defendant vowed to retaliate.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In September, 1997, the defendant, Corey King, Shawn Kennedy, and the defendant\u2019s cousin, Ryan Peeler (Ryan), were driving in Bridgeport when the defendant noticed Snead\u2019s car parked in the lot of a barber shop. The defendant observed Snead leave the barber shop, get into his car and drive away. At the time, the defendant was aware that two young boys, later identified as Leroy Brown, Jr., and Tyrell Snead (Tyrell), were passengers in Snead\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The defendant\u2019s car followed Snead\u2019s car to the Lindley Avenue entrance ramp to Route 25. As Snead proceeded up the ramp, he slowed down and pulled off to the side. The defendant\u2019s vehicle pulled up next to Snead\u2019s car, and the defendant, who was seated in the right front passenger seat, fired several shots at Snead from a .40 caliber, semi-automatic handgun.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant kept shooting until his gun jammed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Several of the shots fired by the defendant hit Snead, injuring him, but not so severely that he was unable to drive away. A Bridgeport police officer, who noticed glass falling from Snead\u2019s car as he drove by, stopped the vehicle. After Snead explained what had happened, the officer sent him to St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">At the hospital, another officer from the Bridgeport police department interviewed Snead and his two young passengers, Brown and Tyrell. The officer\u2019s investigative report included the names of all three interviewees. On the basis of Snead\u2019s identification of the defendant as the person who had shot him, the defendant was arrested and charged with attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The defendant, however, posted bond and was released from custody. After his release, the defendant made it clear to his associates that he was furious with Snead for reporting the Lindley Avenue shooting to the police, and that he was going to \u201cget\u201d him for giving a statement to the police. Subsequently, in May, 1998, while free on bond, the defendant shot and killed Snead in the same barber shop that Snead had patronized immediately prior to the Lindley Avenue shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">While investigating Snead\u2019s death, the Bridgeport police department performed ballistics tests comparing the shell casings retrieved from the minder scene with those from the Lindley Avenue shooting. The tests revealed that all of the bullets had been discharged from the same gun. The police were also aware that Brown could identify the defendant as the shooter in the Lindley Avenue shooting, thus linking him directly to Snead\u2019s murder. On the basis of this information, the defendant was arrested and charged with Snead\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant, however, again secured his release by posting bond. As a condition of his release, the defendant was required to observe a curfew and wear an electronic ankle bracelet to ensure compliance. Despite these precautions, the defendant continued operating his drug trafficking business, albeit from a new location.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In January, 1998, during the course of pretrial discovery in connection with the Lindley Avenue shooting, the state provided defense counsel with the police report identifying Brown and Tyrell as the two passengers in Snead\u2019s car when that shooting had occurred. The trial court, however, ordered counsel to conceal the names of the two children from the defendant to ensure their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">During the fall of 1998, the defendant frequently discussed his pending cases with his attorney, and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>speculated as to the identity of the state\u2019s witnesses. He noticed that his attorney had made an extraordinary effort to prevent him from learning the name or names of the state\u2019s witnesses. The defendant, however, remembered that during the Bindley Avenue shooting Snead had been accompanied by two children, Tyrell and Brown. He therefore surmised that those children could be the state\u2019s witnesses in the cases pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The defendant\u2019s suspicions were confirmed when, one day while driving past 207 Earl Avenue in Bridgeport, where Brown lived with his mother, Karen Clarke, the defendant saw Brown playing outside. When Brown saw the defendant, he looked surprised and immediately ran away. As a result, the defendant concluded that Brown was in fact one of the state\u2019s witnesses. The defendant thereafter openly contemplated the possibility of having someone kill Brown and Clarke.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In December, 1998, the defendant told his girlfriend, Angelina Keene, that she should move away from Bridgeport because he was going to start killing the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At about the same time, the defendant offered Kybarris Taylor $10,000 to kill two people. Specifically, the defendant told Taylor that he wanted to eliminate \u201ctwo nobodies.\u201d Taylor refused the offer. The defendant also asked his brother Adrian and Josephine Lee, a crack addict and prostitute who lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>across the street from Clarke and Brown, to carry out the killings. They too initially refused. Ultimately, however, Adrian agreed to commit the double homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The defendant also told his associates that he wanted the witnesses killed with a revolver because, unlike a .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun, the shell casings would not be discharged from the revolver, making it more difficult to link the shootings to the gun.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In October, 1998, one of the defendant\u2019s associates in the drug trade, Albrent Daniels, procured for the defendant the revolver that was to be used to kill Clarke and Brown. Michael Lanier, a drug user, went to a crack house that was controlled by the defendant and offered to trade Daniels a .357 magnum revolver in exchange for drugs. Daniels contacted the defendant and asked whether he was interested in acquiring the gun. The defendant agreed, and Daniels subsequently traded for the revolver. King, another associate of the defendant, then picked up the gun from Daniels and delivered it to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">King testified that at one point after the defendant had gained possession of the gun, the defendant described to several of his associates, including Adrian, what he intended to do with it. He said that he would put the gun to Brown\u2019s head and go \u201c[p]ow,\u201d simulating the sound of a gunshot. The gun eventually was given to the defendant\u2019s brother, Adrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">At this same time, the defendant and his drug trafficking associates moved their crack production to a house located at 200 Earl Avenue in Bridgeport, across the street from the house in which Clarke and Brown then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>lived. The residents of the 200 Earl Avenue address, including Lee, were crack users who obtained the drug from the defendant\u2019s drug trafficking network.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Lee testified that on January 6, 1999, the day before the Clarke and Brown murders, the defendant and an associate, later identified as King, were at the house located at 200 Earl Avenue. According to Lee, the two men spent time in the dining room observing Clarke and Brown\u2019s residence. Lee further testified that another of the defendant\u2019s associates, later identified as Gary Gamer, and the defendant\u2019s brother, Adrian, also came by the house that day. At some point, King left Lee\u2019s residence and, thereafter, Lee observed Adrian and the defendant conversing in the dining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The defendant and Adrian then entered the kitchen and \u201ccooked\u201d some crack. Lee testified that the defendant asked her if she would \u201cdo him a favor . . . [and] kill the woman across the street . . . .\u201d Lee, however, refused to do so. The defendant thereupon asked Adrian if he would kill Clarke and her son. According to Lee, Adrian indicated that he would \u201ctake care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant then asked Lee to keep an eye on the 207 Earl Avenue address and to contact him when Clarke and Brown returned home. Lee agreed to do so, and the defendant wrote down his beeper number for her to call. The defendant then gave Lee a handful of crack cocaine as payment for her cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The next day, when Lee saw Clarke and Brown return home, she telephoned the defendant\u2019s beeper number and left her number. When the defendant called her back, she informed him that Clarke and Brown had returned home. The defendant said \u201cokay\u201d and hung up the telephone. A few minutes later, Adrian arrived at Lee\u2019s residence holding a gun. Adrian greeted Lee and then immediately departed Lee\u2019s residence. Lee followed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Adrian crossed the street and proceeded toward Clarke and Brown\u2019s house at 207 Earl Avenue, stopping first to speak to a lone occupant in a car that was parked in front of that residence. The occupant of the car subsequently was identified as Gamer. Lee testified that Gamer told her that if she \u201csaid anything,\u201d she \u201cwas going to be next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Adrian and Lee approached Clarke\u2019s residence and Lee rang the front doorbell while Adrian remained behind her. Lee heard a voice from inside the house ask, \u201c[w]ho is it?\u201d Lee responded, \u201c[t]he girl across the street.\u201d Clarke cracked open the door, at which time Adrian pushed past Lee and forced the door open. Lee testified that she heard the mstle of grocery bags, which were later found strewn across the floor, and the sounds of a stmggle inside. When Lee entered the house, she saw Clarke and Brown running up the stairs trying to escape from Adrian, who was chasing them. According to Lee, once Clarke and Brown reached the top of the stairs, she heard a gunshot, and then heard Brown scream out, \u201cmommy, mommy, mommy, mommy,\u201d from the top of the stairs. Lee then saw Adrian pursue Clarke into a bedroom and heard him mention something about Brown being a witness to a shooting. Lee, who by this time was at the top of the stairs, testified that she had heard another gunshot and, immediately thereafter, observed Adrian emerge from the bedroom. Lee further stated that she saw Adrian shoot Brown in the head. Adrian then ran out of the house. Lee, who was still at the top of the stairs, testified that she initially had stood frozen, but eventually left to return to her residence at 200 Earl Avenue. On her way out of Clarke and Brown\u2019s house, Lee noticed Adrian was gone, as was the car in which Gamer had been sitting. Louis Ellis, who also lived at 200 Earl Avenue, corroborated Lee\u2019s account, testifying that on the evening of the murders, he heard four or five gunshots, and shortly there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>after, he heard Lee run into the house breathing hard, as if out of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On April 14,1999, the defendant was arrested for the murders of Clarke and Brown and charged with one count of murder, two counts of capital felony\u2014one for the murder of Brown, and the second for the double murder\u2014and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. While incarcerated and awaiting trial, the defendant inculpated himself to fellow inmates. Two of those inmates, Audrey Holeman and Thomas Kerr, testified that while each was incarcerated with the defendant, the defendant had bragged about his involvement in the murders. Holman testified that he had overheard the defendant tell another inmate that his brother would not testify against him because the defendant had murdered one person, but his brother had murdered two, and that the defendant was pleased with his brother because Adrian \u201chad done something righteous\u201d for him \u201cthat nobody else . . . would do . . . .\u201d Ken- testified that the defendant had told him that \u201cthat bitch,\u201d Clarke, rather than the defendant himself, was responsible for both of the deaths, and that \u201c[s]he should have known not to mess with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">After a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty on all counts. The state then proceeded to a penalty hearing, in accordance with \u00a7 53a-46a (a),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> seeking the death penalty for the two capital felony convictions. While deliberating on the defendant\u2019s sentence, the jury on several occasions informed the court that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. Notes from the jury to the trial judge indicated that on the charge pertaining to the murder of Brown, the panel found that the state had proven at least one aggravating factor and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the defendant had proven at least one nonstatutory mitigating factor, but the jurors could not agree as to whether the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors. Regarding the double homicide of Clarke and Brown, the jury indicated that it could not reach a unanimous verdict as to whether the state had proven an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">After several unsuccessful attempts by the trial court to obtain a unanimous verdict, which included the giving of a \u201cChip Smith\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> instruction to the jury, the court submitted a revised verdict form that allowed the jury to indicate the following: (1) on the capital felony count concerning the murder of Brown, \u201c[w]e the jury unanimously agree that we are unable to unanimously agree that one or more of the proved statutory aggravating factors outweighs one or more of the proved nonstatutory mitigating factors\u201d; and (2) as to the capital felony count directed at the double homicide, \u201c[w]e the jury unanimously agree that we are unable to unanimously agree that the [s]tate . . . has proved one or more of the statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Neither the defendant nor the state objected to the submission of the revised verdict form. The jury then resumed deliberations and, on both counts, selected the option declaring that it unanimously agreed that it could not unanimously agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">After the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the court subsequently dismissed the penalty phase proceedings, rendered a judgment of guilty in accordance with the verdict and, merging the two capital felony counts and the murder count, sentenced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>defendant to a total effective sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"AUj\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of a capital felony based on conspiratorial liability under <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 328 U.S. 640.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Specifically, the defendant argues that the instruction was erroneous because: (1) this court\u2019s decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), preclude a trial court from instructing a jury that it may use the doctrine of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to find a defendant guilty of a capital felony under \u00a7 53a-54b; (2) allowing the use of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine to prove a capital felony would produce an absurd, bizarre and unworkable result; and (3) this court never has adopted the expansive notion of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability applied by the trial court and should not do so in the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We disagree with each of the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we address the reviewability of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of capital felony based upon <em>Pinkerton </em>liability. The defendant concedes that he failed to preserve his claim by either taking an exception to the relevant jury instructions or submitting a relevant request to charge. He therefore seeks to prevail under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); and the plain error rule. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant may prevail on unpreserved claims \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>stitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. \u201cThe first two [prongs of Golding] involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 784, 785 A.2d 573 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We conclude that, in the present case, the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied, that is, the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 490, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003) (claim of improper jury instruction on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is of sufficient constitutional magnitude for <em>Golding </em>review); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>232 Conn. 1, 7, 653 A.2d 161 (1995) (\u201can improper jury instruction as to an essential element of the crime charged may result in the violation of the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial, and thus require the reversal of a conviction based upon that instruction\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We also conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s instruction on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability was proper and the defendant therefore cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cThe standard of review for claims of instructional impropriety is well established. [Individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 490.

The rationale for the [adoption of the] principle [was] that, when the conspirator [has] played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>nal conduct, he should be held responsible, within appropriate limits, for the crimes committed as a natural and probable result of that course of conduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cWe concluded in <em>Walton </em>that the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle was applicable in state criminal cases, reasoning, first, that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is not inconsistent with our penal code and, therefore, that we were not prohibited from recognizing that theory of criminal liability as a matter of state common law. See General Statutes \u00a7 53[a]-4. Without foreclosing the use of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine in other circumstances, we then concluded that application of the doctrine was appropriate in <em>Walton, </em>in which [1] the defendant was a leader of the conspiracy, [2] the offense for which vicarious liability was sought to be imposed was an object of the conspiracy and [3] the offense was proved by one or more of the overt acts alleged in support of the conspiracy charge. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 518, we were required to decide whether to extend the principle of vicarious liability that we adopted in <em>Walton </em>to a case in which not all of [the three <em>Walton] </em>conditions have been met, a question that we expressly reserved in <em>Walton. </em>... In <em>Diaz, </em>the defendant had been convicted of, inter alia, murder under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine and conspiracy to commit murder. . . . The evidence showed that the defendant, along with several other individuals, had fired multiple gunshots into a motor vehicle occupied by the victim and three others. . . . The victim was struck and killed by a single bullet. . . . The defendant claimed on appeal that the court\u2019s instruction under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine had been improper because, among other reasons, it was broader than the limited version of the doctrine recognized in <em>Walton. . . . </em>This court acknowledged that the state had not proved that the defendant was the leader of the conspiracy to ambush the vehicle and its occupants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>and, thus, had not established the first condition for <em>Pinkerton </em>liability set forth in <em>Walton. . . . </em>We noted, however, that the evidence reasonably established that the defendant was a fully engaged member of the conspiracy who had actively participated in the shooting and that he, along with his coconspirators, intended to kill one or more of the vehicle\u2019s passengers. . . . We concluded that where . . . the defendant was a full partner in the illicit venture and the coconspirator conduct for which the state has sought to hold him responsible was integral to the achievement of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, the defendant cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct. . . . We further concluded that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability may be imposed even if none of the three <em>Walton </em>conditions is present. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201cWe also acknowledged, however, that there may be occasions when it would be unreasonable to hold a defendant criminally liable for offenses committed by his coconspirators even though the state has demonstrated technical compliance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>rule. ... In such a case, a <em>Pinkerton </em>charge would not be appropriate.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 491-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In claiming that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of capital felony under \u00a7 53a-54b based upon a theory of conspiratorial liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, the defendant first argues that this court\u2019s conclusions in <em>State </em>v. Harrell, supra, 238 Conn. 828, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 702, preclude such an instruction. Specifically, the defendant argues that, in <em>Johnson, </em>this court implicitly rejected the contention that an \u201cintentional murder committed by [a codefendant] can be used as the predicate murder for the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>felony conviction . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 712. We disagree.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 478, is dispositive of this argument. \u201cIn <em>Coltherst, </em>we considered the defendant\u2019s claim that, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>[supra, 238 Conn. 839], and <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>[supra, 241 Conn. 713-14], he could not be convicted of capital felony under \u00a7 53a-54b (5) because his murder conviction was premised on the doctrine set forth in <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra, 328 U.S. 640]. [As in the present case, the defendant in <em>Coltherst] </em>argued that, although he had been convicted of intentional murder under \u00a7 53a-54a, because the intent to kill had been imputed to him under <em>Pinkerton, </em>he had not committed an intentional murder for purposes of the capital felony statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, [500-502]. [The <em>Coltherst </em>court noted that in] <em>Harrell, </em>we determined as a matter of statutory interpretation that the word murder as used in \u00a7 53a-54b means intentional murder as defined by Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 2, now codified as \u00a7 53a-54a (a). Therefore, we concluded in <em>Harrell </em>that the defendant\u2019s conviction for arson murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54d could not serve as a predicate murder for purposes of the capital felony statute. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 839. Similarly, in <em>Johnson, </em>we rejected the state\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s conviction of felony murder could serve as the predicate for capital felony when the defendant\u2019s codefendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>an intent to kill, concluding that the requirement [under \u00a7 53a-54b] of an <em>intentional </em>murder refers to the underlying murder that the defendant was convicted of ... . <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 712. In <em>Coltherst, </em>we determined that, in <em>Harrell </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>we had not focused on the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind in concluding that a defendant could not be charged under \u00a7 53a-54b unless he had been convicted of intentional murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 500-501. Instead, those cases stand for the proposition that a conviction under \u00a7 53a-54a is both necessary and sufficient to meet the requirement of a murder conviction under the capital felony statute, regardless of the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind. Id. Accordingly, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 50 n.17, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003). In the present case, the jury convicted the defendant of intentional murder. Therefore, in accordance with this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Coltherst, </em>nothing would prevent the trial court from instructing the jury on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to prove a capital felony.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The defendant further argues that \u201c[allowing the use of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to prove a capital felony would produce an absurd, bizarre and unworkable result.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Specifically, he claims such a bizarre result would occur because, under the doctrine of accessorial liability, \u201c[a] defendant who agrees to commit a violent felony with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>another and does not intend that the victims be killed would not be guilty of the capital murder of two people if his accomplice kills the victims . . . [b]ut [under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine] a defendant who conspires with another and does not intend that the victims be killed would be guilty of capital murder of two people if his coconspirator killed the victims.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In light of the fact, however, that the defendant\u2019s conspiracy conviction was for a murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), necessarily an intentional crime under the statute, and the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury that it must decide whether the defendant <em>intended </em>to commit murder, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s hypothetical has no relevance to the facts of this case, and therefore we need not address it. See <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 209, 355 A.2d 21 (1974) (defendant\u2019s constitutional attack on statute predicated on hypothetical facts deemed irrelevant and therefore court declined to address); see also <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Olesen, </em>31 Conn. App. 359, 361, 624 A.2d 920 (1993) (court declines to address defendant\u2019s claim because irrelevant to disposition of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Lastly, the defendant argues that this court never has adopted the expansive notion of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability applied by the trial court, and should not do so in the present case. Specifically, he argues that \u201c[t]his court has [never] applied <em>Pinkerton </em>to a defendant who was not actively involved in the murder or was not even at the scene . . . and should not do so in this case . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. Diaz, supra, 237 Conn. 529, this court concluded that in circumstances wherein \u201cthe defendant was a full partner in the illicit venture and the coconspirator conduct for which the state has sought to hold him responsible was integral to the achievement of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, the defendant cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct.\u201d In upholding the trial court\u2019s instruction on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability, the <em>Diaz </em>court reasoned that, \u201c[although the state did not prove that the defendant was the leader of the conspiracy to ambush the [victim\u2019s] vehicle and its occupants, the evidence reasonably established that the defendant was a fully engaged member of the conspiracy who had actively participated in the shooting and that he, along with his coconspirators, intended to kill one or more of the vehicle\u2019s passengers.\u201d Id. This court then concluded by stating that, although we indicated in <em>Walton </em>that \u201cthere may be occasions when it would be unreasonable to hold a defendant criminally liable for offenses committed by his coconspirators even though the state has demonstrated technical compliance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>rule ... we are not presented with such a situation in this case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In the present case, the facts reveal that the defendant sufficiently was engaged in the conspiracy so that it is not unreasonable to impose criminal liability on him for the actions of his coconspirator. Indeed, the defendant was the one who had initiated the plan to murder Brown and Clarke in order to prevent them from testifying against him. The evidence at trial established that the defendant believed that Brown had witnessed the Lindley Avenue shooting. As a result, the defendant conspired with his brother, Adrian, to murder Brown and Clarke in order to prevent them from testifying against him at his trial for Snead\u2019s murder. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dant obtained the murder weapon from one of his associates and gave it to Adrian. He graphically demonstrated to several of his associates, including Adrian, that he wanted Brown to be killed by placing the gun next to his head and pulling the trigger. Finally, the defendant gave Lee a handful of crack as payment for notifying him when the victims were home and providing a means of access into the victims\u2019 house. Consequently, although the defendant did not actually pull the trigger of the gun that killed the victims, and was not present when the shootings occurred, his actions clearly establish that he was \u201ca fully engaged member of the conspiracy who . . . along with his coconspirators, intended to kill [the victims]\u201d; id., 529; and therefore the defendant \u201ccannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously hable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of capital felony based upon conspiratorial liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. Therefore, a constitutional violation does not clearly exist and the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly charged the jury on an element of conspiratorial liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine by failing to instruct the jury that, in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, it had to find that the coconspirator intentionally caused the victims\u2019 deaths. In other words, the defendant argues that by instructing the jury that it could convict the defendant if it found that he had conspired to murder the victims and a coconspirator \u201cperform[ed] that act that was the proximate cause\u201d of their deaths, the court improperly treated <em>Pinkerton </em>liability as a species of felony murder requiring that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>foreseeable <em>death, </em>rather than a foreseeable <em>murder, </em>occur in furtherance of and within the scope of a conspiracy.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">At the outset, we address the reviewability of this claim. The defendant once more concedes that he failed to preserve this claim, and therefore seeks to prevail under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the issue is reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We agree.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim falls short on its merits, and thereby fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review. As we previously noted herein, \u201cindividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 490. Accordingly, in reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is \u201csufficiently correct in law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As we previously noted herein, the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine allows the state to prove the guilt of one defendant through the acts of another committed within the scope of and in furtherance of a conspiracy of which the defendant was a member, provided the acts are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy. See <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 328 U.S. 647-48. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 531, this court clarified the standard when it stated that when applying <em>Pinkerton </em>liability, \u201ca defendant may not be convicted of murder unless <em>one of his criminal associates </em>acting foreseeably and in furtherance of the conspiracy, <em>caused the victim\u2019s death with the intent to do so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">On the basis of the totality of the jury instructions, we are not persuaded that the jury was misled to believe that Adrian\u2019s intent was irrelevant in determining whether the defendant was guilty of murder based upon a theory of conspiratorial liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. The jurors specifically were instructed that in order to find the defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, they had to \u201cconclude [that] the defendant was a member of the conspiracy as charged in the second count of the information beyond a reasonable doubt and that <em>another member of that same conspiracy committed the crime of murder, </em>[that then] you farther conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was in the scope of and the furtherance of this conspiracy, then each and every member of that conspiracy would be guilty of the murder charge whether or not they personally committed the murder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The trial court then explained to the jury that murder, by definition, must include an intentional act. Citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u00a7 53a-54a (a), the court stated that, \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder, [when] <em>with intent to cause the death of another </em>person, he causes the death of such person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We conclude that the instructions, viewed in their totality, were accurate and, \u201c[i]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the jury properly followed those instructions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 398, 844 A.2d 810 (2004); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 313, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The defendant argues in his brief that, \u201c[o]n six occasions, the court told the jury it only had to find that a coconspirator caused the victims\u2019 deaths and never told the jury that it must find that Adrian committed murder . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant points to the trial court\u2019s repeated use of the instruction that the jury could convict the defendant of murder if it found that he conspired to murder the victims and a coconspirator \u201cperformed the act that was the proximate cause\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>their deaths. The defendant, however, reads these instructions in isolation and out of context. Although the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of murder if it found that he conspired to murder the victims and a coconspirator \u201cperform[ed] that act that was the proximate cause\u201d of their deaths, such language was always couched within the court\u2019s instruction on murder, which clearly stated that the actor must <em>intend </em>to cause the death of the victim. See footnote 17 of this opinion. We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions, when read in totality, were \u201csufficiently correct in law, adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 185. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because there is no clear constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court violated his constitutional rights under the sixth<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> by denying him disclosure of certain medical, drug treatment and psychiatric records of Lee, a key witness for the state, for purposes of cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The defendant contends that Lee\u2019s mental health records demonstrate that she had been diagnosed on numerous occasions with significant mental illnesses, which were exacerbated by an extensive drug habit. The defendant argues that by denying him access to this information, the court prevented him from impeaching Lee\u2019s testimony based on the impact of her mental illness on her ability accurately to perceive, remember and recall the events at the time of the murders, thereby violating his rights to confrontation and to present a defense.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Although we agree with the defendant, we conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Certain additional facts are relevant to this issue. Prior to trial, the state moved to depose Lee because she was suffering from a terminal illness and might not survive until trial. After reviewing Lee\u2019s medical records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and hearing argument on the motion, the trial court granted the state\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Before Lee\u2019s deposition, the defendant moved for a hearing on Lee\u2019s competency to testify. The defendant argued that because Lee was suffering from an unspecified terminal illness,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> such illness could also affect her competency to testify, and therefore a hearing was warranted. In order to resolve this issue, Lee consented to the release of her medical, drug treatment and psychiatric records (mental health records) from the various federal prisons, psychiatric institutions and rehabilitation centers in which she had been held or admitted over the past several years, to the extent it was necessary to determine whether she was competent to testify.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The trial court, however, postponed ruling on the motion until a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">At about the same time that the defendant filed his motion for an inquiry into Lee\u2019s competency, he also filed a motion for production requesting all of Lee\u2019s mental health records for impeachment purposes during cross-examination. The defendant argued, among other things, that such documents contained information relevant to Lee\u2019s mental condition that reasonably could affect her credibility at trial. He argued that, at a minimum, such information warranted an in camera review by the court. The trial court denied the motion without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The court nevertheless allowed defense counsel to review Lee\u2019s mental health records solely for purposes of the pending competency hearing. In light of the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for full disclosure, the trial court specifically ordered the defense not to use any of the information gleaned from its review of Lee\u2019s medical records to cross-examine Lee at her deposition or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Lee\u2019s deposition began in early November, 1999.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The court initiated the proceedings by addressing the defendant\u2019s motion for a hearing regarding Lee\u2019s competency to testily. The defendant argued that recently disclosed reports indicated that Lee was a \u201cpatient . . . beginning to lose it, that she hears voices, that she sees hallucinations,\u201d and, therefore, she was not competent to testify. The trial court, however, disagreed. After reviewing Lee\u2019s mental health records, the trial court concluded that Lee appeared to be unstable only when under the influence of narcotics, that she was not presently under the influence of such substances and, therefore, that she was competent to testify. The state then commenced its direct examination of Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Prior to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Lee, , the defendant renewed his previous motion for permission to use Lee\u2019s medical records during cross-examination.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Having previously reviewed Lee\u2019s mental health records in relation to his motion on Lee\u2019s competency to testify, the defendant argued that an in camera review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of the documents would reveal that Lee had been diagnosed as having \u201ca major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder\u201d and at the time was taking four different psychotropic medications. Furthermore, the defendant argued, the records reflected Lee\u2019s long history of crack abuse, her auditory hallucinations while using crack and her heavy crack use at the time that she claimed to have witnessed the murders. The defendant maintained that such information was relevant to whether Lee accurately could perceive, remember and relate the incidents surrounding the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">After hearing Lee testify on direct examination, and having heard argument from all the parties, the trial court concluded that Lee \u201chad feelings of suicide when depressed, and that usually was in conjunction with the development of the use of crack cocaine . . . and/ or alcohol.\u201d Relying on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stale </em>v. D\u2019Ambrosio, 212 Conn. 50, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990), the court noted, however, that a witness\u2019 history of drug or alcohol treatment does not automatically provide the key to gain access to that witness\u2019 mental health records. Therefore, the trial court initially concluded that the defendant had not met the threshold burden needed to justify an in camera review of Lee\u2019s mental health records.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Nevertheless, \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d the trial court reviewed all of Lee\u2019s mental health records in camera and concluded that \u201c[t]here is no especially probative feature to be disclosed from [the mental health records] in the court\u2019s judgment of this witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe and recollect and narrate relevant occurrences, not only now, but in the course of her developing life as she suffered from physical illness and addiction problems.\u201d The records were then sealed for appellate review, and the deposition proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>During his subsequent cross-examination at Lee\u2019s deposition, defense counsel attempted to inquire into Lee\u2019s mental health at the time of the murders of Brown and Clarke, but was prevented from doing so by the trial court. Specifically, when defense counsel asked Lee about her history of hearing voices, the trial court interjected and reminded counsel that such questions violated its order sealing Lee\u2019s records, and that it would not allow any inquiry based on the records into \u201cthe ability of the witness to recall, report accurately under oath and hopefully truthfully.\u201d The defendant then requested permission to make an offer of proof. The trial court denied the request, making it clear that under no circumstances would it revisit its order sealing Lee\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Lee subsequently testified before the jury during the defendant\u2019s trial. Lee testified on direct examination that in January, 1999, she had smoked crack on a daily basis. She further testified that she had smoked crack on the day of the murders. During cross-examination, Lee admitted that when she was under the influence of crack, she would experience extreme paranoia, lasting approximately five minutes. When asked what she meant by feeling \u201cparanoid,\u201d she stated that she would get \u201cscared.\u201d The defendant impeached Lee\u2019s credibility with an inconsistent statement from her deposition, wherein she testified that she remained paranoid for fifteen to twenty minutes after ingesting crack. The defendant further impeached Lee with numerous inconsistent statements that she had made to the police about the events surrounding the murders. Due to the court\u2019s order sealing her mental health records, however, defense counsel made no attempt to question Lee about her mental illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">While the appeal in the present case was pending, Adrian\u2019s case went to trial. On a motion by counsel for Adrian, the trial judge in that case, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>that either Lee consent to the release of her mental health records to defense counsel for Adrian, the same mental health records in dispute in the present case, or the state would be precluded from having Lee testify. Lee subsequently consented to their full release, thereby making the records available to Adrian\u2019s counsel during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Because Lee\u2019s mental health records had become part of the public record at Adrian\u2019s trial, the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel subsequently moved to have the records unsealed so their contents could be reviewed and referred to in the present appeal. Lee consented, and the trial court therefore unsealed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying disclosure of Lee\u2019s mental health records for purposes of cross-examination. The defendant argues that such an exclusion violated his state and federal constitutional rights to cross-examine Lee about her various hospitalizations, medications and psychiatric conditions, especially as aggravated by her significant crack use, in an effort to challenge her ability to perceive and recall the events surrounding the murders. We have reviewed Lee\u2019s mental health records in connection with our determination of this appeal and we conclude that the defendant should have been given access to portions of the records that bore on Lee\u2019s ability to understand, recall and relate the circumstances of the murders. We further conclude, however, that the failure to afford the defendant access to these records was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u201cWe first set forth the standard of review for determining whether the exclusion of this evidence enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ties the defendant to a new trial. Upon review of a trial court\u2019s decision, we will set aside an evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. Provost, 251 Conn. 252, 257, 741 A.2d 295 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 822, 121 S. Ct. 65, 148 L. Ed. 2d 30 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). The trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination and [e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. ... To establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 173, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">It is well established that \u201c[a] criminal defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses, which may include impeaching or discrediting them by attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception. <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 19, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 457, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). Thus, in some instances, otherwise privileged records, like the ones in this case, must give way to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the jury facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 401-402, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); <em>State v. Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 227, 514 A.2d 724 (1986), on appeal after remand, 208 Conn. 683, 546 A.2d 286 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1016, 109 S. Ct. 1131, 103 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>257 Conn. 842, 853-54, 779 A.2d 723 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201cWe are mindful, however, that the right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 175. \u201cThe need to balance a witness\u2019 statutory privilege to keep psychiatric records confidential against a defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause is well recognized. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 108-109, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). The test and the associated burdens imposed on a defendant are equally well chronicled. If, for the purposes of cross-examination, a defendant believes that certain privileged records would disclose information especially probative of a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, he may, out of the jury\u2019s presence, attempt to make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. ... If in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera. A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019testimony stricken. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u201cUpon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. ... If the court determines that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness\u2019 further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>possible appellate review. . . . Once the trial court has made its inspection, the court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s access to the witness\u2019 records lies in the court\u2019s sound discretion, which we will not disturb unless abused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 855-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201c[T]he linchpin of the determination of the defendant\u2019s access to the records is whether they sufficiently disclose material especially probative of the ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth . . . so as to justify breach of their confidentiality and disclosing them to the defendant in order to protect his right of confrontation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 856-57. \u201cIt bears emphasis [however] that any limitation on the impeachment of a key government witness is subject to the most rigorous appellate review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 250, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">With this standard in mind, our review of Lee\u2019s mental health records convinces us that portions of these records directly relate to Lee\u2019s ability to perceive, remember and relate events at the time of the murders and, therefore, should have been disclosed by the trial court to the defendant for use for impeachment purposes. Specifically, the records contain information that could call into question Lee\u2019s mental stability at the time of the events in question, and could have created doubt regarding her ability accurately to perceive and relate the events surrounding the murders. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 736, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). In particular, the records reveal that both prior to and after the murders, Lee was diagnosed with significant mental disorders, including \u201ccocaine induced psychiatric disorder with hallucinations,\u201d \u201cchronic paranoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>schizophrenia,\u201d \u201cdrag induced psychosis\u201d while using cocaine, and antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The records further reveal that in the year prior to the events in question, while hospitalized, Lee had been placed in four point restraints and medicated with Thorazine, an antipsychotic drag,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> on several occasions after severely acting out as a result of hearing voices. On one occasion in particular, Lee was restrained after running wildly up and down the hallway of the Southwest Community Mental Health Center, experiencing auditory hallucinations, and yelling that \u201cthe people say I got to get out of here.\u201d Finally, the records reveal that only seven months after the events in question, Lee was again diagnosed as having \u201ca history of schizophrenia,\u201d of \u201chearing voices for the last two years,\u201d especially when using drags, and, most importantly, experiencing difficulty in recalling past events, including her numerous suicide attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that Lee\u2019s mental health records contained information demonstrating that she suffered from conditions that may have \u201csubstantially affected [her] ability to observe, recall or narrate events at issue in the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardinal, </em>194 Conn. 114, 119, 478 A.2d 610 (1984). Specifically, Lee\u2019s records reveal a history of mental unsoundness, including hallucinations, delusions, misperception of reality and paranoia, exacerbated by a severe state of substance dependency. The records therefore were probative of Lee\u2019s ability to \u201ccomprehend, know and correctly relate the truth,\u201d which, as previously noted, is the linchpin in determining whether disclosure is warranted. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 856. Accordingly, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>elude that the trial court improperly denied the defendant access to this evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 459 (stating that access to records bearing on \u201c \u2018the mental unsoundness of a witness,\u2019 \u201d including \u201csuch traits as hallucinations, delusions, lack of contact with or misperception of reality, [or] paranoia . . . are admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The state argues that the trial court correctly refused the defendant access to Lee\u2019s mental health records because her records solely relate to \u201cher drug and alcohol addiction and treatment, and the resulting depression, despair and suicidal feelings.\u201d On the basis of this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 529, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996), that \u201c \u2018we have never held that a history of alcohol or drug abuse or treatment automatically makes a witness fair game for disclosure of psychiatric records to a criminal defendant,\u2019 \u201d the state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant access to Lee\u2019s mental health records. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The state mischaracterizes the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant does not argue that he should have been given access to Lee\u2019s mental health records because they demonstrate a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and therefore would be relevant to her credibility. Rather, the defendant argues that he should have been given access because the records reflect that Lee suffered from mental instability, before and after the events in question, which was exacerbated by her drug and alcohol abuse. It is this information that the defendant deems strongly probative of Lee\u2019s ability accurately to perceive, recall and relate the events at the time of the murders. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Our conclusion that the trial court improperly denied disclosure of Lee\u2019s mental health records for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of cross-examination does not, however, end our inquiry. We must next consider whether the trial court\u2019s improper refusal to disclose Lee\u2019s mental health records is of constitutional magnitude, or whether the error was merely evidentiary in nature. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 412, 820 A.2d 236 (2003). \u201cIf the claim is of constitutional magnitude, the state has the burden of proving the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Otherwise, in order to establish reversible error on an evidentiary impropriety, the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and a harm that resulted from such abuse.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 858, we stated that \u2018there is ... a minimum level of cross-examination that must be afforded to the defendant into matters affecting the reliability and credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses.\u2019 Accordingly, in that case, we held that, because the trial court\u2019s failure to disclose treatment records was an abuse of discretion that deprived the defendant of an opportunity to pursue a relevant line of inquiry, such error amounted to a constitutional violation. Id., 859.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>267 Conn. 162, 181-82, 836 A.2d 1191 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In the present case, the trial court refused to disclose Lee\u2019s mental health records, which prevented the jury from evaluating the impact of Lee\u2019s mental condition on her ability accurately to perceive, recall and relate the events in question. Moreover, although the trial court allowed the defendant to question Lee during cross-examination concerning her heavy use of crack and the paranoia she felt while under the influence of crack, the defendant was denied any meaningful opportunity to inquire into Lee\u2019s extensive history of mental illness, and how her admitted drug use may have affected her mental condition, which we previously have determined was relevant to her credibility as a witness. Consequently, we conclude that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>court\u2019s order denying access to the mental health records and restricting the scope of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Lee was of constitutional magnitude, which requires the state to establish its harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. See id., 182 (constitutional violation when court refused to disclose records reflecting extreme drug and alcohol abuse of witness); see also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 316 (confrontation clause violated when defense counsel restricted by state confidentiality provisions from questioning witness on juvenile criminal record). We further conclude, however, that the state has met this burden in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u201cWhether [a confrontation violation] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In the present case, the state supported its case with a considerable amount of corroborating evidence, significantly limiting its need to rely solely on Lee\u2019s testimony. This evidence included the testimony of several of the defendant\u2019s drug associates corroborating the defendant\u2019s involvement in the murders, several incriminating statements said to, or overheard by, the defendant\u2019s fellow inmates, and the testimony of Keene, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>defendant\u2019s girlfriend, all of which pointed to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Kennedy, an associate of the defendant\u2019s who was with him during the Lindley Avenue shooting, testified that after the defendant\u2019s arrest for the murder of Snead, the defendant made a significant effort to discover the identity of the state\u2019s witnesses against him in that homicide. Kennedy testified that the defendant ultimately had told him that he had determined that Brown was the state\u2019s witness against him and that he \u201cwas going to kill [him]\u201d to prevent Brown from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Daniels, an associate who participated in the drug trafficking network with Kennedy and the defendant, testified that he had purchased a .357 Magnum revolver for the defendant, the same type of gun that subsequently was used to commit the murders of Brown and Clarke. Daniels\u2019 testimony was corroborated by that of Michael Lanier, the individual who had sold Daniels the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">King testified that once the defendant had obtained possession of the .357 Magnum, the defendant described to Adrian, and several other associates, how he would kill Brown by placing the barrel of the gun to the child\u2019s head and pulling the trigger. Ira Kanfer, the state\u2019s medical examiner, testified that Brown was killed in such a manner; and Marshall Robinson, the state\u2019s firearms expert, testified that Brown and Clarke were both killed by bullets from a .357 Magnum. In addition, Keene testified that sometime in December of 1998, after the defendant had determined that Brown was a state\u2019s witness in the Lindley Avenue shooting, the defendant told her to leave town because he was going to begin murdering witnesses. Specifically, Keene testified that the defendant first told her to move in November, 1998, stating that, \u201c[h]e told me shit was starting to get hot and he [was] about to start getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>witnesses, witnesses\u2014wait a minute. . . . [H]e told me witnesses [were] about to get killed.\u201d Keene further testified that the defendant warned her again on Christmas day in 1998, stating: \u201cHe was talking in an opening to everybody, but, like, me mainly . . . I\u2019m telling her she better move. Shit about to start getting hot, meaning people starting to get killed.\u201d Lastly, Keene testified that, when the defendant spoke about killing witnesses, he quoted the following lyrics from a rap song: \u201c[Naggers want to lie, niggers wonder why, niggers gonna die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Lastly, two of the defendant\u2019s fellow inmates, Aundrey Holeman and Thomas Kerr, testified that while each was incarcerated with the defendant, the defendant had bragged about his involvement in the murders. Holeman testified that he had overheard the defendant tell another inmate that Adrian would not testify against him because the defendant had murdered one person, but Adrian had murdered two,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and that the defendant was pleased with his brother because Adrian \u201chad done something righteous\u201d for him \u201cthat nobody else . . . would do . . . .\u201d Kerr testified that the defendant had told him that \u201cthat bitch,\u201d Clarke, and not the defendant, was responsible for both of the deaths, and that \u201c[s]he should have known not to mess with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Moreover, the state presented a significant amount of physical evidence that the jury could have found corroborated Lee\u2019s description of the murders, lessening the state\u2019s need to rely upon her testimony. For example, Lee testified that grocery bags had been strewn against the door when Adrian forced his way into Clarke and Brown\u2019s home. This was confirmed by photographs taken at the scene of the crime. Lee testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>fied that she had heard a gunshot, and then heard Brown yell out, \u201cmommy, mommy, mommy, mommy\u201d from the top of the stairs. Brown\u2019s body was found at the top of the stairs. Lee stated that she saw Clarke run as far as the second floor bedroom before she heard another shot. Photographs established that Clarke\u2019s body was found in a second floor bedroom. Lee testified that she saw Adrian exit the bedroom, proceed to the top of the stairs, and then shoot Brown in the head. Physical evidence confirmed this testimony. Finally, Lee testified that when she realized what had happened, she ran out of the house and returned to her residence at 200 Earl Avenue. Louis Ellis, who also lived at 200 Earl Avenue, corroborated Lee\u2019s account, testifying that on the evening of the murders, he heard four or five gunshots, and shortly thereafter, he heard Lee run into the house breathing hard, as if out of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Lastly, a review of the record reveals that even without Lee\u2019s mental health records, the defendant was able to take full advantage of numerous other methods of challenging Lee\u2019s credibility. Defense counsel elicited from Lee herself that she had lied to the police, under oath, on at least ten different occasions. The defendant also put into evidence several letters written by Lee that contradicted and, in some instances, explicitly recanted her accusations regarding the defendant\u2019s complicity in the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Additionally, the defendant mounted a serious attack on Lee\u2019s motive for testifying by exposing the fact that, despite being an accessory to these murders and having pleaded guilty to federal drug offenses, Lee was hoping for a minimal amount of jail time as a result of her testimony. The defendant also revealed that Lee was infatuated with Officer Dwayne McBride, one of the investigating Bridgeport police officers, and wanted to convince him that when she was called to testify, she would tell the real \u201ctruth.\u201d Furthermore, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>elicited testimony from Lee that since she had been taken into government custody, she was kept safe, she was receiving good meals, medical treatment and drug rehabilitation, and she was looking forward to a new life.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Finally, even without the use of Lee\u2019s mental health records, the defendant significantly undermined Lee\u2019s credibility concerning her ability to perceive, remember and recall the events in question by highlighting the details of her significant drug habit. In particular, building upon Lee\u2019s testimony during direct examination that she had smoked between $100 and $200 worth of crack per day for a period before and after the murders, the defendant was able to further elicit that while Lee was under the influence of crack, she experienced extreme par anoia.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On the basis of our careful review of the trial court record in the present case, we are persuaded that the state has satisfied its burden of proving that the trial court\u2019s refusal to order disclosure of Lee\u2019s mental health records and permit their use in cross-examination was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state produced substantial evidence that the crimes had been perpetrated as the defendant had planned, physical evidence reasonably corroborated Lee\u2019s testimony, and the defendant was able to undermine Lee\u2019s credibility extensively without the use of the mental health records. Consequently, we conclude that the state has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the disclosure and use of Lee\u2019s mental health records would not \u201chave had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 174; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 129-30, 672 A.2d 899 (1996) (concluding that state had not met its burden of proving harmlessness beyond reasonable doubt because its case rested \u201csolely on the [uncorroborated] testimony of the victim\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Conn. 254 (concluding that trial court\u2019s exclusion of witness\u2019 testimony was harmful error because state conceded that \u201cthe jury . . . would have to credit [the witness\u2019] testimony to convict the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that by conducting two ex parte<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> proceedings with Lee\u2019s attorney, the trial court denied the defendant his rights to: (1) be present at all important stages of trial; (2) have counsel at every critical stage of a criminal proceeding; and (3) have an impartial judge preside at trial. Specifically, the defendant argues that by conducting the ex parte hearings without him or his attorney present, the trial corut violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution. The defendant further argues that events surrounding the ex parte hearings evidenced a bias against the defendant, in violation of canon 3 (a) (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of the Code of Judicial Conduct,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and, therefore, the judge should have recused himself, sua sponte, from further proceedings.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, we nevertheless conclude that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the impropriety was harmless. We therefore conclude that <em>the </em>defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court violated the Code of Judicial Conduct is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, Lee was incarcerated at a federal penal hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. In December, 1999, near Christmas, Lee sent holiday cards, with letters enclosed, to the three Bridgeport police officers who had befriended her during their investigation of the murders of Brown and Clarke. Simultaneously, she sent a card, with a letter enclosed, to her attorney, Richard Reeve, in which she recanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>her accusations against the defendant and Adrian. During transmission, the letters and envelopes were somehow switched, causing the holiday cards and letters addressed to the police officers to be delivered to Reeve, and the recantation letter to be delivered to the Bridgeport police. Once the police officers determined that the letter that they had received had been intended for someone else, they immediately turned the letter over to the Bridgeport state\u2019s attorney, Jonathan Benedict.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Benedict, realizing that the letter contained potentially exculpatory information and that it was most likely an inadvertently disclosed privileged communication, forwarded the letter to the trial court, <em>Thim, J., </em>for an in camera review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c (b).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> After reviewing the letter, Judge Thim concluded that it contained exculpatory information that should be disclosed to the defendant, but suggested that if Benedict disagreed, he should present the issue to Judge Ford, the trial judge assigned to the case. The matter was then referred to Judge Ford for his review.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Early in January, 2000, Judge Ford conducted the first of two<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> ex parte hearings with Reeve in an effort to determine: (1) whether the letter did in fact contain exculpatory information that would require that the state turn the letter over to the defendant; and (2) if the letter did contain exculpatory information, whether such information nevertheless was protected by Lee\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Because the exculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>nature of the letter was apparent from its content, the hearing focused on whether Lee had intended to assert her attorney-client privilege with regard to the letter and, if she did, whether the inadvertent disclosure vitiated the privilege, thereby requiring the court to disclose the letter to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">During this meeting, which was conducted without the knowledge of the defendant or the state, the court discussed with Reeve the letter\u2019s contents, how the letter came into the state\u2019s possession, and the legal ramifications of its disclosure. In particular, the court asked Reeve whether he believed the defendant would be prejudiced by delaying disclosure to the defendant while Reeve discussed the letter with his client, Lee. Both the trial court and Reeve concluded that, under the circumstances, such a delay was warranted and, therefore, the court directed Reeve to travel to Fort Worth, Texas, where Lee was being held in a federal prison, in order to further discuss the matter with her. The court also requested that Reeve file a memorandum with the court detailing the factual and legal basis for Lee\u2019s claim of privilege after Reeve visited her. The court then sealed all of the documents obtained during the ex parte hearing, as well as the transcript of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On February 15,2000, while the parties were selecting the jury, the trial court took a recess from the proceedings and requested that counsel leave the courtroom so that the trial court could speak privately with Reeve. Although the court did not disclose to either the defendant or the state the purpose of the meeting, both attorneys complied without comment. During this second meeting, Reeve submitted a memorandum to the court confirming that the misdirection of Lee\u2019s recantation letter was inadvertent, as well as providing legal argument for not disclosing the letter to the state\u2019s attorney or defense counsel. The court then discussed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Reeve, among other things, the legal issue of whether, in light of the letter, Lee\u2019s deposition would be admissible should Lee be unavailable to testify. It was the court\u2019s opinion that \u201cwhen [Lee\u2019s letters] are offered in the full context the way in which they have been given . . . they [do not] amount to an awful lot . . . [because] [t]hey don\u2019t show anything real[ly] severely] exculpatory.\u201d Reeve agreed, but noted that if Lee were unavailable to testify and the letter to him were disclosed, the defense would want to address on cross-examination the issue of why Lee would lie to her attorney. Reeve stated that, based upon his conversations with Lee, it was his belief that she would respond to any such inquiry by stating that, \u201cas she realized the gravity of what she had done and the legacy she was leaving with and upon her children ... it [was] just too difficult ... to bear. And the question [then became], is there a way for me to get out of this so I don\u2019t leave my children with the shame and the legacy of their mother having been involved in a murder which involved another young child?\u201d Reeve stated, however, that he felt that he had no obligation to disclose Lee\u2019s claim that she had lied under oath to both the court and the other parties because he believed that the present recantation was, in fact, a he in itself. Judge Ford made no comment on this point. At the conclusion of the hearing, the corut instructed court personnel not to reveal what had transpired in the hearing and sealed the record for appehate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Three days after that hearing, on February 18, 2000, the court filed a memorandum of decision disclosing to both the state and defense counsel that on January 5, 2000, the court had conducted a hearing to determine whether the recantation letter to Reeve should be disclosed to the defendant, and that on February 15, 2000, Reeve had reported back to the court, noting that Lee had intended the letter to be a private communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>to her attorney. The court then concluded in its memorandum that the disclosure was inadvertent, that the inadvertent disclosure did not destroy the attorney-client privilege, and, therefore, the letter would remain sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The defendant thereafter filed a motion for an in camera hearing to establish an \u201cappropriate record ... to support [the court\u2019s] decision ... a full record of the facts underlying the invocation of the privilege in this case and to permit the court to explore the exculpatory nature of the information sought by the defendant.\u201d The motion did not challenge, however, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s conducting the previous ex parte proceedings. In a memorandum of decision issued a few days later, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, concluding that \u201cany further inquiry on the part of the defense into the substance of the letter from [Lee] to her attorney would violate her assertion of the attorney-client privilege . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In early April, 2000, the trial court was informed that Lee had decided to waive her attorney-client privilege regarding the letter she had intended to send to Reeve. The court therefore unsealed the letter and made it available to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Lee subsequently testified during the defendant\u2019s juiy trial on May 9 and 10, 2000. On the second day of her testimony, during cross-examination, she read the letter she had written Reeve to the jury and the letter was admitted as a full exhibit in the case. In the letter, Lee stated that she had lied when she had implicated both the defendant and his brother, Adrian, in the murders of Brown and Clarke. On redirect examination, the state asked Lee why she had written the letter. Lee testified: \u201cI was very desperate. I didn\u2019t want to die in jail . . . because the doctor told me I had AIDS.\u201d She stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that she thought that if she told her attorney that she had lied, she would be able to get out of jail and \u201csee [her] kids before [she] die[d].\u201d Lee, however, did not reveal any concern over what type of legacy her involvement in the murders would leave for her children, as Reeve had suggested to the trial judge during the February 15, 2000 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">After this appeal was filed, the transcripts and other documents pertaining to the trial court\u2019s ex parte hearings were released to both the state and the defendant. The defendant then learned for the first time of Reeve\u2019s disclosure to the court that Lee allegedly wrote the recantation letter out of shame and concern over the legacy that she was leaving her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The defendant first contends that the trial court violated his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution by conducting two ex parte proceedings with Lee\u2019s attorney, during which the substance of Lee\u2019s reasons for sending the recantation letter was discussed. Specifically, the defendant argues that by excluding both him and his attorney from the proceedings, the defendant was prevented from discovering, and subsequently utilizing, the reasons for the letter, another ground to impeach Lee, in that such information was disclosed only at these ex parte meetings. The defendant contends that the action by the trial court violated his constitutional right to: (1) be present at any stage of trial where his exclusion would interfere with his opportunity for effective cross-examination; (2) be present at all stages of trial where his presence would contribute to the fairness of the proceedings; and (3) have the presence of counsel at every critical stage of a criminal proceeding. The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial and therefore seeks review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine and the plain error rule.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the issue is reviewable under Golding<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We agree that the issue is reviewable under <em>Golding, </em>but conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>because the alleged constitutional violations were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">At the outset, we briefly review the scope of the defendant\u2019s claims. The defendant is not claiming that his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments were violated because the court failed to inform him that the ex parte proceedings had occurred or to disclose to him the substance of those proceedings. He concedes that the record reflects just the opposite. In mid-February, 2000, only three days after the conclusion of the second and final ex parte proceeding, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision fully disclosing to the parties the fact that it had conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>two ex parte hearings with Reeve. The memorandum further stated that the purpose of the proceedings was to determine whether Lee\u2019s letter recanting her implication of the defendant and Adrian in the murders of Brown and Clarke should be disclosed to the defendant, or whether the letter was protected by Lee\u2019s attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The defendant also is not claiming that his constitutional rights were violated because he was not made privy to Lee\u2019s recantation letter. The defendant concedes that in April, 2000, after learning that Lee had waived her privilege, the court unsealed the letter and made the letter available to defense counsel. The letter subsequently was read by Lee to the jury during cross-examination and became a full exhibit at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">What the defendant does argue is that, by failing to disclose Reeve\u2019s brief reference to an alternate reason for Lee\u2019s recantation letter until after the transcripts of the ex parte proceedings were released following the filing of the present appeal, the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments by depriving him of an alternate ground to impeach Lee. Specifically, the defendant contends that Reeve\u2019s statement that he believed his client wrote the recantation letter because she did not want to \u201cleave [her] children with the shame and the legacy of their mother having been involved in a murder which involved another young child,\u201d was critical to impeaching the state\u2019s key witness in that she gave a different explanation on cross-examination. During cross-examination, Lee testified that the reason she had written the recantation letter was because she \u201cwas very desperate . . . [and] didn\u2019t want to die in jail . . . because the doctor told [her she] had AIDS,\u201d a reason different from the one that she had given her attorney, which he later conveyed to the trial court. The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to allow for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>his or his attorney\u2019s presence during the ex parte hearing, or at a minimum, subsequently disclose this critical impeachment evidence to the defendant, violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Whether the exclusion of the defendant and his counsel from the trial court\u2019s ex parte proceedings violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights is a mixed question of law and fact. Accordingly, our review is plenary. <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 318, 803 A.2d 287 (2002) (\u201c[questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact receive plenary review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In the present case, we need not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims because, even if we were to assume that the defendant\u2019s claims ar e valid, the state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that any impropriety was harmless. A conclusion that a defendant\u2019s sixth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated is subject to harmless error analysis, which will result in a new trial only if the exclusion of the proffered evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967) (\u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 649, 835 A.2d 895 (2003) (where constitutional violation is subject to harmless error analysis, \u201cstate has burden of demonstrating that . . . violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Whether a constitutional violation is harmless in a particular case depends upon the totality of the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>supra, 649. \u201cIf the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In part II C of this opinion, we addressed the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion, in failing to grant the defendant access to portions of Lee\u2019s mental health records, was harmless error. We noted that the state had produced an abundance of evidence that the crime was perpetrated just as the defendant had planned, that the physical evidence reasonably corroborated Lee\u2019s testimony, and that the defendant was able to challenge Lee\u2019s credibility extensively without the use of the mental health records. We therefore concluded that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the inclusion of Lee\u2019s mental health records would not have \u201chad a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; and, consequently, the improper suppression of those records was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Similarly, on the basis of the totality of the evidence produced at trial, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s inability to utilize the alternate ground for impeaching Lee\u2019s testimony concerning the recantation letter\u2014her shame that her children would know that she had been involved in the murder of a child\u2014was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. First, Lee\u2019s motivation in sending the recantation letter provided only marginal additional exculpatory material. Even without this additional impeachment material, the record reflects that the defendant was able to take full advantage of numerous other methods of challenging Lee\u2019s credibility as well as her motive to testify. See part II C of this opinion. Moreover, even if Lee\u2019s testimony had been stricken from the record entirely, the remaining evidence produced by the state would have been sufficient to convict the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we conclude that any misconduct by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant\u2019s claim therefore fails under the fourth prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFp3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court\u2019s two ex parte proceedings with Lee\u2019s attorney evidenced a bias against the defendant and, therefore, the trial judge should have, suasponte, recused himself. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial judge should have recused himself after violating canon 3 (a) (4) (A) of the Code of Judicial Conduct by: (1) failing promptly to disclose to the defendant the substance of the ex parte hearings and allow him reasonable opportunity to respond; and (2) requesting that Reeve perform an independent investigation of the facts of the case when the trial court directed Reeve to travel to Texas to consult with Lee concerning the recantation letter that she had written.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">As a preliminary matter, we begin by addressing the reviewability of the defendant\u2019s claims. The defendant concedes that his claim of judicial impropriety was not properly preserved at trial and therefore he seeks review under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the issue is reviewable under <em>Golding</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> We agree. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit, and thereby fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Whether the trial judge violated the Code of Judicial Conduct by failing to recuse himself, sua sponte, after conducting two ex parte hearings is an issue of law over which our review is plenary. <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>246 Conn. 815, 825, 717 A.2d 1232 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Canon 3 (a) (4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct generally prohibits a presiding judge from initiating, permitting or considering ex parte communications concerning pending or impending proceedings, outside of the presence of the parties. See footnote 46 of this opinion. The canon also contains several explicit exceptions to its general prohibition, one of which provides that \u201c[a] judge may initiate or consider any ex parte communications when <em>expressly authorized by law to do so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Code of Judicial Conduct, canon 3 (a) (4) (E). The ex parte hearings conducted by the trial court in the present case arose under \u00a7 54-86c (b), which expressly provides that \u201c[a]ny state\u2019s attorney, assistant state\u2019s attorney or deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney may request an ex parte in camera hearing before a judge, who shall not be the same judge who presides at the hearing of the criminal case if the case is tried to the court, to determine whether any material or information is exculpatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the present case, the ex parte hearings, which had been requested by the state\u2019s attorney after Lee\u2019s letter had been turned over to the trial court, were authorized by \u00a7 54-86c (b). Therefore, they fall within the expressly enumerated exception in canon 3 (a) (4) (E) for an ex parte proceeding expressly authorized by law. After Judge Thim performed an in camera inspection of the recantation letter, pursuant to \u00a7 54-86c (b), he stated that although it was his opinion that the letter contained exculpatory information, the state also might want to present the issue to Judge Ford, the trial judge, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>additional review. The state did in fact present the issue to Judge Ford for a separate \u00a7 54-86c (b) review. Because the defendant\u2019s case was not tried to the court, it was appropriate for Judge Ford to conduct a separate ex parte hearing concerning the letter. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c (b) (restricting ex parte in camera review of potentially exculpatory information to judge who is not presiding as fact finder).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We acknowledge that the trial court\u2019s inquiry at the ex parte hearings was not limited to whether Lee\u2019s letter contained exculpatory information. The hearings also addressed the issues of whether the letter should remain undisclosed under the attorney-client privilege, and whether that privilege had been waived by the inadvertent disclosure. This broadened scope of the ex parte hearing does not necessarily render the hearings violative of canon 3 (a) (4), however, because, under our common law, ex parte proceedings are authorized to resolve claims of attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We have stated that, \u201c[t]he decision of whether to engage in an [ex parte] in camera review of . . . allegedly privileged information is necessarily one for the trial court.\u201d <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment </em>Corp., 254 Conn. 145, 183, 757 A.2d 14 (2000). Furthermore, we have stated that once it has been established that the privilege applies, \u201cthe trial court has discretion to determine if a waiver of the attorney-client privilege has occurred and the scope of that waiver\u201d; <em>Harp </em>v. King, 266 Conn. 747, 770, 835 A.2d 953 (2003); and \u201cin certain circumstances, [an ex parte in camera review] may be an appropriate means of examining the allegedly privileged material without abrogating the privilege itself. \u201d <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>supra, 182-83; see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>252 Conn. 533, 557, 747 A.2d 487 (2000) (discussing standard that criminal defendant must meet to obtain in camera inspection of witness\u2019 confidential records sought for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>impeachment purposes); <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>251 Conn. 790, 846-49, 742 A.2d 322 (1999) (discussing attorney-client privilege and in camera review in context of medical peer review statute). Such situations occur when there is a \u201crisk of disclosing the privileged material to an adverse party through an examination of the documents themselves . . . .\u201d <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>supra, 182. In the present case, such a risk was evident because at the time of the ex parte hearings, Lee had not yet waived her potential privilege in the recantation letter. Consequently, we conclude that because the ex parte proceedings were expressly authorized by law, they were not conducted in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The defendant further claims that, even if the law expressly permitted the trial court\u2019s inquiry into whether Lee\u2019s letter was exculpatory, and whether that letter nonetheless was protected by the attorney-client privilege, the court did not limit its inquiry to these two subjects. Rather, the defendant argues, the trial court also addressed the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> would overcome the attorney-client privilege, which was outside the court\u2019s express legal authority, and therefore violative of canon 3 (a) (4) (E). The state responds that, although it does not dispute the contention that the defendant should have been included in the court\u2019s discussion of this ancillary topic, the defendant\u2019s claim was rendered moot once Lee waived her privilege in the letter. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u201c[M]ootness implicates the jurisdiction of the court. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... In the absence of an actual and existing controversy for us to adjudicate . . . the courts of this state may not be used as a vehicle to obtain judicial opinions upon points of law . . . and where the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Green Rock Ridge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kobernat, </em>250 Conn. 488, 497, 736 A.2d 851 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In the present case, prior to the commencement of trial, Lee waived her attorney-client privilege regarding the recantation letter. The trial court therefore unsealed the letter and made it available to defense counsel, who had the letter admitted as a full exhibit at trial. Consequently, any claim of impropriety concerning the court\u2019s discussion with Reeve about the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was rendered moot when the letter was fully disclosed to the defendant prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">STATE\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">At a separate penalty phase hearing with regard to the two capital felonies for which the defendant was convicted, the same jury that convicted the defendant considered evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors as provided in \u00a7 53a-46a.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> After several days of deliberation following the admission of that evidence, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to either of the offenses. The state moved for a mistrial, but its motion was denied. The trial court thereafter merged the two counts and rendered judgment impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release. The state then moved for permission to appeal, which was also denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The state now challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of (1) the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and (2) the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The state argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the state permission to appeal, after concluding, among other things, that a deadlocked jury can reach a lawful verdict. The state further argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial after improperly instructing the jury that if it remained deadlocked, the trial court would be required to impose a sentence of life imprisonment \u201cwithout the benefit of release.\u201d Such an improper instruction, the state argues, was not only based upon an unsound legal premise, but tainted the jury deliberations by: (1) leading the jury to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or put to death did not rest solely in its discretion; and (2) increasing the likelihood that the jury would remain deadlocked. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The state first claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the state permission to appeal from the denial of its motion for mistrial. Specifically, the state argues that in denying it permission to appeal, the trial court misconstrued the law of unanimity in the context of a capital felony penalty hearing, and by doing so, improperly concluded that the jury in the present case reached a lawful verdict. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this issue. After the defendant\u2019s conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>two counts of capital felony, the trial court conducted a penalty hearing before the same jury that had heard the guilt phase of the proceedings. Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a, the jury was to determine whether the imposition of the death penalty was warranted by making findings concerning aggravating and mitigating factors. While deliberating, the jury repeatedly informed the trial court that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. Despite several reinstructions by the court, which included a \u201cChip Smith\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> instruction, the jury remained deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The trial court then submitted to the jury a revised verdict form that allowed the jury to indicate that it unanimously agreed that it could not unanimously agree as to certain findings regarding aggravating and mitigating factors. Neither the defendant nor the state objected to the submission of the revised form to the jury. The jury then resumed deliberations and subsequently filled out the verdict form to indicate as follows: On the capital felony count concerning Brown\u2019s murder, \u201c[w]e the jury unanimously agree that we are unable to unanimously agree that one or more of the proved aggravating factors outweighs one or more of the proved nonstatutory mitigating factors\u201d; and, as to the capital felony count directed to the double homicide of Brown and Clarke, \u201c[w]e the jury unanimously agree that the [s]tate . . . has failed to prove one or more statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">After receipt of the revised special verdict form indicating that the jury unanimously agreed that it could not unanimously agree, the trial court ordered the verdict accepted and recorded. The state then orally moved for a mistrial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-45.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>state argued, among other things, that the jury\u2019s response to the revised verdict form merely confirmed that it could not unanimously agree, and therefore, a valid verdict had not been reached because \u201cno finding of fact [had] been made by the jury.\u201d The court, however, denied the state\u2019s motion. The state subsequently moved for permission to appeal, which request also was ultimately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Thereafter, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision articulating its rationale for denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal from the denial of its motion for a mistrial.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In its memorandum, the court reasoned that the jury\u2019s finding that it unanimously agreed that it could not unanimously agree constituted a valid verdict that indicated that \u201cthe state [had] failed to sustain its burden of proof.\u201d The court further concluded that the jury\u2019s verdict indicated that the state was unable to overcome any mitigating factor found by the jury and the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal, therefore, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the appropriate standard of review that guides our resolution of this issue. \u201cAs a general proposition ... \u00a7 54-96 authorizes the state to appeal questions of law in a criminal case only if the trial court grants permission to appeal. Section 54-96, however, does not preclude an appeal by the state when the denial was so arbitrary as to constitute an extreme abuse of discretion rendering the denial ineffective. In such cases the statute\u2019s condition requiring the court\u2019s permission to appeal cannot serve to insulate a trial court from review by this court; rather, the statute as a whole remains operative to allow appeal by the state. . . . Although we accord great deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to the trial court\u2019s discretionary rulings on these matters, that does not mean that its decision is shielded from our scrutiny. . . . Section 54-96 does not deprive this court of jurisdiction simply because the trial court gave considered reasons when it denied the state permission to appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 660-61, 574 A.2d 164 (1990). \u201cConfidence in our judicial system would be severely eroded if the trial court had the authority to dismiss [the penalty phase] against [a] defendant ... on an unsound premise, and could then insulate its decision from appellate review.\u201d Id., 662-63. Consequently, this court will review a trial court\u2019s decision denying the state an appeal and will not uphold the denial if \u201cthe record manifests a \u2018clear and extreme abuse of discretion\u2019 or [if] \u2018injustice appears to have been done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>supra, 660-61; <em>State v.

Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).

The <em>Lozada </em>inquiry was established in order to determine whether a petitioner has made the requisite substantial showing of the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of a federal right for the issuance of the required certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of federal habeas relief .... In Lozada, the United States Supreme Court held that the required substantial showing was made if the petitioner [1] demonstrate [s] that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; [2] that a court could resolve the issues in a different maimer; or [3] that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. ... In the federal courts, the probable cause certificate serves the same policy goal as the granting of permission for certification to appeal does in Connecticut, namely, to screen out frivolous appeals while still protecting the litigants\u2019 statutory right to appellate review of adverse determinations. . . . [Consequently], we held that the <em>Lozada </em>criteria was appropriate in evaluating an abuse of discretion in which the state sought permission to appeal under . . . \u00a7 54-96. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, [405-10]. Thus, [we have made] clear that when a petitioner presents an issue on appeal that satisfies any one of the <em>Lozada </em>criteria, that petitioner ought to have that issue considered on appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>267 Conn. 414, 430-31, 838 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 809, 125 S.

Ed. 2d 12 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the state has met its burden of satisfying at least one of the <em>Lozada </em>criteria, namely, that the issue is adequate to \u201cdeserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 430. This court\u2019s resolution of issues challenging the general requirement of jury unanimity has long been regarded as fundamental to maintaining the consistency and reliability of the judicial system as a whole, and the ultimate verdict in a criminal trial in particular. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 580, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>223 Conn. 384, 388, 614 A.2d 401 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 972, 113 S.

In <em>Daniels, </em>this court noted that \u201cwe perceive a special need for jury unanimity in capital sentencing. Under ordinary circumstances, the requirement of unanimity induces a jury to deliberate thoroughly and helps to assure the reliability of the ultimate verdict. . . . The heightened reliability demanded by the [e]ighth [a]mendment in the determination whether the death penalty is appropriate . . . convinces us that jury unanimity is an especially important safeguard at a capital sentencing hearing.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The issue in the present case, namely, whether in denying the state permission to appeal, the trial court misconstrued the law of unanimity in the context of a capital felony penalty hearing, and by doing so, improperly concluded that the jury reached a valid verdict, plainly fits this category. Moreover, the fact that this court has not had an opportunity previously to address this specific issue renders it even more worthy of review. Consequently, we conclude that the issue presented by the state \u201cdeserve[d] encouragement to proceed further\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 432; and therefore the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The state\u2019s second, and principal, claim on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial after improperly instructing the jury that if it remained deadlocked, the trial court would be required to impose a sentence of life imprisonment \u201cwithout the benefit of release.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Specifically, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s improper instruction was not only based upon an unsound legal premise, but tainted the subsequent jury deliberations by: (1) leading the jury to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or put to death did not rest solely in the jury\u2019s discretion; and (2) increasing the likelihood that the jury would remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>deadlocked, thereby denying the state its right to fair and thorough deliberations by a jury attempting to reach a unanimous verdict. Therefore, the state argues, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state\u2019s subsequent motion for a mistrial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history inform our resolution of this issue. On the third day of deliberations in the penalty phase of the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury sent to the court a note in reference to the questions on the verdict form dealing with the murder of Brown. The jury requested instructions on how to proceed if it was unable to agree on whether the non-statutory mitigating factor or factors outweighed the aggravating factor or factors. Commenting on the note outside the jury\u2019s presence, the trial court told the parties that the jury must \u201cstrive to reach a unanimous verdict. If they become deadlocked on [the issue of weighing] . . . I\u2019ll impose life without the benefit of release.\u201d In response, the state argued that if the jury was deadlocked on this issue, the court would have to declare a mistrial rather than sentence the defendant to life in prison. The trial court, however, disagreed stating: \u201c[I]f it\u2019s deadlock, it means that you haven\u2019t met your burden,\u201d and \u201cthe defendant would get the benefit of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The jurors were then recalled to the courtroom and the court reinstructed them on the possible verdicts. The court reiterated that at each point in its deliberations, the jury must be unanimous. Specifically, the court stated that the jury had to agree unanimously that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors for death to be imposed, or in the alternative, it had to agree unanimously that mitigating factors either outweighed or were in equipoise with aggravating factors for a life sentence to be imposed. The trial court concluded its substantive re-instruction by stating: \u201cIf you continue to deliberate on this issue and at the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>analysis you axe not able to agree, then you report that, and in that event your deliberations would cease and by your action <em>I would be required to impose a sentence of life without the benefit of release.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The jury was then excused to continue its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Later that day, the jury sent a second note to the court stating that, with regard to the murder of Brown, it still was deadlocked on the issue of whether the nonstatutory mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors. In response, the trial court instructed the jury to put the issue aside and to move on to the questions on the verdict form dealing with the double murder of Brown and Clarke. The court implored the jurors to strive to answer the remaining questions. The court then repeated to the jury the action the court would take if the jury were to become deadlocked on the second issue: \u201cI\u2019ve already told you, <em>if you cannot agree, then I will impose a sentence which is in accord with the inability of the state to satisfy the burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt in respect to the aggravating factor and your consideration of the mitigating factor. So there\u2019s no puzzle.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The state again indicated to the court that it disagreed with the court\u2019s proposed disposition. The state argued that the jury\u2019s notes merely indicated that it was deadlocked and, therefore, imposing a life sentence would be improper. The court adhered to its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Shortly thereafter, the jurors sent a third note to the court indicating that they also were deadlocked on the issue of whether the state had proven an aggravating factor pertaining to the double homicide. The trial court indicated to the parties that it would respond to the note by giving a \u201cChip Smith\u201d instruction to the jury in an effort to nudge the jury toward unanimity. When the state inquired as to how the court interpreted the jury\u2019s deadlock on the aggravating factors pertaining to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>double homicide, the court again stated, \u201c[i]f they can\u2019t agree, they haven\u2019t\u2014the state hasn\u2019t met its burden; simple as that.\u201d The court then called the jury back in and proceeded by giving the \u201cChip Smith\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Later that same afternoon, the jury sent a fourth, and final, note to the court stating: \u201cWe still have a problem with the word unanimous .... Some of us feel the state has proven one or more statutory aggravating factors and some of us feel the state has failed to prove one or more statutoiy aggravating factors.\u201d In response, the court provided the jury with an \u201cOfficial Revised\u201d version of the verdict form which permitted the jurors to \u201cunanimously agree that [they] are unable to unanimously agree\u201d on both counts of capital felony. All twelve jurors chose this new option for both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Immediately after the jury announced that it had agreed to disagree, the trial court ordered the verdict accepted and recorded. The state then orally moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-45, for a mistrial. The state\u2019s motion, however, was denied by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">We begin our analysis by setting forth our standard of review. \u201cThe principles that govern our review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial are well established. Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for a [mistrial] must take into account the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided. . . . Thus, [a] motion for a [mistrial] is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and is not to be granted except on substantial grounds. . . . In our review of the denial of a motion for mistrial, we have recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial. The decision of the trial court is therefore reversible on appeal only if there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>262 Conn. 825, 842, 817 A.2d 670 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In reviewing a claim of abuse of discretion, we have stated that \u201c[discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 29, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). In general, abuse of discretion exists when a court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or has decided it based on improper or irrelevant factors. See id. Therefore, \u201c[i]n those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 174 Conn. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The state first contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction that, if the jury remained deadlocked, the court would be required to sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, was improper. Specifically, the state argues that the instruction was based upon the unsound legal premise that, under Connecticut law, during the penalty phase of a capital case a deadlocked jury necessarily signifies that the trial court must sentence the defendant to life imprisonment because the state has failed to sustain its burden of proof. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201cIt is settled doctrine in Connecticut that a valid jury verdict in a criminal case must be unanimous. ... A nonunanimous jury therefore cannot render any finding of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 388. Indeed, where a jury is deadlocked, a court cannot rightfully record a verdict \u201cbecause [as a matter of law] no such verdict can be found to have existed . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Conn. App. 438, 448, 646 A.2d 879, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 940, 653 A.2d 824 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 394 (concluding that deadlocked jury in penalty phase of capital case makes no finding of whether death or life imprisonment is warranted). Rather, it is axiomatic that a deadlocked jury makes no lawfully cognizable finding, thereby requiring no specific action by the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 580; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>supra, 388; <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">This court addressed a similar issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 394, wherein the court concluded that under our death penalty statute, a deadlocked jury in the penalty phase of a capital trial \u201cneither authorizes imposition of the death penalty nor requires the imposition of a life sentence.\u201d The court stated that, \u201c[b]ecause the record in this case reveals an unchallenged finding that an aggravating factor exists, but no unanimous finding that the defendant has proved that a mitigating factor exists, the defendant was not entitled as a matter of law to a sentence of life imprisonment . . . .\u201d Id., 393. Under Connecticut law, therefore, we concluded that a deadlocked jury authorizes neither a life sentence nor the death penalty. Id., 394.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We therefore determine that the jury instruction in the present case that the trial court would be required to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release if the jury remained deadlocked was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The state further contends that this improper instruction tainted the jury\u2019s subsequent deliberations. We agree.

Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). \u201c[T]he task . . . of determining whether a specific human being should die at the hands of the [s]tate . . . necessarily calls upon the intellectual, moral and emotional resources of the jurors in a way that far exceeds any factual determination of guilt or innocence. It requires the jury to make a reasoned moral and individualized determination regarding the imposition of the death penalty. . . .

Id., 324-26. The Supreme Court vacated the defendant\u2019s death sentence, reasoning that, \u201cunder the [e]ighth [a]mendment the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination. . . . Accordingly, many of the limits that this [cjourt has placed on the imposition of capital punishment are rooted in a concern that the sentencing process should facilitate the responsible and reliable exercise of sentencing discretion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u201cIn evaluating the various procedures developed by [sjtates to determine the appropriateness of death, this [c]ourt\u2019s [e]ighth [a]mendment jurisprudence has taken as a given that capital sentencers would view their task as the serious one of determining whether a specific human being should die at the hands of the [sjtate. Thus, as long ago as . . . <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>402 U.S. 183 [91 S. Ct. 1454, 28 L. Ed. 2d 711] (1971), [the court has assumed] . . . that jurors confronted with the truly awesome responsibility of decreeing death for a fellow human will act with due regard for the consequences of their decision .... Belief in the truth of the assumption that sentencers treat their power to determine the appropriateness of death as an awesome responsibility has allowed this [c]ourt to view sentencer discretion as consistent with\u2014and indeed as indispensable to\u2014the [e]ighth [a]mendment\u2019s need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case. <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>[428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S.

The trial court instructed the jury that if it remained deadlocked, \u201c[the court] <em>would be required to impose a sentence of life without the benefit of release . . . which is in accord with the inability of the state to satisfy the burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt in respect to the aggravating factor and your consideration of the mitigating factor.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)

On the basis of the explicit content of this instruction, therefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, as a whole, <em>\u201cclearly and unequivocally </em>explained] to the jury that <em>it is solely responsible </em>for determining whether the defendant will receive the death penalty or, instead, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release,\u201d as required by the eighth amendment. (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The trial court\u2019s instructions further tainted the jury\u2019s deliberations by reinforcing the likelihood of deadlock, thereby denying the state its right to fair and thorough deliberations by a jury attempting to reach a unanimous result. It is unquestionable that a defendant has a substantial liberty interest at stake in any criminal trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 578-79. \u201cThat does not mean, however, that the defendant\u2019s liberty interest is the only substantial interest at stake .... The state also has a substantial interest, namely, its interest in securing a [determination of the imposition of the death penalty]\u201d through the jury\u2019s thoughtful deliberation to a unanimous verdict. Id., 579; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>257 Conn. 653, 658, 778 A.2d 134 (2001) (recognizing \u201cthe state\u2019s right to seek a judgment against the defendant\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>247 Conn. 662, 674, 725 A.2d 316 (1999) (\u201c[t]he [state], like the defendant, is entitled to resolution of the case by verdict from the jury\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). A jury instruction that implies that a jury need not deliberate to a unanimous decision \u201cneglects the state\u2019s interest in the resolution of the charges on which it presented the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 578. Indeed, \u201c[a jury] should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>not be given an instruction that could encourage it to give the [penalty phase deliberations] short shrift .... Anything less [than a unanimous completion of the difficult task] dilutes the right of the state and the defendant to have the jury give its undivided attention and most serious deliberations to the [penalty phase proceedings] and flies in the face of the unanimity requirement of <em>Aparo </em>and <em>Daniels.\u201d </em>Id., 583. Jury instructions must reflect the \u201ccommitment that justice be done to both the state and the defendant, and that the [penalty phase disposition] be thoroughly deliberated, considered and disposed of definitively.\u201d Id., 578; <em>State </em>v. <em>Salgado, </em>257 Conn. 394, 405, 778 A.2d 24 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In the present case, after the jury reported being deadlocked, the trial court instructed the jury that, if it remained deadlocked, the trial court would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release. This instruction was reasonably likely to have influenced those jurors who, at that point in the deliberations, were inclined to vote against the imposition of the death penalty, to resist further deliberations aimed at reaching a unanimous verdict. In other words, those jurors who favored sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment improperly were informed by the court that they could ensure a sentence of life imprisonment simply by refusing to deliberate further, in which event the court would impose a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">After improperly instructing the jury as to the sentence that it would be required to impose if the jury were to remain deadlocked, the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion for mistrial. The trial court\u2019s instruction in the present case impermissibly led the jury to believe that it was not solely responsible for determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant. Moreover, the improper instruction increased the likelihood that the jury would remain deadlocked, as it did, in violation of the state\u2019s right to fair and thorough deliberations by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>a jury attempting to reach a unanimous verdict. We conclude that the denial of the motion for a mistrial was a manifest abuse of discretion and rendered an injustice to the state because it improperly barred the state from pursuing a second penalty hearing before a properly charged and motivated jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 674 (state has strong interest \u201cin fair trials designed to end in just judgments\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 174 Conn. 111 (\u201c[i]n those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">DEFENDANT\u2019S ALTERNATE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In response to the state\u2019s claims, the defendant presents four alternate grounds to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s sentence should be upheld because: (1) \u00a7 53a-46a (b)<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> does not permit a trial court to impanel a new jury after the original jury becomes deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital case; (2) principles of accessorial liability cannot be used to prove the existence of aggravating factors, and therefore the state presented insufficient evidence to prove any aggravating factors necessary for the imposition of the death penalty; (3) the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the particularized mental state required by each aggravating factor; and (4) <em>Pinkerton </em>liability cannot be used to prove the existence of aggravating factors, and therefore the state presented insufficient evidence to prove any aggravating factors. We disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>with each of the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and the subsequent imposition of a life sentence, was proper because \u00a7 53a-46a (b) does not permit a trial court to impanel a new jury after the original jury becomes deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital case. Specifically, the defendant argues that, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 53a-46a (b), a trial court may impanel a new jury for a second sentencing hearing only upon a showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d and the fact that a jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the appropriate punishment cannot be considered \u201cgood cause\u201d when interpreted in relation to similar statutes. Consequently, the defendant argues, because \u00a7 53a-46a (b) bars the impanelment of a new jury for a second sentencing hearing in the case of a deadlocked jury, and because the declaration of a mistrial by the court would have allowed for such an impaneling, the trial court properly denied the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial and subsequently imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The question of whether \u00a7 53a-46a (b) prohibits the impaneling of a new jury after the original jury becomes deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital case is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 546-47, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Therefore, our analysis begins with the text of \u00a7 53a-46a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Section 53a-46a (b) provides in relevant part that a penalty hearing shall be conducted \u201c(1) before the jury which determined the defendant\u2019s guilt, or (2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of such hearing . . . (C) if the jury which determined the defendant\u2019s guilt has been discharged by the court for <em>good cause </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the statute, and the Penal Code in general,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> fail to define \u201cgood cause,\u201d this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), had occasion to define the phrase in reference to \u00a7 53a-46a (b). In <em>Webb, </em>the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the general requirement of \u00a7 53a-46a (b) that the same jury determine both the guilt and penalty phases for a defendant in a capital case, arguing that a jury\u2019s determination of guilt creates a bias sufficient to prevent the jury from determining the penalty phase issues fairly and impartially. Id., 464-65 and n.52. In upholding the constitutionality of the statute, this court concluded, among other things, that even if the defendant were able to establish that the jury was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>biased, the statute provides a mechanism to address such a situation in that it specifically allows a trial court to impanel a new jury for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Id., 469 n.57. This court then equated \u201cgood cause\u201d in the context of \u00a7 53a-46a (b) with a conclusion by the trial court \u201cthat the jury cannot fairly perform its penalty phase duties.\u201d Id. On the basis of the definition espoused in <em>Webb, </em>and because it is manifest under Connecticut penal law that jurors are required to be unanimous in their verdicts,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> it cannot be said that the fact that a jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict does not constitute good cause pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (b). The fact that a jury is deadlocked undoubtedly indicates that the jury \u201ccannot fairly perform its penalty phase duties\u201d; id.; thereby necessitating the impaneling of a second jury rather than the imposition of a life sentence. See, e.g., <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>201 Conn. 675, 681 n.5, 519 A.2d 35 (1986) (noting that deadlocked jury constitutes quintessential rationale for manifest necessity in declaring mistrial).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Our conclusion finds further support in our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 374. In <em>Daniels, </em>both the defendant and the state challenged the trial court\u2019s sentencing of the defendant to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for capital felony and murder after the jury unanimously found the existence of an aggravating factor, but was unable to agree unanimously on the existence of a mitigating factor. Id., 378. The state argued that \u00a7 53a-46a required that \u201conce it has established the existence of an aggravating factor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>a defendant can escape the death penalty only by persuading the trier of fact that a mitigating factor exists.\u201d Id., 386. The defendant, however, argued a diametrically opposite construction of the statute, claiming that \u201cthe statute does not authorize the imposition of a death sentence unless there has been an unconditional and unanimous finding by the trier of fact that no mitigating factors exist within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-46a (e).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In upholding the judgment of the trial court, this court concluded that contrary to the arguments of both the state and the defendant, \u00a7 53a-46a does not mandate a specific outcome for death penalty cases in which the trier of fact cannot come to a unanimous decision on the imposition of the death penalty. Id., 394. The court reasoned that, \u201c[i]n such circumstances, the statute neither authorizes imposition of the death penalty nor requires the imposition of a life sentence.\u201d Id. Rather, the court stated that the trial court could elect from among three options, one of which was to declare a mistrial, impanel a new jury and retry the penalty phase. Id., 394-96. Accordingly, under this court\u2019s construction of the statute in <em>Daniels, </em>it is apparent that \u00a7 53a-46a (b) does not preclude a trial court from declaring a mistrial and subsequently impaneling a new jury for a retrial when the jury is deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital case.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Furthermore, the legislature\u2019s failure to amend \u00a7 53a-46a after our decision in <em>Daniels, </em>leads us to presume that the legislature agreed with our interpretation of the statute in that case. We have noted that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201clegislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation . . . we . . . presume that the legislature is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. . . . Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 855, 874, 792 A.2d 774 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>Daniels, </em>where this court concluded that \u00a7 53a-46a mandates the imposition of neither a life nor death sentence in the event of a deadlocked jury, but, rather, permits a trial court, among other things, to declare a mistrial, and subsequently impanel a new jury for a retrial of the penalty phase, the court \u201cfreely acknowledge^] that [its] construction of \u00a7 53a-46a places Connecticut alongside a very small minority of jurisdictions with regard to the proper procedure to be followed when the jury cannot unanimously agree. The majority of states have statutorily provided for an automatic sentence of less than death in the event of a deadlocked jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 393. The court then invited the legislature to address the issue if it disagreed: \u201cWhether our decision . . . calls for corrective action is a matter that only the legislature can decide.\u201d Id., 394. Despite numerous substantive changes to Connecticut\u2019s capital sentencing scheme since the <em>Daniels </em>decision, the legislature has failed to act on this court\u2019s invitation.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Accordingly, based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>legislature\u2019s failure to act, it is reasonable for this court to conclude that the legislature agreed with the <em>Daniels </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The defendant attempts to overcome <em>Webb </em>and <em>Daniels </em>by relying on the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 380-81, 119 S. Ct. 2090, 144 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999), in which the court concluded that the phrase \u201c \u2018good cause,\u2019 \u201d within the federal death penalty statute; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593;<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> does not include impaneling a second sentencing jury in the event of a deadlock. The defendant claims that because \u201c[18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593] and\u00a7 53a-46a have the same lineage<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and have virtually the same language setting forth when the jury that determined guilt can be discharged and a new jury impaneled for a penalty retrial,\u201d they should be interpreted similarly. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 381, the court held that, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018good cause\u2019 in \u00a7 3593 (b) (2) (C) plainly encompasses events such as juror disqualification, but cannot be read so expansively as to include the jury\u2019s failure to reach a unanimous deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>sion.\u201d In doing so, the court referenced a corresponding section of the death penalty statute which provides: \u201cUpon a recommendation under section 3593 (e) that the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of release, the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly. <em>Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser sentence that is authorized by law. Notwithstanding any other law, if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense is life imprisonment, the court may impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of </em>release.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3594. The text of the statute that we have italicized prompted the court to conclude that the term \u201c \u2018[o]therwise\u2019 \u201d meant that, without unanimity, the sentencing determination passes to the court, which may impose a sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 380-81. Despite the defendant\u2019s contention in the present case, such language is clearly absent from Connecticut\u2019s death penalty statute. Consequently, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593 and \u00a7 53a-46a are not analogous and should not be interpreted as such, and we therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Jones </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court\u2019s judgment sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment should be upheld because principles of accessorial liability cannot be used to prove the existence of aggravating factors, and the state therefore presented insufficient evidence to prove any aggravating factors needed for the imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>support this claim, the defendant argues that: (1) the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> indicates that principles of accessorial liability cannot be used to prove aggravating factors; (2) the plain language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i)<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> indicates that principles of accessorial liability do not apply to aggravating factors; and (3) the use of accessorial liability to prove an aggravating factor violates the eighth<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this issue. The state relied upon four aggravating factors, in accordance with \u00a7 53a-46a (i), in seeking the death penalty for the murder of Brown. These were: (1) in the course of Brown\u2019s murder, Clarke was placed at a grave risk of death; (2) the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner; (3) the defendant paid Lee with cocaine to help commit the crime; and (4) the defendant paid money to Gamer, the person who drove Adrian to and from the murder scene, to help commit the crime. With respect to the second count of capital felony, i.e., the double homicide of Brown and Clarke, the state alleged three aggravating factors, the same as those alleged for Brown\u2019s murder, with the exception of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">At the beginning of the penalty hearing, the defendant moved to strike each aggravating factor. He argued that: (1) nothing in Connecticut\u2019s death penalty statutory framework allows principles of vicarious liability to be used to prove aggravating factors; (2) the state failed to produce evidence that the defendant instructed Adrian on how the murders were to be carried out, and therefore he did not know that they would be committed in a heinous, cruel or depraved manner; and (3) under the eighth amendment to the United States constitution, the defendant cannot be sentenced to death for the acts of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>After listening to the parties\u2019 arguments and thoroughly reviewing the briefs they submitted, the trial court denied the motion to strike, concluding that under Connecticut law, both a coconspirator and an accessoiy \u201cmay be charged and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d In addition, citing <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>481 U.S. 137, 158, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 95 L. Ed. 2d 127 (1987), the trial court stated that the United States Supreme Court has held that the eighth amendment does not prevent the death penalty from being imposed vicariously if there is evidence of major participation by the defendant combined with reckless indifference to human life. Therefore, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe aggravating factors alleged by the state may be applied vicariously because the defendant was a major participant in the planning of the offense . . . and had knowledge of the manner in which the killings were to be completed,\u201d and, consequently it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The defendant first argues that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-8 indicates that principles of accessorial liability cannot be used to prove aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a capital case. The defendant contends that because \u00a7 53a-8 limits its application to an \u201coffense,\u201d which is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a) as any \u201ccrime or violation,\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> the use of accessorial liability to prove aggravating factors is necessarily precluded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth our applicable standard of review. The question of whether principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of accessorial liability can be used to prove aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a capital case is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 546-47. As we previously noted herein, \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes,\u201d and only \u201c[if] the meaning of such text is . . . [ambiguous can] extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute ... be considered.\u201d Public Act 03-154, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u201cWhen the statute in question is one of a criminal nature, [however] we are guided by additional tenets of statutory construction. First, it is axiomatic that we must refrain from imposing criminal liability where the legislature has not expressly so intended. <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 268-69, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989). Second, [c]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 340, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995). Finally, unless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are to be strictly construed against the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>[supra, 230 Conn. 200].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 788-89, 772 A.2d 559 (2001). It is, however, equally understood that despite the nature of the statute, it \u201cmust be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>237 Conn. 613, 621, 678 A.2d 473 (1996). In other words, \u201c[n]o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase ... [so that] no word [or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>phrase] in a statute is to be treated as superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771-72, 695 A.2d 525 (1997); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 346, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 274, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">With these standards in mind, we begin by examining the text of \u00a7 53a-8. The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a). By its express terms, the statute provides that a person may be <em>prosecuted and punished </em>as the principal without actually committing the offense himself. The defendant\u2019s interpretation, however, would have this court focus solely upon the use of accessorial liability to <em>prosecute </em>a defendant as if he were a principal, and ignore the statute\u2019s mandate that an accessory shall also be <em>punished </em>as if he were the principal. Our well established rules of statutory construction prohibit us from interpreting a statute in such a way as to ignore some of the express wording enacted by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s proffered interpretation would vitiate one of the clearly stated, overarching purposes of the statute, i.e., the <em>punishment </em>of a person as if he were the principal, when, with the requisite mental state, he solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids the person who physically committed the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 792 (\u201c[t]he accomplice liability statute permits an accessory to be \u2018prosecuted and <em>punished </em>as if he were the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>offender\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]). It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that, \u201c[i]nsofar as the language of the statute will permit, we interpret it in accordance with the purpose of the statute, because legislation is a purposive act.\u201d <em>Cislo </em>v. Shelton, 240 Conn. 590, 598, 692 A.2d 1255 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Taiton, </em>209 Conn. 133, 141, 547 A.2d 543 (1988) (basic tenet of statutory construction that \u201cthe legislature acted to accomplish some purpose\u201d and statutes must be interpreted accordingly [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980) (\u201cfundamental principle of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry out the intent of the legislature\u201d). The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-8 (a), however, would vitiate its overarching purpose in contravention of this fundamental principle of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">This court has addressed a similar issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 792, where we concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that [a statute] is a sentence enhancement provision rather than a separate and distinct offense ... is of no consequence to [whether \u00a7 53a-8 applies].\u201d (Citation omitted.) In <em>Davis, </em>the defendant claimed that General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> which provides for an enhanced sentence for any person who commits any class A, B or C felony with the use of a firearm, could not be applied to him through the application of principles of accessorial liability. Id., 787. Specifically, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe plain language and legislative history of \u00a7 53-202k demonstrate the legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>intent that the statute apply only to an individual who actually uses a firearm during the commission of a felony.\u201d Id. In upholding the trial court\u2019s application of \u00a7 53a-8 to \u00a7 53-202k, we reasoned that, \u201c[t]he accomplice liability statute permits an accessory to be prosecuted and <em>punished </em>as if he were the principal offender. . . . Thus once convicted of [the substantive offense], even if as an accessoiy, the defendant is legally indistinguishable from the principal actor. Accordingly, the defendant is subject to the enhancement penalty that the principal also would have received had he been caught and convicted.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Similar to the statute at issue in <em>Davis, </em>\u00a7 53a-46a is analogous to a sentence enhancement statute. See generally <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002); <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). The statute sets forth the procedure for the enhancement of a defendant\u2019s penalty for a capital felony conviction from life imprisonment without the possibility of release to death through jury findings based on the state having proven certain aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (f) and (i).<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the interpretation offered by the defendant in this case runs counter to this court\u2019s precedent, would ignore the explicit wording of the statute, and would frustrate clear legislative intent. Accordingly, we decline to read \u00a7 53a-8 to preclude its application to aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Similarly, the defendant also argues that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) indicates that principles of accessory liability do not apply to aggravating factors. Specifically, the defendant contends that because all but one of the aggravating factors set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) state that they apply when \u201c[t]he <em>defendant </em>committed the offense\u201d; (emphasis added); such language necessarily precludes their proof through principles of accessorial liability.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The text of the revision of the statute in effect at the time of the commission of the offenses in the present case provides in relevant part: \u201cThe aggravating factors to be considered shall be limited to the following . . . (3) the defendant committed the offense and in such commission knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense; or (4) the defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner; or (5) the defendant procured the commission of the offense by payment, or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i). The defendant equates the statute\u2019s express use of the phrase \u201cthe defendant\u201d and its failure to make an express reference to accomplices, with an affirmative decision by the legislature that \u00a7 53a-46a (i) applies only to principals. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u201cIn making such an assertion, the defendant attempts to draw a distinction between principal and accessorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>liability. Such a differentiation, however, misconstrues the nature of accessorial liability. This court has long since abandoned any practical distinction between the terms accessory and principal for the purpose of determining criminal liability. . . . The defendant is incorrect . . . when he argues that his liability turns on whether he was found to be a principal or an accessory. Those labels are hollow .... Instead, [tjhe modem approach is to abandon completely the old common law terminology and simply provide that a person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of the other person in the commission of the crime. . . . The legislature adopted this view and expressed it in ... \u00a7 53a-8 (a). Accordingly, accessorial liability is not a distinct crime, but only an alternative means by which a substantive crime may be committed ....</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u201cThis principle is apparent throughout our state\u2019s criminal statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), for example, provides that [a] person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person .... The fact that our murder statute prohibits specified criminal conduct of the principal actor, without ever expressly including accomplices, does not preclude its application to accomplices. Although, by its terms, our murder statute encompasses only the principal actor, it undoubtedly applies to all participants in the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>253 Conn. 354, 358, 752 A.2d 40 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 622, 725 A.2d 306 (1999). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u201c[Additionally] [b]ecause the legislature is presumed to know the state of the law when it enacts a statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 201, 506 A.2d 118 (1986); we can assume that, absent an affirmative statement to the contrary, it did not intend to change the existing law to create a distinction between accessories and principals when it enacted [\u00a7 53a-46a(i)]. . . . Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the legislature intended to deviate from our usual practice of treating accessories and principals alike, it easily could have expressed this intent. ... In the absence of specific language to that effect, we refuse to adopt an inteipretation of [the statute] that would require courts to retreat to the days of determining which actors should be identified as principals and which should be identified as accomplices.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 789-91. We therefore decline to inteipret the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) as precluding the establishment of aggravating factors through the application of principles of accessorial liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the use of accessorial liability to prove an aggravating factor violates the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. Specifically, the defendant contends that using accessorial liability to prove an aggravating factor would violate the eighth amendment by: (1) depriving the defendant of the constitutionally required individualized consideration of the appropriate punishment for him; and (2) defining a class of death-eligible defendants in a manner unrelated to their individual moral blameworthiness, thereby making death a disproportionate punishment.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The eighth amendment to the United States constitution provides that \u201c[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d In recognizing \u201cthe unique nature of the death penalty and the need for heightened reliability in death penalty deliberations\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 230; the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>has interpreted the eighth amendment to require, among other things, that sentencers \u201cnot be given unbridled discretion in determining the fates of those charged with capital offenses. The [c]onstitution instead requires that death penalty statutes be structured so as to prevent the penalty from being administered in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 231, quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>479 U.S. 538, 541, 107 S. Ct. 837, 93 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1987). This includes \u201cdefin[ing] the crimes for which death may be the sentence in a way that obviates standardless sentencing discretion. . . . <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 428, 100 S. Ct. 1759, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1980). A statutory requirement that, before death may be imposed, the sentencer must find at least one statutorily mandated aggravating circumstance is a constitutionally permissible response to the need to avoid standardless sentencing discretion and to narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. <em>Blystone </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>494 U.S. 299, 302, 110 S. Ct. 1078, 108 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1990); <em>Lowenfield </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 244, 108 S. Ct. 546, 98 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1988); <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>[428 U.S. 262, 270-71, 276, 96 S. Ct. 2950, 49 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1976)]; <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>[428 U.S. 242, 251-53, 96 S. Ct. 2960, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1976)]; <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>[428 U.S. 153, 198, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 232. The aggravating factor, however, must \u201cgenuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder. <em>Zant </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>462 U.S. 862, 877, 103 S. Ct. 2733, 77 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 62. Therefore, when principles of accessorial liability are used by the state in an attempt to establish that a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>should be sentenced to death, \u201cthe focus [must still remain] on [the defendant\u2019s] culpability, not on that of those who committed the robbery and shot the victims, for [the United States Supreme Court] insist[s] on individualized consideration as a constitutional requirement in imposing the death sentence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Although the issue of whether the eighth amendment precludes the application of principles of accessorial liability to prove aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a capital case is an issue of first impression for this court, the United States Supreme Court has addressed a similar issue and, in doing so, implicitly answered the question before us. In <em>Tison, </em>where the defendants were charged with murder based upon accessory liability similar to the present case, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cmajor participation in the [murders] committed, combined with reckless indifference to human life\u201d demonstrated culpability sufficient for imposition of the death penalty. Id., 158. In that case, the defendants, who were brothers, planned and carried out the escape of their father from prison, with the help of another brother, where the father was serving a life sentence for having killed a correction officer during a previous escape. Id., 139. After the defendants\u2019 father and another inmate were freed, the group of five men flagged down a passing automobile after their own automobile became disabled. The four occupants of the automobile that stopped to help the defendants were overtaken, driven into the desert and brutally executed by the defendants\u2019 father and his fellow escapee. Id., 139-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendants in <em>Tison </em>individually were tried for and convicted of, among other things, capital murder under Arizona\u2019s felony murder and accessorial liability statutes. Id., 141-42. During the penalty phase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>proceedings, the trial court found sufficient evidence to establish three statutory aggravating factors, namely: (1) the defendants had created a grave risk of death to persons other than the victims; (2) the murders had been committed for pecuniary gain; and (3) the murders were especially heinous.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Id., 142. The trial court did not find any statutory mitigating factors but did find sufficient evidence to establish several nonstatutory mitigating factors. The court concluded, however, that the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating factors, and sentenced the defendants to death. Id., 142-43. In evaluating the trial court\u2019s findings of aggravating and mitigating factors, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the first aggravating factor\u2014 creation of a grave risk to others\u2014was not supported by the evidence, but upheld the finding of the other factors and, therefore, the imposition of the death sentence. Id., 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The defendants appealed, claiming, among other things, that the state had failed to prove that the defendants had \u201c \u2018inten[ded] to kill\u2019 \u201d the victims, as required by <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 797-98, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1982). <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 143. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat the [e]ighth [a]mendment did not preclude imposing the death penalty on two brothers who participated substantially in their father\u2019s armed prison breakout and in a related kidnaping and robbery that resulted in four murders, even though neither defendant took any act which he desired to, or was substantially certain would, cause death. . . . [The court] found that the [defendants\u2019] involvement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the crime was such that both subjectively appreciated that their acts were likely to result in the taking of innocent life . . . and that the record would support a finding of the culpable mental state of reckless indifference to human life .... [The court] noted that reckless indifference to the value of human life may be every bit as shocking to the moral sense as an intent to kill . . . and [it] remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Arizona for a specific determination [of] whether the [defendants] possessed that mental state . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers, </em>490 U.S. 805, 818-19, 109 S. Ct. 2207, 104 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1989) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting), citing <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 150-52, 157-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Although the <em>Tison </em>court did not address expressly the narrow issue before this court, i.e., whether principles of accessorial liability may be used to prove aggravating factors under the eighth amendment, in broadly concluding that the eighth amendment did not preclude the <em>imposition </em>of the death penalty based on accessorial liability when there is \u201cmajor participation\u201d by the defendant and he evidences a \u201creckless indifference to human life\u201d; <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 152, 158; the court acknowledged that the eighth amendment does not preclude using accessorial liability to prove aggravating factors. By explicitly recognizing the trial court\u2019s finding of aggravating factors established through principles of accessorial liability, and thereafter concluding that an accessory could be sentenced to death, the Supreme Court in <em>Tison </em>implicitly concluded that the eighth amendment permitted the use of accessorial liability to prove aggravating factors. Id. In other words, by answering the broader question, i.e., whether the eighth amendment permitted imposing the death penalty on an accessory, the <em>Tison </em>court necessarily decided the more narrow issue that is presently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>before us, namely, whether accessorial liability may be used to prove aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Furthermore, we can conceive of no reason why a statutory scheme that requires a jury to evaluate aggravating factors need face a more stringent requirement under the eighth amendment when principles of accessorial liability are being used to prove those aggravating factors rather than the commission of the crime itself. In other words, because the eighth amendment does not mandate that the fact finder evaluate aggravating factors for a capital punishment statutory scheme to be constitutionally valid, and because the death penalty has been upheld as constitutional despite the application of accessorial liability to the <em>crime </em>of capital murder; see id., 158; there should be no greater standard under the eighth amendment when principles of accessorial liability are used to prove <em>aggravating factors </em>that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty, as compared to being used to prove the commission of a <em>crime </em>that could result in the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The United States Supreme Court has emphatically stated that, \u201c[a]ny argument that the [c]onstitution requires that a jury impose the sentence of death or make the findings prerequisite to imposition of such a sentence has been soundly rejected by prior decisions of this [cjourt.\u201d <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>494 U.S. 738, 745, 110 S. Ct. 1441, 108 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1990); see also <em>Spaziano </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>468 U.S. 447, 459, 104 S. Ct. 3154, 82 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1984) (concluding that neither sixth amendment, nor eighth amendment, nor any other constitutional provision provides defendant with right to have jury determine appropriateness of capital sentence). For example, in <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 428 U.S. 270, the court concluded that the Texas death penalty statute did not violate the eighth amendment or any other section of the federal constitution although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>statute did not provide for the narrowing of death-eligible defendants by a jury\u2019s consideration of aggravating factors. The court reasoned that, \u201c[w]hile Texas has not adopted a list of statutory aggravating circumstances the existence of which can justify the imposition of the death penalty as have Georgia and Florida, its action in narrowing the categories of murders for which a death sentence may ever be imposed serves much the same purpose. ... In fact, each of the five classes of murders made capital by the Texas statute<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> is encompassed in Georgia and Florida by one or more of their statutory aggravating circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. The Supreme Court concluded by stating that the only mandated requirement of a death penalty statutory scheme under the eighth and fourteenth amendment is that \u201ca capital-sentencing system must allow the sentencing authority to consider mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ing circumstances.\u201d Id., 271. In other words, as long as sentencers are not \u201cgiven unbridled discretion in determining the fates of those charged with capital offenses,\u201d so that the death penalty is \u201cadministered in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 231; and a defendant is permitted \u201cto introduce any relevant mitigating evidence regarding his character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; the eighth amendment\u2019s proscription of cruel and unusual punishment requires nothing more for a capital sentencing scheme to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Because the United States Supreme Court clearly has stated in <em>Tison </em>that principles of accessorial liability may be used to prove the <em>crime </em>of capital felony under the eighth amendment, and the eighth amendment does not require that a death penalty scheme must mandate that a juiy consider aggravating factors, we can conceive of no reason why a statutory scheme that requires a jury to determine the existence of aggravating factors need face a more stringent requirement under the eighth amendment when principles of accessorial liability are being used to prove those aggravating factors rather than the commission of the crime itself.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>we conclude that when principles of accessorial liability are used to prove the existence of aggravating factors, the additional requirements that a defendant be a \u201cmajor\u201d participant and that he exhibit a \u201creckless indifference to human life,\u201d as established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Tison </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 158, sufficiently protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Turning to the facts of the present case, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crimes was not minor, but, rather, was substantial and that he evidenced a reckless disregard for human life. Far from merely asking his brother Adrian to murder the two victims, the defendant was \u201cactively involved ... in the entire sequence of criminal activity culminating in the murder of [Brown and Clarke] . . . .\u201d Id. The defendant planned every detail of the crime. This included soliciting the commission of the murders by Adrian, purchasing the gun that eventually was used by Adrian to commit the crimes, and paying Lee to inform him when both Brown and Clarke were at home so that the murders could be committed simultaneously. The defendant even demonstrated to Adrian how he wanted Brown to be killed. Such participation in these murders clearly rises to the level of major participation that evidences \u201ca reckless disregard for human life.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The defendant argues that, despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Tison, </em>the use of accessorial liability to prove an aggravating factor would define a class of death-eligible defendants in a way unrelated to their individual moral blameworthiness, thereby making death a disproportionate punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>defendant argues that there is a \u201cmoral\u201d difference between the culpability of a person who was not the tiiggerman, was not at the murder scene and did not direct how the murder was to occur, and the actual murderer. Therefore, the defendant contends that by allowing the jury to find aggravating factors based upon his status as an accessory to the murders, the jury was not able to make the kind of reasoned moral judgment about the appropriate penalty that the eighth amendment requires. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As we previously noted herein, when a legislature broadly defines capital offenses and provides for the narrowing of culpability for those offenses by jury findings of aggravating circumstances, as the Connecticut legislature has chosen to do here; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a; the only other constitutional requirement under the eighth amendment at the sentencing phase is the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating factors. <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>492 U.S. 302, 319-28, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1989). The jury must be allowed to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant\u2019s character, record, or the circumstances of the offense in order that the punishment be directly related to the personal culpability of the defendant. Id., 327-28; see also <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>487 U.S. 164, 179, 108 S. Ct. 2320, 101 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1988); <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 113-15. The fact that aggravating factors may be established through principles of accessorial liability therefore is irrelevant to the eighth amendment\u2019s requirement that punishment be related to the personal culpability of the defendant. Rather, the only requirement of the eighth amendment is that the jury must be allowed \u201cto consider and give effect to mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant\u2019s character or record or the circumstances of the offense.\u201d <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>supra, 327-28. In this case, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>required to consider the fact that the defendant was not at the murder scene, and did not control or direct how the murder was to occur at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Specifically, the jury was instructed: \u201cThe defendant has a whole list [of mitigating factors], and there is nothing that bars anything from your consideration, even things beyond the list [he] submit[s] that come to you in your consideration, your judgment, of the totality of the facts developed here before you in the case.\u201d The trial court then reiterated this instruction near the end of its charge stating: \u201cIn addition to any of the mitigating factors claimed by the defendant, you may give a mitigating force to any fact taken alone or in conjunction with facts presented providing, of course, you are persuaded that the fact or facts exist by a preponderance of the evidence and that the fact or facts are mitigating in nature, as that term had been defined for you.\u201d We conclude that such instructions were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The defendant\u2019s third argument is that, even if accessory liability may be used to prove aggravating factors, the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the particularized mental state required by each aggravating factor and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s judgment of life imprisonment without the possibility of release should be upheld. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove that the defendant: (1) knew that, in killing Brown, another person would be subject to a grave risk of death; (2) intended to or was callously indifferent to the fact that the victims would be killed in an \u201cespecially heinous, cruel or depraved manner\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(3) intended to procure the murders by payment of money or anything else of pecuniary value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. During the penalty phase of the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury indicated on the final verdict form that, in reference to count two, i.e., the death of Brown, it had agreed unanimously that the state had proven one or more aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had failed to prove any statutory mitigating factors, and that at least one member of the jury found the existence of one or more nonstatutory mitigating factors. The form further indicated, however, that the jury was unable to agree unanimously that one or more of the proved statutory aggravating factors outweighed one or more of the proved nonstatutory mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We begin by briefly reviewing what is required under our death penalty statute for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. Section 53a-46a (g) provides that a judgment of life imprisonment without the possibility of release shall be imposed by a trial court when the fact finder unanimously finds that: (1) one or more statutory mitigating factors, as set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (h), exists; (2) none of the aggravating factors, as set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (i), exists; or (3) one or more of the aggravating factors and one or more nonstatutory mitigating factors exist, but the aggravating factor or factors do not outweigh the mitigating factor or factors. If the jury does find one or more aggravating factors and one or more nonstatutory mitigating factors, \u00a7 53a-46a (e) sets forth the required weighing process. That subsection provides that, \u201c[t]he jury or, if there is no jury, the court <em>shall </em>return a special verdict setting forth its findings as to the existence of any factor set forth in subsection (h), the existence of any aggravating factor or factors set forth in subsection (i) and whether any aggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist pursuant to subsection (d).\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Consequently, in applying these precepts to the present case, if we were to determine that there is evidence in the record to support beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the existence of <em>at least one </em>aggravating factor for each capital felony count, our inquiry into the sufficiency of the evidence to support the state\u2019s alleged aggravating factors would necessarily end. That is because even if we were to assume that the other aggravating factors alleged by the state were not supported by sufficient evidence, we could not conclude, as a matter of law, that the jury would have found that the one aggravating factor did not outweigh the mitigating factor or factors found, thereby requiring the imposition of a life sentence. Section 53a-46a (g) necessarily provides that the only way in which a life sentence would be mandated, as a matter of law, without the jury having to perform its weighing function, would be if this court were to conclude that <em>none </em>of the aggravating factors proposed by the state were supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Only in that specified scenario would this court not need to remand for further proceedings. In other words, the issue presently before us is whether, as a matter of law, a life sentence is mandated. Once there is sufficient evidence to support one aggravating factor, a life sentence is <em>not </em>mandated because there remains a question for the jury to decide, namely, whether the supported aggravating factor outweighs any found mitigating factor or factors. Therefore, the narrow question we must determine is whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to establish beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the aggravating factors alleged by the state with regard to each capital felony count. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that, in killing Brown, another person would be subject to a grave risk of death, as articulated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (3). We further conclude, with regard to the double murder count, that there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant procured assistance in the commission of the double murder by payment with both crack cocaine and cash, in satisfaction of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[B]ecause of the seriousness of any death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>penalty determination, we will subject a finding of an aggravating factor to the same independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding, such as the voluntariness of a confession ... or the seizure of a defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 259. \u201cHowever, [e]ven with the heightened appellate scrutiny appropriate for a death penalty case, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of aggravating circumstances must be reviewed, in the final analysis, by considering the evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s penalty hearing in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts impliedly found by the jury. . . . Furthermore, [i]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with [the existence of the aggravating factor] and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with [its nonexistence]. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The defendant argues that the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended that the offense be committed in such a way as to knowingly create a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove that he knew that, in carrying out the murder of Brown, Clarke would be exposed to a \u201cgrave risk of death . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (3). The defendant further claims that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant made payment with crack cocaine and cash in exchange for assistance in the commission of the double murder, as articulated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5). We disagree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Before we review the evidence adduced by the state in the present case, we define the standard by which it is to be measured. Neither this court nor the legislature, however, has had an occasion to define the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cgrave risk of death,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (3). \u201cThus, in construing the term, we look to its commonly approved usage, an inquiry that often is [achieved through] the examination of dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Kelo </em>v. <em>New London, </em>268 Conn. 1, 17, 843 A.2d 500 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 224, 796 A.2d 502 (2002) (\u201c[w]here a statute does not define a term it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994) (\u201c[i]f a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cgrave\u201d as meaning \u201cvery serious: dangerous to life . . . .\u201d Therefore, in order to establish the aggravating factor set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (3), the state must prove that the defendant knew that in killing one person, another person would be subject to a \u201cvery serious\u201d risk or \u201cdanger\u201d to his or her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In the present case, as to the first capital felony count, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant intended to have someone kill not only Brown, but also Clarke, thereby clearly subjecting Clarke to a grave risk of death. The defendant first asked Taylor to kill <em>\u201ctwo </em>nobodies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After Taylor declined, the defendant proceeded to ask both Lee and Adrian if either of them would murder <em>both </em>Brown <em>and </em>Clarke. Furthermore, the evidence reveals that the defendant asked Lee to tell him when both Brown and Clarke arrived home, demonstrating an intent that he wanted the crimes to be committed together. Finally, at the time of the murder, the defendant knew that Brown was a young child, approximately eight years old. On the basis of this fact, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant knew, or should have known, that there was a strong possibility that Brown\u2019s mother would be in close proximity to him, wherever he went, and, therefore, if the defendant intended to have Brown killed, he also would subject Clarke to a substantial risk of death. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>record for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew that in killing Brown, another person, i.e., Clarke, would be subject to a \u201cgrave risk of death,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As to the double murder count, the jury reasonably could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant gave crack cocaine to Lee during the commission of the double murder, in exchange for her assistance in alerting the defendant when the victims arrived at their home and in helping the defendant gain access to the victims\u2019 home, which is an aggravating factor as articulated in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5). Further, there was evidence that the defendant directed Keene, his girlfriend, to give money to Gamer, who drove the getaway vehicle, in exchange for his assistance in the double murder. Thus, there was substantial evidence of the existence of an aggravating factor according to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Consequently, because we conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one aggravating factor applicable to each capital felony count, we need not address the remaining aggravating factors, and therefore we reject the defendant\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court\u2019s judgment sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release should be upheld because <em>Pinkerton </em>liability cannot be used to prove aggravating factors, and the state therefore presented insufficient evidence to prove any aggravating factors required for the imposition of the death penalty. To support this claim, the defendant argues that: (1) the application of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to aggravating factors is inconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 53a-46a; (2) <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is inconsistent with the mental state requirements of aggravating factors; and (3) the use of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability to prove a capital murder, which could result in the imposition of the death penalty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>would violate the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Our review of the record in the present case, however, reveals that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury during the penalty phase of the trial were completely devoid of any instruction on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is irrelevant to the facts of this case, and we need not address it. See <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 209 (defendant\u2019s constitutional attack on statute predicated on hypothetical facts deemed irrelevant and therefore court declined to address claim); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Olesen, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 361 (court declined to address defendant\u2019s claim because irrelevant to disposition of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judgment is affirmed with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction; the judgment is reversed with respect to the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release and the case is remanded for a new penalty phase hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of . . .

First, he argues that a retrial of the penalty phase is barred by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution because the trial judge acquitted the defendant of the death penalty. This argument is fully addressed as part of the state\u2019s claims on appeal; see part III B of this opinion; and, therefore, we need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>it as an alternate ground for affirmance. Second, the defendant argues that under the recent United States Supreme Court case of <em>Sattazahn </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>537 U.S. 101, 112, 123 S. Ct. 732, 154 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2003), retrial of the penalty phase is barred \u201c [i]f a jury unanimously concludes that a [s]tate has failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances [because] double jeopardy attaches to the \u2018acquittal\u2019 on the offense . . . .\u201d Similarly, this argument is fully addressed in part m B of this opinion. Third, the defendant argues that a retrial of the penalty phase is barred by the double jeopardy clause when an objection has been made to the declaration of a mistrial and the state has failed to establish the existence of manifest necessity. We find this argument to be unpersuasive. In the present case, the state moved for a mistrial of the penalty phase after the jury had become deadlocked on both of the capital felony counts. Both this court and the United States Supreme Court have long held that the fact that a jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict is considered the classic basis for a proper declaration of a mistrial, and, therefore, there was no need for the state to establish that there was manifest necessity for its declaration. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>182 Conn. 124, 129, 438 A.2d 30 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1090, 101 S. Ct. 883, 66 L.

Specifically, the court stated that, \u201c[t]here is a doctrine in our law that provides that once a defendant\u2019s participation in a conspiracy is established, he is then responsible for each of the criminal acts of the other coconspirators which is within the scope of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">\u201cThis means in this case that if you conclude the defendant was in fact guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, as I will define that for you, but he did not in fact kill [Brown or Clarke], then you must determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to show you beyond a reasonable doubt that another member of that same conspiracy did in fact perform that act that was the proximate cause of their deaths. If such other member of the conspiracy did perform that act and if that act was in the scope of the furtherance of the conspiracy, then the defendant would be guilty of murder and capital felony as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">\u201cTo reiterate, if you conclude [that] the defendant was a member of a conspiracy as charged in the second count of the information beyond a reasonable doubt and that another member of that same conspiracy commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ted the crime of murder, [and] you further conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was in the scope of and the furtherance of this conspiracy, then each and every member of that conspiracy would be guilty of the murder charge whether or not they personally committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cIt does not matter whether [the murder] that resulted from the . . . coconspirator\u2019s act be intended by [the defendant].

Specifically, the court stated that, \u201c[a] verdict of guilty for the crime of conspiracy to commit the murder does not automatically result in a verdict of guilty for the crime of murder or capital felony,\u201d unless the state proves all of the other elements of the crimes charged. The jury repeatedly was instructed that it must decide whether the defendant intended to commit the murders, the alleged underlying object of the conspiracy. In particular, in the court\u2019s supplemental instructions, it told the jury that these are \u201cspecific intent crime[s]. All four charges require the finding by a jury unanimously that the intent of the actor during the course of the conduct is intentional conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The court then defined the crime of murder as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of murder, [when] with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> The defendant makes two additional arguments in his brief.

Because the eighth amendment pertains solely to the punishment phase of a trial, and not the guilt phase, we address this claim as an alternate ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s imposition of a life sentence. See part IV of this opinion. Second, the defendant argues that \u201c[w]here the jury did not articulate on which of [the] two theories of liability it convicted the defendant [accessorial or <em>Pinkerton], </em>if either one of them is legally insufficient, then the conviction must be reversed.\u201d Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability was proper, and the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s instruction on accessorial liability, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. ...\u201d Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s argument fails on its merits, we need not address the defendant\u2019s claim of plain error.

Instead, the question before us is whether our prior precedents adopting and delineating the parameters of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine preclude the state from proving a capital felony through use of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine.

Rather, the defendant argues, the issue is \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s rights to present a defense and to confrontation were violated when he was <em>prevented from impeaching </em>Lee with her psychiatric records,\u201d and therefore \u201cuntil the sixth amendment is satisfied, the trial court has no discretion to prevent the defendant from using the information critical to presenting his defense . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This argument, however, presents two problems. First, \u201c[w]e generally do not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 587 n.6, 830 A.2d 164 (2003); see also <em>Bovat </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>258 Conn. 574, 585 n.11, 783 A.2d 1001 (2001) (\u201c[i]t is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief\u2019 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Second, Lee\u2019s consent to the release of her mental health records occurred in the subsequent trial of Adrian, well after the alleged denial of access occurred. The fact that the defendant was given access to the documents <em>after </em>his trial was complete does not affect our inquiry into whether the denial of access <em>during </em>the trial was improper.

It cites <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S. Ct. 2633, 86 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1985), in support of this proposition. I disagree. First, as a factual matter, I do not understand how instructing the jury that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release is the \u201crequired\u201d outcome in the event of a deadlock amounts to an instruction that some other body is responsible for making the final decision as to whether the defendant receives a sentence of life imprisonment or the death penalty. A required outcome precludes choice. Second, and more importantly, I believe that <em>Caldwell </em>is inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 472 U.S. 324, defense counsel, during closing argument, spoke of the jury\u2019s awesome responsibility in deciding whether the defendant would live or die. The prosecutor, in response, argued that the defense inappropriately had suggested that the jury was solely responsible for its decision. Id., 325. The prosecutor further stated that the jury\u2019s decision was not \u201cthe final decision\u201d; id.; because it was reviewable automatically by the Mississippi Supreme Court. Id., 325-26. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments had violated the defendant\u2019s eighth amendment right to reliable imposition of the death penalty because \u201cit is constitutionally impermissible to rest a <em>death sentence </em>on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In the present case, the death penalty was not imposed. Thus, the <em>Caldwell </em>court\u2019s concerns with respect to the reliable imposition of the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>do not exist here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if <em>Caldwell </em>may be read so broadly as to require the same level of reliability when a life sentence has been given, I believe that <em>Caldwell </em>is inapposite for other reasons. The majority asserts that the court\u2019s statements in the present case, like the prosecutor\u2019s comments in <em>Caldwell, </em>\u201ccreated a reasonable likelihood that the jury failed to appreciate its \u2018awesome responsibility ....\u2019\u201d The majority\u2019s conclusion necessarily suggests that because of this failure, the defendant\u2019s eighth amendment right to reliable imposition of the death penalty has been violated. The defendant claims no such violation, however. Rather, the <em>state </em>claims that the court\u2019s instructions violated <em>Caldwell </em>and \u201cprejudiced\u201d the state. The majority, therefore, appears to be invoking <em>Caldwell </em>not to protect the defendant\u2019s eighth amendment rights, but, rather, to protect some unidentified interest of the state. Without an explanation of this unprecedented expansion of eighth amendment jurisprudence, I am compelled to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Moreover, the <em>Caldwell </em>court was particularly concerned with the bias in favor of the death sentence created by the prosecutor\u2019s comments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the present case did not suggest to the jury that if it imposed a death sentence, or any sentence, its decision would not be final because it would be subject to review by an appellate court. There also was no suggestion that the imposition of a death sentence would lead to appellate review, but that a life sentence would not. Unlike <em>Caldwell, </em>the court\u2019s instruction created no bias in favor of a death sentence. If the court\u2019s statements created any bias at all, it was in favor of a life sentence for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The majority also asserts that the court\u2019s statements are grounds for a mistrial because they gave the jurors in favor of a life sentence an incentive to cut deliberations short, thereby increasing the likelihood that the jury would remain deadlocked. I conclude that the state was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted by the majority, the statements may have provided an incentive for those jurors in favor of a life sentence to stop trying to convince those in favor of death to change their minds. The statements did not provide any incentive for the jurors in favor of death to cease their efforts to convince those in favor of life, because doing so would only have resulted in a hung jury with a resultant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>life sentence. Therefore, I do not agree with the majority that the court\u2019s statements adversely affected the state\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Accordingly, I conclude that the court\u2019s statements to the jury did not create circumstances such that the court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial constituted a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">I, therefore, would reach the state\u2019s claim that the court abused its discretion by denying its motion for mistrial and by dismissing the proceedings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56. The defendant claims that the court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the proceedings, and, in the alternative, that the court was not dismissing the proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 54-56, but, rather, was acquitting the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-40 or \u00a7 42-50. Having carefully reviewed the record, I believe that it is simply unclear whether the court was acquitting the defendant or dismissing the case. Accordingly, bearing in mind the double jeopardy concerns with respect to acquittal, I would remand the case for further articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for the resolution of this issue. Immediately after the court ordered the jury\u2019s special verdict accepted and recorded, the state made an oral motion for a mistrial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-45. The state argued that a mistrial was necessary because the jury was deadlocked, but the court denied the state\u2019s motion. The state then asked for permission to appeal, and the court reserved ruling on the issue until the day of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">At the sentencing hearing, the court denied the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal and reiterated its asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tion that a mistrial was not appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court then imposed a total effective sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In a subsequent memorandum of decision on the court\u2019s denial of the motion for permission to appeal, the court further articulated its reasons for denying the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The court first noted that it could take one of three courses of action in response to the jury\u2019s inability to agree, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 394-97, 542 A.2d 306 (1988). Specifically, the court stated that it could: \u201c(1) declare a mistrial; (2) make factual findings \u2018acquitting\u2019 the defendant of the death penalty; or (3) exercise its discretion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to dismiss the death penalty proceedings.\u201d The court then stated: \u201cBecause the jury was unable to unanimously agree as to whether the proved aggravating factor or factors outweighed the proved mitigating factor or factors, <em>the court found that the state failed to sustain its burden of proof. </em>Anything beyond this conclusion is mere speculation. Indeed, the verdict, as exemplified by the questions posed by the jury and the formulation of the special verdict form, which was accepted by both the state and the defendant, indicates that the state was unable to overcome the mitigating factor or factors found by the jury. Consequently, the court, <em>exercising its discretion, </em>denied the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>and dismissed the death penalty proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court concluded by stating: \u201cThe court has given due consideration to the circumstances of the case, including the evidence presented and the jury\u2019s verdict as indicated on the special verdict forms. Because the court finds that <em>the state failed to sustain its burden of proof </em>that the one or more aggravating factors outweighed the one or more mitigating factors, the motion for permission to appeal is hereby denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 380-81, the court imposed a life sentence after the jury could not unanimously agree as to the presence or absence of a mitigating factor. On appeal, after determining that the court had three options for disposing of the case after the jury deadlocked (acquit, dismiss or declare a mistrial), this court concluded that the record was ambiguous as to which action the court had taken and why. Id., 401-403. We could not ascertain whether the court acquitted the defendant on the basis of its assessment of the facts or imposed a life sentence because it thought it was required to do so. Id., 402. We refused to entertain the state\u2019s remaining claims because, in the event that the court\u2019s imposition of a life sentence constituted an acquittal, further review of the state\u2019s claim would have been barred by double jeopardy. Id. \u201cIf the trial court\u2019s imposition of a life sentence amounts to an \u2018acquittal\u2019 of the death penalty then double jeopardy bars a second capital sentencing proceeding.\u201d Id., 398. The effect of an acquittal is particularly important in the context of the state\u2019s claim that the court imposed a life sentence on the basis of erroneous legal conclusions, because, \u201c[t]he fact that an acquittal is based in whole or in part on an erroneous construction of the governing law is of no import. That fact affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The court\u2019s action in the present case is similarly ambiguous. In its memorandum <em>of </em>decision, the court indicated that the state had failed to carry its burden of proof, suggesting that the court itself made factual findings and acquitted the defendant of capital felony murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, however, also stated in the memorandum of decision that it had \u201cexercis [ed] its discretion . . . [and] dismissed the death penalty proceedings,\u201d which suggests that the court intended to exercise its discretion to dismiss the death penalty proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 54-56. Keeping in mind that, if the court had acquitted, a second capital penalty hearing would be barred by double jeopardy, I would remand the case to the trial court for an articulation of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">KATZ, J., with whom NORCOTT, J., joins, dissenting. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is, in all circumstances, cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the constitution, I reaffirm my position that our \u201csociety should not have the authority to sustain an institution the nature of which is to destroy its own members. If our status as moral creatures is to survive, the termination of our ability to accomplish a deliberate institutionalized method of execution heads my list of desiderata for this society.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>252 Conn. 128, 150, 750 A.2d 448 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S. Ct. 93, 148 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">As I have stated before, the issue \u201cis not whether the defendant. . . has the right to life, but whether we as a society have the right to kill. \u201d Id. Certainly the defendant who has committed such hideous atrocities did not have that right. His acts of violence, however, do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>justify state sanctioned murder. The \u201cjustice\u201d we impose is no less shocking than the crime itself, and, far from treating the defendant\u2019s offense, instead sullies us. As Justice Brennan of the United States Supreme Court summarized in a dissent: \u201cThe fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death is that it treats members of the human race as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. [It is] thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the [cruel and unusual punishments] [c]lause that even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human dignity. ... As such it is a penalty that subjects the individual to a fate forbidden by the principle of civilized treatment guaranteed by the [clause].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 230, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">I also agree with former Justice Berdon and Justice Norcott, both of whom, in separate dissenting opinions, have expressed their opposition to the death penalty because it allows for arbitrariness and racial discrimination in the determination of who shall live or die at the hands of the state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 530-36, 545-48, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). In the years following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), serious efforts were made to comply with its mandate, and legislatures and appellate courts struggled to provide judges and juries with sensible and objective guidelines for determining life and death. We have attempted to define who is \u201cdeserving\u201d of the death penalty through the use of carefully chosen adjectives, reserving the death penalty for the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d But the <em>Furman </em>promise of consistency and the requirement of individualized sentencing; see <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Ed. 2d 973 (1978); merely have reduced, rather than eliminated, the number of people subject to arbitrary sentencing. While one might hope that providing the sentencer with as much relevant mitigating evidence as possible will lead to more rational and consistent sentences, experience has taught us otherwise. Indeed, the decision whether a human being should live or die is so inherently subjective that it unavoidably defies the rationality and consistency required by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Furthermore, even under the most sophisticated death penalty statutes, race continues to play a major role. We have not eliminated the biases and prejudices that infect society generally; therefore, it should not be suiprising that such problems continue to influence the determination of who is sentenced to death, even within the narrower pool of death-eligible defendants selected according to so-called objective standards. Finally, even the most sophisticated death penalty schemes are unable to prevent human error from condemning the innocent. Innocent persons <em>have </em>been executed. See H. Bedau &amp; M. Radelet, \u201cMiscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases,\u201d 40 Stan. L. Rev. 21, 36 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent because to do otherwise would perpetuate yet another killing, sadly this one state sponsored.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> The majority notes two problematic statements made to the jury. \u201cIf you continue to deliberate on this issue and at the final analysis you are not able to agree, then you report that, and in that event your deliberations would cease and by your action I would be required to impose a sentence of life without the benefit of release.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve already told you, if you cannot agree, then I will impose a sentence which is in accord with the inability of the state to satisfy the burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt in respect to the aggravating factor and your consideration of the mitigating factor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 provides: \u201cAll courts having jurisdiction of criminal cases shall at all times have jurisdiction and control over informations and ciiminal cases pending therein and may, at any time, upon motion by the defendant, dismiss any information and order such defendant discharged if, in the opinion of the court, there is not sufficient evidence or cause to justify the bringing or continuing of such information or the placing of the person accused therein on trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-40 provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter the close of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief or at the close of all the evidence, upon motion of the defendant or upon its own motion, the judicial authority shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal as to any principal offense charged and as to any lesser included offense for which the evidence would not reasonably permit a finding of guilty.

The court gave four reasons for its concerns. First, it noted that \u201c[b]ias against the defendant clearly stems from the institutional limits on what an appellate court can do . . . .\u201d Id. Second, prosecutorial argument of this nature \u201cpresents an intolerable danger of bias toward a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>death sentence\u201d because a jury, even if it is not convinced that the defendant actually deserves death, may wish to \u201csend a message\u201d of disapproval of the defendant\u2019s acts and may feel tree to do so with the prosecutor\u2019s assurance that any error will be corrected on appeal. Id., 331. Third, a jury seeking to delegate responsibility for sentencing may return a sentence of death if it assumes, on the basis of argument, that only a death sentence is reviewable. Id., 332. Finally, such comments create \u201can intolerable danger that the jury will in fact choose to minimize the importance of its role,\u201d especially in light of a jury\u2019s tendency to believe that an appellate court may be more well suited to make the decision.
