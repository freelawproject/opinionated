The Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiffs action was time barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-584<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the accidental failure of suit statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-592,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not save the action because the defendant had not been served with process within the limitations period and \u00a7 52-592 \u201c[did] not authorize another action to be filed or to extend any statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Family Dollar Store, 78 </em>Conn. App. 235, 241, 826 A.2d 262 (2003). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-592 should not apply in cases such as the present action in which the plaintiff delivered the complaint in a timely manner to a sheriff, and, due to the sheriffs actions, default or negligence, the complaint was not served?\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Family Dollar Store, </em>266 Conn. 912, 832 A.2d 69 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person . . . caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct . . . shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed ... to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action ... for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
