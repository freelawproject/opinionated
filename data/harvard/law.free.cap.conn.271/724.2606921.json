App. 386, 835 A.2d 126 (2003); we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into a possible conflict of interest between the defendant and defense counsel was inadequate and, if so, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant was entitled to a reversal of his conviction in the absence of a specific showing of harm?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>267 Conn. 912, 840 A.2d 1174 (2004). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present during the inquiry in question constituted a structural error warranting the automatic reversal of his conviction without a specific showing of harm or prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The underlying facts and procedural history, as set forth in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, are as follows. \u201cIn March, 1999, the victim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her mother moved into the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant and the victim\u2019s mother were romantically involved at that time. The defendant and the victim\u2019s mother shared one bedroom while the victim slept in a separate bedroom. The defendant used the victim\u2019s bedroom as his business office and kept his computer there.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u201cThe victim alleged that soon after she moved into the defendant\u2019s home, he began molesting her by touching her inappropriately. The victim claimed that this behavior occurred frequently, and she provided descriptions of three such incidents. The first such alleged incident occurred in March, 1999, when the victim had gone to her bedroom, where the defendant was working on the computer, to ask for assistance with her homework. After the defendant declined to help her, the victim went to her bed to work on her assignment. She alleged that the defendant then went to the bed, pinned her arms over her head and rubbed her groin with his free hand. That alleged touching occurred over the victim\u2019s clothing. The second occurrence was in April, 1999. At that time, the defendant approached the victim while she was sitting on her bed. He allegedly kissed the victim on the face and again rubbed her groin over her clothing. The third alleged incident also occurred in April, 1999. The victim claimed that the defendant had approached her while she was standing in her bedroom and \u2018touched [her] in the comer.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThe alleged molestation came to light when the victim disclosed it to several friends during a school field trip. A teacher\u2019s aide overheard the victim\u2019s conversation and confronted her with the information. The victim confirmed the allegations, but requested that the aide not tell anyone else. The aide, nevertheless, notified the victim\u2019s teacher and the school principal. The principal then notified the victim\u2019s mother and the department of children and families.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\u201cA worker from the department of children and families interviewed the victim. During the interview, the victim repeated her allegations of abuse. The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with three counts each of sexual assault in the third degree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (B),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2). Following a jury trial, the defendant was acquitted of all of the sexual assault charges and convicted of each of the risk of injury charges.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 80 Conn. App. 388-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The defendant, with the assistance of new counsel, filed a motion for a new trial, alleging for the first time, inter alia, that he had been deprived of conflict-free representation at trial because his trial counsel had put himself in the position of being a material witness and that the court\u2019s inquiry into the matter should have been on the record. The defendant\u2019s motion was based on the following facts. \u201cThe victim made certain statements that were inculpatory as to the defendant and that were the basis for the state\u2019s bringing the charges of which he was convicted. Prior to trial, however, the victim wrote and signed a statement recanting her previous accusations against the defendant. The victim testified that she [had done] so at the insistence of her mother and the defendant. She further testified that the defendant [had] dictated the statement to her and that she [had been] angry that she was forced to write the statement because it was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\u201cAfter the victim had written a statement recanting her accusations, the victim\u2019s mother and the defendant brought her to the office of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>attorney Christopher W. Boylan. The victim later testified that she had had a private conversation with Boylan, during which she [had] told him that her handwritten statement was the truth. The victim\u2019s statement was then typed on stationery bearing Boylan\u2019s letterhead. The victim signed the typewritten statement, and Boylan acknowledged the statement as an officer of the Superior Court. At trial, she testified that she had been forced to make the statements, which were not true.\u201d Id., 389-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial memorializes the following additional events forming the basis of his claim. At some point during the trial, \u201c[t]he state informed the court, outside of the defendant\u2019s presence and off the record, that [Boylan] may intend to testify at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge, in chambers, asked [Boylan] if he intended to testify and whether a new attorney should be obtained to represent the defendant. After consideration by [Boylan], he informed the judge that he did not intend to testify on behalf of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In denying the motion, the trial court concluded that no conflict existed because Boylan did not intend to testify. The court reasoned \u201cthat it was entitled to rely on [Boylan\u2019s] assertion as an officer of the court and that it would be inappropriate to unnecessarily pry into defense strategy. Accordingly . . . there was no duty to conduct an inquiry on the record.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, raising claims that, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>alia:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1) the trial court should have conducted an inquiry on the record and in the defendant\u2019s presence into whether a conflict of interest had existed between him and Boylan; and (2) the trial court improperly failed to conclude that Boylan had been burdened by an actual conflict of interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. In reaching its conclusion that reversal was mandated, the court first noted that, although sixth amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally should be asserted by way of habeas corpus rather than direct appeal, because of the need to develop an evidentiary record, this case was distinguishable. Id., 390. It concluded that here, the trial court\u2019s actions, which were evident from the record, were at issue, not the actions of defense counsel. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Turning to the merits of the case, the Appellate Court concluded that, because the possibility of a conflict of interest was sufficiently apparent, the trial court had a duty to inquire about the conflict. Id., 392. The trial court\u2019s actions failed to satisfy that duty, however, because, in determining that Boylan was not going to testify, it had addressed only how the potential conflict, would be handled and had failed to inquire into the actual nature of the conflict itself. Id., 393. The Appellate Court further noted that, because the defendant had not been present during the inquiry, it could not determine whether the defendant had consented to or waived any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>conflict. Id., 393-94. Finally, the Appellate Court was persuaded that the circumstances of the case clearly had presented an actual conflict of interest that gave rise to a presumption of prejudice requiring reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Id., 394. Because this conclusion was dispositive of the appeal, it did not reach the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) the trial court\u2019s in-chambers inquiry into the potential conflict of interest had been inadequate; (2) there had been an actual conflict of interest; and (3) no specific showing of harm was required. The state further claims that the defendant cannot show the requisite harm, namely, that his representation was affected adversely. In response, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court\u2019s inquiry, conducted off the record and in the defendant\u2019s absence, had been inadequate because of its failure to ascertain the nature or effect of the conflict of interest. We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, albeit for reasons other than those cited by that court. We conclude that the in-chambers inquiry regarding the potential conflict of interest was a critical stage of the defendant\u2019s prosecution at which the defendant had a constitutional right to be present. We further conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to ensure the defendant\u2019s presence under these circumstances constituted a structural error warranting automatic reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Before addressing the merits of the state\u2019s claims before us, we note that these claims present issues of law. Accordingly, our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>270 Conn. 55, 66, 850 A.2d 1040 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>We begin with a fundamental tenet of criminal jurisprudence: a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his or her prosecution. <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 117, 104 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1983) (\u201cthe right to personal presence at all critical stages of the trial and the right to counsel are fundamental rights of each criminal defendant\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to be present ... is scarcely less important to the accused than the right of trial itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 127, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986). Although the constitutional right to be present is rooted to a large extent in the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, courts have recognized that this right is protected by the due process clause in situations when the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or evidence against him. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105-106, 108, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 691-92, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987) (recognizing that right to be present similarly is guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988). In judging whether a particular segment of a criminal proceeding constitutes a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of a defendant\u2019s prosecution, courts have evaluated the extent to which \u201c \u2018a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by [the defendant\u2019s] absence\u2019 \u201d or whether \u201c \u2018his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 96 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">A determination that the defendant\u2019s absence from a critical stage of the proceedings violated his constitutional rights does not end the inquiry that a reviewing court must conduct in deciding whether to order a new trial. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u2018most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u2019 . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999); see also <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991). \u2018The harmless error doctrine is essential to preserve the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial.\u2019 <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>supra, 308; see also <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>255 Conn. 425, 444, 773 A.2d 287 (2001). In contrast, the Supreme Court has noted that there is a \u201cvery limited class of cases\u201d involving error that is \u201cstructural,\u201d that is to say, error that transcends the criminal process. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S. Ct. 1544, 137 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1997), citing <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 113 S. Ct. 2078, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1993) (defective reasonable doubt instruction); <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>474 U.S. 254, 106 S. Ct. 617, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986) (racial discrimination in selection of grand jury); <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1984) (denial of public trial); <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1984) (denial of self-representation at trial); <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963) (complete denial of counsel); <em>Turney </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927) (biased trial judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201cStructural [error] cases defy analysis by harmless error standards because the entire conduct of the trial, from beginning to end, is obviously affected .... These cases contain a defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself. . . . Such errors infect the entire trial process . . . and necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair .... Put another way, these errors deprive defendants of basic protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the case at hand. It is undisputed that the in-chambers inquiry into the potential conflict of interest took place during the defendant\u2019s trial; see footnote 5 of this opinion; and that the defendant was neither present for, nor invited to participate in, the discussion. In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>302 F.3d 892, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that such a hearing was a critical stage of the proceedings and that reversal was mandated in similar circumstances. During the defendant\u2019s trial in <em>Campbell, </em>the trial court held an in-chambers hearing, on the record to inquire into a potential conflict of interest on the part of defense counsel. Id., 895. The hearing was initiated because the state had informed the court that defense counsel was being prosecuted on drug charges, unrelated to her client\u2019s case, by the same district attorney\u2019s office that was prosecuting her client then before the court. At that hearing, the trial court asked defense counsel one question\u2014whether she wished to make a statement. Id., 895-96. After defense counsel declined to do so, the trial court determined that no conflict existed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 896. The defendant was neither present for nor informed of the in-chambers hearing. Id., 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In concluding that the hearing was a critical stage of the proceeding, the Court of Appeals reasoned that, \u201cif defense counsel\u2019s representation is hampered by a conflict of interest, the integrity of the adversary system is cast into doubt because counsel cannot \u2018play . . . the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.\u2019 <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 685, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Given that the right to conflict-free counsel must be preserved in order to \u2018ensure that the trial is fair,\u2019 id., the in-chambers hearing held to determine whether [the defendant\u2019s] right to conflict-free counsel had been violated must have been a critical stage of the criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>supra, 302 F.3d 898-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Turning to the question of whether the lack of the defendant\u2019s presence fell into the category of structural error, the Court of Appeals in <em>Campbell </em>concluded: \u201c[The defendant] would have been able to influence the process in a significant way had he been present at the hearing. . . . [Defense counsel, the defendant\u2019s] only representative at the in-chambers hearing, could not adequately represent [his] interest in conflict-free counsel because she was the subject of the hearing. As a result, [the defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to conflict-free counsel received no consideration beyond the judge\u2019s one question to defense counsel and the one word response that the judge received. Had [the defendant] been informed of [the] potential conflict, and were he or a court-appointed representative present at the in-chambers hearing, [the defendant] or his representative could have asked the judge to expand his inquiry into the potential conflict. Just as the denial of the assistance of counsel affects the integrity of an entire trial, [the defendant\u2019s] exclusion from this critical in-chambers hearing at which his counsel\u2019s potential conflict of interest was evaluated affect[ed] the trial from beginning to end.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>omitted.) Id., 899-900; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>47 iLL. App. 3d 812, 816, 365 N.E.2d 481 (1977) (\u201cthe hearing in chambers to determine whether [the] defendant\u2019s attorneys had a conflict of interest was a critical stage of the proceedings for the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We find this reasoning persuasive. \u201cWhere a constitutional right to counsel exists . . . there is a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>261 Conn. 420, 427, 802 A.2d 844 (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present case, the inquiry in question involved the identification of a potential conflict of interest for Boylan, during which he was placed in the conflicting roles of a potential material witness in the case and the defendant\u2019s legal counsel. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we cannot presume that Boylan adequately represented the defendant\u2019s interests during the inquiry, particularly when Boylan\u2019s position as a material witness to, and participant in, the events surrounding the victim\u2019s recantation letter were in direct conflict with Boylan\u2019s role as the defendant\u2019s attorney and representative before the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, the defendant\u2019s right to conflict-free counsel was given no more consideration than a single question and a simple answer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Furthermore, the inquiry was substantially related to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to defend himself, and \u201ca fair and just hearing [was] thwarted by his absence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 745. In order for the defendant to have had adequate knowledge of the potential implications of the conflict and for him to have had a fair opportunity to question the sufficiency of the inquiry or to have objected to Boylan\u2019s representation of the defendant\u2019s interests, he would have had to have been present during the proceeding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This was not a situation in which the defendant could have contributed nothing had he been at the inquiry, nor can we state with <em>any </em>degree of confidence that he would have gained nothing by attending. See <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>supra, 291 U.S. 108. Accordingly, we conclude that the in-chambers inquiry regarding the potential conflict of interest was a critical stage of the defendant\u2019s prosecution at which the defendant had a constitutional right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Similarly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s exclusion from the in-chambers inquiry amounted to structural error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the United States Supreme Court has noted that most constitutional errors are subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>a harmless error analysis, it has drawn a distinction between a limited class of cases with \u201cstructural defects\u201d in the trial mechanism that defy analysis by harmless error standards and the broader category of cases involving \u201ctrial errors\u201d that occur during the presentation of the case to the jury, and accordingly may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>supra, 499 U.S. 306-309. In applying this distinction, the Supreme Court has recognized further that, when the consequences of the deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right are \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, [the deprivation of that right] unquestionably qualifies as \u2018structural error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In the present case, the potential conflict centered around the <em>pivotal </em>witness against the defendant\u2014the victim\u2014and the <em>critical </em>issue at trial\u2014the victim\u2019s credibility. It is impossible to know, had the defendant been present, whether he would have initiated further inquiry into the conflict, requested new counsel or requested that Boylan testify on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, we have no way of determining whether Boylan\u2019s cross-examination of the victim was affected because of his questionable role in securing her recantation letter. See footnote 11 of this opinion. It is equally difficult to assess how the jury perceived Boylan as a result of his interaction with the victim and if its perception of Boylan reflected adversely on the defendant. Thus, the consequences of the deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to be present in this case are \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,\u201d and the deprivation of that right \u201cunquestionably qualifies as \u2018structural error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We recognize that, in the vast majority of cases, we require defendants whose constitutional rights have been violated during the course of a trial to make a specific showing of harm or prejudice. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>that to require a specific showing of harm in this instance would defy the very purpose and nature of the structural error doctrine. A structural error creates a defect in the trial mechanism such that, while it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the exact harm, it remains abundantly clear that the trial process was flawed significantly. For this reason, \u201c[e]rrors of this magnitude are <em>per se </em>prejudicial and require that the underlying conviction be vacated.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Lainfiesta </em>v. <em>Artuz, </em>253 F.3d 151, 157 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lainfiesta </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>535 U.S. 1019, 122 S. Ct. 1611, 152 L.

We conclude that the denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present during the in-chambers inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>constituted a structural defect warranting the automatic reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction and the granting of a new trial without a specific showing of harm or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 (2) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...

During oral argument before this court, however, the defendant represented with certainty that the in-chambers inquiry had taken place after jury selection, and the state did not dispute this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> The defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly had denied his motion for a new trial because the verdict was inconsistent and because the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument constituted misconduct sufficient to warrant a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 80 Conn.

In addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have canvassed the defendant personally, we noted that the record of the two hearings held in court involving the potential conflict did not reflect whether the defendant had been present. Id., 426 n.10. The issue raised in that case was whether the hearings were adequate; no separate claim regarding the defendant\u2019s right to be present was raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> This is particularly true because Boylan\u2019s presence at and involvement in the preparation of the victim\u2019s letter recanting her previous accusations might have: impeded his ability to cross-examine the victim; made him a witness at trial; or exposed him, as it did the victim\u2019s mother, to a charge of witness tampering in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151, thereby putting him directly in conflict with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> Although we have no reason to doubt that the off-the-record inquiry proceeded as represented by the trial court in its memorandum of decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>we cannot presume any further discussion than that which the court provided in its memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> Unlike cases in which the existence of an in-chambers conference subsequently is put on the record in open court with the defendant present, thereby affording him the chance either to object or to waive any objection to his having been absent from that conference; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>381 F.3d 114, 122-23 (2d Cir. 2004); no such opportunity in the present case materialized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> During oral argument before this court, the state conceded that, \u201cif this court considers that this in-chambers conference was a critical stage of the proceedings . . . there is a structural defect . . . and we couldn\u2019t prevail in that regal'd.\u201d Despite the state\u2019s candor, and the evident overlap between the considerations relevant to the critical stage analysis and the structural error analysis under the facts of this case, we view the inquiries as having an independent factor, and we therefore address whether the error is structural or subject to harmless error analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
