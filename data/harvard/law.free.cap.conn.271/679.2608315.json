Corcoran, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing her appeal from the decision of the defendant, the department of social services (department), to discon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tinue her medicaid benefits because her assets, in the form of a testamentary trust, exceeded the prescribed limits. The plaintiff claims that the trial court, by incorrectly concluding that the department\u2019s administrative hearing officer properly excluded an earlier order of the Probate Court construing the trust, improperly dismissed her administrative appeal. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that, pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the administrative hearing officer should have admitted and given preclusive effect to the Probate Court\u2019s previous construction of the trust. In the alternative, the plaintiff claims that the trial court: (1) improperly affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the assets of the testamentary trust were available to the plaintiff; and (2) improperly affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to exclude extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent. We conclude that the trial court properly concluded that: (1) the hearing officer was not collaterally estopped from construing the trust; (2) the hearing officer correctly determined that the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff; and (3) the hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in excluding extrinsic evidence offered to prove the testator\u2019s intent. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">This appeal involves two separate proceedings, a Probate Court hearing and an administrative hearing before a department hearing officer, related to the construction of a trust created by Lyman M. Corcoran (testator), in his will of November 3, 1987, for the benefit of the plaintiff, his daughter. The testator\u2019s will provided that, upon his death, his residuary estate should be divided equally among his three daughters, Robin C. Turek, Imogen J.C. Kellogg and the plaintiff. Pursuant to the will, Turek and Kellogg each would receive their one-third share directly, while the remaining one-third was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>to be held in trust for the plaintiff, who is mentally disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The testamentary language creating the trust provided that \u201c[i]f my daughter [the plaintiff] is then living, the trust established for her shall be retained by my trustees to hold, manage, invest and reinvest said share as a Trust Fund, paying to or expending for the benefit of [the plaintiff] so much of the net income and principal of said Trust as the Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall deem proper for her health, support in reasonable comfort, best interests and welfare . . . .\u201d Additionally, the will provided that \u201c[a]mong the circumstances and factors to be considered by the trustee in determining whether to make discretionary distributions of net income or principal to a beneficiary are the other income and assets known to the trustee to be available to that beneficiary and the advisability of supplementing such income or assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The testator died on May 29, 1989. Thereafter, the Probate Court appointed the plaintiffs sisters as trustees of the trust, which they funded in 1992. From the time the trust was funded until December 31, 2000, the trust receipts totaled $854,307.95. During the same period of time, the plaintiff received $150 from the trust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Following the testator\u2019s death,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the department granted the plaintiffs application for financial and medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>cal assistance under the state administered medicaid program (medicaid benefits).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As of February, 2001, the plaintiffs monthly income included $19 from Supplementary Social Security Income (SSI), $531 from Social Security and $175.46 from employment. Upon learning that the plaintiff was the beneficiary of the trust created by the testator, the department notified the plaintiff, by a letter dated February 26, 2001, that it was discontinuing her medicaid benefits because her assets, including the trust, exceeded the relevant asset limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the plaintiffs request, an administrative hearing was scheduled for April 26, 2001, to review the department\u2019s decision to terminate her medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Shortly before the department notified the plaintiff of its intention to discontinue her medicaid benefits,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trustees petitioned the Probate Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (4),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to construe the terms of the trust \u201cas they pertain to any rights the State . . . may have to claim reimbursement from the Trust for benefits heretofore provided . . . and/or for any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>benefits provided by the State to the [plaintiff] in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the trustees asked the Probate Court to issue \u201ca ruling classifying said Trust as a \u2018special needs\u2019 trust, from which it is neither appropriate nor required to reimburse said State for benefits received by [the plaintiff] . . . .\u201d The Probate Court scheduled a hearing for May 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Prior to the Probate Court\u2019s hearing, the department conducted the scheduled administrative hearing to determine whether the department properly discontinued the plaintiffs medicaid benefits. Before the hearing officer, counsel for the department argued that the department properly had characterized the trust as a general support trust, the assets of which were available to the plaintiff, and properly had discontinued the plaintiffs medicaid benefits because of excess assets. The plaintiffs counsel contended that the trust was more properly characterized as a supplemental needs trust from which the plaintiff could not compel distributions, and counsel asked the hearing officer to delay ruling on the issue until the construction action pending before the Probate Court was resolved. Because the plaintiff was not present at the hearing, however, the hearing officer requested that the plaintiffs counsel either produce the plaintiff or provide medical evidence explaining her absence. Thereafter, the hearing officer suspended the proceedings until such medical evidence was provided or the plaintiff appeared before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The department subsequently notified the Probate Court of the pending administrative proceedings and urged the court not to proceed with the hearing scheduled for May 4, 2001. The department premised this request on the fact that it already had litigated this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cexact issue,\u201d namely, the proper construction of the trust, before the hearing officer and should not be forced to defend its actions in two separate forums.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Over the department\u2019s objection, the Probate Court conducted the scheduled hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In an order dated June 12, 2001, the court determined that the testator intended the \u201ctrust at issue ... to be ... a \u2018special needs, discretionary trust\u2019 not otherwise available to the state . . . .\u201d The Probate Court also stated: \u201cAlthough [this] court lacks the power to order any department of the state ... to reinstate benefits to a party before this court, it respectfully requests that the state do so in this case . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Before the Probate Court issued its order, the administrative hearing reconvened with the plaintiff in attendance on May 31,2001. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer, at the department\u2019s request, agreed to keep the hearing record open until June 8, 2001, to allow the department time to submit a rebuttal and comments. On July 12, 2001, the hearing officer issued a ruling on the hearing record, indicating that she had closed the record on June 8, 2001, four days prior to the issuance of the Probate Court\u2019s decision on June 12,2001. Thereafter, on July 17,2001, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the department\u2019s decision to discontinue the plaintiffs medicaid benefits because the trust was an asset that was available to her and, therefore, her assets exceeded the regulatory limits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The plaintiff subsequently requested reconsideration of the decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a (a) (1) (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the department should reconsider both the ruling closing the record on June 8, 2001, and the resulting decision in light of the Probate Court\u2019s order of June 12, 2001. Her motion was denied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-61<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 4-183,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed from the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>In a four count complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the department: (1) improperly applied Connecticut law regarding availability of assets; (2) made factual findings that were clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence in the record as a whole; (3) exceeded its statutory authority by improperly excluding the Probate Court\u2019s decision; and (4) resolved the issue in a manner contrary to federal law. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal, concluding that the hearing officer properly determined that the plaintiff was the beneficiary of a general support trust. Additionally, the trial court determined that the hearing officer\u2019s decision to exclude the Probate Court\u2019s order was not improper. The trial court based this determination on its conclusion that the \u201cfindings by the Probate Court do not resolve whether under the statute and regulations administered by the department, the trust is an inaccessible asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff first claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the hearing officer properly refused to consider and give preclusive effect to the order of the Probate Court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the issue of whether the trust is a supplemental needs trust or a general support trust was litigated fully and fairly in the Probate Court action, which the hearing officer failed to consider. The department responds that the hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in closing the hearing record prior to the issuance of the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Court\u2019s decision, and further, that the ultimate issue decided by the hearing officer, i.e., whether the trust constituted an asset that was available to the plaintiff, was not identical to the issue decided by the Probate Court and, therefore, the hearing officer was not estopped from construing the trust. We agree with the department that the hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in closing the record and that the issue presented to, and decided by, each tribunal was not identical. The hearing officer, therefore, was not bound by the principles of collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. The plaintiffs claim requires us to determine whether the trial court properly declined to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel to preclude the hearing officer from construing the trust. This presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Patio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>257 Conn. 456, 466, 778 A.2d 61 (2001) (propriety of application of collateral estoppel is question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The hearing officer closed the record four days before the Probate Court issued its ruling, and in an exercise of her discretion, she declined to consider any further submissions. Our scope of judicial review is limited to determining if the hearing officer \u201cacted unreasonably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>arbitrarily or illegally, or abused [her] discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 139, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996). We cannot say that the hearing officer\u2019s decision to close the record was an abuse of discretion, and accordingly, the ruling of the Probate Court was not part of the record in this case. Moreover, the issues decided by the hearing officer and the Probate Court were not identical, and collateral estoppel therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u201cThe fundamental principles underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel are well established. The common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. . . . Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . . Issue preclusion arises when an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and that determination is essential to the judgment. . . . Collateral estoppel express [es] no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>262 Conn. 45, 58, 808 A.2d 1107 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\u201cBefore collateral estoppel applies [however] there must be an <em>identity of issues </em>between the prior and subsequent proceedings. To invoke collateral estoppel the issues sought to be litigated in the new proceeding must be <em>identical </em>to those considered in the prior proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 345, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993); see also <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 799, 813, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997) (\u201c[t]he present case presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>a question of issue preclusion, which requires an identity of those issues between the prior and subsequent proceedings\u201d); <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 297, 596 A.2d 414 (1991) (\u201c[i]n order for collateral estoppel to bar the relitigation of an issue in a later proceeding, the issue concerning which relitigation is sought to be estopped must be identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding\u201d). In other words, \u201c[i]n order for collateral estoppel to apply . . . there must be an <em>identity </em>of the issues, that is, the prior litigation must have resolved the <em>same </em>legal or factual issue that is present in the second litigation.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>241 Conn. 24, 38, 694 A.2d 1246 (1997). Simply put, \u201ccollateral estoppel has no application in the absence of an identical issue.\u201d <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 249, 261, 773 A.2d 300 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Turning to the facts of the present case, we conclude that, because the issue decided by the Probate Court, namely, that the trust was not available to the plaintiffs <em>creditors, </em>is not identical to the issue before the hearing officer, namely, whether the trust constituted an asset available to the <em>plaintiff, </em>the hearing officer was not collaterally estopped from construing the trust. Our conclusion is supported by a review of the proceedings before each tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Although the proceedings before the Probate Court and the hearing officer arose out of the same testamentary instrument, each tribunal was called upon to decide, and did in fact decide, a different issue. The trustees petitioned the Probate Court \u201cto construe the terms of said Trust as they pertain to any rights the State . . . may have to claim <em>reimbursement </em>from the Trust for benefits heretofore provided . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Specifically, the trustees requested \u201ca ruling classifying said Trust as a <em>\u2018special needs' </em>trust, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>which it is neither appropriate nor required to <em>reimburse said State </em>for benefits received . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In response to this petition, the Probate Court determined that the testator intended to create a \u201c \u2018special needs, discretionary trust,\u2019 not otherwise <em>available to the state ... or other creditors of the trust beneficiary </em>for her care and support\u201d and, further, that \u201c[t]he trust assets are not available to the claims of the state . . . for past or future care . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The hearing officer, however, conducted the administrative hearing, at the plaintiffs request, to determine whether the department properly discontinued the plaintiffs medicaid benefits. In concluding that the termination was proper, the hearing officer determined that the trust was an \u201casset available to the <em>plaintiff\u2019 </em>under the regulations and policies of the department. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We acknowledge that there was some area of overlap in the issues presented in the two proceedings. As we previously have noted, however, the linchpin of collateral estoppel is the identity of the issues decided by both tribunals, and, in the present case, we are not persuaded that the issues are identical. The Probate Court determined, in the context of a potential reimbursement claim, that the trust was not available to the plaintiffs creditors and the state, whereas the hearing officer determined that the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff that disqualified her from receiving medicaid benefits. The Probate Court\u2019s opinion is notable for what it did not conclude, namely, whether the plaintiff had a legal right to compel distribution from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>trust. As we discuss more fully in part II of this opinion, for the purposes of determining eligibility for the medicaid program, \u201conly assets <em>actually available to a medical assistance recipient </em>may be considered . . . .\u201d (Emphasis altered.) <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>179 Conn. 83, 94, 425 A.2d 553 (1979). Assets held in trust are considered available if the beneficiary has the legal right to compel distributions. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-261 (c). Therefore, although the Probate Court determined that the trust is not available to the <em>state </em>as a potential creditor, it did not consider whether the trust is available to the plaintiff as a matter of law. As the trial court aptly noted, \u201c[t]hese findings by the Probate Court do not resolve whether under the statutes and regulations administered by the department the trust is an inaccessible asset\u201d as to the plaintiff. In other words, the hearing officer was not estopped from construing the trust in relation to the plaintiffs rights because the Probate Court\u2019s decision did not address the plaintiffs rights to the trust. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly determined that the hearing officer was not collaterally estopped from construing the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The plaintiff maintains that the hearing officer was estopped from relitigating the proper characterization of the trust because the identical issue, the availability of the trust to the plaintiff, was \u201cnecessarily determined\u201d by the Probate Court\u2019s decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Even if we were to assume, for the purpose of argument, that the issue presented to the Probate Court was the same as the issue before the hearing officer, that issue, i.e., the availability of the trust to the plaintiff, was not necessarily determined by the Probate Court. We note that the Probate Court classified the trust at issue as a \u201cspecial needs, discretionary trust . . . .\u201d We are unable, from this characterization, to determine what the Probate Court intended to conclude regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the availability of the trust to the plaintiff. A special needs trust is defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A) as follows: \u201cA trust containing the assets of an individual under age 65 who is disabled . . . and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court <em>if the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual </em>up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the present case, the trust in question cannot be a special needs trust because upon the plaintiffs death, the trustees will become the trust\u2019s beneficiaries. Furthermore, the phrase \u201cdiscretionary trust\u201d is ambiguous. This court previously has used this phrase to describe trusts in which the settlor is also the beneficiary; <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 829, 629 A.2d 379 (1993); <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>129 Conn. 211, 222, 27 A.2d 166 (1942); as well as trusts in which the trustee has discretion to make distributions or to accumulate income. See, e.g., <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>133 Conn. 31, 39, 47 A.2d 865 (1946) (\u201ca trustee, in determining whether to make expenditures under a discretionary trust for support, is entitled to take into consideration other means of support available to the beneficiary\u201d). This phrase alone, however, does not indicate the precise level of discretion conferred upon the trustee, the determination of which, in this case, is essential to identifying the availability of the trust\u2019s funds to the plaintiff. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the Probate Court\u2019s characterization of the trust as a \u201cspecial needs, discretionary trust\u201d necessarily determined the issue in the present case, namely, whether the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Moreover, we note that previous decisions by this court, and their underlying public policy, counsel against the plaintiffs interpretation. This court pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>viously has recognized \u201cthat the application of the collateral estoppel doctrine has dramatic consequences for the party against whom the doctrine is applied. [Therefore] [c]ourts should be careful that the effect of the doctrine does not work an injustice. In applying the doctrine, the court must specifically determine that an issue that is presented in the second case was necessary to the judgment in the first case . . . and that the broader purposes of the doctrine are satisfied.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 261-62. \u201cThus, [t]he doctrines of preclusion . . . should be flexible and must give way when their mechanical application would frustrate other social policies based on values equally or more important than the convenience afforded by finality in legal controversies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Because we have recognized that applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel has harsh consequences, namely, cutting off a party\u2019s right to future litigation on a given issue, we have been reluctant to uphold the invocation of the doctrine unless the issues are completely identical. See, e.g., <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>268 Conn. 541, 556, 848 A.2d 352 (2004) (declining to apply doctrine because issues presented were not identical); <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 62 (declining to apply doctrine due to deferential standard of review in initial proceeding); <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Patio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 464-65 (Appellate Court improperly concluded that parties were estopped from litigating definition of \u201cfine furniture\u201d in cease and desist action because it was necessarily determined in previous proceeding); <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 261 (issues not sufficiently identical for collateral estoppel to serve as bar); <em>Nancy G. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Chil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>dren &amp; </em>Families, 248 Conn. 672, 682, 733 A.2d 136 (1999) (declining to apply collateral estoppel based on inference to be drawn from initial proceeding); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 40 (issues not sufficiently identical to warrant issue preclusion); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 344-46 (finding in employment termination proceeding does not preclude future litigation on issue of wilful misconduct under doctrine of collateral estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In the present case, if we were to accept the plaintiffs claim, as adopted by the dissent, we would be premising the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel on a mere inference. As we previously have discussed, the issues were not, on their face, identical. The plaintiff argues, and the dissent agrees, however, that by resolving the issue of creditors\u2019 rights, the Probate Court necessarily determined the rights of the plaintiff. This claim is premised on the unproven, implicit assertion that a creditor enjoys the same rights to a trust as a beneficiary. In other words, the plaintiff asks us to infer the rights of the plaintiff from the Probate Court\u2019s decision regarding the rights of creditors. We are unwilling to do so. In this case, the addition of an inferential step is sufficient to negate the required identity of the issues. See, e.g., <em>Nancy G. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Families, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 682 (declining to infer from adoption order that child had been \u201cplaced\u201d within meaning of statute for collateral estoppel purposes); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 344-46 (issue of wilful misconduct was not necessarily determined by termination hearing).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Contrary to the conclusion reached by the dissent, the rights of the beneficiary and a creditor of the beneficiary are not in lockstep. It is true that \u201c[a] transferee or creditor of a trust beneficiary cannot compel the trustee to make discretionary distributions if the beneficiary personally could not do so.\u201d 2 Restatement (Third), Trusts \u00a7 60, comment (e), p. 409 (2003). Thus, if the beneficiary does not have a right to access freely the assets of the trust, a creditor is likewise precluded from reaching those assets. The converse, however, does not necessarily follow. The right of a creditor to reach the trust is not determinative of the right of the beneficiary to do so. It is possible for a trustee to be ordered to make payment to the beneficiary even when the creditor cannot similarly force payment from the trust. \u201c[A] trustee\u2019s refusal to make distributions might not constitute an abuse [of discretion] as against an assignee or creditor even when, under the standards applicable to the power, a decision to refuse distributions to the beneficiary might have constituted an abuse in the absence of the assignment or attachment. This is because the extent to which the designated beneficiary might actually benefit from a distribution is relevant to the justification and reasonableness of the trustee\u2019s decision in relation to the settlor\u2019s purposes and the effects on other beneficiaries.\u201d Id. This court considers the rights of a trust beneficiary to be distinct from the rights of the beneficiary\u2019s creditor. In <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>119 Conn. 131, 139-41, 174 A. 308 (1934), this court considered as separate questions the beneficiary\u2019s right to access the principal of a support trust and a creditor\u2019s ability to reach the beneficiary\u2019s trust income.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Zeoli </em>further undermines the dissenting opinion\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a] creditor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>rights to reach the assets of a trust are coextensive with a beneficiary\u2019s right to reach those assets . . . .\u201d In <em>Zeoli, </em>this court undertook a two part analysis. <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 86. First the court analyzed the right of a creditor to reach the assets held in trust for the beneficiaries. Id., 88. Second, after determining that a creditor could <em>not </em>access the trust funds, the court nevertheless went on to consider whether funds were available to the beneficiaries. Id., 91. The fact that this court independently analyzed both the rights of a creditor and the rights of the beneficiaries strongly suggests that their rights are not, as the dissenting opinion claims, coextensive. Were the dissent correct, it would have been wholly unnecessary for this court to analyze separately the beneficiaries\u2019 right to the trust assets after the court first determined that a creditor could not reach those assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In addition, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is based on notions of judicial economy, such that \u201cwhere a party has fully and fairly litigated his claims, he may be barred from future actions on matters not raised in the prior proceeding. But the scope of matters precluded necessarily depends on what has occurred in the former adjudication.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Truck Service, Inc., </em>253 Conn. 416, 423, 752 A.2d 509 (2000).

Id. In the present case, where the two decisions were reached nearly simultaneously, there is no strong reason to afford one precedence over the other.

Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the testator intended to create a discretionary, supplemental needs trust, the assets of which should not be considered available for medicaid purposes. The department, however, contends that the testamentary language indicates that the testator intended the trust to provide for the plaintiffs general support, in which case it would constitute an asset available to the plaintiff. We agree with the department that the testator intended to create a general support trust and, therefore, we further agree that the trust coipus and income properly may be considered to be available to the plaintiff for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We begin by setting forth our applicable standard of review. Resolution of this issue requires us to determine whether the hearing officer properly construed the terms of the trust instrument. \u201cThe construction of a will presents a question of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Canaan National Bank </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>217 Conn. 330, 335, 586 A.2d 562 (1991).

This principle \u201chas served primarily to prevent the States from conjuring fictional sources of income and resources or imputing financial support from persons who have no obligation to furnish it or by overvaluing assets in a manner that attributes nonexistent resources to recipients.\u201d <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>470 U.S. 184, 200, 105 S. Ct. 1138, 84 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u201cFor the purposes of determining eligibility for the [mjedicaid program, an available asset is one that is actually available to the applicant or one that the applicant has the legal right, authority or power to obtain or to have applied for the applicant\u2019s general or medical support. If the terms of a trust provide for the support of an applicant, the refusal of a trustee to make a distribution from the trust does not render the trust an unavailable asset.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-261 (c). For medicaid purposes, general support trusts are considered available because a beneficiary can compel distribution of the trust income. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-321.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In other words, the beneficiary has a \u201clegal right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>... to obtain\u201d the funds. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-261 (c). Conversely, supplemental needs trusts, in which a trustee retains unfettered discretion to withhold the income, are not considered available to the beneficiary. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hurlbutt, </em>157 Conn. 315, 327, 254 A.2d 460 (1968) (spendthrift trust not open to alienation or assignment by anyone until income paid over to beneficiary); <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>supra, 119 Conn. 141 (beneficiary may not alienate or assign interest of spendthrift trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that in the construction of a testamentary trust, the expressed intent of the testator must control. This intent is to be determined from reading the instrument as a whole in the light of the circumstances surrounding the testator when the instrument was executed, including the condition of his estate, his relations to his family and beneficiaries and their situation and condition.\u201d <em>Gimbel </em>v. <em>Bernard F. &amp; Alva B. Gimbel Foundation, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 21, 26, 347 A.2d 81 (1974). Therefore, in determining whether the assets of a testamentary trust are available to a beneficiary, this court considers whether the testator intended to create a supplemental needs trust or a general support trust. See <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 91-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The leading case in this state on trust construction in relation to medicaid eligibility is <em>Zeoli. </em>In that case, the plaintiffs, two mentally disabled sisters, appealed from the department of social services\u2019 decision to terminate their medicaid benefits for having excess assets in the form of a testamentary trust devised to them by their father. Id., 84-85. The language of the bequest granted the trustee \u201cabsolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d to make distributions to either daughter, \u201cregard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>less of whether any one of my daughters may be totally deprived of any benefit hereunder.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86-87 n.2. The trust instrument further provided that \u201c[w]ithout in any way limiting the absolute discretion of my Trustee, it is my fond hope that my trustee pay or apply the net income or principal of the trust for the maintenance, support, education, health and general welfare of . . . my daughters . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. This court, after analyzing the testamentary language, concluded that \u201cthe testator\u2019s intent was to provide the trustee with sufficient flexibility to use the funds under the trust solely for supplemental support.\u201d Id., 90. Therefore, \u201c[s]ince the assets held in the spendthrift trust were not intended for the plaintiffs\u2019 general support, they could not compel their distribution\u201d and the trust corpus and income could not be considered available. Id., 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Although the factual posture of the present case is similar to <em>Zeoli, </em>notably, the testamentary language reflective of the testators\u2019 intent is not. In the present case, the trust instrument manifests the testator\u2019s unambiguous intent to create a general support trust whereas the <em>Zeoli </em>trust unequivocally indicated the testator\u2019s intent to provide for the beneficiaries\u2019 supplemental needs. In <em>Zeoli, </em>the trust instrument was replete with references to the \u201cabsolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d afforded the trustees in their decision-making process. See id., 86-87 n.2. In addition to the overt references to the unfettered discretion of the trustees, the court in <em>Zeoli </em>deemed the provision authorizing the trastee to discriminate among the beneficiaries when making distributions highly probative of the vast level of discretion the testator intended to confer on the trustee. See id., 90. In the present case, however, the testator granted the trustees \u201csole discretion\u201d to make distributions and provided them with factors to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sider when making \u201cdiscretionary distributions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This language is not as strong as that used in <em>Zeoli </em>and suggests that the testator in the present case intended to confer a lesser amount of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Kolodney </em>v. <em>Kolodney, </em>6 Conn. App. 118, 121-22, 503 A.2d 625 (1986) (distinguishing \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d from \u201csole discretion\u201d); <em>Gimbel </em>v. <em>Bernard F. &amp; Alva B. Gimbel Foundation, Inc., </em>supra, 166 Conn. 27-28 (trust instrument providing for \u201csole, absolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d recognized by court as having \u201cimparted to the trustees the widest possible discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The principal distinction between <em>Zeoli </em>and the present case, however, is the manner in which the respective testators expressed their intentions regarding the use of the trust funds. In <em>Zeoli, </em>after establishing the trust, the testator provided in his will that <em>\u201cit is my fond hope </em>that my trustee pay or apply the net income or principal of the trust for the maintenance, support, education, health and general welfare of [the beneficiaries] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 86-87 n.2. The court interpreted this to mean that \u201c[t]he combination of express and precatory terms in the will attempts to grant the trustee flexibility to provide the support that would benefit either of the beneficiaries the most, that is, imposing on the trustee the legal duty to furnish only supplementary support.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Id., 91. In the present case, the testator created the trust with the following language: \u201cIf [the plaintiff] is then living, the trust established for her shall be retained by my trustees to hold, manage, invest and reinvest said share as a Trust Fund, paying to or expending for the benefit of [the plaintiff] so much of the net income and principal of said Trust as the Trustees, <em>in their sole discretion, shall deem proper for her health, support in reasonable comfort, best interests and welfare </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the trustees\u2019 \u201csole discretion\u201d is limited by the ascertainable standard of the plaintiffs \u201chealth, support in reasonable comfort, best interests and welfare See, e.g., <em>Kolodney </em>v. <em>Kolodney, </em>supra, 6 Conn. App. 121 (\u201cplaintiffs discretion limited by a standard, that of comfortable maintenance, support and education\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Put simply, whereas the testator in <em>Zeoli </em>imbued his trustees with \u201cabsolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d and noted his mere <em>desire </em>that the trust be used for the maintenance and support of the beneficiaries; <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 86-87 n.2; the testator in the present case created the trust for the purpose of supporting the plaintiff \u201cin reasonable comfort . . . .\u201d See, e.g., <em>Kolodney </em>v. <em>Kolodney, </em>supra, 122 (\u201c[i]t is clear from the testator\u2019s use of the comfortable maintenance, support and education standard that the trustee\u2019s discretion was not intended to be absolute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Absent the requisite testamentary intent to provide only for the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental needs, we agree with the department and conclude that the trust in question is a general support trust. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the hearing officer properly concluded that the trust corpus and income were available to the plaintiff for the purpose of determining her medicaid eligibility.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The plaintiffs final claim on appeal is that the hearing officer improperly excluded extrinsic evidence probative of the testator\u2019s intent.

On November 3, 1987, the testator, Lyman M. Corcoran, executed a will that took effect on May 29, 1989, the date of his death. The will contained a provision that created a trust fund for the benefit of the plaintiff, Pamela D. Corcoran. The testator appointed the plaintiffs two sisters, Robin C. Turek and Imogen J.C. Kellogg, as trustees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>After the testator\u2019s death, the plaintiff applied for and received medicaid benefits, which commenced on November 28, 1989.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 26, 2001, the defendant, the department of social services (department), discontinued these benefits, effective March 31, 2001, when it determined that the plaintiff was ineligible for assistance because her \u201cavailable assets\u201d from the trust exceeded the prescribed limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">On February 13,2001, approximately two weeks prior to the department\u2019s discontinuation of the plaintiffs benefits, the trustees petitioned the Probate Court to construe the terms of the trust to determine whether the trust assets were \u201cvulnerab[le] to the claims of the . . . [department] that the trust assets were \u2018available\u2019 to the [plaintiff].\u201d The department, the trustees and the plaintiff were parties to the Probate Court proceeding and participated in the hearing on this matter on May 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Probate Court thereafter issued its order on June 12, 2001. In its order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Probate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he trust at issue is ... a \u2018special needs, discretionary trust\u2019 not otherwise available to the state of Connecticut or other creditors of the trust beneficiary [i.e., the plaintiff] for her care and support.\u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[t]he trustees have the authority and power to consider all other sources of principal and income, other than those of the trust, including payments by the state of Connecticut and others, before utilizing the assets of the trust for the [plaintiffs] benefit.\u201d The court therefore determined that \u201c[t]he trust assets are not available to the claims of the state of Connecticut for past or future care, except as specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>cally authorized and approved by the trustees in their sound discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On March 28, 2001, before the Probate Court issued its order but after the trustees had commenced the action in the Probate Court, the plaintiff appealed from the department\u2019s decision to discontinue her medicaid benefits to an administrative hearing officer (hearing officer). Both the department and the plaintiff were parties to this appeal and participated in the hearings held on April 26, 2001, and May 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On July 12, 2001, one month after the Probate Court had issued its order, the hearing officer issued a ruling on the hearing record, in which she declared: \u201cI rejected and ignored any correspondence sent after June 8,2001.

In conclusion, the hearing officer stated that, \u201cby their actions and imputed intentions, the trustees have shown circumstances under which they can and will make a payment from the trust to or on behalf of the [plaintiff],\u201d and, \u201c[u]nder the regulations ...

Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . .

Therefore, just as the Probate Court was required to determine whether \u201cthe trust assets were \u2018available\u2019 to [the plaintiff],\u201d the hearing officer, too, was required to decide \u201cwhether the corpus, or principal of such a trust [was] an [asset] available\u201d to the plaintiff. Dept, of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual, index 4030.80 (B) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The majority further concedes that the Probate Court recognized its duty, in the court\u2019s own words, \u201cto con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>strue the will of the [testator] in the context of the trust\u2019s vulnerability to the claims of the . . . [department] <em>that the trust assets were \u2018available\u2019 to the [plaintiff].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The majority, however, dismisses the Probate Court\u2019s statement of the issue to be decided because \u201c[t]he Probate Court . . . did not phrase its order or its analysis in terms of availability to the plaintiff.\u201d Footnote 17 of the majority opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I believe that the majority misconstrues the Probate Court\u2019s order. In its order, the Probate Court expressly adopted the findings and recommendations of the committee,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which reasoned that the trustees could not consider making a distribution for the plaintiffs past or future care and support without taking into account all of the plaintiffs other income and assets, including any public welfare benefits to which the plaintiff was entitled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Probate Court\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>trust assets were not available to the claims of the department or other creditors thus was based upon the Probate Court\u2019s finding that the trust assets were not available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The majority suggests that the dissent is concluding that \u201c[t]he right of a creditor to reach the trust is . . . <em>determinative </em>of the right of the beneficiary to do so.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is not the case. I merely agree with the well established principle that \u201c[a] transferee or creditor of a trust beneficiary cannot compel the trustee to make discretionary distributions if the beneficiary personally could not do so.\u201d 2 Restatement (Third), Trusts \u00a7 60, comment (e), p. 409 (2003). A creditor\u2019s rights to reach the assets of a trust are coextensive with a beneficiary\u2019s right to reach those assets; that is, the creditor has no greater rights to the trust assets than the beneficiary possesses. See, e.g., <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>261 Ind. 193, 205, 301 N.E.2d 349 (1973) (\u201c[i]f the beneficiary himself cannot compel the trustee to pay over any part of the trust fund, his assignee and his creditors are in no better position\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); IIA A. Scott, Trusts (4th Ed. 1987) \u00a7 155, pp. 153-54 (same); see also G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d Ed. Rev. 1992) \u00a7 228, pp. 525-26 (\u201cUntil the trustee elects to make a payment the beneficiary has a mere expectancy. Nor can a creditor compel the trustee to exercise his discretion to make payments. If . . . [the beneficiary\u2019s] creditors seek to take [the beneficiary\u2019s interest], before the trustee has made an election to pay or apply, the . . . creditor has no remedies against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the trustee because he stands in the shoes of the beneficiary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">This court addressed a similar question involving nearly identical facts in <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 83. In <em>Zeoli, </em>the defendant commissioner of social services (commissioner) terminated medical assistance payments to the plaintiffs, two mentally handicapped sisters, on the ground that the plaintiffs had assets available to them in excess of the prescribed limits. Id., 84-85. The assets consisted of a joint savings account that was held in the name of the plaintiffs\u2019 brother as trustee, with the plaintiffs as beneficiaries. Id., 85. In determining that the savings account constituted an asset of a spendthrift testamentary trust, this court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs [could not] compel distribution or in any manner alienate the [trust funds] beyond that authorized to be distributed as supplementary support in the trustee\u2019s discretion\u201d; id., 95; and, therefore, the commissioner could not terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 medical assistance benefits. See id., 97; see also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Brownell, </em>95 Conn. 216, 224, 111 A. 182 (1920) (recognizing that previous cases had \u201cdecided . . . that where trustees were given, as in the will before the court, discretionary power to give or [to] withhold from a beneficiary income, he was incapable of alienating it and his creditors could not take it\u201d); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>72 Conn. 45, 50, 43 A. 564 (1899) (\u201cAs the beneficiary could [compel distribution of the trust income], so a creditor of the beneficiary may do it. Equity allows the creditor to avail himself of the interest which the beneficiary has.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, in determining a creditor\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to reach trust assets, this court\u2019s precedent and other legal authority inform us that an analysis of the beneficiaiy\u2019s right to compel distribution of the funds is an inherent part of this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The majority states that <em>Zeoli </em>undermines the conclusion that the rights of a creditor are coextensive with the rights of a beneficiary. According to the majority, the court in <em>Zeoli </em>first analyzed the right of the creditor to reach the assets held in trust for the beneficiaries, and, only after determining that the creditor did not have access to the trust funds did the court consider whether the funds were available to the beneficiaries. The majority thus asserts that, if the rights of creditors are coextensive with those of beneficiaries, there would have been no need for this court to conduct a separate analysis of the beneficiaries\u2019 rights to the assets of the trust. I disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of <em>Zeoli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In <em>Zeoli, </em>the court did not undertake a two part analysis of the issue, as the majority suggests. In analyzing the right of the creditor to reach the assets held in trust for the beneficiaries, the court concluded that \u201c[a] trust [that] creates a fund for the benefit of another, secures it against the beneficiary\u2019s own improvidence, and places it beyond the reach of his creditors is a spendthrift trust. . . . Section 52-321 of the General Statutes provides that trust fund income is not subject to the claims of creditors of the beneficiary if the trustee is granted the power to accumulate or [to] withhold trust income [from the beneficiary] or if the income has been expressly given for the support of the beneficiary or his family. . . . Since . . . [the] will specifically provides the trustee with the power to accumulate and [to] withhold trust income, its language creates a spendthrift trust under \u00a7 52-321.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 88. Our reference in <em>Zeoli </em>to the trustee\u2019s \u201cpower to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>accumulate and [to] withhold trust income\u201d; id.; makes sense only if understood to mean the trustee\u2019s power to accumulate and to withhold such income from a beneficiary of the trust. Moreover, the court explicitly recognized that a spendthrift trust secures the assets against the beneficiary\u2019s own improvidence. Id. The court in <em>Zeoli </em>thus equated a creditor\u2019s rights to reach the assets of a trust with those of the trust\u2019s beneficiaries. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Furthermore, the \u201csecond\u201d portion of the <em>Zeoli </em>opinion, which focused on the rights of the beneficiaries, addressed specific arguments raised by the commissioner, some of which concerned the intent of the testator to make the assets of the trust available to the beneficiaries. Id., 88-91. In its analysis, the court explained why each argument was unpersuasive. See id., 90-92. The court\u2019s response to the commissioner\u2019s arguments thus supported, but was not essential to, its prior conclusion that the rights of creditors to the assets of a trust were the same as the rights of beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">It also should be recognized that, although the Probate Court labeled the trust created for the benefit of the plaintiff as a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust, the court did not mean \u201cspecial needs\u201d as defined by the majority or the federal statute to which it cites.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, the Probate Court actually meant to label the trust as a \u201csupplemental needs\u201d trust. In its report, the committee addressed the contrasting claims of the parties, describing the arguments as a dispute between whether the trust qualified as one for the plaintiffs \u201cgeneral support\u201d or one for her \u201c \u2018special needs.\u2019 \u201d Under a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust, as defined by federal statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and by the majority, however, the state <em>will </em>receive the funds remaining in the trust upon the beneficiary\u2019s death. Such a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>does not exist in the trust in the present case. If the Probate Court truly had intended to classify the trust, and the trustees\u2019 claims concerning the trust, as a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust as defined by the majority, then no controversy would have arisen between the parties because a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust, under the definition advanced by the majority, gives the state the right to access the trust funds. Thus, the Probate Court could not have intended to construe the trust in such a way, and clearly intended to equate a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust with a \u201csupplemental needs\u201d trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Moreover, the trustees\u2019 petition to the Probate Court likewise uses the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust, but obviously could not have intended such a classification in the manner defined by the majority. Instead, the trustees made clear that they were seeking \u201ca ruling classifying [the] trust as a \u2018special needs\u2019 trust, <em>from which it is neither appropriate nor required to reimburse [the] state for benefits received by [the plaintiff] </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In their petition, the trustees also highlighted the provisions in the trust granting them discretion to disburse funds and requiring them to consider other sources of support to the plaintiff and \u201c \u2018the advisability of supplementing such income or assets.\u2019 \u201d On the basis of these provisions, the trustees described the intention of the testator that the trust \u201cbe used, <em>in the discretion of the trustees, to supplement, not supplant, such benefits, and the trustees believe that their administration of [the] trust is in accordance with that intention.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, it is beyond serious debate that the trustees in fact intended to ask for a construction of the trust as a \u201csupplemental needs\u201d trust that is unreachable by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In light of the fact that the Probate Court determined, and the trustees in fact claimed, that the will established a trust for the plaintiffs supplemental needs, it is further apparent that the Probate Court necessarily determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>that the trust assets were not available to the plaintiff. As the majority itself recognizes, and our precedent makes clear, \u201csupplemental needs trusts, in which a trustee retains unfettered discretion to withhold the income, <em>are not considered available to the beneficiary. Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hurlbutt, </em>157 Conn. 315, 327, 254 A.2d 460 (1968) (spendthrift trust not open to alienation or assignment by anyone until paid over to beneficiary); <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>[119 Conn. 131, 141, 174 A. 308 (1934)] (beneficiary may not alienate or assign interest of spendthrift trust).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Part II of the majority opinion; see also <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 90, 92, 95 (concluding that trust was created for beneficiaries\u2019 supplementary support, that because \u201cthe assets held in the spendthrift trust were not intended for the [beneficiaries\u2019] general support, they could not compel their distribution,\u201d and that beneficiaries could not \u201ccompel distribution or in any manner alienate the money in the account beyond that authorized to be distributed as supplementary support in the trustee\u2019s discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Accordingly, in my view, the majority makes a distinction without a difference, as the Probate Court previously had necessarily determined the issue later decided by the hearing officer regarding the availability of the trust assets to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">I next must determine whether the parties \u201cactually litigated\u201d this issue, whether the Probate Court and the hearing officer \u201cdetermined [the issue] by a valid and final judgment,\u201d and whether \u201cthat determination [was] essential to the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DaCruz </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 686, quoting <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>In their petition to the Probate Court for construction of the trust under the will, a proceeding in which the department was a party, the trustees requested that the court \u201cconstrue the terms of [the] trust as they pertain to any rights the state of Connecticut . . . may have to claim reimbursement from the trust for benefits heretofore provided to the [plaintiff] by [the] state, and/ or for any such benefits provided by the state to the [plaintiff] in the future.\u201d The report of the committee, which the Probate Court incorporated by specific reference in its order, sets forth the arguments of the parties as follows: \u201c[T]he trustees maintain [that] the testator intended the assets of the trust be used to supplement whatever other income and assets are available to the [plaintiff]. [The department] disagrees and argues that the trust is one providing for the general support of the [plaintiff] and that the trust principal and income should be distributed to [the plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In its June 12,2001 order, the Probate Court acknowledged that the trustees had asked it \u201cto construe the will ... in the context of the trust\u2019s vulnerability to the claims of . . . the [department] that the trust assets were \u2018available\u2019 to the [plaintiff].\u201d Upon consideration of the evidence, the Probate Court determined that \u201c[t]he trust at issue [was] a \u2018special needs, discretionary trust,\u2019 not otherwise available to the state . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">By comparison, at the administrative hearing, the department presented its claim that, \u201cbased upon existing case law and the way that the trust is written by [the testator] . . . the trust is a general support trust and . . . was intended to provide for the needs of [the plaintiff] and there is nothing in the trust to so indicate that it is to be used only as a supplemental needs [trust].\u201d In its request for reconsideration of the hearing officer\u2019s July 17, 2001 decision, the department recognized that \u201c[t]o determine whether the present trust is an available asset of [the plaintiff], the hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>needed to determine whether the trust is a general support [trust] or a discretionary supplemental needs trust.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">At the administrative hearing, the plaintiff stated that \u201c[t]he issues in [the] construction action [in the Probate Court] are identical to the issues [in] the administrative hearing . . . .\u201d Moreover, the plaintiff asserted that application of the relevant case law \u201cleaves no doubt as to the fact that this [trust] is intended to be a supplemental needs trust, not a general support trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">After receiving evidence, the hearing officer found that \u201c[t]he [department\u2019s] reason for discontinuing the [plaintiffs] benefits was [that] \u2018[t]he value of [her] assets [was] more than the amount [the department] allow[s] [her] to have.\u2019 \u201d The hearing officer also determined, contrary to the determination of the Probate Court, that \u201c[t]he corpus and income of the trust are an available asset to the [plaintiff].\u201d Furthermore, unlike the Probate Court, the hearing officer concluded that \u201c[t]he trust is not exempt from consideration as an asset in determining the [plaintiffs] ongoing eligibility for assistance from the [department],\u201d and that \u201cthe [department\u2019s] action to discontinue the [plaintiffs] benefits . . . was correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">From an examination of the arguments advanced by the parties in both proceedings, there is no question that they actually litigated the issue regarding the nature of the plaintiffs trust assets before the Probate Court and the hearing officer. In both proceedings, the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ties<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> asked the Probate Court and the hearing officer to determine whether the trust assets were \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Moreover, as is evident from the Probate Court\u2019s order and the hearing officer\u2019s decision, the key fact necessarily determined by the Probate Court, and relitigated subsequently in the administrative appeal, was the determination of the character of the plaintiffs trust funds as either available assets or unavailable assets. Although the majority posits that it \u201ccannot conclude that the Probate Court\u2019s characterization of the trust as a \u2018special needs, discretionary trust\u2019 necessarily determined the issue in the present case, namely, whether the trust was an asset available to the plaintiff,\u201d the explicit language of the Probate Court\u2019s clear statement of the issue, its declaration in its order that the trust assets were \u201cnot otherwise available to the state of Connecticut or other creditors of the [plaintiff] for her care and support,\u201d the necessary implication from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>this determination that the plaintiff could not access the trust funds, and the fact that the Probate Court equated a \u201cspecial needs\u201d trust with a \u201csupplementary needs\u201d trust, the assets of which are unreachable by the plaintiff, all serve to refute this supposition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>trary to the majority\u2019s assertion, therefore, the Probate Court\u2019s determination in this regard was \u201cessential to the judgment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>DaCruz </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 686; because the availability of the trust assets constituted the decisive issue presented to and determined by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Accordingly, because the parties actually litigated, and both the Probate Court and the hearing officer necessarily determined, the issue of the availability of the trust assets to the plaintiff, I believe that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded the hearing officer\u2019s subsequent construction of the trust<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that the Probate Court\u2019s order should have been conclusive with respect to this matter.

Specifically, the department maintains that, while the plaintiff argued that the Probate Court\u2019s decision should be given preclusive effect before the hearing officer, on appeal to the trial court, the plaintiff merely argued that the hearing officer improperly excluded the Probate Court order. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u2019\u2019In the present case, the trial court did address the issue of collateral estoppel in substance by stating that \u201c[t]he plaintiff claims that the hearing officer, who closed the hearing without considering the order of the Probate Court, erred in not recognizing the Probate Court\u2019s construction of the trust.\u201d We therefore conclude that the issue of collateral estoppel sufficiently was raised in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> We are mindful that, in its order, the Probate Court described its duty \u201cto construe the will of the [testator] in the context of the trust\u2019s vulnerability to the claims of the . . .

Instead, the dissenting opinion maintains that the plaintiffs claim is properly premised on an \u201cinescapable implication . . . .\u201d Regardless of the nomenclature employed, the fact remains that collateral estoppel is intended to preclude litigation when an <em>identical </em>issue previously has been decided. If an \u201cinference\u201d or \u201cimplication\u201d is needed to equate the contested issues, they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>sufficiently identical to warrant the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, with its harsh results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-321 provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 52-321a and 52-352b:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u201c(a) If property has been given to trustees to pay over the income to any person, without provision for accumulation or express authorization to the trustees to withhold the income, and the income has not been expressly given for the support of the beneficiary or his family, the income shall be liable in equity to the claims of all creditors of the beneficiary. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201c(d) If any such trust has been expressly provided to be for the support of the beneficiary or his family, a court of equity having jurisdiction may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>make such order regarding the surplus, if any, not required for the support of the beneficiary or his family, as justice and equity may require. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\"> The plaintiff makes much of the fact that the testator authorized the trustees to consider the \u201cadvisability of <em>supplementing </em>such income or assets\u201d in making distributions.

Id., 32. It is axiomatic that creditors have limited access to spendthrift trusts. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-321.

The principal of such a trust is an available asset to the extent that the terms of the trust entitle the individual to receive trust principal or to have trust principal applied for his or her general or medical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\u201c3. Under circumstances described in subparagraph 2 above, the trust principal is considered an available asset if the trustee\u2019s failure to distribute the principal for the benefit of the individual in accordance with the terms of the trust would constitute an abuse of discretion by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">\u201c4. The Department considers the following factors in determining whether the trustee would be abusing his or her discretion by refusing to distribute trust principal to the individual:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">\u201ca. the clarity of the settlor\u2019s intention to provide for the general or medical support of the individual; and</p>\n<p id=\"AyC\">\u201cb. the degree of discretion afforded to the trustee; and</p>\n<p id=\"And\">\u201cc. the value of the trust created, with a higher dollar value tending to indicate an intent to provide for general or medical support; and</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">\u201cd. the history of trust expenditures prior to the filing of an application for assistance for or on behalf of the individual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> The trust document describes the relationship between the testator, the trustees and the plaintiff only; it does not bind third parties, such as the department, in any manner, nor does it grant any rights to them. This is precisely why, in any analysis of a creditor\u2019s right to reach the assets of a trust, the initial and necessary issue that the court must determine is the extent of the beneficiary\u2019s right to access the trust assets, and it is this determination that requires the court to construe the trust document.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Despite this fact, the majority states that the Probate Court did not determine the nature of the plaintiffs right to access the trust assets but only determined the rights of the plaintiffs creditors to reach those assets. If the majority\u2019s assertion is correct, however, then there would be no need to analyze the trust language to determine the plaintiffs right to access the trust assets, as the majority does in part K of its opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\"> The committee\u2019s report provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he [testator\u2019s] will . . . outlines factors which the trustees are directed to consider before [they] may exercise . . . discretion, including other income and assets available to the [plaintiff]. In its post-hearing brief, [the department] alleges that the trust fails to mention that the trustees are to consider whether [the plaintiff] receives public welfare benefits prior to distributing funds to her or for her benefit from the trust. The compelling inference to be drawn from that argument is that such benefits are not to be considered as income or assets available to the beneficiary which the trust does contemplate. The committee is of the opinion that [the public welfare] benefits <em>were'precisely </em>why the testator created the trust in the manner set forth in his will. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>[I]t is difficult to comprehend why [the department] would consider its benefits something apart from income and assets available to a beneficiary, particularly as such benefits are, among others, commonly referred to as <em>entitlements.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The committee then recommended that the Probate Court \u201cissue a ruling classifying the trust as a special needs trust and that prior to making distributions, the trustees consider <em>all </em>other income and assets [including public welfare benefits] available to or for [the plaintiff].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> As with creditors, state agencies may not reach assets that are otherwise unavailable to the beneficiary.

Under the mutuality rule, [pjarties who were not actually adverse to one another in a prior proceeding could not assert collateral estoppel against one another in a subsequent action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Torres v. Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 110, 135, 733 A.2d 817 (1999), quoting <em>Labbe </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>239 Conn. 168,186, 682 A.2d 490 (1996). This court has recognized, however, that \u201c[t]he mutuality requirement has . . . been widely abandoned as an ironclad rule. . . . [T]he [mutuality] rule ... no longer operate [s] automatically to bar use of [the doctrine of] collateral estoppel . . . but . . . circumstances may exist in which lack of mutuality would render application of [the doctrine] unfair.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 135-36, quoting <em>Labbe </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>supra, 186. Thus, \u201c[a] party precluded from relitigating an issue with an opposing party ... is also precluded from doing so with another person unless the fact that he lacked full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action or other circumstances justify affording him an opportunity to relitigate the issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 136, quoting 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 29, p. 291 (1982). This maxim is not implicated in the present case because the plaintiff and the department were adverse parties in both proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\"> The majority contends that it cannot \u201cpremis[e] the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel on a mere inference,\u201d and that \u201cthe addition of an inferential step is sufficient to negate the required identity of the issues. \u201d An abstract or unnecessary inference does not flow from the Probate Court\u2019s determination, however; instead, a determination of the plaintiffs lack of access to the trust assets is an <em>inescapable implication </em>of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Moreover, the cases on which the majority relies in support of its conclusion, namely, <em>Nancy G. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Families, </em>248 Conn. 672, 682, 733 A.2d 136 (1999), and <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 344-46, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993), do not support its proposition. In both cases, this court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not preclude the subsequent litigation of an issue because the record did not indicate the specific basis on which the determination of the issue had been made and more than one basis for the determination could have existed. See <em>Nancy G. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children </em>&amp; <em>Families, </em>supra, 681-82; <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 344-46. Thus, in <em>Nancy G., </em>we determined that, because the Probate Court\u2019s decree was \u201csusceptible of two conclusions\u201d; <em>Nancy G. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Families, </em>supra, 681; the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not preclude litigation of the relevant issue in the subsequent proceeding. Id., 682. Likewise, in <em>Crochiere, </em>the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply because \u201c[t]he record before this court regarding the 1987 termination hearing reveal[ed] <em>only that the plaintiff was dismissed. </em>The dismissal, therefore, may have been for inefficiency or incompetence, insubordination against reasonable rules or disability as shown by competent medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\u201cIn the absence of a record to support the defendant\u2019s assertions that the hearing officer at the termination proceeding concluded that the plaintiff had inappropriately touched a student and that, as a consequence, he was terminated as a teacher, the [workers\u2019 compensation] commissioner was not precluded from inquiring into the allegations of willful misconduct or from deciding that very issue in the context of the workers\u2019 compensation hearing.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 344-46. In the present case, the Probate Court was clear in that it was called upon to determine whether the trust assets were available to the plaintiff, and it determined that those assets were not available to either the state or the plaintiffs creditors and, as a necessary consequence, were not available to the plaintiff as well. Thus, <em>Nancy G. </em>and <em>Crochiere </em>are inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> This court previously has not determined whether an order of the Probate Court can collaterally estop a subsequent determination by an administrative agency on the same issue. In light of the goals of finality, economy and consistency of judgments embodied by the doctrine of collateral estoppel; e.g., <em>DaCruz v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 686; and the comparable quantum of proof necessary to establish the availability, or unavailability, of the trust assets in both the Probate Court and the administrative proceedings; see footnote 10 of this opinion and accompanying text; it appears that the doctrine of collateral estoppel properly may apply in the present case. Cf., e.g., <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Killens, </em>122 N.C. App. 685, 690, 472 S.E.2d 33 (1996) (when quantum of proof is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d with respect to court\u2019s determination in criminal case and administrative agency\u2019s determination in license revocation proceeding, party cannot relitigate issue previously decided by court); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Dept. of Licensing, </em>138 Wash. 2d 783, 797, 982 P.2d 601 (1999) (when same rules of evidence apply and issue has been fully litigated, evidentiary ruling in criminal case can have preclusive effect in subsequent administrative proceeding). Moreover, the failure to preclude relitigation of the same issue previously determined by a court, in a later administrative proceeding undoubtedly would have the effect of undermining the integrity of judicial determinations. See, e.g., <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>2 Cal. App. 4th 108, 115, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 855 (1991) (\u201c[w]hen ... it is the prior judicial decision that is being ignored in the subsequent administrative hearing, the impact on the integrity of [the] judicial system is . . . direct and magnified\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
