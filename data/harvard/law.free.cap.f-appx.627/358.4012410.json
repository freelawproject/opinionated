First, the district court concluded that the relevant one-year statute of limitations had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>run by the time plaintiffs filed suit in October 2013 and that plaintiffs had failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether equitable tolling should apply. Second, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to raise a genuine issue of-material fact as to whether they suffered actual damages as a result of the alleged TILA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief is exclusively devoted to challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to actual damages and nowhere challenges the district court\u2019s alternative conclusion that summary judgment was appropriate based on the running of the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs have therefore waived any argument that the district court erred in concluding that the statute of limitations foreclosed their TILA claim and that equitable tolling did not apply to their case. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cAn appellant abandons all issues not raised and argued in its initial brief on appeal.\u201d). In light of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to contest the district court\u2019s determination that the statute of limitations barred their TILA claim, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on that basis alone.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-22\">. The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract, trespass to try title, quiet title, and declaratory judgment. However, because plaintiffs have not appealed those adverse rulings, our review is limited solely to considering whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 TILA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
