Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the district court dismissed Evans\u2019s action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim for relief. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii). Evans does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his action was subject to dismissal on the basis of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Evans also does not challenge the district court\u2019s alternative decision that his action was subject to dismissal on the basis that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">The dismissal by the district court of Evans\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Evans has already accumulated at least two other strikes. <em>See Evans v. Cessna, </em>No. 3:14-cv-00846, 2014 WL 6750470 (S.D.Miss. Dec. 1, 2014); <em>Evans v. Ford, </em>No. 3:13-cv-00996, 2014 WL 1355457 (S.D. Miss. April 7, 2014); <em>see also Coleman v. Tollefson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1759, 1763-64, 191 L.Ed.2d 803 (2015). Evans is therefore barred from proceeding in forma pauperis while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-27\">AFFIRMED; BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
