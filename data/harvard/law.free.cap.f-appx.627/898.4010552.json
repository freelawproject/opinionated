As a result of having his access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>privileges revoked, the employee could not continue working at the nuclear facility. The operator opposed arbitration on the ground that the dispute was not within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The district court compelled arbitration, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Defendant-Appellant Florida Power &amp; Light (\u201cFPL\u201d) operates the Turkey Point nuclear power plant. To operate a nuclear generator, FPL must comply with certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d) regulations, which state that an individual must be \u201ctrustworthy and reliable\u201d to be granted \u201cunescorted access\u201d to the nuclear facility. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.56. FPL has enacted policies to comply with NRC regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Michael Kohl is a long-time FPL employee who worked as a nuclear watch engineer at Turkey Point. In August 2012, Kohl was arrested for \u201cgrand theft.\u201d Following his arrest, FPL revoked Kohl\u2019s \u201cunescorted access\u201d to the Turkey Point nuclear facility. Without unescorted-access privileges, Kohl could not continue working as a nuclear watch engineer at Turkey Point. Kohl appealed the revocation of his access privileges to FPL management, who upheld the revocation in November 2012. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.56(() (\u201cThe procedure must provide for an impartial and independent internal management review.\u201d). Ultimately, the grand theft charges against Kohl were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Kohl is a member of Plaintiff-Appellee International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers System Council U-4 (\u201cIBEW\u201d). Kohl was covered by a collective bargaining agreement between IBEW and FPL. The agreement contains a grievance and arbitration procedure. Grievances advance through a series of steps in an attempt to settle the dispute. If a grievance remains unresolved, either party may demand arbitration. Doc. 1-3, Art. IV, \u00b6 27(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In September 2012, Kohl and IBEW filed a grievance with FPL, stating, \u201cI Mike Kohl, request that my Nuclear Access be reinstated and I be returned to work and made whole.\u201d Doc. 1-5. After his access privileges were revoked, Kohl continued to work for FPL at a different power plant as a maintenance worker, but he earned substantially less than he did as a nuclear watch engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">In November 2012, FPL informed IBEW that it would \u201cnot accept a grievance because it involves a matter that is not disciplinary in nature and is not subject to grievance and arbitration procedures.\u201d Doc. 1-8. According to FPL, decisions about nuclear access are governed by NRC regulations, and FPL, \u201cas licensee, has the sole responsibility to grant or deny unescorted access to its nuclear facilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">In January 2013, IBEW filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to compel arbitration of the dispute about Kohl\u2019s access rights. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). FPL answered, denying that the dispute was subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement. In November 2013, FPL moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. FPL asserted that the case was moot because Kohl\u2019s site-access revocation had been lifted and he was \u201cnow eligible to apply for access authorization to Turkey Point.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>The district court granted FPL\u2019s motion and dismissed the case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">On appeal, this Court vacated and remanded. <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Sys. Council U-4 v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>580 Fed.Appx. 868 (11th Cir.2014) (hereinafter <em>\u201cIBEW </em>\u201d). We held that the district court erred in dismissing the case as moot because, \u201ceven if the issue of nuclear access is moot, IBEW\u2019s request that Kohl be returned to his previous job and receive back pay is not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869. We remanded the action to the district court with instructions to determine only \u201cwhether FPL\u2019s determination of \u2018access rights\u2019 falls within the arbitration provisions of IBEW and FPL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement,\u201d such that the agreement \u201cprovides the arbitrator with authority to adjudicate this dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We instructed the court not to consider \u201cissues that go to the merits, such as whether the NRC regulations render FPL\u2019s actions unreviewable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. Of Elec. Workers Local 2150 v. NextEra Energy Point Beach, LLC, </em>762 F.3d 592, 596 (7th Cir.2014) (hereinafter <em>\u201cNextEra Energy </em>\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">On remand, the district court granted IBEW\u2019s petition to compel arbitration. According to the court, a \u201cgrievance\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement \u201cencompasses any conduct by FPL that takes a job benefit away from an employee, including nuclear access.\u201d Doc. 33 at 3. Finding that \u201cFPL took away Kohl\u2019s worksite, job title, job duties and reduced his salary[,]\u201d the court concluded that Kohl\u2019s challenge to these actions through his loss of access to Turkey Point constituted a valid and arbitrable grievance. <em>Id. </em>at 4. FPL appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court order granting a motion to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>Johnson v. KeyBank Nat\u2019l Assoc. (In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation), </em>754 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">We begin by summarizing the principles governing our review of an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement, derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Steelworkers </em>Trilogy over fifty years ago. <em>See Steelworkers v. Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960); <em>Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); <em>Steelworkers v. Am. Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">First, because arbitration is simply a matter of contract and consent, <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 1418, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986), \u201ca court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate <em>that dispute,\u201d Granite Rock Co. v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>561 U.S. 287, 297, 130 S.Ct. 2847, 2856, 177 L.Ed.2d 567 (2010) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Second, questions of whether an arbitration agreement covers a particular dispute are generally for the courts unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 649, 106 S.Ct. at 1418. Thus, if an arbitration provision\u2019s applicability to the dispute is in issue, as it is here, \u201cthe court must resolve the disagreement.\u201d <em>Granite Rock Co., </em>561 U.S. at 299-300, 130 S.Ct. at 2858 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Third, in deciding questions of arbitrability, \u201ca court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.\u201d <em>AT </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>&amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 649, 106 S.Ct. at 1419. In this case, the previous panel identified \u201cwhether the NRC regulations render FPL\u2019s actions unreviewable\u201d as such a merits issue. <em>IBEW, </em>580 Fed.Appx. at 869; <em>see also NextEra Energy, </em>762 F.3d at 596 (\u201c[W]e do <em>not </em>hold that the arbitrator may, in fact, review and overturn NextEra\u2019s revocation of Hofstra\u2019s unescorted access privileges.... But the potential weakness of the Union\u2019s claim on the merits is no defense to the arbitrability of this dispute, as a threshold question.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Fourth, and finally, \u201cwhere the contract contains an arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S.Ct. at 1419 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted; alterations adopted). In short, doubts should be resolved in favor of arbitration. <em>Id. </em>The presumption of arbitrability is \u201cparticularly applicable\u201d where an arbitration clause is broadly worded. <em>Id.; see NextEra Energy, </em>762 F.3d at 594 (\u201cWhere the arbitration clause is broad, we presume arbitrability of disputes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The presumption of arbitrability \u201capplies when an \u2018arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dasher v. RBC Bank (USA), </em>745 F.3d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 144, 190 L.Ed.2d 231 (2014) (quoting <em>Granite Rock Co., </em>561 U.S. at 301, 130 S.Ct. at 2858). Put differently, the \u201cfederal policy favoring arbitration\u201d does not \u201coverride[ ] the principle that a court may submit to arbitration only those disputes that the parties have agreed to submit.\u201d <em>Granite Rock Co., </em>561 U.S. at 302, 130 S.Ct. at 2859 (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Inetianbor v. CashCall, Inc., </em>768 F.3d 1346, 1352-53 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1735, 191 L.Ed.2d 701 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">The question before us is \u201cwhether FPL\u2019s determination of \u2018access rights\u2019 falls within the arbitration provisions of IBEW and FPL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>IBEW, </em>580 Fed.Appx. at 869. That question, in turn, depends on the definition of \u201cgrievance\u201d in the collective bargaining agreement, because only grievances may be advanced to arbitration. Doc. 1-3, Art. IV, \u00b6 27(a). The agreement defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d \u201cas a violation of the terms of this Agreement or any type of supervisory conduct which unjustly denies to any employee the employee\u2019s job or any benefit arising out of the employee\u2019s job.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">FPL contends that the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration should be reversed because the court applied the presumption of arbitrability without first determining whether the grievance and arbitrations provisions were ambiguous. And the provisions are not ambiguous, according to FPL, because the revocation of Kohl\u2019s access privileges does not fall within the plain and objective meaning of \u201csupervisory conduct,\u201d given that David Bonthron, the FPL employee who revoked Kohl\u2019s unescorted access, was not Kohl\u2019s supervisor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> FPL also argues that the \u201crobust, unequivocal public policy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>safeguard the Nation\u2019s nuclear facilities\u201d is consistent with the purportedly clear conclusion that the parties did not include this particular dispute within the grievance and arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">We first address whether the grievance and arbitration provisions are ambiguous, so as to trigger the presumption of arbitrability. <em>See Dasher, </em>745 F.3d at 1115. We must interpret an arbitration agreement by construing the contract to effectuate the intent of the parties, \u201cas determined by the objective meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Inetianbor, </em>768 F.3d at 1353 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA contract term is ambiguous if reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.\u201d Ork<em>in Exterminating Co., Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>849 F.2d 1354, 1360 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Initially, we note that FPL makes no claim that the revocation of access privileges does not or could not \u201cunjustly den[y] to any employee the employee\u2019s job or any benefit arising out of the employee\u2019s job.\u201d <em>See </em>Doc. 1-3, Art. IV., \u00b626. And, because access privileges are necessary for ah employee to work at a nuclear facility, we find that their revocation arguably denies the employee his job and his job benefits. For example, in this case, Kohl lost his job as a nuclear watch engineer and suffered a loss of job duties and salary because of FPL\u2019s revocation of his access rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Rather, FPL\u2019s challenge is limited to whether determinations of access privileges are encompassed by the. phrase \u201cany type of supervisory conduct.\u201d The collective bargaining agreement does not define the term \u201csupervisory conduct,\u201d or, for that matter, \u201csupervisor.\u201d FPL interprets \u201csupervisory conduct\u201d to exclude actions from those who, like Bonthron, exercise authority over employees in the interest of management but do not supervise employees\u2019 job duties or performance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This may, in fact, be a reasonable interpretation. We do not need to decide whether it is, however, because we conclude that the grievance and arbitration provisions are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that covers FPL\u2019s determination of access rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">In interpreting a contract, we must read the words of the contract in the context of the contract as a whole. <em>Inetianbor, </em>768 F.3d at 1353. In this case, the context is that of a collective bargaining agreement governing relations between labor and management. \u201cA collective bargaining agreement is an effort to erect a system of industrial self-government[,]\u201d and \u201cthe grievance machinery under a collective bargaining agreement is at the very heart of the system of industrial self-government.\u201d <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 580-81, 80 S.Ct. at 1351-52. In essence, \u201c[collective bargaining agreements regulate or restrict the exercise of management functions.\u201d <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 583, 80 S.Ct. at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Viewed against this backdrop, we think it is reasonable to construe the phrase \u201csupervisory conduct\u201d broadly as referring to conduct, under management\u2019s authority and in its interest that takes away an employee\u2019s job or job benefit, or, as the district court succinctly put it, \u201cany conduct by FPL that takes a job benefit away from an employee\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (defining a \u201csupervisor\u201d under the National Labor Relations Act as an individual who has authority \u201cin the interest of the employer\u201d to take or recommend certain actions with respect to employees); <em>cf. Beasley v. Food Fair of N. Carolina, Inc., </em>416 U.S. 653, 658-60, 94 S.Ct. 2023, 2026-27, 40 L.Ed.2d 443 (1974) (explaining that \u201csupervisors\u201d were excluded from collective bargaining because they were considered part of \u201cmanagement obliged to be loyal to their employer\u2019s interests\u201d). The collective bargaining agreement\u2019s use of broad language to define a grievance\u2014 <em>\u201cany type </em>of supervisory conduct\u201d \u2014 likewise may suggest that the provision was not intended to be construed narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Whether or not Bonthron supervised Kohl\u2019s work, it is undisputed that Bonthron had authority, in the interest of FPL, to make nuclear-access determinations for FPL employees, including Kohl. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1667 (10th ed. 2014) (defining a \u201csupervisor\u201d as \u201c[o]ne having authority over others; a manager or overseer\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; FPL\u2019s Initial Br. at 30 (stating that Bonthron\u2019s duties were \u201cto assist in managing\u201d Turkey Point by making access determinations); <em>see also IBEW, </em>580 Fed.Appx. at 869 (characterizing the issue in this appeal as <em>\u201cFPL\u2019s </em>determination of \u2018access rights\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). In making these determinations, FPL \u201cmonitor[ed],\u201d \u201cevaluat[ed],\u201d \u201cinvestigat[ed],\u201d and \u201cobserv[ed]\u201d employees \u2014 all terms consistent with oversight and supervision \u2014 to determine whether they are and continue to be \u201ctrustworthy and reliable\u201d so as to comply with NRC regulations. FPL\u2019s Initial Br. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">As explained above, FPL\u2019s access decisions can have significant employment consequences for employees. Thus, despite the fact that Bonthron may not have been Kohl\u2019s supervisor in a traditional sense or that access decisions do not arise out of that type of relationship, we think the phrase \u201cany type of supervisory conduct\u201d is reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that encompasses FPL\u2019s nuclear-access determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">In sum, the grievance and arbitration provisions are ambiguous because they are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that covers FPL\u2019s determinations of access rights. <em>See Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., </em>849 F.2d at 1360. Therefore, even assuming that FPL\u2019s interpretation of the grievance and arbitration provisions is also reasonable, we apply the presumption of arbitrability. <em>See Granite Rock Co., </em>561 U.S. at 302, 130 S.Ct. at 2858 (stating that the presumption applies where there is \u201ca validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement [that] is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">We adhere to the presumption of arbitrability and resolve any doubts in favor of ordering arbitration unless the presumption is rebutted. <em>Id., </em>130 S.Ct. at 2858-59. To rebut the presumption in the face of a broadly worded arbitration provision, the party opposing arbitration generally must show either an \u201cexpress provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration\u201d or, in its absence, \u201conly the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T, </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S.Ct. at 1419 (quoting <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf, </em>363 U.S. at 584-85, 80 S.Ct. at 1354).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Here, FPL points to no express exclusion in the collective bargaining agreement. The agreement does not expressly commit unescorted-access decisions either to arbitration or to management\u2019s sole discretion. FPL suggests that we can infer a purpose to exclude access decisions based on the \u201cstrong public policy to safeguard nuclear facilities,\u201d and it also cites a general provision in the collective bargaining agreement vesting management of the properties of the company exclusively in FPL. However, the exclusion clause is vague, not express, and inferring a purpose to exclude based on public-policy grounds goes beyond our threshold inquiry of arbitrability and improperly encroaches on the merits of the dispute. <em>See Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 584-85, 80 S.Ct. at 1354; <em>see also NextEra Energy, </em>762 F.3d at 596; <em>IBEW, </em>580 Fed.Appx. at 869. FPL puts forth no other \u201cforceful evidence\u201d or legal argument in satisfaction of its burden. .</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In short, FPL has provided no \u201cpositive assurance\u201d that the arbitration clause does not cover this dispute. <em>See AT &amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S.Ct. at 1419. Applying the presumption of arbitrability, we resolve any doubts about the scope of the grievance and arbitration provisions in favor of coverage, and find, therefore, that the dispute is arbitrable as a threshold matter. To be clear, we do not hold that the arbitrator may, in fact, review FPL\u2019s revocation of Kohl\u2019s unescorted-access privileges, and, as we indicated in our previous opinion, that question may now be moot. <em>IBEW, </em>580 Fed.Appx. at 869. We express no opinion on these matters. <em>See NextEra Energy, </em>762 F.3d at 596. But, as we also indicated in our previous opinion, IBEW\u2019s request for Kohl to be reinstated to his previous position and to receive backpay is not moot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In sum, the grievance and arbitration provisions in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that covers FPL\u2019s determination of access rights. Thus, the agreement is ambiguous, and the presumption of arbitrability applies. Because FPL has not rebutted the presumption, any doubts are resolved in favor of coverage. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. According to FPL, because Kohl\u2019s access had been \"unfavorably terminated,\u201d NRC regulations required Kohl to again apply for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>complete the unescorted access authorization process mandated by the NRC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. According to FPL, Bonthron was employed by FPL as the Access Authorization/Fitness for Duly Program Manager. He was responsible for ensuring FPL\u2019s compliance with the NRC\u2019s regulations regarding unescorted access privileges and related matters for all FPL executives and employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">. We infer this interpretation, we think fairly, from FPL\u2019s briefing. FPL asserts that Bonthron was not Kohl\u2019s supervisor, but it never defines what it means by the term \"supervisor\u201d or attempts to provide a more 'comprehensive interpretation of the provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b928-8\">. We may affirm the district court\u2019s order on any ground supported by the record, even if that ground was not relied upon by the district court. <em>Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, </em>707 F.3d 1244, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2013).
