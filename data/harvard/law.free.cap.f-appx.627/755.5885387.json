After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">On April 11, 2014, plaintiff Wylie filed suit against defendant Red Bull in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Wylie alleged that his consumption of defendant Red Bull\u2019s energy drink caused him to suffer a debilitating stroke. In the original complaint, plaintiff Wylie alleged that the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 because (1) the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, (2) plaintiff Wylie is a citizen of Pennsylvania, and (3) defendant Red Bull is a \u201ccorporation or business entity with headquarters\u201d in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">On April 15, 2014, the district court ordered plaintiff Wylie 'to file an amended complaint, or to submit evidence, that properly identified defendant Red Bull\u2019s citizenship. In that April 15 order, the district court found that the original complaint failed to adequately allege the citizenship of defendant Red Bull. The order advised plaintiff Wylie that a defendant is a citizen of its state of incorporation and the state in which it has its principal place of business. Because the initial complaint failed to allege the state of defendant Red Bull\u2019s incorporation, the district court concluded that it was unable to determine whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. The district court warned plaintiff 'Wylie that it would be required to dismiss this action unless Wylie filed an amended complaint alleging specific facts to show federal court jurisdiction or submitted evidence establishing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">On April 30, 2014, plaintiff Wylie filed an amended complaint. Wylie alleged that defendant Red Bull \u201cis a business entity incorporated in the state of California with a branch office incorporated in the state of Georgia.\u201d The complaint gave the address of defendant Red Bull\u2019s registered agent in the state of Georgia. The complaint attached a copy of a printout from the website of the Georgia Secretary of State (\u201cthe website printout\u201d). Wylie alleged that this website printout, which he later calls a \u201cregistration,\u201d confirmed Red Bull\u2019s citizenship as an incorporated entity <em>in Georgia. </em>The amended complaint did not mention, let alone discuss, Red Bull\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">On May 8, 2014, defendant Red Bull moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiff Wylie failed to properly allege subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">On June 4, 2014, plaintiff Wylie responded to the motion to dismiss, claiming that the \u201cregistration\u201d with the Georgia Secretary of State (i.e., the website printout) showed that Red Bull was, in fact, a California corporation. That registration is, however, only the above printout from the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s website. The website printout identifies Red Bull North America, Inc. as a foreign corporation with its \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in California and its \u201cPrincipal Office Address\u201d in Santa Monica, California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>On March 13, 2015, the'district court granted defendant Red Bull\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court held that plaintiff Wylie filed a defective amended complaint because he still failed to allege defendant Red Bull\u2019s principal place of business. Moreover, the district court held that the evidence provided by plaintiff Wylie, the registration (the website printout) from the Georgia Secretary of State, also did not establish diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiff Wylie\u2019s complaint was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">It is a long-standing rule, of this Court that the party invoking federal court jurisdiction, here plaintiff Wylie, has the burden to establish that jurisdiction exists. <em>Tetco Metal Products, Inc. v. Langham, </em>387 F.2d 721, 723 (5th Cir.1968).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When federal jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, the complaint \u201cmust include the citizenship of each party, so that the court is satisfied that no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\u201d <em>Travaglio v. Am. Exp. Co., </em>735 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2013). Without clearly alleged diversity of citizenship, \u201cdistrict courts are constitutionally obligated to dismiss the action altogether if the plaintiff does not cure the deficiency.\u201d <em>Id,:</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">On appeal, plaintiff Wylie argues that he satisfied that burden, both by amending the complaint to include California as the state of incorporation for defendant Red Bull and by filing a website printout showing defendant Red Bull\u2019s registration to do business as a foreign corporation in Georgia. Specifically, Wylie argues that the evidence submitted shows that defendant Red Bull\u2019s \u201chome jurisdiction\u201d is California and that \u201cthe officers that direct and control [Red Bull] (i.e., its- CEO, Secretary!,] and CFO), all do so from a single location in California.\u201d Plaintiff Wylie contends that this establishes diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">After review, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that plaintiff Wylie failed to allege defendant Red Bull\u2019s principal place of business. First, we review the relevant- law regarding \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">For diversity jurisdiction purposes, a corporation is a \u201ccitizen of every State by which it has been incorporated and of the State ... where it has its principal place of business.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1). \u201cPrincipal place of business\u201d is a term of art with a defined legal meaning for jurisdictional purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">In <em>Hertz Corp. v. Friend, </em>the United States Supreme Court adopted the \u201cnerve center\u201d test to determine a corporation\u2019s principal place of business. 559 U.S. 77, 92-93, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 1192, 175 L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010). The \u201cnerve center\u201d refers to \u201cthe place where a' corporation\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is generally \u201cthe place where the corporation maintains its headquarters \u2014 provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <em>i.e., </em>the \u2018nerve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>center,\u2019 and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings (for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 130 S.Ct. at 1192; see <em>also Holston Invs., Inc. B.V.I. v. LanLogistics Corp., </em>677 F.3d 1068, 1071 (11th Cir.2012) (referring to the <em>Hertz </em>\u201cnerve center\u201d test as a \u201csimple rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\">In <em>Hertz, </em>the Supreme Court specifically noted that the \u201cmere filing of a form ... listing a corporation\u2019s \u2018principal executive offices\u2019 [is], without- more,\u201d insufficient to establish a corporation\u2019s principal place of business because it \u201cwould readily permit jurisdictional manipulation, thereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the \u2018principal place of business\u2019 language in the diversity statute.\u201d 559 U.S. at 97, 130 S.Ct. at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Here, plaintiff Wylie\u2019s amended complaint does not, on its face, allege that defendant Red Bull\u2019s principal place of business is California. Plaintiff Wylie\u2019s \u201cevidence\u201d (attached to his amended complaint) shows only that, for the purpose of a corporate filing with the Georgia Secretary of State, defendant Red Bull listed a California address as its \u201cPrincipal Office Address\u201d and listed the same address for several corporate officers. That alone is insufficient under <em>Hertz. See id. </em>The fact that the CEO, CFO, and Secretary of defendant Red Bull are listed on the form as sharing that \u201cPrincipal Office Address\u201d does not establish Red Bull\u2019s principal place of business under the \u201cnerve center\u201d test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of plaintiff Wylie\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. The printout appears to reflect not the actual filing by defendant Red Bull but rather a series of fields generated by the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office that are then populated by the information contained in a foreign corporation\u2019s annual registration. This is based on review of the document attached to plaintiff Wylie's amended complaint as well as review of the Georgia Secretary of State's website, which includes formal registration filings <em>by Red Bull, See </em>Business Search for Red Bull North America, Inc., Georgia Secretary of State \u2014 Corporations Division, https:// ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch/Business Information? businessld= 1608844 &amp; busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>nessType=ForeignProfitCorporation (last visited Aug. 10, 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">.Because the district court found that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the remaining arguments for dismissal advanced by defendant Red Bull in its May 8 motion were denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-15\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-16\">. \"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law [this Court] review[s] <em>de novo.\" Travaglio, </em>735 F.3d at 1268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">. It is only for the first time on appeal that plaintiff Wylie claims the listing of the corporate officers on the registration form as a basis for Wylie\u2019s \"principal place of business\u2019\u2019 argument. Although Wylie waived this argument, <em>see Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2004), it lacks merit in any event</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
