This appeal is \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Gutierrez has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
