Amendment 782. In January 2014, Michel pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The district court determined that Michel was responsible for 10.18 kilograms of cocaine, and it assigned a base offense level of 32, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) of the 2013 Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The court determined that the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision in \u00a7 5C1.2 applied. As a result, it reduced Michel\u2019s offense level by two points, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16), and it was authorized to sentence him without regard to the ten-year statutory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Pursuant to the plea agreement, the court also applied a two-point minor role reduction and a one-point acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.2(b), 3E1.1. In addition, because Michel received a minor role reduction and his base offense level was 32, he received an additional 2-point reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(i). His resulting total offense level was 25. With his criminal history category of I, Michel\u2019s final guideline range was 57-71 months. The court imposed a guideline sentence of 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">In September 2014, Michel filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782, arguing that Amendment 782 reduced his base offense level by 2 points, resulting in an amended guideline range of 46-57 months. The district court denied the motion, on the ground that Amendment 782 did not lower Michel\u2019s guideline range because, at the time of sentencing, he received \u201can extra two-level reduction pursuant to [\u00a7 2D 1.1 (a)(5)(i) ],\u201d After he filed his notice of appeal, Michel filed a motion for appointment of counsel in the district court, and the district court granted the motion. On appeal, Michel, through counsel, argues that the district court erred in determining that Amendment 782 did not lower his guideline range. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is ineligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). For a defendant to be eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the Sentencing Commission must have amended\u2019 the Guidelines, the amendment must have lowered his guideline range, and the amendment must have been made retroactively applicable. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2), (d), &amp; comment, (n, 1(A)). Amendment 782, which became effective on November 1, 2014, provides a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most drug quantities listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. Amendment 782 has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>made retroactively applicable. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d)!</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The Guidelines policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [amendment] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the [amendment] for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\"><em>Id., </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The application note to \u00a7 1B1.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">[A] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... an amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">We\u2019ve explained that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. It works by giving \u201cthe defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We\u2019ve cautioned that the defendant \u201cis not to receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of his sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201c[t]he goal is to treat a defendant sentenced before the amendment the same as those sentenced after the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206-08 (holding the defendant was ineligible for a sentencing reduction under Amendment 750 because the amendment did not lower his guideline range, which was determined by the statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">Here, we are unpersuaded by Michel\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a sentence reduction and determined that he was no longer eligible for the 2-point reduction in \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(i). Michel is correct that Amendment 782 did not amend \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(i), under which he received a 2-point reduction at his original sentencing proceeding, based on his receipt of a minor role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 and his base offense level.of 32 under the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). However, in determining whether Michel was eligible for a sentencing reduction based on Amendment 782, the district court was required to \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have'been applicable to [him] if [Amendment 782] had been in effect at the time [he] was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). If Michel had been sentenced after Amendment 782 went into effect, he would not have received a 2-point reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(i) because his base offense level under the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), based on his responsibility for 10.18 kilograms of cocaine, would have been 30. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (2014). Importantly, under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), no reduction in base offense level is available if a defendant\u2019s offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>level is less than level 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(i) (providing that a defendant\u2019s base offense level is \u201c[t]he offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table .,except that if (A) the defendant receives an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 (Mitigating Role); and (B) the base offense level\u201d is <em>level 32 or greater, </em>the offense level is decreased by two or more levels).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Because Michel\u2019s guideline range would not have been lower had he been sentenced after Amendment 782 went into effect, he was not eligible for a sentencing reduction based on the amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376; <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. Thus, the district court did not err in denying his motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
