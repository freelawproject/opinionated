The district court determined that Afghahi\u2019s case involves a serious risk of flight and that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure his appearance if he is released. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142(e)-(g), 3145(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-22\">Absent an error of law, we must uphold a district court\u2019s pretrial detention order if it is supported by the proceedings below, a deferential standard of review that we have equated to the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Hare, </em>873 F.2d 796, 798 (5th Cir.1989). The same standard governs our review of the denial of a \u00a7 3145(b) motion to revoke a detention order. <em>Id. </em>We generally look to whether \u201cthe evidence as a whole supports the conclusions of the proceedings\u201d in the district court, <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 586 (5th Cir.1992), although we review questions of law de novo, <em>United States v. Olis, </em>450 F.3d 583, 585 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Afghahi argues that the district court applied incorrect legal standards. We disagree. The district court repeatedly articulated and applied the correct statutory standards. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3142(e)-\u00ae. Any error in the district court\u2019s consideration of \u201ccommunity ties\u201d to Houston, Texas, or the best interests of Afghahi\u2019s proposed sureties was harmless as the court found that Afghahi lacks ties to the United States and that the proposed sureties would not be effective in reasonably assuring his appearance. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Ceim.P. 52(a). In light of the statutory factors, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3142(g), \u201cthe evidence as a whole supports the conclusions of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Rueben, </em>974 F.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
