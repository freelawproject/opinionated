He contends that his 57-month term of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">We assess the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). As Martinez-Villescas recognizes, his argument that this court should not apply the reasonableness presumption because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). While he also contends that the guidelines \u201cproduced an unfair range in his particular case\u201d in light of \u201csignificant mitigating facts,\u201d it is well-settled law that the advisory guidelines range is a \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for determining an appropriate sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>S.Ct. 586. Whether to deviate from the advisory guidelines range is within the sound discretion of the district court, and Martinez-Villescas has not identified any authority permitting us to overturn the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Martinez-Villescas also argues that the sentence does not reflect his personal history because, by returning to the United States, he was merely fleeing after his life was threatened in Mexico to the country where he had been raised and lived for 43 years. The record shows that MartinezVillescas explained his reasons for return but that the district court determined that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate due to his criminal history. By arguing that he should have received a below-guidelines sentence, Martinez-Villescas is urging us to reweigh the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, we defer to the district court\u2019s assessment of the facts and their import under \u00a7 3553(a), and Martinez-Villescas has failed to rebut the reasonableness presumption or show that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
