He argues for the first time on appeal that the district court\u2019s \u201cupward variance\u201d from the advisory guidelines range was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. On plain error review, we affirm. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Fair argues that the district court committed procedural error when it failed to give adequate reasons for its \u201cupward variance.\u201d Fair\u2019s contention that the district court imposed a non-guideline sentence, however, is frivolous. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fair was instead sentenced at the low end of the advisory guidelines range, and a district court\u2019s explanation for a sentence imposed within the recommended guidelines range can be both brief and legally sufficient. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 362 (5th Cir.2009). Fair\u2019s implicit argument that the district court should not have found, for sentencing enhancement purposes, that he committed armed robbery is belied by his representation in the PSR \u201cthat sufficient evidence exists for [the armed robbery] to be shown by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d which is the standard for sentencing. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>448 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir.2006)(judge is empowered to decide facts relevant to sentencing guidelines range by a preponderance of the evidence). Our review of the record reveals no procedural error, plain or otherwise, in this regard. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Fair also challenges the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, arguing that the district court gave improper weight to his criminal history. The record reveals, however, that the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, Fair\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(C). Furthermore, \u201c[a] discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Fair therefore has not demonstrated clear or obvious error with regard to the substantive reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of his sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">. Fair\u2019s original guidelines range was lower than the one ultimately used. The later recalculation and increase came not from a \"variance\u201d but from Fair\u2019s conduct in seeking to bribe a witness to change his testimony. That conduct resulted in Fair losing the benefit of the acceptance of responsibility decrease and gaining obstruction of justice points which raised his guidelines range,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
