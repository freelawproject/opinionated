On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior conviction of burglary of a dwelling under Florida law was a crime of violence under the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) because the clause is unconstitutionally vague. Because this court has held that the vagueness doctrine is not applicable to advisory guidelines and thus the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is not unconstitutionally vague, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">\u201cWe review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant qualifies for an enhanced base offense level of 20 if he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced after receiving one prior conviction for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Section 4B1.2, the definition section of the career offender guideline, provides that the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is an offense under federal or state law that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that: \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <em>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added). The emphasized language is known as the residual clause. <em>See United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">The Supreme Court has held that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2557, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). However, this court recently held that, although the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2 is virtually identical to the one in the ACCA, the vagueness doctrine \u201cdoes not apply to advisory guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185, 1189, 1193-95 (11th Cir.2015).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, our holding in <em>Matchett </em>squarely forecloses Brown\u2019s argument that the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1193; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>also United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting that, under the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound to follow our binding precedent unless it is overruled by the court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court). Accordingly, upon review of the relevant case law, the record, and the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\">. In <em>Matchett, </em>we also noted that Florida burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, while not a crime of violence under the enumerated offenses clause of \u00a7 4B1.2, nevertheless qualifies under the residual clause. <em>See </em>802 F.3d at 1196-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-16\"><em>. </em>Given that <em>Matchett </em>forecloses Brown\u2019s sole argument on appeal, it is unnecessary to address the government\u2019s alternative argument that Florida\u2019s burglary of a dwelling statute is divisible and Brown\u2019s conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the elements clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) using the modified categorical approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
