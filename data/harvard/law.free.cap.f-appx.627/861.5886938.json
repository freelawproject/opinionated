On appeal, Ortiz-Merino argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u201c\u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court is not required to explicitly state that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as long as the court\u2019s comments demonstrate that it considered the factors when imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given [\u00a7 3553(a)] factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted). We will not reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and will not remand for resentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by imposing a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, a court may abuse its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). Moreover, a court should not focus on one factor \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of other factors, and a court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"A6J\">We may not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable, and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (quotation omitted). Extraordinary justification is not required, but the district court should explain why the variance is appropriate, and the justification must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. <em>Id. </em>at 1186-87. A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum). The maximum term of imprisonment for a defendant convicted of illegal reentry by a deported alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) is two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Here, Ortiz-Merino has failed to show that his sentence is unreasonable. As for procedural reasonableness, the district court was not required to specifically discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and the record establishes that the court set forth enough to show that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>decision \u2014 specifically, it said that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the guideline range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In imposing the upward variance, the court stressed that Ortiz-Merino\u2019s number of illegal reentries was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and demonstrated a lack of respect for the law. The court also responded to Ortiz-Merino\u2019s arguments that he (1) had usually voluntarily departed the United States, and (2) came to the United States because of troubling circumstances in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">As for substantive reasonableness, the district court explained why the variance was appropriate and gave a sufficiently compelling justification for it: Ortiz-Merino\u2019s record of 14 illegal entries and voluntary departures or removals prior to the instant conviction, which implicated several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to promote respect for the law and deter criminal conduct. The variance was also supported by Ortiz-Merino\u2019s numerous driving offenses, including ten convictions for driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, as well as his conviction for domestic battery and pending charge for aggravated battery. Although the district court placed significant weight on Ortiz-Merino\u2019s repeated illegal entries, it did not focus on this factor \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of others, and expressly noted that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the parties\u2019 arguments, which addressed a multitude of \u00a7 3553(a) factors. While the court may not have weighed Ortiz-Merino\u2019s traumatic childhood experiences as much as he desired, its decision to weigh other factors more heavily was within its sound discretion. Finally, the 12-month sentence was considerably below the 24-month statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
