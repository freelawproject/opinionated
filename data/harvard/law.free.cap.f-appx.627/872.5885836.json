Enoch appeals the 60-month prison sentence he received after pleading guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His sentence represented a 27-month variance above the advisory guideline range of 27 to 33 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-27\">On appeal, Enoch contends that the district court committed the following errors: it mistakenly believed it did not have the authority to downwardly depart under United States Sentencing'Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress); it imposed the equivalent of an upward departure for under-represented criminal history, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>providing notice or following the prescribed procedures; and it otherwise imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">On September 2, 2013, a police officer on patrol in Moultrie, Georgia, observed Enoch standing on the side of a road and holding a semi-automatic pistol. When the officer turned his car around, a female co-defendant took the gun from Enoch and began to run. Both Enoch and the co-defendant were detained, and officers retrieved a ,40 caliber pistol with a magazine in it. Enoch eventually told officers that, \u201cdue to an altercation down the street,\u201d the co-defendant had tried to give him the gun for his protection. The co-defendant stated that Enoch already had the pistol and she was trying to get him to go inside the house \u201cto avoid getting into trouble,\u201d but he told her to take the pistol when they observed the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Enoch pled guilty, under a written plea agreement, to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Before sentencing, a probation officer prepared a final presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) finding Enoch\u2019s advisory sentencing guideline range to be 27 to 33 months of imprisonment. Enoch was determined to be in criminal history category V, based on prior convictions for statutory rape, obstruction of a law enforcement officer, possession of marijuana, battery, and burglary, and because he committed the instant offense while serving the burglary sentence. The PSR did not identify any grounds warranting a variance from the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Enoch moved for a downward departure based on coercion or duress, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12, in his objections to the PSR and at sentencing. He contended that he only possessed the firearm in question because he was reasonably in fear for his safety at the time of the offense. At sentencing, defense counsel asserted that Enoch was being targeted because he had testified against certain individuals in several criminal trials involving gang activity, and that he already had been beaten and shot after testifying against one individual. The district court expressed skepticism about whether coercion or duress could be a defense to the firearm-possession offense. After further discussion of the downward departure, the district court adopted the PSR and found the guideline range to be 27 to 33 months, implicitly denying the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The court sentenced Enoch to 60 months in prison, stating that it had considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and made an \u201cindividualized assessment.\u201d The court stated that it \u201c[made] this upward variance primarily because of [Enoch\u2019s] past criminal history,\u201d including his convictions for statutory rape, battery, burglary, and obstruction of an officer. (D.E. 59 at 20). \u201cIn addition,\u201d the court told Enoch, \u201cfor the past 11 years you have had no verifiable employment. As we know now, you\u2019ve never been married, but as your lawyer has said and as the presentence report said, you have five children, and I think it\u2019s probably fair to assume that you are not making support payments to any of them.\u201d <em>(Id.). </em>Enoch personally interjected that he took care of his kids and that he worked various odd jobs and had filed tax returns. The court responded, \u201cAll right[.] In any event, those are the reasons that the Court had for the upward variance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">The court further elaborated that it found that Enoch was \u201cnot a man with respect for the law,\u201d who was \u201cvery probably a danger to [the] community,\u201d and that \u201ca sentence in the range of 27 to 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>months does not adequately treat [his] case with the severity it deserves.\u201d <em>(Id.). </em>At the close of the hearing, Enoch objected to the upward variance and he renewed his objection to the denial of his motion for a downward departure. This is Enoch\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Enoch first argues that remand for re-sentencing is required because the district court found it did not have the authority to apply a ' downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. The court, according to Enoch, incorrectly concluded that there is no excuse or justification defense to the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and so failed to consider Enoch\u2019s evidence of an incomplete justification defense under \u00a7 5K2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12, a sentencing court \u201cmay depart downward\u201d for a defendant who \u201ccommitted the offense because of serious coercion, blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a complete defense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12; <em>see also United States v. Russell, </em>917 F.2d 512, 515-16 (11th Cir.1990) (discussing departures under \u00a7 5K2.12). The section further provides that the extent of the decrease should depend on the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">We lack jurisdiction \u201cto consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a discretionary decision of the district court to not apply a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). However, we may conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a claim that the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to grant such a departure. <em>United States v. Mignott, </em>184 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d 917, 921 (11th Cir.1993) (vacating and remanding sentence after distinct court declined to depart downward because it wrongly believed that it lacked authority to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">We must first determine whether the district court incorrectly believed it lacked authority to grant a departure. When nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume that the district court understood that it had the authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006). But where the record is ambiguous as to the district court\u2019s understanding, the ambiguity is resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>139 F.3d 1390, 1395 (11th Cir.1998) (vacating sentence after concluding that the district court \u201cappeared] to have agreed with both the proposition that it lacked the authority to depart ... as well as the proposition that it had the discretion to depart but chose not to do so in this case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Here, the record is ambiguous as to whether the district court understood that it had the authority to depart downward. Some of the court\u2019s comments seem to show that the court believed, as a matter of law, that there could be no excuse or justification defense to a firearm-possession offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), as a matter of law. For example, in response to defense counsel\u2019s arguments that the court could depart under \u00a7 5K.12 based on coercion or duress, the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says if a man or a worn an is a convicted felon that there are circumstances that excuse the offense.\u201d (D.E. 59 at 11). Further, the court asked whether coercion is a defense to a violation of the statute, stating \u201cI don\u2019t know it to be.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12). While other comments may be construed to suggest that the court may have made a discretionary determination based on the merits, we resolve the ambiguity in Enoch\u2019s favor. <em>See Webb, </em>139 F.3d at 1395.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Turning to the merits, Enoch contends that this circuit recognizes a justification defense to a \u00a7 922(g)(1) firearm-possession offense, and that the district court therefore was permitted to depart downward under \u00a7 5K2.12, even if the facts show only an imperfect defense. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">This Court has held that \u201cjustification\u201d is an affirmative defense to a \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge. <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Rice, </em>214 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). To establish this defense in the \u00a7 922(g)(1) context, a defendant must prove four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">(1) that the defendant was under unlawful and present, imminent, and impending threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) that the defendant did not negligently or recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (3) that the defendant had no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law; and (4) that there was a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWTE\"><em>Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d at 1297. Because \u00a7 5K2.12 provides that the court may depart downward in \u201ccircumstances not amounting to a complete defense,\u201d the district court would have been permitted to depart even if Enoch was unable to establish these elements fully. The extent of the decrease, if warranted, \u201cshould depend on the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s actions, on the proportionality of the defendant\u2019s actions to the seriousness of coercion, blackmail, or duress involved, and on the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The government suggests that, even if the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked the authority to depart, we may nonetheless affirm the denial of the downward departure because Enoch did not prove his entitlement to the departure by presenting any evidence in support of his request at the sentencing hearing. However, defense counsel explained the factual basis for seeking a departure under \u00a7 5K2.12 at the sentencing hearing, but it appears that the district court was unwilling to entertain an excuse or justification defense to the \u00a7 922(g)(1) as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Enoch cannot be faulted for failing to produce evidence that the court already had rejected as necessarily legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Consequently, we vacate and remand for resentencing and for consideration on the merits of whether and to what extent a \u00a7 5K2.12 departure is warranted based on the evidence presented. We express no view as to whether a downward departure should, in fact, be granted on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Enoch also raises various other challenges to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his 60-month prison sentence. He contends that the court procedurally erred by (1) effectively imposing an upward departure based on an underrepresented criminal history, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, without complying with the procedural requirements of that section or of Rule 32(h), Fed.R.Crim.P., and (2) failing to give a significant justification for its major variance. And he argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because: (a) it was based primarily on his prior criminal history, which had al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ready been factored into his guideline range; (b) the court improperly increased his sentence based on unfounded assumptions about Enoch\u2019s lack of employment, marital status, and failure to pay child support; and (c) the court failed to consider mitigating evidence and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">To the extent that the court may have based its upward variance on any assumptions or speculation about Enoch\u2019s failure to pay child support, without making any supporting factual findings, it would have been inappropriate to do so. A district court\u2019s sentencing determinations must be \u201cbased on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. While a district court may make factual findings by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts in the record, <em>United States v. Creel, </em>783 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2015), factual findings \u201ccannot be based on speculation,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Newman, </em>614 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2010)), and must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>see United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n. 25 (11th Cir.2008). Further, when there is a disputed matter at sentencing, the district court generally must \u201crule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The district court\u2019s factual findings supporting its sentencing determinations, and the court\u2019s resolution of disputed factual matters, are necessary to ensure meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Reid, </em>139 F.3d 1367, 1368 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cWe cannot engage in meaningful appellate review of a sentence unless the district court sets out the facts underpinning the guidelines it applied in fashioning the defendant\u2019s sentence or the record plainly establishes such facts.\u201d); <em>Shukwit v. United States, </em>973 F.2d 903, 905 (11th Cir.1992) (remanding based on the district court\u2019s failure to resolve a factual dispute because this Court was \u201cunable to ascertain whether [the defendant] was sentenced on the basis of inaccurate information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">After Enoch personally objected that he worked various odd jobs and took care of his children, the district court did not thereafter resolve the question either by making supporting factual findings or by stating that the matter would not affect sentencing. Nor did the court explain how Enoch\u2019s marital status, employment history, or purported lack of child support supported an upward variance based on the \u25a0\u00a7 3553(a) factors. So it is not clear whether the district court, in fact, relied on impermissible speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Nevertheless, we need not, and do not, decide whether the district court procedurally or substantively erred on this or other grounds because we conclude that a remand is warranted based on the departure issue, as explained above. Enoch\u2019s remaining challenges are to the length of the sentence and tp the district court\u2019s justification of that sentence. Because the chosen sentence, as well as its underlying justification, may change upon remand, we do not at this time opine on its reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gupta, 572 </em>F.3d 878, 888 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe do not know what sentence the district court will impose on remand. Thus, we would be rendering an advisory opinion if we were to pick a sentence and declare it to be reasonable.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Collins, </em>915 F.2d 618, 622 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">In sum, we VACATE Enoch\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. Although we acknowledge that defense counsel, when pressed by the district court, failed to identify a case showing that there is a defense to a \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge, we also note that counsel cited <em>Deleveaux </em>in his objections to the PSR.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
