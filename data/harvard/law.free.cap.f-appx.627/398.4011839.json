By moving to proceed IFP, Goetz is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The district court implicitly determined that Goetz was eligible for a reduction but decided that a reduction was not warranted in Goetz\u2019s case. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). We review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Goetz argues that the district court failed to reasonably consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when it denied his motion. The record reflects that the district court considered Goetz\u2019s motion as a whole and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that its denial is not based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. Goetz cannot show that the district court abused its discretion by denying him a sentence reduction. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">This appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Goetz\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
