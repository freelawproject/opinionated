No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Briefly stated, Bolton\u2019s claims arise from the Board\u2019s refusal to hire Bolton as a full-time teacher. Following an interview, the school principal recommended Bolton for an open special-education teaching position at Baldwin County High School. Shortly thereafter, Bolton attended a new hire orientation, received keys to her classroom, and began reporting to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">Under the Board\u2019s standard practice \u2014 of which Bolton was made aware \u2014 a teacher is not employed formally until her hiring is approved by the Board at a public meeting. In addition, teachers who have not yet been hired formally by the Board are considered substitute teachers and are compensated accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">As part of the Board\u2019s approval process, the Board\u2019s Human Resources Office began working to verify Bolton\u2019s teaching credentials. Bolton was not yet certified to teach in Alabama; she was instructed and required to register for two state certification tests: a basic skills test and Praxis II. Bolton was told she needed to register for the next administration of each test before the Board\u2019s next meeting so that the Board could approve formally Bolton\u2019s hiring. Although Bolton registered for the state-required certification tests, she failed to register for the next available testing date, as instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">The Human Resources Office also concluded that Bolton failed to provide proper professional references in support of her employment application. All applicants were required to submit professional references, defined as references from \u201cprevious supervisors or coworkers.\u201d On her application, however, Bolton identified her references only as \u201cfriends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">As a result of Bolton\u2019s failure to register properly for the state-required certification tests and her failure to provide proper professional references, the Human Resources Office was unable to process Bolton\u2019s application in time for the Board\u2019s next meeting. The Human Resources Office, together with the school principal, then decided to cancel Bolton\u2019s recommendation for employment. Bolton received substitute teacher pay for the days she worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">Bolton filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging race discrimination. The EEOC dismissed the complaint and issued Bolton a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-19\">Bolton then filed this civil action against the Board, alleging both race discrimination and retaliation. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>concluded that Bolton failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination because she failed to show that she was treated differently than a similarly-situated person outside her protected class. The district court also determined that the Board had identified legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for refusing to hire Bolton full-time and that Bolton failed to show that the Board\u2019s reasons were pretexts for race discrimination. The district court next concluded that Bolton failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation because she had engaged in no statutorily-protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cconstruing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2012). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A9i\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination under both Title VII and section 1981,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a plaintiff must prove (1) that she belongs to a protected class; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) that the employer treated similarly-situated people outside her protected class more favorably; and (4) that she was qualified to do the job. <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir.2008). To satisfy this initial burden, a plaintiff must show she and the non-minority employees, whom plaintiff alleges were treated more favorably, are similarly situated in all pertinent respects. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper <em>if </em>a plaintiff fails to show the existence of a similarly-situated employee and no other evidence of discrimination exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Bolton has failed to identify a similarly-situated applicant that was treated more favorably. First, the Board imposed the same procedural requirements on Bolton as it did on other non-minority teacher applicants. The record shows that Melissa Miller,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a white applicant, was required\u2014 like Bolton \u2014 to register for the next administration of required certification tests before the Board\u2019s next public meeting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Miller was also required to submit professional references in support of her application. And Miller was entitled only to substitute teacher pay until she was hired formally by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">Unlike Bolton, however, Miller complied in full with the Board\u2019s application instructions and requirements. As a result, Miller\u2019s employment application was submitted in time for the Board\u2019s next meeting, during which Miller\u2019s full-time employment was approved. Because-Bolton failed to follow instructions and to satisfy the Board\u2019s application requirements, Miller and Bolton are not similar in all perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>nent respects; and Miller is no valid comparator. <em>See Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. Bolton failed to identify a valid comparator and has presented no other evidence of discrimination and, thus, has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>ease of discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court committed no error in entering summary judgment on Bolton\u2019s race discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">About Bolton\u2019s retaliation claim, employers are barred under both Title VII and section 1981 from retaliating against an employee or an applicant for employment who engages in statutorily-protected activity. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>Chapter 7 Tr. v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2012). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that she engaged in a statutorily-protected activity and suffered an adverse employment action that was causally related to the protected activity. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Protected activities include the filing of a formal complaint, the voicing informally of a complaint to superiors, or the use of an employer\u2019s internal grievance procedure to report alleged discrimination. <em>See Rollins v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Law Enf't, </em>868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Bolton has failed to demonstrate that she engaged in a statutorily-protected activity. Bolton contends that the Board retaliated against her because she failed to register properly for the state-required certification tests and retaliated based on unspecified statements from Bolton\u2019s former employer. Neither of these acts shows or constitutes statutorily-protected activity. And nothing evidences that Bolton complained about the Board\u2019s alleged discrimination \u2014 either formally or infor<em>mally </em>\u2014 before Bolton\u2019s recommendation for employment was cancelled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Bolton has failed to show that she engaged in a statutorily-protected activity or that the Board\u2019s failure to hire her full-time was causally related to a statutorily-protected activity, she has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>ease of retaliation. Summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. \"The elements of a claim of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C, \u00a7 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate treatment claim in the employment context.\u201d <em>Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>232 F.3d 836, 843 n. 11 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. Bolton raises no challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that Carolina Smoak was no valid comparator. Bolton has abandoned this argument on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-14\">.Bolton provides no record evidence supporting her contention that Miller needed to take and was not required to register for the basic skills test. Although we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Bolton, mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations raise no genuine issue of fact sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, <em>See Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\">. Moreover, even if we assume \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that Bolton could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination, Bolton has raised no challenge to the district court\u2019s alternative independent ruling that Bolton failed to show that the Board\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons \u2014 including failure to follow instructions \u2014 for not hiring Bolton were a pretext for race discrimination. Bolton has abandoned that argument, <em>see Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874, and can show no reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A38\">. Although Bolton Hied ultimately a complaint of race discrimination with the EEOC, she did so <em>after </em>the Board had already refused to hire her as a full-time teacher. And Bolton makes no allega\u00fcons that she suffered \u00e1n adverse employment action after, or as a result of, her filing the EEOC complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
