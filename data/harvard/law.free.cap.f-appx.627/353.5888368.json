Castillo contends that the district court committed plain error by using the wrong guidelines edition when calculating his sentencing range, erred procedurally in determining drug quantity, violated his due process rights by using unadjudicated acts information to sentence him, and imposed a sentence that was substantively unreasonable. Because Castillo did not present the-district court with any of the arguments he advances on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The district court\u2019s error in using the 2013 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines instead of the 2014 edition did not affect Castillo\u2019s substantial rights, as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) of each edition assigned the same base offense level for the 480-kilo-grams for which Castillo is accountable. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. We reject also Castillo\u2019s contention that drug quantity was improperly calculated. Because determination of drug quantity is a factual finding, and because he did not properly object, precedent dictates that Castillo cannot prevail on plain error review. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). We decline Castillo\u2019s invitation to break with precedent. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we could review the district court\u2019s factual determination that Castillo was accountable for 480 kilograms of cocaine, that determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">There is no merit to the argument that the district court violated due process by relying on unadjudicated facts. To the extent that the assertion that the determination of the date of Castillo\u2019s initial involvement in drug trafficking is tethered to the claim that drug quantity was miscalculated, it fails; the determination is a factual one and offers at best a slim basis for reversal on plain error review. <em>See Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d at 438. Additionally, the claim that the district court relied on a report of an assault incident in Mexico does not entitle Castillo to relief on plain error review. The record \u201cdoes not indicate that it is reasonably probable\u201d that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it not considered the incident. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 438 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, even if there were a reasonable probability that Castillo\u2019s sentence would have been less had the district court not considered the incident in Mexico, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Even if improper, the district court\u2019s mention of the Mexican incident did not \u201cgo to the criminality of\u2019 Castillo\u2019s conduct in the instant case but instead arguably affected only \u201cthe discretionary decision of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>lengthy a sentence is necessary to provide adequate deterrence and protect the public.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 683-84 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Castillo\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence fails on plain error review because Castillo \u201ccannot demonstrate any error at all.\u201d <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.2012). The district court explained that the sentence was appropriate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, because the sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range,\u201d an inference arises that the district court considered \u201call the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). In this circuit, a within-guidelines sentence \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Nothing in the record counsels in favor of not applying the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. Castillo\u2019s motion to relieve counsel and to appoint new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
