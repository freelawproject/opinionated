After careful review of the trial record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">I. CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">On appeal, Toussaint argues that the district court erred in admitting some of Cl Jeudy\u2019s statements to Toussaint in recorded conversations in violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause bars the admission of out of court statements that are \u201ctestimonial\u201d unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1226 (11th Cir.2010). However, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause prohibits <em>only </em>statements that constitute impermissible hearsay,\u201d and \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201cif a trial court admits a statement, made by an available declarant whom the defendant has not had an opportunity to cross-examine, for purposes <em>other </em>than for the truth of the matter asserted, the admissibility of that statement does not violate the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Cl Jeudy did not testify at trial. Instead, Federal Bureau of Investigations Special Agent Tom Ryan, who monitored all but one of the recorded conversations as they occurred, testified about 35 recorded conversations involving Defendant Toussaint and the two CIs that occurred between late October 2013 and late January 2014. In addition, transcripts of the 35 conversations were published to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because Cl Jeudy was available to testify but did not appear at trial, Toussaint contends that the admission of five of Cl Jeudjfs statements in recorded conversations with Toussaint violated the Confrontation Clause. The five statements occurred during a series of conversations in January 2014 in which Cl Jeudy arranged to buy stolen personal identifying information from Defendant Toussaint. Toussaint, in turn, coordinated with a third man, whose source had stolen the information from a mental health treatment center in Philadelphia. Defendant Toussaint instructed Cl Jeudy to set up an email account to receive the stolen information and send him an email from that account. Later, after Toussaint was paid, Toussaint instructed the third man by telephone to send an email with the stolen information. Two such email transactions occurred, one on January 18, 2014 and the other on January 31, 2014, for which Toussaint received a total of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">In the five challenged statements, Cl Jeudy: (1) asserted that he needs the stolen information and complains that Toussaint has not yet called his connection; (2) said he needs a lot of information and asks Toussaint to find out from his connection how much it will costs; (3) complained again that Toussaint has not found any information; (4) confirmed that he had set up the email account and would have the money to pay Toussaint by Friday, and asked Toussaint if he should send his email address; and (5) urged Toussaint to make sure the connection sends good information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Setting aside whether Cl Jeudy\u2019s five statements are \u201ctestimonial\u201d within the meaning of <em>Crawford, </em>the district court did not err in admitting them because they were not impermissible hearsay. This Court recently concluded in <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>780 F.3d 1084, 1092 (11th Cir.2015), that the hearsay rule does not operate to exclude a confidential informant\u2019s half of a conversation with the defendant where those statements are either \u201c(1) non-assertive statements that are incapable of being true or false or (2) statements that are indisputably false.\u201d As we explained, the confidential informant\u2019s portion of the conversation was important to \u201cprovide[ ] a context to assess [the] Defendant\u2019s response,\u201d and \u201cto show the effect those statements had on [the] Defendant. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The five statements Toussaint challenges, like the confidential informant\u2019s statements in <em>Rivera, </em>either were non-assertive statements that are incapable of being either true or false, or they were indisputably false, and they were all admitted to place Toussaint\u2019s own responses and conduct in context. The only arguably truthful factual assertion was Cl Jeudy\u2019s statement that he had created an email account to receive the stolen information. However, Special Agent Ryan testified that he was with Cl Jeudy when the email account was created, and print outs from the email account were admitted into evidence. Thus, the government did not need Cl Jeudy\u2019s recorded statement to prove this fact, and instead offered Cl Jeudy\u2019s recorded statement only to show the effect it had upon Toussaint, and not for its truth. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that the confidential informant\u2019s one truthful factual statement \u2014 that her husband had offered the defendant money to keep him silent\u2014 was not hearsay because other witnesses testified about this fact and thus the confidential informant\u2019s recorded statement was not admitted for its truth but to show its effect on the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Because these five statements were not impermissible hearsay \u2014 that is, they were not admitted to prove the truth of the matters asserted \u2014 their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1286-87.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">II. ENTRAPMENT INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Troussaint next argues that the district court erred in denying Toussaint\u2019s requested jury instruction on entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">The failure to give a particular \u201cinstruction is reversible error where the requested instruction (1) was correct, (2) was not substantially covered by the charge actually given, and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important that the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947-48 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>An entrapment defense has two elements: (1) the government induced the crime and (2) the defendant lacked predisposition to commit the crime before the inducement. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007). In order to be allowed to present an entrapment defense, a defendant bears the initial burden of production as to the element of governmental inducement. <em>United States v. Sistrunk, </em>622 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2010). If the defendant meets his initial burden of production, the burden shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime. <em>Id. </em>The sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s evidence of governmental inducement is a legal issue to be decided by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33. When considering whether the defendant satisfied his initial burden of production, this Court accepts the testimony most favorable to the defendant. <em>United States v. Wolffs, </em>594 F.2d 77, 80 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">A defendant can show inducement by the producing evidence sufficient to create a jury issue \u201cthat the government\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person other than one ready to commit it.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>43 F.3d 618, 623 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation marks omitted). The defendant meets this burden if he produces evidence that the government\u2019s conduct included some form of persuasion or mild coercion. <em>Id. </em>The defendant may show persuasion with evidence that he \u201chad not favorably received the government plan, and the government had to \u2018push it\u2019 on him, or that several attempts at setting up an illicit deal had failed and on at least one occasion he had directly refused to participate.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir.2002). However, the government\u2019s mere suggestion of a crime or initiation of contact is insufficient to demonstrate inducement. <em>Brown, </em>43 F.3d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In this case, the district court concluded that Toussaint failed to show government inducement. The recorded conversations proffered at trial showed that Toussaint was a willing participant in the offenses and did not show any coercion or persuasion. <em>See Brown, </em>43 F.3d at 623 (explaining that the government\u2019s initiation of contact or suggestion is not enough to show inducement). Rather, Toussaint\u2019s own statements during the conversations showed that he was not induced to commit the crimes. <em>Ryan, </em>289 F.3d at 1345 (explaining that inducement requires an opportunity to commit the crime \u201cplus something like excessive pressure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Although Toussaint testified at trial, even accepting his testimony as true, Toussaint did not meet his burden to show government inducement. Toussaint testified that throughout the summer of 2013, Jeudy and Polo repeatedly called and visited him, asking for help setting up a fraudulent tax preparation business. Toussaint testified that although he always refused, he realized they were not going to stop bothering him. Toussaint finally agreed to participate because he thought they would leave him alone and because he was afraid of them due to their criminal records. However, Toussaint admitted that Jeudy and Polo never threatened him.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">In short, even according to Toussaint, Jeudy and Polo\u2019s repeated requests for help occurred over the summer of 2013, before the government\u2019s use of Jeudy and Polo as confidential informants began in October 2013. Given that Jeudy and Polo were not government informants at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>time, nothing they said then could qualify as government conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In any event, the district court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction was not reversible error because Toussaint was able to proffer a defense. <em>See Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947-48 (explaining that there is reversible error only when the failure to give an entrapment instruction \u201cseriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense\u201d). Among other things, Toussaint\u2019s counsel argued the entrapment issue to the jury in closing argument, and the jury was able to consider the defense, Toussaint\u2019s testimony, and the recorded statements to determine whether Toussaint\u2019s claim of entrapment had merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">III. RELEVANT CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Toussaint contends the district court clearly erred in finding that another tax-fraud conspiracy involving Toussaint and both CIs for the 2012 tax year was relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 for purposes of calculating Toussaint\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">\u201cWhen calculating a defendant\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines, the sentencing court must consider all \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 as defined in [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d <em>United States v. Siegelman, </em>786 F.3d 1322, 1332 (11th Cir.2015). \u201c[Relevant conduct is broadly defined to include both uncharged and acquitted conduct that is proven at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\u201d and \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of\u2019 jointly undertaken criminal activity \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), (2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">\u201cFor two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 9(A). \u201cAccordingly, we consider whether there are distinctive similarities between the offense of conviction and the remote conduct that signal that they are part of a single course of conduct rather than isolated, unrelated events that happen only to be similar in kind.\u201d <em>Siegelman, </em>786 F.3d at 1333 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also consider the \u201csimilarity, regularity, and temporal proximity between the offense of conviction and the uncharged conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Here, the district court included as relevant conduct another stolen identity refund fraud scheme that occurred in the prior tax year (2012) and involved Defendant Toussaint, the CIs Jeudy and Polo, and a woman named Whitney McCoy (\u201cthe McCoy scheme\u201d). According to testimony at sentencing, in the McCoy scheme, Toussaint approached Jeudy and Polo about obtaining an electronic filing number (EIFN) in their names, but neither could do so because they had criminal records. Instead, Jeudy and Polo recruited McCoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>as a \u201cjunky\u201d for that purpose. Toussaint, meanwhile, recruited Rosemond Jeanty to provide the software necessary to use the EIFN. The conspirators then filed over 500 fraudulent tax returns using stolen personal identifying information, seeking more than $1,000,000 in refunds and the IRS paying about $317,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">It was during the undercover investigation of the McCoy scheme that agents learned of Toussaint. Jeudy and Polo subsequently agreed to become confidential informants in an investigation of Toussaint during the 2013 tax year. During the recorded conversations between Toussaint and the CIs, they spoke about the McCoy scheme from the prior year, with Toussaint boasting that McCoy did not know how much money they had made. Toussaint also told the CIs that Rosemond Jeanty would again help with software.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In light of this evidence, the district court did not clearly err when it found that the earlier McCoy conspiracy was part of a common scheme or plan. The two schemes were substantially similar and temporally connected. First, the McCoy scheme involved a stolen identity refund fraud scheme during the 2012 tax season and the instant offenses were committed ostensibly to facilitate a similar stolen identity refund scheme for the following tax season. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 9(b) (noting that the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d includes consideration of the nature of the offenses, listing as an example tax fraud, which would only occur at yearly intervals). Second, the two conspiracies involved common accomplices. Jeudy, Polo, and Toussaint were involved in both frauds. And, Toussaint enlisted Jeanty\u2019s assistance in both schemes. Third, the two schemes had similar modus operandi. In the McCoy scheme, Toussaint used Polo and Jeudy to find a \u201cjunky\u201d whose identification they could use to obtain an EFIN and file fraudulent tax returns. In the instant case, Toussaint obtained personal identity information, and he instructed Polo and Jeudy to find another \u201cjunky\u201d to obtain an EFIN. In both cases, they relied on Jeanty to obtain the software <em>for </em>the EFIN.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Toussaint relies on <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006 (11th Cir.1994), but the facts of <em>Maxwell </em>are distinguishable. In <em>Maxwell, </em>this Court concluded that a cocaine distribution scheme more than one year earlier was not relevant conduct to a dilaudid distribution scheme because it did not involve any of the same parties except the defendant, was temporally remote, and was not sufficiently similar except that both instances were drug offenses. 34 F.3d at 1011. Here, unlike in <em>Maxwell, </em>the two tax fraud schemes were connected by at least two common factors \u2014 the same accomplices and the same modus operandi \u2014 and were temporally close, one following on the heels of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In sum, the district court did not err in concluding that the McCoy conspiracy was relevant conduct under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a)(2) and considering that conduct in calculating Toussaint\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Toussaint\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">. Because these conversations were conducted in Haitian Creole, the jury was given transcripts of the conversations translated into English. The parties stipulated that the transcripts and their English translations were true and accurate recordings of the conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">. The five statements by Cl Jeudy were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">1. \u201cThe thing that I need is the stuff, the information. Do you understand?

He told me he is having a problem with his wife. He kicked the woman out last night.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADo\">2. \"I will need a lot.

Although this Court typically reviews a district court's refusal to give a requested jury instruction for an abus\u2019e of discretion, it is unclear whether we review a district court\u2019s decision not to give an entrapment instruction based on the defendant's failure to produce sufficient evidence of governmental inducement <em>de novo </em>or for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sistrunk, </em>622 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2010) (collecting cases).
