The district court dismissed his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, Lichten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>berg argues that the concept of sovereign immunity did not apply to his case. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. <em>Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). We also construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, if a party does not brief a legal claim or argument, it is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Federal courts are limited in their jurisdiction to the power conferred by the Constitution and federal statutes, and the party invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction bears the burden of proving the existence of federal jurisdiction. <em>Bishop, </em>210 F.3d at 1298. Jurisdiction may be based on a civil action alleging a violation of the United States Constitution, or a federal cause of action established by a Congressionallycreated expressed or implied private remedy for violations of a federal statute. <em>City of Huntsville v. City of Madison, </em>24 F.3d 169, 171-72 (11th Cir.1994). If the district court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it must dismiss the action. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). Further, the United States is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued. <em>Zelaya v. United States, </em>781 F.3d 1315, 1321 (11th Cir.2015). If there is no specific waiver of sovereign immunity as to a particular claim, the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Section 1001 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code is a criminal statute prohibiting knowingly making false or fraudulent statements or. concealing information in a matter within federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. It does not provide a civil cause of action. <em>See id. </em>However, RICO provides a civil cause of action and grants jurisdiction to the district courts to hear those claims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Here, even construing Lichtenberg\u2019s pleadings liberally, he has not fully briefed the relevant issue on appeal, since he has cited no legal authority to support his proposition that sovereign immunity did not apply. But even if we were to examine the merits of the district court\u2019s dismissal, we would conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Lichtenberg\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. First, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 does not provide a civil cause of action, and therefore, the district court could not have had jurisdiction over his claim. Second, while RICO provides a civil cause of action, Lichtenberg has not shown that the United States specifically waived its sovereign immunity for that claim. Thus, none of the statutes he relied on provided the court with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Finally, Lichtenberg\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s dismissal conflicted with its order from January 5, 2015 \u2014 which granted Lichtenberg additional time to properly serve the Navy with his complaint \u2014 lacks merit. The January order was not relevant to the dismissal order, nor did it conflict with the order, since the court had the authority to dismiss Lichtenberg\u2019s complaint if it determined \u2014 as it did \u2014 that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
