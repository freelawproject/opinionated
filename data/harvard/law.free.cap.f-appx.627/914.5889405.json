Jerry challenges his enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) on multiple grounds, including that the residual clause is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">Under the ACCA, a person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d in several ways, one of which is commonly called the residual clause. Under that clause, a violent felony is any offense that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">The district court sentenced Jerry under the ACCA after finding that he had three qualifying prior convictions, all three of which qualified under the residual clause. Jerry argued both before the district court and in his opening brief on appeal that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. In light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), the Government concedes that Jerry is correct. <em>See id. </em>at 2563. We vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>and remand for resentencing without reference to the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
