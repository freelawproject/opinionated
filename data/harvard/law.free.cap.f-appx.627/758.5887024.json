No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">In 2009, Liu\u2019s then-wife \u2014 Hong Zhang\u2014 filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief based on China\u2019s family-planning policy. Briefly stated, Zhang asserted that, because she got pregnant out-of-wedlock and was ineligible for a birth permit, she was forced to have an abortion, was subjected to public ridicule, and was required to pay a fine. Liu (the baby\u2019s father) was listed as a derivative beneficiary on Zhang\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief, concluding that Zhang\u2019s claim was not credible. Zhang and Liu appealed to the BIA. While their appeal was pending, however, two pertinent things happened: (1) Zhang and Liu divorced and (2) Zhang withdrew voluntarily her appeal to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-19\">Then, in its September 2014 order, the BIA dismissed Liu\u2019s appeal. The BIA determined that (1) Liu had filed no independent application for asylum or other relief; (2) Liu lacked standing to pursue independently the claim for relief raised in Zhang\u2019s asylum application; and (3) Liu was no longer eligible for derivative status now that he and Zhang were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-21\">We have already addressed Liu\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 2014 order. <em>See Liu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>601 Fed.Appx. 921 (11th Cir.2015) (unpublished). In that petition for review, Liu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>asserted two arguments: (1) the BIA erred in determining that Liu filed no independent asylum application; and (2) the BIA erred in dismissing Liu\u2019s appeal instead of remanding his case to the IJ for further proceedings. We rejected both arguments, concluding substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Liu filed no separate asylum application and concluding we lacked jurisdiction to consider Liu\u2019s argument about a remand, because he failed to raise it to the BIA. <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">1. <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In Liu\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s September 2014 order, Liu challenged the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal for the same two arguments he raised in his first petition for review with this Court. The BIA denied the motion, and Liu now reasserts the same two arguments in this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Because we have already rejected each of the arguments that Liu raises on appeal when we denied his first petition for review, he is precluded from raising them again. Under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, an appellate court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions are \u201cgenerally binding on all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009). The exceptions to this rule are few: \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence; (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue; or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because these exceptions are inapplicable here, we deny Liu\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. Moreover, the BIA abused no discretion in determining that Liu failed to establish an error of law or fact sufficient to warrant reconsideration of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">2. <em>Motion to Reopen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Liu also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his appeal. In his motion, Liu argued that he was entitled to file a new asylum application \u2014 pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(C), (ii) \u2014 -because his divorce constituted a \u201cchanged circumstance.\u201d The BIA denied the motion, noting that Liu could have filed his own asylum application earlier in the proceedings but chose not to. The BIA also concluded (1) that Liu\u2019s divorce was no \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d that affected materially his eligibility for asylum; and (2) that Liu\u2019s proposed asylum application raised a claim identical to the claim raised in Zhang\u2019s application, which the IJ already denied as not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, determining only \u201cwhether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cMotions to reopen in removal proceedings are particularly disfavored.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">\u201cA motion <em>to </em>reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing[.]\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen if, among other things, the petitioner fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case or the petitioner fails to submit evidence that' is both material and previously unavailable. <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256. To demonstrate that evidence is \u201cmaterial,\u201d a petitioner bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to show that, \u201cif the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>The BIA abused no discretion in denying Liu\u2019s motion to reopen. Liu presented no \u201cmaterial\u201d facts: facts that would likely change the outcome of the case. Liu\u2019s proposed asylum application is based on the same set of facts already raised in Zhang\u2019s application. Liu conceded in his motion for reconsideration that, because the IJ had already denied relief after hearing testimony from both Zhang and Liu, Liu\u2019s filing a new asylum application was unlikely to produce a different result. Because Liu has failed to present new \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence, the BIA\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s motion to reopen was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-17\"> Whether Liu\u2019s divorce constituted a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d for purposes of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(C), (ii), is not pertinent to our decision. Liu seeks no asylum relief <em>based on </em>his \"changed circumstance,\u201d and Liu has failed to show that his divorce would likely change the outcome of his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
