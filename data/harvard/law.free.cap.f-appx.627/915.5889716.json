The district court denied Orlansky\u2019s petition after finding that the restitution order did not have any legal defect and that the court in his underlying criminal proceeding had the power to reduce his restitution obligations pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2). Shortly after this order, the court in Orlansky\u2019s criminal proceeding actually did reduce his restitution obligations under \u00a7 3664(j)(2), Orlansky argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying a writ of <em>audita querela </em>because the exact amount of the restitution reduction remains undetermined in his criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a petitioner is entitled to a writ of <em>audita querela. United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The writ of <em>audita querela </em>is \u201can ancient writ used to attack the enforcement of a judgment after it was rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The writ was typically employed by a debtor in a civil case to stop a judgment\u2019s execution \u201cbecause of some defense or discharge arising subsequent to the rendition of the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A writ of <em>audita querela </em>is now available only to attack a criminal judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">Federal courts have the authority to \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). However, this \u201cresidual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute\u201d does not apply if a statute specifically addresses the issue. <em>Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 361, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). Where a statute has a mechanism for relief, we may not grant a writ of <em>audita querela. See Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-25\">Under 18' U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f), a restitution order must set the restitution amount as the full amount of a victim\u2019s loss without any reduction for third-party compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>to the victim. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1). However, the court may reduce a restitution order \u201cby any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The district court did not err in denying Orlanksy\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Orlansky\u2019s main argument is that we should reduce his restitution order to prevent the victim in his case from receiving a double recovery as a result of compensatory damages the victim received from another party for the same loss. However, \u00a7 3664(j)(2) provides a statutory remedy for just this situation. In fact Orlansky has already sought and received a reduction in his restitution obligation based on this statutory remedy. This statutory remedy forecloses relief by way of a writ of <em>audita querela. See Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">To the extent Orlansky\u2019s brief can be construed as challenging the court\u2019s restitution reduction under \u00a7 3664(j)(2) in his criminal proceeding, we lack jurisdiction to consider that challenge. We have jurisdiction to review \u201conly those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987). Orlansky appealed only the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for a writ of <em>audita querela, </em>not any judgment in his criminal proceeding. The district court thus did not err by denying Orlanksy\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>audita querela.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
