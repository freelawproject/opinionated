Evans alleged that Jimmie C. Cessna struck him with a motor vehicle while Evans was riding a bicycle. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the district court dismissed Evans\u2019s action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">A district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim for relief. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii). Evans does not challenge the reasons provided by the district court for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action against Cessna, who is not a state actor. Evans also does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that diversity jurisdiction did not exist over his negligence claim, nor the court\u2019s decision declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claims. Because Evans does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint, he has abandoned the claims on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Evans\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 462-63 (5th Cir.1998). Evans has already accumulated at least one other strike. <em>See Evans v. State of Mississippi, </em>No. 3:13-cv-00996 (S.D. Miss. April 7, 2014). Evans is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes, then he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
