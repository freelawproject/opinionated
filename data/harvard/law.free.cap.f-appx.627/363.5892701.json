The district court held that Pena was not entitled to a reduction because the drug quantity for which he was held accountable at his original sentencing would result in the same base offense level after the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). At his original sentencing, Pena was assigned a base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) because he was held accountable for the equivalent of 477,-540 kilograms of marijuana. Under amended \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Pena\u2019s base offense level remains 38. Thus, Amendment 782 did not lower Pena\u2019s applicable guidelines ranges, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s,</p>\n<p id=\"b389-22\">Pena complains that the district court should not have based its decision on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>presentence report without giving him notice and an opportunity to challenge its reliability. He also complains that the district court denied his motion without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He has not shown an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, any attempt to relitigate the facts underlying Pena\u2019s original conviction and sentencing exceeds the limited scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 711-12 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
