Hu\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants breached these contracts by failing to pay for goods that she shipped to them. In support of these allegations,- Hu attached two documents to her complaint: (1) a table that she prepared containing the defendants\u2019 payment history and a calculation of late fees, and (2) an unauthenticated e-mail from defendant Makoto Haneda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>acknowledging an \u201cunpaid debt.\u201d Haneda filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss Hu\u2019s complaint, alleging that the parties settled these claims, and he attached the purported settlement agreement in support of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">After considering the submissions, the magistrate judge recommended that if the district court treats Haneda\u2019s motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, Hu\u2019s complaint should be dismissed because: (1) it did not include a particularized statement of facts to support her contention that she entered into a contract with all three defendants, and (2) it did not allege that any contractual terms were reduced to writing, nor did Hu attach any writing, which is required by Texas\u2019 statute of frauds for contracts for the sale of goods over $500. Alternatively, the magistrate judge recommended that if the district court considers evidence outside the pleadings and treats the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for summary judgment, the motion should be granted because Hu had not produced any evidence of a contract that was reduced to writing. After the magistrate judge issued her report and recommendations to the district court, but before the district court ruled, Hu moved to amend her complaint in response to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. She attached the amended complaint and an \u201caffidavit\u201d with fourteen exhibits (largely e-mail correspondence between Hu and the defendants) to her motion. The district court later adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied all other pending motions as moot, Hu appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">On appeal, Hu contends that: (1) the district court erred in granting Haneda\u2019s motion to dismiss because Haneda admitted the existence of a contract in the pleadings thus taking the contract outside of the statute of frauds under Texas law, and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in not permitting her to amend her complaint because an amendment would not cause undue delay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">After a careful review of the briefing and the record, we find no reversible error of law or fact'. We agree with the district court and magistrate judge that Haneda\u2019s admission in an e-mail that he owed Hu an \u201cunpaid debt\u201d does not constitute an admission of the existence of a contract, sufficient to fall within an exception to the writing requirement of Texas\u2019 statute of frauds. <em>See </em>Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 2.201(c)(2) (Vernon 2009) (noting that a contract not meeting the requirements of the statute of frauds is enforceable against a party who admits \u201cin his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that <em>a contract for sale was made\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Additionally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hu\u2019s motion to amend her complaint because, even accepting the amended complaint and attached exhibits as true, they are still insufficient to demonstrate the existence and minimum required terms of a written contract. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.201(a) (\u201ca contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ment is sought\u201d); <em>see, e.g., Westlake Petrochemicals, L.L.C. v. United Polychem, Inc., </em>688 F.3d 232, 241 (5th Cir.2012) (holding that the contract at issue satisfied the statute of frauds because it identified the quantity term, price, product, and delivery terms). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-5\">. Hu also contends that the district court erred by purportedly granting Haneda's motion for summary judgment. Though the magistrate judge\u2019s report recommended, in the alternative, that if the district court were to consider evidence outside the pleadings it should treat Haneda\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and grant it, a close review of the district court\u2019s order indicates that the court treated Haneda\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, not a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we do not consider this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
