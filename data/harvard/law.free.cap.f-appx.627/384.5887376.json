Wilson-Hooker asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of this argument, he maintains that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 illegal reentry sentencing guideline should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness because it is not empirically based, double counts certain predicate criminal convictions, overstates the seriousness of the illegal reentry offense, and does not provide just punishment for the offense. Wilson-Hooker additionally asserts that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics, namely, his terrible childhood, conscription with the Contras, unsuccessful attempt to gain political asylum in the United States, and motive for returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When a sentence falls within a properly calculated guidelines range, we apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Wilson-Hooker\u2019s empirical basis challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected the argument that a sentence imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2 is substantively unreasonable because certain predicate criminal convictions are double counted in the computation of a defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected the assertion that \u00a7 2L1.2 overstates the seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, Wilson-Hooker\u2019s remaining arguments are nothing more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is insufficient to show the district court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
