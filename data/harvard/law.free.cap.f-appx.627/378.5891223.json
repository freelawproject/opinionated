Boutte, pro se federal prisoner # 13611-035, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a writ of error coram nobis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). Boutte is serving a 120-month sentence of imprisonment imposed following his 2009 guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. According to Boutte, his conduct did not meet the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) definition of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense because the weapon was not used in furtherance of the drug offense. Therefore, he contends, the district court violated his constitutional right to due process by accepting his plea to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">Although the district court did not address its jurisdiction, this court must consider the basis of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>See EEOC v. Agro Distribution, LLC, </em>555 F.3d 462, 467 (5th Cir.2009). Boutte was not entitled to relief through a motion for a writ of error coram nobis because he is still in custody. <em>See United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2004). Because he is challenging his federal sentence, the district court should have con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>strued his motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). The district court, however, lacked jurisdiction to do so because Boutte previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, and this court did not authorize the filing of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>388 Fed.Appx. 385, 386 (5th Cir.2010); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Boutte\u2019s appeal is thus \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the motion. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
