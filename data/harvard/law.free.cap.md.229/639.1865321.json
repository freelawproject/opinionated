It does not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that these questions were raised below. <em>Murray v. Director, </em>228 Md. 658, 661. In any event they have been considered in prior cases and found to be without merit. <em>Eggleston v. State, </em>209 Md. 504; <em>Simmons v. Director, 227 </em>Md. 661, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The petitioner also contends that he is not a defective delinquent, that the court erred in submitting an interrogatory to the jury, and in \u201cprotecting the image of Patuxent Institution\u201d. These contentions are without merit. There was sufficient testimony to warrant submission of the case to the jury. Dr. Gundry, the petitioner\u2019s own witness, testified that the petitioner was a potential threat to society. The interrogatory in question, given to the jury in connection with the court\u2019s careful and elaborate charge, simply contained the statutory definition with certain key words underscored. We think there was no reversible error in the interrogatory, nor do we think there was reversible error in the court\u2019s description of Patuxent Institution, in which the court repeated what this court has said and recited some of the legislative purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Other contentions, not raised below, are not subject to review here. <em>Weddle v. Director, 227 </em>Md. 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
