The cab driver testified that when appellant was asked to pay his fare he replied, \u201cI ain\u2019t going to pay you nothing, this is a holdup\u201d, at which time the driver noted the blade of a knife sticking out of appellant\u2019s hand. The driver stated that a struggle ensued during which appellant threw the knife at the driver, but missed his mark, whereupon the driver pinned appellant to the ground. A policeman, called by another driver who had come upon the scene, testified that when he arrived the cab driver was holding the appellant on the ground and that both were \u201cbreathless as though a struggle had happened.\u201d The officer found the knife some 75 feet away from the scene after being informed by the driver of the direction in which it had been thrown. At the trial the appellant denied owning the penknife and denied that the cab driver had touched him or that any struggle had taken place. His version was that the driver called the police when he offered to get money to pay the fare in a nearby house and that he was standing beside the cab when the policeman arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The credibility of the witnesses was a matter for the trier of fact to determine, and the trial judge was under no obligation to believe the appellant\u2019s story. <em>Knuckles v. State, </em>228 Md. 318 (1962). The evidence was ample to support the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Appellant\u2019s only other contention is that the trial court erred in admitting the penknife into evidence without sufficient identification of it as belonging to the appellant. The knife was identified by both the police officer and the cab driver 'as the weapon found at the scene of the crime after a search by the officer of the area where the thrown knife would have landed. We have consistently held that a probability of connection of proffered evidence with a crime is enough to malee It admissible, its weight being for the trier of fact to evaluate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Spriggs v. State, </em>226 Md. 50 (1961). We find no error in the admission of the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
