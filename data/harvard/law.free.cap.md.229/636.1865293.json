The trial judge, after a brief hearing in open court, granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground \u201cthat Mr. Cook does not allege such facts or error that has not either been previously acted upon either by the Trial or Appellate Court, or has not been waived as a result of trial, and as a result have no assignment of error in the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Under the provisions of Rule BK45 (b) of the Maryland Rules every order on a petition filed for relief under the Act \u201cshall include or be accompanied by a short memorandum of the grounds of the petition, the questions, including specifically the federal and State rights involved, and the reasons for the action taken thereon.\u201d It is apparent, without going into the merits of the petitioner\u2019s alleged grounds for relief, that the summary dismissal of his petition does not comply with the requirements of this Rule. In <em>Brigmon v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 622, this same question arose under Code (1959 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, Sec. 645G, which has since been repealed, Acts 1962, Ch. 36, Sec. 1, and replaced by the Rule quoted above, and which read in part: \u201cThe order making final disposition of the petition shall clearly state the grounds on which the case was determined and whether a federal or a state right was presented and decided.\u201d The Court, in remanding the case for further disposition, pointed out through Judge Prescott that \u201cthe plain direction of the statute\u201d required the final order to contain \u201ca statement of the Federal and State rights \u2018presented and decided,\u2019 as well as \u2018the grounds on which the case was determined.\u2019 \u201d We find it necessary to remand this case for further proceedings in accord with Rule BK45 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\n<em>Application for leave to appeal granted and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
