This proceeding must therefore be remanded for further proceedings to the end that the lower court may decide whether or not the applicant was a defective delinquent at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">\n<em>Application for leave to appeal granted and petition remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
