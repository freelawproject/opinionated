Byrd, Jr., who was convicted of larceny by the Criminal Court of Baltimore sitting without a jury, appeals. He contends, essentially, that the State failed to prove the corporate existence of the alleged owner of the stolen vehicle, that it failed to prove the ownership of the vehicle, and that it produced insufficient evidence to convict him of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">The indictment under which Byrd was convicted charged him with larceny of a 1961 Chevrolet Impala from \u201cCity Chevrolet Co., Inc., a corporation.\u201d At trial, the State\u2019s first question of its first witness \u2014 a salesman for City Chevrolet' \u2014 - was, \u201cDirecting your attention to October 20, 1961 [the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>of the larceny], you were employed by the City Chevrolet <em>Corporation </em>at that time, is that correct?\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u25a0The witness replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The salesman\u2019s subsequent testimony established that the stolen vehicle belonged to City \u25a0Chevrolet and that he had been using it as a demonstrator at the time of its theft. The sales manager for City Chevrolet also testified that the car \u201cbelonged to City Chevrolet.\u201d Although no testimony concerning the Chevrolet agency \u2014 after the initial question to the salesman \u2014 identified it as a corporation, each witness thereafter called it \u201cCity Chevrolet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As we said in <em>Richardson v. State, </em>221 Md. 85, 89, \u201cformal Tprooi\u201d of a corporation\u2019s existence is not necessary in a criminal proceeding; it may be proved \u201corally and by general reputation.\u201d We think the evidence produced by the State in this cease sufficient in this regard, and the <em>Richardson </em>case almost parallel on its facts. The appellant relies heavily upon <em>Sippie v. State, </em>227 Md. 449, a reversal, where not only was there a complete absence of any proof of corporate existence but also a failure on the part of the State to prove the ownership of stolen money. Here, there was clear proof of ownership, as amply shown by the testimony of the salesman and the sales manager of City Chevrolet. <em>Cf. Wersten v. State, </em>228 Md. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Finally, the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to allow the trial court to conclude that Byrd had exercised control and dominion over the car shortly after it was stolen from City Chevrolet. There was testimony that he had been seen sitting in the car, that he had inquired as to the cost of a new tire for it (the spare tire was missing when the police impounded the car, which had been parked one block from Byrd\u2019s home), and that he had asked about the price of a battery \u201chot-shot\u201d for it. Also, there were produced in evidence documents which had been in the glove compartment of the car at the time of its theft and which the police had subsequently found in Byrd\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">This recent possession of the stolen vehicle, which the trial judge concluded was not explained by the appellant\u2019s alibi, justified the inference that Byrd was the thief of the car. See <em>Glaros v. State, </em>223 Md. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
