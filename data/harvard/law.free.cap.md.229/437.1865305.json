The real question to be determined is whether the allegations of the petition, considered as a whole, are sufficient to withstand appellee\u2019s demurrer. We shall, therefore, consider them as a whole, and point out why the trial court was correct in his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">For the purposes of this case, we shall assume, without deciding, that a <em>mandamus </em>proceeding is a proper one to obtain relief from officials, who are entrusted with discretion in the performance of their duties, but who exercise that discretion in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The amended petition, in substance, alleges: that petitioners are residents and voters of Baltimore County, and \u201cdefendants\u201d constitute the Board of Election Supervisors; that on April 30, 1962, petitioners proceeded to the office of the defendants for the purpose of submitting over 10,000 signatures on nominating petitions; that they were treated rudely, and required to undergo certain indignities, but they filed their nominating petitions; that on May 25, 1962, they received telegrams (presumably from the defendants) requesting $9,204 on, or before, May 28 for the publication of the names; that petitioners filed a petition for a writ of <em>mandamus, </em>to compel the defendants to publish the names of the signatures in accordance with the statute; and that Judge Raine passed an order in which he directed the defendants to publish the names by a certain date, and he stated in said order, \u201cnominees [apellants] will be responsible for the reasonable costs of publication consistent with Section 68 of Article 33\u201d of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The petition further alleges: that prior to the filing of their petitions they \u201cdid make inquiry and were advised that the cost of publication * * * would not exceed $2,000.00\u201d; that they had spoken to counsel of the Board and he had stated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Jeffersonian or County Paper (county papers) would be satisfactory; that two members of the Board threatened to inflict physical injury on petitioners\u2019 counsel; that the Board arbitrarily and capriciously did cause the names to be published in the Sunpapers for $9,204, \u201cwith full knowledge that the cost of the same publication could have been secured from the Jeffersonian for $1,680.00 or the County Paper for $1,920.00\u201d; and that the petitioners had tendered $1,920 to the Board in full payment of publication costs, but this sum had been refused. The petition prayed that the Board be commanded to accept the $1,920 in full payment from appellants for the publication of the nominating petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 33, \u00a7 68 reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cWhere such [nominating] petitions are filed with the boards of supervisors of elections, said board within thirty days after the filing of such petition shall cause to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the county, or the City of Baltimore, as the case may be, the names of all of the signers of any such petition, together with an explanation of the nature of the petition to which such persons\u2019 names are affixed. The cost of such publication shall be paid by the nominee whose name is thereby entered on the ballot; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">There can be little doubt that the wording of this section vests a certain amount of discretion in the Board in selecting the newspaper in which to publish the names, and the phraseology \u201cat least once in a newspaper\u201d indicates that under some circumstances it may be proper for the Board to make more than one publication of the names. There is no requirement that the contract for publication be submitted to public bidding, or that the cheapest offer for publication be accepted. The requirements of the statute particularly pertinent here require, at least, one publication, within 30 days after the filing of the petition, of <em>all </em>the signers on the petition and an explanation of the nature of said petition in a newspaper of general circulation in Baltimore County. It is conceded that the Board made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>one, and only one, publication in the Sunpapers. It has been stated that whether a newspaper is one of \u201cgeneral circulation\u201d is a matter of substance, not merely of size: it is one that circulates among all classes and is not confined to a particular class or calling in the community, and it is a term generally applied to a newspaper to which the general public will resort in order to be informed of the news and intelligence of the day, editorial opinion, and advertisements, and thereby to render it probable that the notices or official advertising will be brought to the attention of the general public. 66 C.J.S., <em>Newspapers, </em>\u00a7 4, p. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">A reading of the allegations of the amended petition, as they are outlined above, discloses that there is no allegation that the Jeffersonian or the County Paper were newspapers of \u201cgeneral circulation\u201d in a legal sense (we do not intimate that they are or that they are not); nor is there any allegation as to the comparable circulations of these newspapers in Baltimore County with the circulation of the newspaper in which publication was actually made, so that the factor of disparity of costs, as it relates to the question of arbitrary action by the Board, may be weighed and considered. The mere fact that the Board incurred an expense for the publication in excess of the amount that two county newspapers would have inserted the notice in their columns for does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>show capricious conduct on the part of the Board. Baltimore County has a population of some five hundred thousand people; it is important that any official public notice be brought to the attention of, at least, a substantial portion of the general public; therefore, it is necessary to know the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different publications in determining whether the action of the Board was whimsical and irresponsible. In addition, the allegation that appellants \u201cdid make inquiry and were advised that the cost of publication * * * would not exceed $2,000\u201d can hardly be considered a clear and direct allegation of fact in support of a petition for <em>mandamus. </em>Appellants have laid great stress on the portion of Judge Raine\u2019s order quoted above which stated that the \u201cnominees will be responsible for the reasonable costs of publication consistent with Section 68 of Article 33,\u201d arguing that this order limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the obligation of the appellants to the <em>reasonable </em>costs of publication and no more. We think that this portion of Judge Raine\u2019s order is no more than a repetition of the meaning of the statute: it is extremely unlikely that the legislature anticipated that nominees should be required to pay an <em>unreasonable </em>amount for costs under any circumstances. The allegation of the statement made by the Board\u2019s counsel with reference to other papers being \u201csatisfactory for publication\u201d has no binding effect on the Board in the absence of a concurrence of a majority of the Board; and the allegation that the appellees did \u201carbitrarily, capriciously and dogmatically\u201d cause the names to be published amounts to no more than a conclusion of the pleaders. <em>Brack v. </em>Wells, 184 Md. 86, 90, 40 A. 2d 319. We hold that Judge Turnbull was correct in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As the <em>per curiam </em>order heretofore filed affirming the order of the trial court did not direct the payment of costs, it is ordered that the appellants pay the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
