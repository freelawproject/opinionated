HX5, L.L.C., etc., et </em>al., - So.3d -, No. 1D12-2885 (Fla. 1st DCA October 18, 2013), Appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Appellees on Appellant\u2019s counts of tortious interference with a contract and advantageous business relationship and the court\u2019s award of costs to Appellees. As in the companion case, genuine issues of material fact exist to preclude Appellees\u2019 entitlement to summary judgment. Thus, we reverse the summary judgment and costs award and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-18\">BENTON and CLARK, JJ., concur; THOMAS, J., Dissents with Opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b213-19\">THOMAS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE6\">DISSENTING.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Appellees InfoPro and Charles Brasfeild, with respect to ADC\u2019s claim against them for tortious interference with a contract and advantageous business relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">ADC\u2019s damages claim is based on the assumption that, had HX5 teamed together with it rather than InfoPro, their joint bid would also have been successful. This is pure speculation and, as I discuss in my opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in the companion case of <em>Alpha Data Corp. v. HX5, L.L.C., etc., et al., </em>\u2014 So.3d -, No. 1D12-2885 (Fla. 1st DCA October 18, 2013), \u201cconcerning damages for anticipated loss of profits in a commercial enterprise, the general rule is that such damages are too speculative and dependent upon changing circumstances to warrant a judgment for their loss.\u201d <em>Fla. Outdoor, Inc. v. Stewart, </em>318 So.2d 414, 415 (Fla. 2d DCA 1975). Thus, because any damages alleged by ADC for the interference alleged here are purely speculative, ADC\u2019s claim must fail, and the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-24\">Furthermore, \u201cwithin the[ ] elements [of tortious interference] is the requirement that the plaintiff establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused or induced the breach that resulted in the plaintiffs damages.\u201d <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Alday-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Donalson Title Co. of Florida, Inc., </em>832 So.2d 810, 814 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002). As discussed in my opinion in the companion case, the record demonstrates that, even before InfoPro contacted HX5 about pursuing the expiring service contract, relations between ADC and HX5 had been deteriorating. Thus, the record fails to support ADC\u2019s position that it was Info-Pro\u2019s overture that led to any \u201cbreach\u201d between the two companies. Nor, if the two companies were in fact drifting apart, could InfoPro\u2019s overture be accurately characterized as \u201cinterfering\u201d with the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">For a party to establish a tortious interference claim, \u201c[t]here must be a relationship in existence at the time of any alleged interference.\u201d <em>Bernstein v. True, </em>636 So.2d 1364, 1366 (Fla. 4th DCA 1994). As in <em>Bernstein, </em>\u201c[tjhere is nothing to indicate that [InfoPro\u2019s] involvement in the second agreement caused the [alleged] first one to fall apart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367. \u201cIn considering the element of causation, Florida courts have held that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant manifested a specific intent to interfere with the business relationship.\u201d <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., 832 </em>So.2d at 814. Here, there was no evidence that anyone at InfoPro had any specific intent to interfere with the alleged relationship or agreement between ADC and HX5 in general, or with respect to the HUBZone contract in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">For the foregoing reason, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s summary judgment and award of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
