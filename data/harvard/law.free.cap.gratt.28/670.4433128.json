It was a suit in equity in tlie circuit court of Gloucester county, brought in October, J872, by Mary E. Ware, the widow of Cinciunatus J. Ware, deceased, and daughter of Henry Hughes, deceased, against the administrator of Cinciunatus J. Ware, to have decreed to her certain judgments which had been recovered by the guardian of her husband, and which were based upon debts transferred *by the representatives of her father to the guardian of C. J. Ware, as a part of the distributive share in her father\u2019s estate. There was a decree dismissing the bill; and thereupon Mrs. Ware applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.

After the intermarriage of Mrs. Ware, the appellant, with Cincinnatus J. Ware, the administrator of her father\u2019s estate delivered to the guardian of Cincinnatus J. Ware, certain bonds in payment or satisfaction of Mrs. Ware\u2019s distributive share in that estate. These bonds, as is conceded, the guardian surrendered to the obligors respectively, taking in their place others payable to himself as guardian. Upon these he afterwards instituted suits, recovered judgments, sued out executions, which were levied upon the property of the debtors respectively. Forthcoming bonds were given and forfeited, and executions again issued and levied, but no sales were made of the property, in consequence of the stay laws passed in the early part of the war. All this occurred in the life time of Cincinnatus J. Ware, and during his minority. He was killed in battle while in the public service and before he attained twenty-one years of age. It is not seriously controverted, that these acts were sufficient to extinguish the entire interest *of Mrs. Ware in the subj'ect matter of controversy, if it be competent for a guardian of an infant husband to reduce into possession for the husband, the wife\u2019s ehoses in action. The learned counsel for the appellant takes the ground that the guardian has no such power; that it is a marital right personal to the husband, which he alone can exercise, and which he may exercise or not, at his pleasure; and in this case, the husband never having elected to reduce the wife\u2019s ehoses into possession, and not having ratified the acts of the guardian, whatever was done by the latter was without authority, and wholly ineffectual to divest the wife\u2019s interest. This point has been elaborated with great force and ingenuity in the printed brief of the counsel for the appellant. And it is to this our attention must be chiefly directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">It is well settled, that, as to the ehoses in action of the wife, marriage is only a qualified gift to the husband, upon condition that he gets possession during the coverture; Fir if he die before the wife, without having gained such possession, she, and not his personal representatives, will be entitled to them; but it is equally true, and has been so expressly held by this court, that the marital right, though it confers no absolute title to the property while a chose in action, yet attaches to the <em>chose in action </em>\u2014 vests &lt;ui appreciable interest therein \u2014 gives the right to make the property of which it is the representative absolutely that of the husband; and this right, vendible and assignable, is the subject of sale or gift to the extent of the husband\u2019s interests. When the assignment is without consideration, as in case oi a gift, if the husband dies before the chose is reduced into possession, the legal right of the wife of survivorship attaches and defeats the right of the assignee. If the assignment is special *for value, it is considered in many cases a <em>quasi </em>reduction into possession. which defeats the legal right of survivorship, and the assignee is only subject to the wife\u2019s equity to a settlement. See <em>Dold\u2019s trustee </em>v. <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, 2 Gratt. 98-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>110. In that case, the wife being entitled to a distributive share in her father\u2019s estate, it was agreed by the husband, who was then insolvent, it should be settled upon the wife, \u2022 and it was accordingly settled to her separate use. Although the husband thus declined to reduce the property into possession, and expressly waived his martial right thereto, this court, was unanimously of opinion, that it was liable to the claims of the husband\u2019s creditors, and might be subject to their payment, notwithstanding the settlement upon the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">It will thus be seen that the husband has an appreciable interest in the- wife\u2019s choses in action, which may be the subject of sale, gift, assignment or release, and may be appropriated by his creditors to the payment of their claims. See upon this point <em>Yerby and wife </em>v. <em>Lynch &amp; als., </em>3 Gratt. 439, 474, 477, 493-4, 567-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">This being so, it is difficult to understand why the chose is not subject to the ordinary rules and incidents applicable to any other estate of property of the ward which may be brought under the control and supervision of the guardian. Although the guardian has no beneficial interest in the estate of his ward, still his authority is coupled with an interest, and is not barely an office. In respect to the real estate, he may make a lease for years, upon which ejectment may be maintained; he may have an action of trespass against a stranger, in his own name, for spoiling the grass; he may have a writ of right of ward, and recover the land and damages, as well as the body of the ward; he *may assign dower and institute proceedings for partition. <em>Truss </em>v. <em>Old, </em>6 Rand. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In respect to- the personal estate, his powers are very extensive. His authority extends to the collection of debts and other <em>choses in action </em>belonging to the ward; to the receipt of legacies and distributive shares, and granting acquittances for the same. He may assign mortgages, compromise and submit to arbitration, and in fine, do whatever is necessary to protect the ward\u2019s interest. .</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Lawrence\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp; als., </em>11 Gratt. 111, a 'bond given to an' executor was transferred by him to a guardian as part of the ward\u2019s estate. This court held, that whatever interest the ward had in the bond was subject to the control of the guardian, who may receive the money thereon, if voluntarily paid; may sue for it in the common law courts in the name of the executor for' his own use as guardian, and cannot be prevented by the executor; or he may sell and transfer the bond to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Seeing that the guardian is thus clothed with very extensive powers in respect to the personal estate of the ward, conferred for the benefit of the latter, he ought, for the same reason, to have the power of making available the ward\u2019s interest in the wife\u2019s personal property. If the guardian is not authorized to do so, who is?- \u2014 not the wife certainly, because she is under the disability of coverture; nor the ward himself, he being under the disability of infancy. The result would be the loss of the debt or other interest, in many instances, for want of legal authority to collect or secure it. And however great might be the necessity of the husband and wife, and however ample the estate of the wife, there would be no hand to receive and apply it to their maintenance and support. The *same difficulties must arise with respect to the ordinary personal effects of the wife \u2014 such as horses, jewels, and the like \u2014 in the possession of third persons. No title vests in the husband until he takes them in his possession; but according to the theory of the learned counsel, he, being an infant, cannot elect to divest the wife\u2019s interest; and as the guardian is incompetent in such case to elect for him; the property must remain beyond the control of the husband or guardian until the former arrives at twenty-one years of age and makes his election to reduce it to his possession. It is no answer to this view to say that a court of equity might give relief. In the large majority of cases of goods and chattels belonging to the wife, and <em>choses in action </em>due her, no ground could be plausibly suggested for the jurisdiction of a court of chancery. Besides, according to the theory advanced, the right to reduce the wife\u2019s <em>choses </em>to possession is a marital right personal to the husband, to be exercised by him and him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">In the case before us, the personal representative of the estate of Hughes, the wife\u2019s father, might have paid the guardian the wife\u2019s distributive share in money instead of bonds \u2014 and such a payment would have been as valid as a payment made to an adult husband. If the administrator was willing to transfer, and the guardian to accept, solvent bonds, in discharge of the wife\u2019s interest, it was equally a good payment. There is no doubt that the guardian might at once have received payment from the obligors in these bonds. If he had done so, and loaned the money to third persons, or e.ven to the same obligors, the transaction would have been substantially the same as that before us. In either case, it was the exercise of a rightful authority, and was effectual to place the fund *under his control for the\" exclusive use and benefit of the husband. In every view that may be taken, the question is free from all difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">The last point to be considered is, whether the appellant has a valid claim to a settlement upon her of the whole or any part of the fund. The rule on that subject in this state is settled under repeated decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">It is thus laid down in <em>Poindexter and wife </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>15 Gratt. 363-369: Whenever the husband, in right of his wife, has obtained possession of and title to her property, his own title <em>jure mariti </em>becomes complete, and the property to the extent of his title, is subject to his right of disposition, and to the claims of creditors, like any other property of his otherwise acquired. And when the property, by being reduced into the husband\u2019s possession, has once been released from' the wife\u2019s equity, it can- never again be subjected to it. If it be recoverable at law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tlie aid of a court of equity be not invoked <em>to recover it, </em>her equity does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Tested by this rule, it is manifest that the appellant is not entitled to a settlement out of the fund which is the subject of controversy. That fund the personal representative of the husband was proceeding to collect at law, under judgment and execution, when this bill was filed by the appellant requiring him to account with and pay over to her such portion of it as might constitute a fair settlement. If the appellant\u2019s intestate be limited to her distributive share in her father\u2019s estate, that interest was satisfied by the transfer of the bonds to the guardian. If it be regarded as extending to the bonds so transferred, that interest was divested by the execution of the new bonds payable to the guardian, followed by the judgment and execution in -'\u25a0\u2022the name of the guardian. Whatever, therefore, may have been the nature of the wife\u2019s <em>chose, </em>it was reduced into the possession of the husband through the guardian in the lifetime of the former. The property being thus released from the appellant\u2019s equity cannot now be subjected to it. See opinions of judges in <em>Yerby </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>3 Gratt. 439. See also, <em>Harcum's adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Hudnall, </em>34 Gratt. 369, 380; 3 Rob. Prac. 204. For these reasons the decree of the circuit court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">DfiCKRB AFFIRMS\u00ae.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
