Fees as of a judgment on trial, should be charged. The case is the same, in principle, as where the jury fail to agree upon a verdict in the county court. And in that case it has been customary, in most parts of the state, to charge a jury fee as well as a full attorney fee in favor of the party recovering, and we think the practice is in accordance with the true intent of the terms of the statute. Such actions are as <em>really \u201c </em>tried\u201d as any other, although not always as <em>effectually.</em></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
