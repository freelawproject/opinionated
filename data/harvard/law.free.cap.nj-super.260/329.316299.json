He brought this action to recover personal injury protection (PIP) benefits under an automobile policy issued to his wife by the New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association (NJAFIUA). A Law Division judge entered summary judgment in favor of NJAFIUA based on a finding that the minivan was not a \u201cprivate passenger or station wagon type\u201d vehicle within the meaning of the policy and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Giordano was employed as a sales manager by Elmwood Auto Sales, Inc., a Ford dealership for new and used cars. As part of his compensation, he was issued a demonstration vehicle owned and insured by the dealership and bearing dealer license plates. The vehicle was available at all times to be test-driven by any prospective purchaser; when Giordano was at the showroom, his vehicle was always parked in front, with the \u201cnew car sticker\u201d in place, to attract the attention of customers. Giordano testified that \u201cat least 80%\u201d of the use of his vehicle was \u201cwork-related,\u201d but he was also permitted unrestricted personal use of it. Approximately every six months or 6,000 miles, he would replace the vehicle with a new one. The minivan Giordano was driving at the time of the accident was his then-assigned demonstration vehicle. It was fitted-out to carry seven passengers; it had air conditioning, a stereo sound system, leather bucket seats and carpeting and carried an automobile registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The accident occurred on a Sunday, while Giordano was engaged in personal pursuits. Traveling south on West Crescent Avenue in Allendale, he crossed the double yellow line into the northbound lane and struck a fully-loaded dump truck. As a named insured under the NJAFIUA insurance policy issued to his wife covering her own automobile, Giordano demanded PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>benefits payable under the policy to a \u201cnamed insured\u201d who sustains bodily injury while using \u201ca private passenger automobile.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a, the policy defines a private passenger automobile as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ\">a self-propelled vehicle designed for use principally on public roads and which is one of the following types:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">(1) a private passenger or station wagon type automobile,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">(2) a pickup, panel truck, delivery sedan, van, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">(3) a utility automobile designed for personal use as a camper or motor home</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">or for family recreational purposes; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">a \u2018private passenger automobile\u2019 does not include a motorcycle; an automobile used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers; a pickup, panel truck, delivery sedan, van or utility automobile customarily used for business, occupational or professional purposes other than farming or ranching, or a utility automobile customarily used for the transportation of passengers other than members of the user\u2019s family or their guests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The question is whether the minivan was \u201ca private passenger or station wagon type automobile\u201d or whether it was a \u201cvan ... customarily used for business, occupational or professional purposes other than farming or ranching.\u201d If it is characterized as \u201ca private passenger or station wagon type automobile\u201d PIP benefits are available notwithstanding that its customary use was for the dealership\u2019s business purposes. That is the holding of <em>Wagner v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 400 A.2d 497 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>60, 404 A.2d 1159 (1979), which awarded PIP benefits to a new car salesman injured while driving his employer\u2019s demonstration car to a prospective purchaser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">... we perceive no legislative design to exclude private passenger vehicles commercially owned and used in business pursuits [from the No-Fault Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-13\"><em>Id. </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31, 400 A.2d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">On the other hand, although the policy and the statute include a \u201cvan\u201d within the definition of \u201cprivate passenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>automobile,\u201d they exclude PIP benefits if the van is \u201ccustomarily used for business, occupational or professional purposes other than farming or ranching.\u201d <em>Cf. Cheatham v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judg. Bd., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 442, 429 A.2d 407 (App.Div.1981) (pickup truck not customarily used in business is an \u201cautomobile\u201d for PIP purposes). The Law Division judge found that exclusion applicable here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We can assume, without deciding, that the minivan was \u201ccustomarily used for business, occupational or professional purposes.\u201d But we are satisfied that it was not a \u201cvan\u201d as that term is used in the policy and in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a. A van is usually understood to be an enclosed vehicle used for the transportation of goods or animals. <em>See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, </em>1303 (Merriam-Webster, 1986). That is consistent with the grouping of \u201cvan\u201d together with \u201cpickup, panel truck, [and] delivery sedan\u201d in the definitional provisions of the policy and the statute. The minivan driven by Giordano was not such a vehicle. Rather, it was designed, equipped and obviously intended to be used precisely as a passenger automobile or station wagon is designed, equipped and used. Indeed, if the term \u201cminivan\u201d were not used in marketing the vehicle, there would be no basis to call it a \u201cvan\u201d at all. Marketing terminology, of course, does not determine the coverage provided by the insurance policy or required by the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In all relevant respects, the vehicle fit the definition of a station wagon, <em>i.e., </em>a vehicle designed for passenger transportation \u201cthat has an interior longer than a sedan\u2019s, has one or more rear seats readily lifted out or folded to facilitate light trucking, has no separate luggage compartment, and often has an adjustable rear window and a tailgate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1152. The conclusion is unavoidable that the minivan was a \u201cstation wagon type\u201d vehicle within the meaning of the insurance policy and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>statute. <em>Accord, Insurance Co. of North America v. Coffman, </em>52 <em>Md.App. </em>732, 451 <em>A.</em>2d 952 (Ct.Spec.App.1982); <em>Light v. Miller, </em>303 <em>Pa.Super. </em>527, 450 A.2d 51 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The summary judgment in favor of NJAFIUA is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2 provides that \u201cthe personal injury protection coverage of the named insured shall be the primary coverage for the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured\u2019s household who is not a named insured under an automobile insurance policy of his own.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> It is interesting, but also of marginal relevance, that in promotional materials for the vehicle, Ford Motor Company describes it as an \"Aerostar wagon\u201d as well as a \"minivan.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
