This scenario is a modest variation on the \u201cjail house informant\u201d line of cases. We conclude that the State violated defendant\u2019s post-indictment right to counsel under Article 1, paragraph 10 of the State Constitution by this attempt to deliberately elicit incriminating information directly from defendant while he was represented by counsel, but without counsel present. The defendant\u2019s conviction for felony murder must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">A Union County jury found defendant guilty of felony murder and related offenses committed on September 2, 1988 in Elizabeth. Defendant and two cohorts were charged with beating, kidnapping and killing a companion, \u201cSam\u201d Patel, near an industrial railroad siding next to the Pathmark grocery store. The State\u2019s principal witness was Roman Fernandez Borges, one of the three defendants. Borges pled guilty to kidnapping, received a 20-year sentence, and fully implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>defendant in the murder at trial. The third defendant, Gilberto Valdes, pled guilty to murder but never testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Defendant Watkins testified at trial. While admitting his presence at the scene, he testified that he personally was not involved in the crimes of kidnapping and murder of Patel. Defendant Watkins left town after the murder and was living in a trailer in a warehouse in Hudson County when he was arrested on November 3, 1988, two months after the crime. Defendant was held in the Union County jail in default of $100,000 bail. He was indicted on March 17, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Testimony at an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing held at trial but outside the jury\u2019s presence revealed these facts. William Jackson was arrested on charges unrelated to this case and held in the Union County jail during August 1989. Jackson had known defendant Watkins before this time and they began talking about their cases when they saw each other in jail. Jackson testified that Watkins wanted to know if Jackson knew anyone who could be an alibi witness for him. Jackson then looked through Watkins\u2019s discovery file and wrote down a phone number of one of the witnesses listed in Watkins\u2019s discovery file. Jackson eventually called the Union County Prosecutor\u2019s Office about Watkins\u2019s case and talked to a Sergeant Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On September 5, 1989 Jackson went to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and gave a written statement about Watkins\u2019s comments to him in the jail. Apparently Jackson told the prosecutor\u2019s detectives that Watkins had confessed to the crime. Jackson then took two lie detector tests and failed both. Jackson testified a detective told him, \u201cWe can\u2019t use you as a witness if you fail two polygraphs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">At some point during their discussion, a detective arranged for Jackson to give Watkins a certain telephone number and to tell Watkins that the number would be that of a potential alibi witness for Watkins. This phone number was, in fact, that of Abdel Anderson, an investigator with the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>When Jackson returned to the county jail, he gave Watkins the number and told him, \u201cThis is my cousin and he would be an alibi for you.\u201d The next day, on September 6,1989, Watkins tried to call the number but at first got no answer. Jackson then made a call for him, got through, and put Watkins on the line. When Watkins took the phone, Jackson said that he \u201cwalked away\u201d and \u201cwent back to my room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Investigator Anderson tape-recorded the September 6, 1989 telephone conversation during which Watkins made statements indicating a consciousness of guilt because he was \u201cinvolved in a murder\u201d and asking for help in hiring an alibi witness even though \u201cI was there when it happened.\u201d Trial began 20 days later on September 27, 1989. The judge ruled that a redacted version of the taped conversation could be admitted in evidence against Watkins without violating his federal constitutional Fifth and Sixth Amendments rights. We have reviewed the redacted and unredacted versions of the tape recording and their transcripts. Curiously, the redacted version actually sounds more harmful to the defendant than the unredacted one.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">During his summation the trial prosecutor very effectively urged upon the jury the relevance of the taped telephone conversation between Investigator Anderson and Watkins on the issue of guilt. The only real issue at trial was the credibility contest between the State\u2019s key witness, Borges, and defendant, Watkins, regarding defendant\u2019s actual criminal involvement while at the scene of the underlying beating, kidnapping felony, and homicide. There is no doubt that the testimony about the taped conversation with Investigator Anderson had a critical impact on the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We rest our decision that defendant\u2019s right to counsel was violated by the detective\u2019s ruse on State constitutional grounds alone, although the federal cases strongly point to the same result. In <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>261, 274, 609 A.2d 400 (1992), Justice Pollock said: \u201cAlthough the language of Article 1, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>virtually identical with that of the Sixth Amendment, we have held in other contexts that the State Constitution affords greater protection of the right to counsel than is provided under the federal constitution.\u201d He added: \u201cSo steadfast has been our commitment that we have secured the right to counsel in settings in which that right has not been assured by federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 609 <em>A.</em>2d 400. The issue in <em>Sanchez </em>was whether the defendant effectively waived the right against self-incrimination and the right to counsel post-indictment before the police interrogated him. The defendant in <em>Sanchez </em>did not know that he had been indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Sanchez </em>observed that \u201cthe return of an indictment transforms the relationship between the State and the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 609 A.2d 400. After indictment the defendant and the State are quite clearly adversaries. The defendant is represented by counsel. In the case before us, defendant was represented by designated counsel from the Office of the Public Defender. The Supreme Court said in <em>Sanchez </em>that \u201cafter the return of an indictment, prosecutors and their representatives should not initiate conversations with an uncounselled defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We surely do not condone defendant\u2019s attempt to fortify his defense with a phoney alibi witness, but we cannot condone the prosecutor\u2019s covert post-indictment effort to get more evidence damaging to defendant\u2019s credibility for the imminent trial by direct contact with him. After defendant has counsel, the State cannot target him for further direct investigation through efforts deliberately designed to elicit harmful information from him personally to use against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 352, 580 A.2d 221 (1990), involving telephone conversations from jail by a defendant represented by counsel, the Court said, \u201ceven if the suspect initiates the contact with the police, the State remains bound to honor the right to counsel.\u201d In <em>Clausell, </em>the defendant even knew that he was speaking to a police officer when he made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>incriminating statements. This did not permit the statements\u2019 admissibility, absent a competent waiver of the right to have counsel present. We contrast this with the situation where the State secures the incriminating statement by chance, not by design. If the statement is obtained by luck and is not the product of a deliberate, investigative attempt to elicit evidence by means designed to circumvent and dilute the right to counsel, the statement is admissible. <em>State v. Bey, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 471, 610 A.2d 403 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>19, 611 A.2d 657 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Here the agents of the prosecutor\u2019s office, in alliance with Jackson, the fellow inmate, provoked a telephone call by defendant to Investigator Anderson in a disguised effort to enhance the State\u2019s case several weeks before the trial. This is not a so-called \u201clistening-post\u201d case. Investigator Anderson, through the overtures of inmate Jackson, was far more than a listening post. He and his cohorts were actively rooting around for useful information for the imminent trial. This is quite like <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 <em>U.S. </em>201, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), where a defendant, free on bail, conversed with his codefendant while in the absence of his counsel and while sitting in the co-defendant\u2019s car, unaware that he had installed a radio transmitter accessible to government agents to listen in on them. The federal Supreme Court found this an intrusion on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcqQ\">We do not question that in this case, as in many cases, it was entirely proper to continue an investigation of the suspected criminal activities of the defendant and his alleged confederates, even though the defendant had already been indicted. All that we hold is that the defendant\u2019s own incriminating statements, obtained by federal agents under the circumstances here disclosed, could not constitutionally be used by the prosecution as evidence against him at his trial. [377 <em>U.S. </em>at 207, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1203, 12 L.Ed.2d at 251],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The federal cases have continued a virtually unbroken line of authority denouncing such active intrusion once the criminal suspect has been indicted and is represented by counsel. <em>See Kuhlman v. Wilson, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>436, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2616, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986); <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>412, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1135, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>L.Ed.2d 410 (1986); <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>159, 178-180, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>477, 497-498, 88 L.Ed.2d 481, 497-499 (1985); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>264, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2183, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>115 (1980). <em>But see Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>285, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988) (5-4 decision that <em>Miranda </em>warning adequate to protect Sixth Amendment rights where defendant knew police had initiated the conversation with him).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Finally, we reject the State\u2019s contention that any constitutional error was harmless beyond any reasonable doubt. The evidence secured through the violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel no doubt seriously struck at his credibility at trial. We can not overlook its impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Ironically, defendant\u2019s version that he was present but not involved in the murder might have been accepted as true by the jury if not for his clumsy attempt to contrive an alibi when tempted by Jackson\u2019s bait set out by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
