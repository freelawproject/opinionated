The Workers\u2019 Compensation judge, applying the literal terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, concluded that petitioner\u2019s accident did not happen in the course of her employment because \u201c[petitioner had left the employer\u2019s premises and was on a portion of public sidewalk____\u201d We reverse the judgment under review for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The undisputed facts as found by the Workers\u2019 Compensation judge are that petitioner was a sales associate employed by respondent on December 9, 1988. At approximately 6:15 p.m., the end of the her work day, petitioner \u201crang out\u201d and exited through a door designated by respondent for the exclusive use of its employees. The door led to a metal staircase terminating at an exterior sidewalk which petitioner had to traverse before reaching the parking lot where her car was parked. Petitioner took only a few steps from the staircase when she slipped and fell on ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Respondent\u2019s personnel manager testified that employees were not required to park in any specific location in the parking lot but were required to use the employee entrance when entering or leaving the premises. While respondent maintained and assumed the responsibility for everything within the store premises, the owner of the mall was responsible for the maintenance of \u201ceverything outside the doors of the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The outcome of this case is controlled by the principles announced by our Supreme Court in <em>Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 543 A.2d 45 (1988). In <em>Livingstone, </em>the Court extensively analyzed the body of case law dealing with the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d beginning with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Bryant v. Fissell, </em>84 <em>N.J.L. </em>72, 86 <em>A. </em>458 (Sup.Ct.1913), up to the 1979 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36. <em>Livingstone, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 95-100, 543 A.2d 45. In that analysis, the Court identified a group of cases holding that \u201cparking lots owned, maintained, or <em>provided </em>by employers were to be considered part of the employer\u2019s premises, and that injuries occurring in such lots before or after the actual work day arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 543 A.2d 45 (emphasis added). That group of cases included injuries sustained on sidewalks connecting employee parking lots with the entrance to the employer\u2019s premises. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 543 A.2d 45; <em>see Lewis v. Walter Scott &amp; Co., </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 141 A.2d 807 (App.Div.1958). Then, after reviewing the 1979 amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the available legislative history, the <em>Livingstone </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">[W]e are persuaded that the Legislature impliedly approved of the principle established by those cases, namely, that lots owned, maintained, or <em>used </em>by employers for employee parking are part of the employer\u2019s premises, and had no intent to affect the validity of such decisions____ The omission of any provision purporting to overrule or limit the reach of the parking-lot cases, in light of the comprehensive nature of the amendment, indicates that the Legislature considered these cases to be consistent with the economic tradeoffs struck by the Act, and therefore in need of no correction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">[111 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-03, 543 A.2d 45 (emphasis added).]</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The Court specifically determined that Livingstone\u2019s workday \u201ccommenced when she arrived in her car at the section of the mall lot adjacent to appellant\u2019s premises, and therefore was in the course of employment when the accident occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 543 A.2d 45. The fact that the respondent, Abraham &amp; Straus, in that case neither owned, maintained, or had exclusive use of that area of the lot was irrelevant to the finding of compensability. <em>Id. </em>The word \u201ccontrol\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36 is not to be interpreted in the \u201cformal property law sense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 105, 543 A.2d 45, but rather in the \u201c \u2018commonsense\u2019 notion that the term implies simply \u2018use by the employer in the conduct of his business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 543 A.2d 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>(quoting <em>Cressey v. Campus Chefs, Div. of CVI Servs., Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 343, 498 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Applying those principles to the facts of this case, we have no hesitancy in concluding that petitioner\u2019s accident is compensable. Although the staircase and the adjacent sidewalk leading from the employee door was not a part of the store premises in a property sense, the respondent exercised control over the area in that it \u201cused\u201d both of them in the conduct of its business, by requiring employees to enter and exit the store by traversing that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
