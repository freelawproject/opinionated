The trial judge, on the State\u2019s application, concluded that there was an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d by virtue of the fact that the same region of the Public Defender\u2019s office was representing the murder victim on another matter at the time of his death. At telephonic oral argument on the motion for leave to appeal before us, the prosecutor acknowledged that there is no evidence that the victim\u2019s death was in any way related to the prosecution of the matter for which the Public Defender had represented the victim or to any other prosecution. Rather, the evidence in the case indicates that defendant and the victim argued over a woman before the victim was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">It is, of course, well established that a lawyer generally cannot represent a client if he, or someone else in his office, represents or previously represented a person with an adverse interest, <em>R.P.C. </em>1.7., 1.10, and this is also true when such representation would involve \u201can appearance of impropriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>rather than an actual conflict,\u201d <em>R.P.C. </em>1.7(c)(2). <em>See also, e.g., In re Petition for Review of Opinion No. 569, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>325, 329-330, 511 A.2d 119 (1986); <em>In re Garber, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>597, 609-11, 472 A.2d 566 (1984); <em>Ross v. Canino, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>402, 409, 461 A.2d 585 (1983); <em>State v. Rizzo, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>28, 30, 350 A.2d 225 (1975); <em>In re Cipriano, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>398, 403, 346 A.2d 393 (1975); <em>note State v. Galati, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>572, 578-79, 319 A.2d 220 (1974) (representation of P.B.A. prevents representation of defendant where P.B.A. officer will testify). Further, the lawyer, or office associate, cannot reveal confidential information obtained by the prior representation in order to assist another client. <em>R.P.C. </em>1.6; <em>R.P.C. </em>1.9(a)(2). <em>See also Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>201, 536 A.2d 243 (1988); <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>460, 473, 416 A.2d 852 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Nevertheless, there is a distinction between attorneys practicing within the Office of the Public Defender and defense counsel in private practice. <em>See State v. Bell, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>163, 447 A.2d 525 (1982). While speaking in the context of joint representation of multiple defendants in the same prosecution, our Supreme Court has concluded that \u201cthe same potential for conflict\u201d did not exist where the attorneys representing co-defendants were associates of the Public Defender\u2019s office, 90 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 447 A.2d 525, \u201cand that multiple representation by public defenders does not in itself give rise to a presumption of prejudice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, as in <em>Bell, </em>we are not dealing with \u201cthe financial benefits to the firm\u201d which flow from private representation of multiple parties, and as the Supreme Court noted, \u201c[pjublic interest firms have no financial incentive in retaining the cases\u201d which involve representation of more than one interest. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 447 A.2d 525.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201cthe public does not lose confidence in a rule allowing attorneys in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the same office\u201d to act in a way that would not be tolerated from private counsel. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In <em>Bell, </em>our Supreme Court followed precedent emanating from the State of Illinois requiring \u201csome showing of a conflict of interest before prejudice to the defendant will be found,\u201d in circumstances involving \u201cmultiple representation by a public defender\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 447 A.2d 525, citing <em>People v. Robinson, </em>79 <em>Ill.2d </em>147, 37 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>267, 402 <em>N.E.2d </em>157 (1980). <em>See also e.g., In re Advisory Opinion, 77 N.J. </em>199, 390 A.2d 118 (1978) (although former assistant prosecutor could not for six months handle matter against his former office, his firm could represent criminal defendant, so long as the former prosecutor had no participation or involvement in the matter); <em>see also Ross v. Canino, supra, </em>(firm of former Attorney General could handle matter that arose during his term in public office, provided that he had no personal involvement in case in either office); <em>compare, Review of Opinion 569, supra, </em>(former Deputy Attorney General may not personally for six months handle matter pending before board he represented if matter was pending at the time he represented board). However, while our Supreme Court in <em>Bell </em>adopted no <em>per se </em>rule or presumption of conflict for joint multiple representation by the Public Defender, it noted that \u201cshould the circumstances demonstrate a potential conflict of interest and a significant likelihood of prejudice,\u201d appropriate action could be taken based on \u201cthe presumption of both an actual conflict of interest and actual prejudice ... without the necessity of proving such prejudice.\u201d 90 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 447 A.2d 525. <em>See also State v. Canery, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 529-31, 366 A.2d 706 (App.Div. 1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>259, 377 A.2d 664 (1977) (no reversal required where same person acted as investigator for two defendants \u201crepresented by separate counsel from the Public Defender\u2019s Office\u201d; no prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Like our Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Illinois has made clear that where a conflict of interest appears, a criminal defendant generally need not show actual prejudice, and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>one attorney is disqualified all others in the same office are similarly disqualified. <em>People v. Free, </em>112 <em>Ill.2d </em>154, 97 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>396, 401, 492 <em>N.E.2d </em>1269, 1274 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>871, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>246, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>170 (1986). However, \u201cthe disqualification of one public defender will not necessarily disqualify all members of that office. In such cases a case-by-case inquiry must be made to determine whether competing or differing interests will preclude the representation by the public defender\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Free, </em>97 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>at 402, 492 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1275 (citations omitted). In <em>Free </em>the court concluded that there was no <em>per se </em>conflict where the Public Defender\u2019s office \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d represented a witness and a criminal defendant. <em>See also State v. Jennings, </em>216 <em>Conn. </em>647, 583 <em>A.2d </em>915, 920 (1990) (another Public Defender had represented victim in unrelated case; no abuse of discretion in denying motion for new counsel; witnesses had signed waivers of confidentiality and no actual prejudice alleged); <em>State v. Holscher, </em>417 <em>N.W.2d </em>698, 701 (Minn.App.1988) (another Public Defender had represented victim in unrelated case while present case was pending; no actual prejudice); <em>People v. Coates, </em>109 <em>Ill.2d </em>431, 94 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>421, 488 <em>N.E.2d </em>247 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1088, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1474, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>729 (1986) (attorney in Public Defender\u2019s office had represented victim\u2019s mother; both attorneys still in Public Defender\u2019s office); Annotation, <em>Circumstances Giving Rise to Prejudicial Conflict of Interests Between Criminal Defendant and Defense Counsel </em>\u2014 State <em>Cases, </em>18 <em>A.L.R.4th </em>360, 394-95, 404-16 (1981 and 1992 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In this case, the Assistant Deputy Public Defender who represented the victim in his drug prosecution, which had been disposed of by negotiated plea and was pending sentencing at the time of his death, left the Public Defender\u2019s office before defendant\u2019s present counsel was hired; the file in that case was \u201csealed\u201d by the Public Defender \u201cand placed with a pool attorney\u201d who later examined the file and had no objection to the representation of defendant by the regional Assistant Depu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ty Public Defender \u201csince there is no possibility that an issue of privilege would arise requiring a waiver\u201d of the victim\u2019s attorney client privilege; the victim and the defendant were not simultaneously represented by the Public Defender; the victim will not be able to testify; the State has no evidence that the murder prosecution has any relationship whatsoever to the former prosecution of the victim or that the victim\u2019s death has any relationship whatsoever to the victim\u2019s prosecution, and the defendant by certification has indicated that he wants his present attorney within the Office of the Public Defender \u201cto proceed\u201d with his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Reviewing the record as a whole, we cannot conclude that the Public Defender is precluded from representing defendant who has been represented by that office and wants continued representation from that office. In appropriate circumstances the issue of the defendant\u2019s desires should be fully developed at a hearing when either the prosecution, defendant or defense attorney raise the question of conflict or appearance of conflict and the trial judge is considering the \u201ccompeting or differing interests\u201d involved. <em>People v. Free, supra, </em>97 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>at 402, 492 N.E.2d at 1275. <em>Cf. State v. Bell, supra. </em>Because of the possibility that defendant\u2019s views, if based on inadequate exploration of relevant factors, could affect the possibility of a later collateral attack on any conviction entered while represented by an Assistant Deputy Public Defender, <em>see e.g. People v. Free; State v. Jennings; State v. Holscher, supra, </em>the trial judge should carefully explain to defendant that the victim\u2019s file may contain confidential communications which may or may not impact on a defense or other issues in the case. The defendant\u2019s desires, expressed after he is fully advised, should be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances relating to whether the Public Defender\u2019s assignment of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sel should be upheld.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. State v. Crisafi, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>499, 608 A.2d 317 (1992); <em>R. </em>3:8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> We recognize that with the severe budget limitations now facing the Public Defender, there may be some financial incentives to \"pool\" as few cases as possible. But, subject to ethical restrictions, these are not the types of \"financial incentives\u201d which apply to attorneys in the private sector.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-12\"> The issue before us does not deal with a question of preferred practice. In fact, the Public Defender originally \"pooled\" defendant\u2019s case to an attorney who subsequently returned the case to the Public Defender when appointed to the Bench. <em>We do not suggest that a defendant can object to the Public Defender\u2019s decision to \"pool\" a case. </em>Here, the Public Defender wants to retain the case, and the issue deals with the propriety of the Public Defender\u2019s exercise of her initial right to select counsel for a defendant. <em>See e.g. N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-9, -10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
