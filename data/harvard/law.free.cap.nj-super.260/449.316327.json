That evening, the vehicle was stopped by State Troopers Michie and Miller for speeding on the New Jersey Turnpike in Elizabeth at 11:53 p.m. As the troopers approached the car, Michie, who was on the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle, noticed the driver moving his right hand toward his inside jacket pocket. When Michie alerted Miller, who was on the driver\u2019s side of the car, of what he had just seen, Miller took the driver out of the car and led him to the rear of the car to perform a protective patdown. As he touched the left breast pocket area of the driver\u2019s open jacket Miller felt a large, hard object. The driver then reached into the jacket, presumably to seize the object, but at Miller\u2019s order withdrew his hand. Trooper Miller thereupon took a .22 calibre handgun from the inside pocket of the driver\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">After Miller secured the driver\u2019s gun, Michie asked defendant to step out of the car. The troopers\u2019 ensuing search of the vehicle revealed a bag filled with cocaine in the arm rest compartment located on the driver\u2019s side door. Defendant later informed Trooper Miller that his credentials were in his jacket on the back seat of the car. When the officer picked up the jacket he found another .22 calibre handgun in the garment\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Defendant now appeals from his conviction for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a)(l), and 2C:35-5(b)(l), on which he was sentenced to a ten-year custodial term with a parole ineligibility period of three and one-third years. Defendant was also assessed a DEDR penalty of $3000, a laboratory fee of $50, and a VCCB penalty of $30. Additionally, his driver\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>was suspended for two years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Defendant\u2019s first contention on this appeal is that he was denied his right to a trial by an impartial jury because the prosecution exercised peremptory challenges on constitutionally-impermissible grounds in violation of <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Sixteen blacks were included among the sixty-eight members of defendant\u2019s jury panel. During the selection process, the prosecutor peremptorily excused four black women, Felicia Simon, Elmethia Lewis, Rosa Mitchell, and Lois Mason McLeod. When defense counsel objected, the court called upon the prosecutor to articulate his explanation for exercising the peremptory challenges. In so doing, the court followed the mandate of <em>State v. Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 537-38, 511 A.2d 1150. The prosecutor then gave the following explanations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcV\">\n<em>Felicia Simon</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">X knocked her off because she was young, and I ask your Honor to take note that just about every young person on that jury was knocked off by me. She has a brother who is twenty-three years old and has no job. That puts him in the same general age as the defendants. And I have every reason to believe that may become somewhat of an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\n<em>Rosa Mitchell</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">She was number one. At that point, Judge, I counted nine women on the jury and the significant reason why I knocked her off is because she did not appear to me to be a strong personality, which I consider necessary in my trying the case that she was going to occupy the foreperson\u2019s spot. She did not come across as a leader.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\n<em>Lois Mason McLeod</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">A young woman, I believe. That\u2019s why I did. I have it written down here, \u201cyoung.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">As to the fourth black woman, Elmethia Lewis, both the defense attorney and the prosecutor agreed that \u201cit was obvious that she had trouble indicating whether she was going to be fair and impartial.\u201d The court thereupon found that the prosecutor had satisfactorily explained the questioned challenges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>and denied defendant\u2019s motion to begin the proceedings anew with a fresh jury panel. In so ruling, the court made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">It\u2019s been shown in terms of attitude that people, young individuals, tolerate drugs, have different feelings about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">I also note for the record the defense has been knocking out a lot of senior citizens peremptorily in terms of their challenges for the same reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">So that\u2019s something that goes on in this court all the time. So I don\u2019t hold it against ... [the prosecutor] simply because these people happen to be young, happen to be young and black.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the prosecutor did not peremptorily excuse the four black women because of their color. The jury that heard the case contained seven black members, five of whom participated in deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Defendant argues that \u201cyoung\u201d people form a cognizable group within the meaning of <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>and that by allowing the prosecutor to challenge them peremptorily the court denied defendant the right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury representing a cross-section of the community. In <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 485 A.2d 708 (Law Div.1984), dealing with a claim by defendant that he had been denied his right to a fair and impartial jury and equal protection of the laws by the county\u2019s jury selection procedures, the court noted that \u201c[n]o evidence was offered and this court does not find young people to be a distinctive group for the purpose of this Sixth Amendment challenge to the jury selection system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 485 A.2d 708. In affirming in material part, the Supreme Court wrote that \u201c[t]o prove either an equal protection or fair cross-section claim, a defendant must first identify a constitutionally cognizable group, <em>i.e., </em>a group capable of being singled out for discriminatory treatment.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 215, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). But more recently, in <em>State v. Zavala, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 611 A.2d 1169 (Law Div.1992), the Law Division wrote: \u201cAlthough young persons do not constitute a cognizable group, the prosecution\u2019s admitted exclusion of all young persons from the jury constitutes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>exclusionary tactic based on group bias\u201d 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 242, 611 A.2d at 1173.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The question of whether age-defined groups may be considered cognizable for our purposes was carefully considered in <em>State v. Pelican, </em>154 <em>Vt. </em>496, 580 A.2d 942 (1990). There, the Supreme Court of Vermont noted that with few exceptions both state and federal courts have held that age by itself is an insufficient standard by which to establish a distinctive group. It noted that there are three main grounds on which courts reach that result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">(1) The parameters of the group are difficult to ascertain and, as a result, varying age limits are used in the claims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(2) The defendant has not proved that the values and attitudes of the group are substantially different from other segments of the community or that the values and attitudes of members of the group are cohesive and consistent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">(3) The membership of the group is in flux.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\"><em>[Id., </em>580 A.2d at 947.]</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">With respect to the first ground, the Court noted that the Kentucky Supreme Court has found that young people are not cognizable because \u201cthe terminal ages of \u2018young adults\u2019 defy definition, and we know of no end to the maze that could be created by classifying jurors as young adults, middle aged adults, elderly adults, and on and on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 947-48 (quoting <em>Ford v. Commonwealth, </em>665 <em>S.W.2d </em>304, 308 (Ky.1983)). It noted also that in <em>Ford v. Seabold, </em>841 <em>F.2d </em>677, 682 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>928, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>315, 102 L.Ed.2d 334 (1988), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals commented that age limits considered in various cases for group definitions have been essentially arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">As to the second ground, the Vermont Supreme Court noted that other courts based their findings in part on the fact that young adults are not a group that has traditionally needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>special legal protection. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Ford v. Seabold, supra, </em>841 <em>F.</em>2d at 682). <em>Pelican </em>noted Ford\u2019s admonition that \u201cif an age classification is adopted, the door would be opened to countless other \u2018distinctive groups.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In denying the defendant\u2019s claim for relief, the <em>Pelican </em>court wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">We conclude that the majority holdings are well reasoned. We are particularly concerned that group definitions like those involved here are arbitrary such that some attitudes of members within the group may be greatly dissimilar, while, at the same time, many group members share attitudes with those outside the group. Nevertheless, we agree with the Georgia Supreme Court that we cannot say that an age-defined group can <em>never </em>be found to be distinctive. <em>See Parks v. State, </em>254 <em>Ga. </em>[403] at 411, 330 S.E.2d [686] at 694. The record must, however, respond to the first two grounds for denying that age-defined groups are distinctive. <em>[Ibid. </em>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In its discussion in <em>Gilmore </em>on \u201cdiscrete, cognizable groups,\u201d our Supreme Court went no further than to identify those defined \u201con the basis of religious principles, race, color, national origin, and sex.\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 526-27, n. 3, 511 A.2d 1150. <em>See, e.g., N.J. Const. </em>art. I, 1\u00cd 5. It noted that the foregoing classifications are \u201csuspect or semi-suspect classifications triggering strict or intermediate scrutiny under federal equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The opinion\u2019s supporting reference to <em>Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Centers, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>432, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3249, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>313 (1985), leaves no doubt that <em>Gilmore </em>was not written to encourage an endless proliferation of \u201ccognizable groups.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Cleburne, </em>after determining that classifications by \u201crace, alienage, or national origin\u201d call for heightened scrutiny, the Supreme Court of the United States elaborated its rationale in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">These factors are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy \u2014 a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or deserving as others. For these reasons and because such discrimination is unlikely to be soon rectified by legislative means, these laws are subjected to strict scrutiny and will be sustained only if they are suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <em>McLaughlin v. Florida, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>184, 192, 13 L.Ed.2d 222, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>283 [288] (1964); <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>365, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>534, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1848 (1971). Similar oversight by the courts is due when state laws impinge on personal rights protected by the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tion. <em>Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>621, 23 L.Ed.2d 583, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1886 (1969); <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>618, 22 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>600, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1322 (1969); <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, </em>316 <em>U.S. </em>535, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>1655, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>1110 (1942).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 440, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3254, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 320.]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In holding that sex-based classifications also require a heightened degree of scrutiny, the Court declared that gender \u201cgenerally provides no sensible ground for different treatment ... Rather than resting on meaningful considerations, statutes distributing benefits and burdens between the sexes in different ways very likely reflect out-moded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3254-55, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 320-21. After drawing similar conclusions regarding \u201cofficial discriminations\u201d relating to persons of illegitimate birth, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">We have declined, however, to extend heightened review to differential treatment based on age:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201cWhile the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination, <em>such persons, unlike, say, those who have been discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have not experienced a \u2018history of purposeful unequal treatment\u2019 or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities. \u201d Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2562 [2566], 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>520 (1976). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\"><em>[Id. </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 441, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3254, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 321.]</p>\n<p id=\"Aku\">The New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Gilmore </em>noted the division already existing in federal and state courts \u201cas to whether groups defined by age, economic status, and occupation, for example, might in particular cases in certain communities be cognizable groups.\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 527, n. 3, 511 <em>A.2d </em>1150. It refrained, however, from resolving these and other issues, concluding that \u201cwhatever the criteria for deciding such questions, Blacks clearly constitute a cognizable group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reading this determination together with the pronouncements of <em>Cleburne </em>we conclude that to be classified as cognizable under <em>Gilmore, </em>a group must be one that has been historically excluded, on the basis of stereotypical prejudices, from full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>participation in the significant duties and privileges of American citizenship. So judged, we hold that, until demonstrated otherwise, age-defined groups are not cognizable for purposes of impartial jury analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Defendant next contends that the pat down of the driver resulting in the discovery of his handgun was violative of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, para. 7 of the New Jersey Constitution. Trooper Michie testified that when he saw the driver\u2019s hand move toward his inside jacket pocket he \u201cfeared that [the driver] might have a weapon or something hidden in there.\u201d He based this anxiety on past incidents involving handguns concealed within a holster in that area of the driver\u2019s body. Under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), where a police officer has reason to conclude in light of his experience that the person with whom he was dealing may be armed and dangerous, he is free to conduct \u201ca carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1884-85, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911. While it was equally inferable that the driver herein was merely reaching for his driving credentials, we strike the balance under these circumstances in favor of the officer\u2019s safety. The driver should not have been spared this minimally intrusive search at the cost of creating a significant risk of harm to the policeman. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>State v. Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>35, 37, 573 <em>A.</em>2d 1376 (1990), a study presented by the attorney general showed that forty percent of State Troopers killed nationwide in the line of duty from September 1976 to September 1982 met their death while making traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Finally, defendant contends that the court erred in denying his motion for a directed judgment of acquittal. We conclude that the evidence supported a finding of knowing and intentional possession of the 8.71 ounces of cocaine found in the compartment below the driver\u2019s side arm rest. Expert testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ny established that that amount of cocaine could be sold for approximately $45,000. Furthermore, the compartment was only an arm\u2019s length away from defendant in a location to which defendant had access. <em>Compare, State v. Palacio, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>543, 545 A.2d 764 (1988). Finally, the presence of a handgun in his jacket pocket is consistent with defendant\u2019s role as a drug trafficker. On these facts defendant\u2019s motion for a directed judgment of acquittal was properly denied. <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\"> Defendant was found not guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-12\"> We question how group bias can be found with regard to a non-cognizable group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
