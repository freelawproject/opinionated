The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding preemption. We agree. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims relate to an air carrier\u2019s rates and services and thus are expressly preempted by \u00a7 1305(a)(1). We therefore affirm the summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that from 1986 through 1989, defendants Pan Am Corporation and Pan Am World Airways falsely advertised they were initiating an enhanced security program, and fraudulently charged $5 per airline ticket to defray the cost of the program. Plaintiffs, who had purchased tickets during that period, claim that in fact the airline did not provide such a program. They charge that defendants\u2019 advertising constituted willful misrepresentation, consumer fraud, and deceptive business practice, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages against defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Since 1938, when Congress enacted the Civil Aeronautics Act, ch. 601, 52 Stat. 973 (1938), the federal government has imposed a pervasive regulatory scheme over civil aviation. Under that act, Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Authority (later changed to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)) and vested it with broad powers to regulate commercial aviation, including the power to determine if air carriers were engaging in deceptive trade practices or unfair methods of competition. <em>See Transworld Airlines, Inc. v. Mattox, </em>897 <em>F.2d </em>773, 776-77 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>307, <em>112 L.Ed.2d </em>261 (1990), <em>aff'd on subsequent appeal, </em>924 <em>F.2d </em>1055 (5th Cir. 1991), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds sub. nom. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). The Act also contained a \u201csaving clause\u201d stating that nothing contained in the Act would \u201cabridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\u201d 52 Stat. at 1027 (codified at 49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7 1506).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA), Pub.L. No. 85-726, 72 Stat. 731 (codified as amended at 49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1301 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to 1557), gave the CAB authority to regulate interstate airfares and to take administrative action against deceptive trade practices. It also preserved the \u201csaving clause.\u201d <em>See Morales, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2034, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 163-64. When the FAA was first enacted, the Supreme Court interpreted the law as enabling the states to regulate intrastate airfares and to enforce their own laws against deceptive trade practices. <em>Id. </em>at -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2034, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 164; <em>Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>290, 300, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1978, 1985, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>643, 652 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">However, in 1978, Congress enacted the Airlines Deregulation Act (ADA), Pub.L. No. 95-504, 92 Stat. 1705 (1978) (codified at 49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1301 to 1557) to maximize reliance on \u201ccompetitive market forces.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2034, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 164. To ensure that the states would not undermine the federal deregulation scheme with regulations of their own, the ADA included a specific preemption provision which prohibits the states from enacting or enforcing any law \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services\u201d of any air carrier. 49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7 1305(a)(1). <em>Morales, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2034, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 164. The ADA also retained the CAB\u2019s existing enforcement authority over deceptive trade practices, but preserved the saving clause in the prior laws. Ibid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Plaintiffs contend that their claims are not preempted by \u00a7 1305(a)(1) because they do not seek to regulate rates or to \u201cusurp the industry\u2019s authority to regulate security measures.\u201d Rather, their claims are \u201cnothing more than traditional actions for fraud and breach of contract\u201d and thus any effect on rates, routes, or services would be remote. In support of their argument, plaintiffs point to the \u201csaving clause\u201d of the FAA which, they argue, contemplates that unless the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>claim and the federal Act are \u201cabsolutely inconsistent,\u201d they may coexist. <em>See Nader, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>at 300, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1985, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Under the Supremacy Clause, <em>U.S. Const. </em>art VI, cl. 2, state laws that \u201c \u2018interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of congress, made in pursuance of the constitution\u2019 are invalid.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Pub. Intervenor v. Mortier, </em>501 U.S.--,--, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2476, 2481, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>532, 542 (1991) (quoting <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 <em>U.S. </em>(9 Wheat) 1, 211, 6 <em>L.Ed. </em>23 (1824)). Thus, \u201cwhen the mandates of federal law and state law are not consistent, the state law must yield.\u201d <em>Feldman v. Lederle Lab., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>117, 133, 592 A.2d 1176 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>3027, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>898 (1992). The preemption doctrine applies equally to common law and state statutory law. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 592 <em>A.2d </em>1176. Preemption may occur where Congress\u2019s intent to supplant state authority is clear from express language in the federal legislation or regulation. <em>See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>519, 525, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1305, 1309, 51 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>604, 614 (1977); <em>Feldman, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 134, 592 A.2d 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Absent explicit preemptive language, Congress\u2019s intent to supersede state law in a particular field may nonetheless be implied from the pervasiveness of the federal regulatory scheme. In such a case, it is reasonable to infer that Congress left no room for the states to supplant the federal scheme. <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 <em>U.S. </em>218, 230, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 1152, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>1447, 1449 (1947); <em>Feldman, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 134, 592 A.2d 1176. Finally, even if Congress has not occupied a particular field, preemption may occur to the extent that state and federal law actually conflict. <em>Mortier, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2478, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 543; <em>Feldman, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 134-35, 592 A.2d 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Morales </em>recently addressed the specific issue before us. There, the Court held that \u00a7 1305(a)(1) expressly preempted airline advertising guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>promulgated by the states and enforced by state attorneys general. 504 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2041, 119 L.Ed.2d at 169-71. It rejected precisely the same argument plaintiffs raise here, that \u00a7 1305(a)(1) only preempts the states from actually prescribing rates, routes, or services. The Court reasoned that such an interpretation \u201csimply reads the words \u2018relating to\u2019 out of the statute[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 168, and had Congress intended \u201cto pre-empt state law in such a limited fashion, it would have forbidden the States to <em>\u2018regulate </em>rates, routes, [or] services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\"><em>Morales </em>also noted that the ordinary meaning of the words \u201crelating to\u201d is a broad one; that is, \u201c\u2018to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 L.Ed.2d at 167 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1158 (5th ed. 1979)). It then compared \u00a7 1305(a)(1) to a similar provision in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1144(a), and cited to a series of cases under ERISA giving the words \u201crelating to\u201d liberal meaning. <em>Morales, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 167. The Court concluded that \u201cState enforcement actions <em>having a connection with </em>or reference to airline \u2018rates, routes, or services\u2019 are preempted under [\u00a7 1305(a)(1) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 167-68 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\"><em>Morales </em>also addressed the saving clause under the FAA, relied on by plaintiffs here, which purports to safeguard common law remedies. It concluded that the clause was a \u201crelic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption regime,\u201d and applied the \u201ccommonplace\u201d statutory construction that the specific substantive preemption provision governs the general \u201csaving clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 L.Ed.2d at 168. <em>See also Wilson v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund Bd., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>271, 278, 536 <em>A.</em>2d 752 (1988) (\u201cwhen there is a conflict between general and specific provisions of a statute, the specific provisions will control\u201d). The Court found that \u201c[a] general \u2018remedies\u2019 saving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>clause cannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision\u201d of \u00a7 1305(a)(1). <em>Morales, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In our view, <em>Morales </em>is dispositive. Plaintiffs\u2019 narrow interpretation of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) is unavailing in view of the broad interpretation given the section by <em>Morales. </em>As <em>Morales </em>notes, had Congress intended for \u00a7 1305(a)(1) only to preempt the states from actually prescribing rates, routes and services, it would not have used the \u201crelating to\u201d language. 504 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 168. <em>See In re Sussex County Mun. Util. Auth., </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>214, 217, 486 A.2d 932 (App.Div.) (\u201clegislative language must not, if reasonably avoidable, be found to be ... superfluous or meaningless\u201d (quoting <em>Hackensack Bd. of Ed. v. City of Hackensack, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 569, 165 A.2d 33 (App.Div.1960))), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>267, 501 A.2d 934 (1985). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims quite obviously \u201crelatfe] to\u201d airline fares and services. They assert that defendants falsely advertised they had initiated a \u201cfar-reaching security program,\u201d employing \u201chighly trained security experts\u201d for the purpose of providing a \u201csafe and secure environment for [their] passengers.\u201d This claim clearly relates to the \u201cservices\u201d of an air carrier. Plaintiffs also allege that throughout the years 1986 through 1989, defendants charged an \u201cextra $5 each way per passenger\u201d to help defray the cost of the \u201cnew, efficient and professionally operated security system\u201d when in fact the security system was never implemented. This claim, at the very least, indirectly relates to the \u201crates\u201d charged by an air carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">To allow plaintiffs\u2019 claims would permit state courts to determine whether an airline\u2019s advertising was false and deceptive, and whether services advertised were in fact provided. If the airline\u2019s conduct were fraudulent or deceptive, state courts could fashion remedies, applying state law, proscribing certain advertising and compelling the airline to repay customers surcharges and other \u201crates\u201d charged to air passengers. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>result would be multiple and potentially conflicting standards controlling airline advertising, services and rates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conclusion is inescapable that Congress intended to reject the dual enforcement of state law claims relating to rates and services, and to vest the federal Department of Transportation with the exclusive authority to regulate and adjudicate allegations of deceptive and fraudulent advertising and practices in the airline industry. <em>See </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A.App. </em>\u00a7 1381 (granting the Department of Transportation authority to investigate unfair trade practices in the airline industry).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In arguing that \u00a7 1305(a)(1) should be narrowly construed, plaintiffs rely heavily on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>West v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>923 F.2d 657 (9th Cir.1990), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2986, 120 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 864 (1992). There, a passenger who had been \u201cbumped\u201d from his flight because of overbooking sued the airline for breach of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Id. </em>at 658-59. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>West </em>found no express preemption, holding \u201cSection 1305(a)(1) preempts claims only when the underlying statute or regulation itself relates to airline services, regardless of whether the claim arises from a factual setting involving airline services. Thus, state laws that merely have an <em>effect </em>on airline services are not preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660. However, the <em>West </em>interpretation of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) is no longer viable, since one week after the Supreme Court decided <em>Morales, </em>it granted certiorari in <em>West, </em>vacated the judgment and remanded to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration in light of <em>Morales. </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2986, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>864.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Plaintiffs also rely on our recent opinion in <em>Miller v. Northwest Airlines, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 625-26, 602 A.2d 785 (App.Div.1992), where we held that \u00a7 1305(a)(1) does not preempt an airline passenger\u2019s state law causes of action for false arrest and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. There, plaintiff sued the airline after being detained because he was holding a cigarette lighter in his attach\u00e9 case which resembled a toy pistol. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 602 A.2d 785. In concluding that there was no preemption, the <em>Miller </em>court, relying on <em>West, </em>found that common law tort and contract claims merely have an effect on those \u201cservices,\u201d and reasoned that \u201c[i]f plaintiff is successful in his claims, that will not interfere in any manner with the airlines\u2019 operation of proper security for passengers boarding with carry-on baggage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 602 A.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In our view, <em>Morales </em>casts serious doubt on the holding in <em>Miller, </em>particularly because <em>Miller </em>relied heavily on <em>West. </em>In any event, the facts and nature of the claim in <em>Miller </em>are distinguishable. There, plaintiff\u2019s tort claims arose out of a single incident tangentially related to the \u201cservice\u201d of an airline. Here, by contrast, plaintiffs challenge the \u201cservice\u201d itself and demand as damages the return of the \u201crate\u201d the airline charged for promised \u201cservices\u201d never provided. We are satisfied \u00a7 1305(a)(1) expressly preempts plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Since we find express preemption, we need not decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ADA impliedly preempts, or is in conflict with, state law. <em>See Cippollone, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2633, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 423; <em>Mattox, </em>897 <em>F.</em>2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 newly-found argument that even if their claims against the airlines are preempted, their claims against the individual defendants are not. First, the contention was never raised below, and it is well-settled that reviewing courts \u201cwill decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when [the] opportunity for such a presentation is available \u2018unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern great matters of public interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 <em>A.</em>2d 142 (1973) (quoting <em>Reynolds Offset Co. v. Summer, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 548, 156 A.2d 737 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>554, 158 <em>A.</em>2d 453 (1960)); <em>see also Murin v. Frapaul Constr. Co., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 613, 573 A.2d 989 (App.Div.1990). Here, plaintiffs\u2019 new claim does not bear on a court\u2019s jurisdiction, nor does it implicate a great matter of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Second, we agree with defendants that to allow plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the carriers\u2019 agents, servants and employees, would undermine the basic goals of the ADA. In their complaint plaintiffs assert that the purported fraudulent and deceptive practices were committed by the airlines \u201cby and through their agents and employees, including the individual defendants.\u201d Permitting plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the individuals vitiates the exclusive federal occupation of the field of aviation, and frustrates the broad preemptive purpose of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) to create a unified system of airline regulation. Plaintiffs would circumvent this purpose by bringing suit against the agents and employees of the airlines, thus fostering the very dual enforcement and regulation proscribed by \u00a7 1305(a)(1). <em>Cf. Reed, </em>555 <em>F.2d </em>at 1089-90 (airline employees fall within definition of \u201ccarrier\u201d under the Warsaw Convention, and are thus protected by the pact\u2019s liability limitations); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>In re Air Disaster, Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 1988, </em>776 <em>F.Supp. </em>710, 713-14 (E.D.N.Y.1991) (nonemployee \u201cagent\u201d of airline is \u201ccarrier\u201d under the Warsaw Convention because the airline had statutory duty to provide safety measures carried out by agent on airline\u2019s behalf). Simply stated, the preemptive force of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) would be frustrated if the provision was broadly interpreted in favor of the airlines, but found inapplicable to the agents and employees who carry out the airlines\u2019 functions \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the preemptive reach of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) extends to agents, servants and employees of an airline as well as the airline itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\"> Plaintiffs also seek to represent the entire class of individuals who purchased tickets from defendants from 1986 through 1989.

What state law, or indeed, foreign law would apply when a multi-state class of plaintiffs assert consumer fraud and breach of contract claims bottomed on the airline\u2019s national or international advertising campaign? <em>Cf. Reed v. Wiser, </em>555 <em>F.2d </em>1079, 1090, 1092 (2d Cir.) (Warsaw Convention limits liability against agents and employees because contrary result would cause \"jungle-like chaos\" in applying the \"thicket of foreign laws\" in multi-party litigation), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>922, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>399, 54 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>279 (1977). Because courts may be called upon to interpret and apply a variety of state anti-fraud laws, the purpose of \u00a7 1305(a)(1), to create a uniform system of airline regulation, would be undermined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> In <em>Cippollone v.
