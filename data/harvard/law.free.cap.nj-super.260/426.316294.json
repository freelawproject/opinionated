Danelczyk, Executor of the Estate of Lester Danelczyk, Sr., is affirmed substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lesemann in his oral opinion of June 16, 1992. Judge Lesemann found that the life estate bequeathed to defendant Bertha Tynek by the Last Will and Testament of Lester Danelczyk, Sr. was a life estate in the second floor apartment referred to as the larger apartment located on the second floor of premises designated 616 River Drive, Garfield, New Jersey and did not include the second floor apartment referred to as the smaller apartment or the first floor of the premises. We are satisfied from our study of the record and the arguments presented that there is sufficient credible evidence in the record as a whole to support the findings and conclusions of the trial court and we discern no good reason or justification for disturbing them. <em>See Leimgruber v. Claridge Assocs., Ltd., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 455-56, 375 A.2d 652 (1977); <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964); <em>see also R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A). Moreover, all of the issues of law raised are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Additionally, we are satisfied that, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the trial court properly utilized the doctrine of probable intent in concluding that the testator intended to give a. life estate in the larger apartment on the second floor of the premises designated 616 River Drive and not the entire building. \u201cThe judicial function in construing a will is to ascertain and give effect to the probable intention of the testator.\u201d <em>In re William F.

Stated differently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">The obligation of a court, when a question is presented such as is involved here, is to effectuate the probable intent of the testator when consideration of the will as a whole together with extrinsic evidence, demonstrates, under all the circumstances, that a patent or latent ambiguity exists in the language used and such intent, overcoming the mere literal reading of the instrument, is thereby made \u201cmanifest.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Flowers, supra, </em>(58 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 277 A.2d 199). This power must be most carefully exercised and should not be utilized unless the court is thoroughly convinced that it is required \u2014 the need for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>exercise must be \u201cmanifest.\u201d Otherwise its exercise would amount to varying the terms of a will as distinguished from merely effectuating a testator\u2019s intent. <em>[In re Munger, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 521, 309 A.2d 205].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Thus, courts today are not limited to the express terms of a will and may look to extrinsic evidence including the testator\u2019s own expressions of intent. <em>Engle v. Siegel, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 291, 377 A.2d 892; <em>Wilson v. Flowers, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 262-63, 277 A.2d 199; <em>In re Estate of Thornton, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 365, 404 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>401, 408 A.2d 795 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">Extrinsic evidence which furnishes information regarding the circumstances surrounding the testator should be admitted to aid in ascertaining his probable intent under the will. Where the probable intent is thus made manifest by extrinsic evidence, the court may not refuse to effectuate that intent by indulging in a merely literal reading of the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">[E]xtrinsic evidence including direct statements by a testator of his intention have always been held admissible, not to vary the terms of the will, but to explain the ambiguity____ [D]irect statements of intention should be admitted no matter what the form of ambiguity [either patent or latent]. If our task is to ascertain and follow the testator\u2019s probable intent, we cannot fairly exclude evidence of that intent. Naturally, the circumstances surrounding the evidence may affect what weight, if any, it is to be given but it should not be excluded. <em>[Wilson v. Flowers, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 262-63, 277 A.2d 199].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYo\"><em>Accord 5 Clapp, supra, </em>\u00a7 197 at 426-29; 80 <em>Am Jur.</em>2d <em>Wills </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1279-81, 1287 (1975); 95 <em>C.J.S.

Furthermore, such evidence is admissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(32). <em>See In re Estate of Cory, </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 222, 236 A.2d 616 (Ch.Div.1967); <em>see also Woll v. Dugas, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 590-94, 250 A.2d 775 (Ch.Div.1969), <em>aff'd, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 271 A.2d 443 (App.Div.1970); <em>In re Pfizer, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 261-62, 110 A.2d 40 (Ch.Div.) (citing <em>Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. Catholic Charities, etc., of New York, </em>141 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>170, 173, 56 A.2d 483 (Ch.Div.1948)), <em>aff'd, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>40, 110 A.2d 54 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Application of these principles compels the conclusion that the trial court properly admitted extrinsic evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>explain the testator\u2019s will. The testator bequeathed to defendant a life estate in his \u201creal property, located at 616 River Drive, Garfield, New Jersey with the specific right to live in the premises for the rest of her life.\u201d The River Drive property contained both residential apartments and commercial space. By adding the language to the life estate bequeath to defendant \u201cwith the specific right to live in the premises for the rest of her natural life\u201d, the testator created an ambiguity and potential inconsistency in the will. The added language could be interpreted as merely superfluous or as intending to clarify and limit the extent of the life estate in the property. Thus, extrinsic evidence was properly admitted, not to vary the terms of the will, but rather to interpret the probable intent of the testator when utilizing the express language contained in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In our view, the trial court properly concluded that the probable intent of the testator was to devise a life estate in the larger second floor apartment, not the entire property. In this regard, the trial court noted that the \u201cmost significant testimony\u201d revealing testator\u2019s intent came from Thomas R. Hilberth, Esq., the attorney who drafted the will, and Olga Malski, a close friend of testator. Attorney Hilberth testified that the testator did \u201cabsolutely not\u201d intend to provide defendant with a life estate in the entire building. Although the notes of both the attorney and his secretary use the general term \u201cproperty,\u201d the attorney was adamant in his recollection that the testator had discussed only the apartment. Moreover, the attorney added the language \u201cwith the specific right to live in the premises for the rest of her natural life\u201d \u201c[t]o make it absolutely clear that it was a life estate for the apartment which he intended to leave her.\u201d Ms. Malski also corroborated the attorney\u2019s testimony, testifying that the testator had repeatedly indicated before his death that he had left defendant a \u201clifetime apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Additionally, the testamentary disposition in the will tends to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the testator\u2019s probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>intent was to bequeath a life estate in the one apartment, not the entire property. While in the Second Article, the testator bequeathed a life estate to defendant, he also bequeathed in the Ninth Article all his interest in his business known as Eldee Industrial Painting Corp. to plaintiff. This business was located in and operated from the first floor of 616 River Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In sum, we are satisfied that the trial court properly gleaned the probable intent of the testator from the language in the will and the extrinsic evidence to provide defendant with a life estate in only the larger of the two second floor apartments and not a life estate in the entire property.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
