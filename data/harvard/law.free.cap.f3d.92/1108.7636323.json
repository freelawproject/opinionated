Cornillie claims the district court erred by (1) refusing Cor-nillie\u2019s request for an instruction on bank larceny as a lesser included offense, and (2) instructing the jury that Cornillie could be found guilty if he had used force and violence <em>or </em>intimidation when Cornillie had been accused in the indictment of having used force, violence <em>and </em>intimidation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-22\">Cornillie claims the district court erred by refusing to charge the jury on. the lesser included offense of bank larceny. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>20 F.3d 1111, 1114 (11th Cir.1994). An abuse of discretion .may occur where the evidence would permit a rational jury to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and not the greater. <em>United States v. Catchings, </em>922 F.2d 777, 780 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-23\">The essential elements of bank larceny under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b) are (1) the defendant took and carried away money, (2) the money was worth more than $100, (3) the money was in the care, custody, control, management or possession of the bank; and (4) the defendant intended to steal or purloin the money. <em>United States v. Falcone, </em>934 F.2d 1528, 1547 (11th Cir.1991). Bank larceny lacks the element of force or intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-24\">Cornillie claims that the jury could have rationally found that he never knowingly and willfully intended to use force and violence or intimidation. Cornillie says the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>evidence showed that he merely passed nonthreatening letters to the bank tellers and that he appeared to be under the influence of drugs. Cornillie claims that if the jury believed he was under the influence of drugs, the jury could have found he lacked the ability to form the requisite intent to intimidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), intimidation occurs \u201cwhen an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer-a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 315 (5th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Graham, </em>931 F.2d 1442, 1443 (11th Cir.1991). The evidence showed that Cornillie presented demand letters to the bank tellers and that the bank tellers complied with.his demands out of fear. That Cornillie appeared to be under the influence of drugs could very well have made Cornillie even more intimidating. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Flynn\u2019s request for a lesser included instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">During deliberations, the jury twice' asked whether they should follow the language of the indictment, which charged Cornillie with having used force, violence <em>and </em>intimidation, or the court\u2019s jury charge which, tracking the language of the statute, instructed the jury that Cornillie could be found guilty if he had used force and violence, <em>or </em>intimidation. After the second request, the district court instructed the jury that the government could charge Cornillie in the conjunctive, that is, using the words by force, violence and intimidation, but that the government was allowed to attempt to prove its ease at trial in the disjunctive, that is by showing force and violence or intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Cornillie claims it was error for the district court to instruct the jury that Cornil-lie could be found guilty if he used only intimidation because he was accused of having used force and violence. Cornillie says the court\u2019s instructions confused the jury\u2014as evidenced by their two questions\u2014and that the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Where the language of a statute proscribes several means by which the defendant might have committed a violation, the government may plead the offense conjunc-tively and satisfy its burden of proof by any one of the means. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>871 F.2d 1566, 1573 (11th Cir.1989). However, the court\u2019s charge to the jury should track the language of the statute. <em>See United States v. Brooks, </em>670 F.2d 148, 152-53 (11th Cir.1982). The district court correctly instructed the jury. And, by referring the jury back to its original instruction, the district court exercised its affirmative duty to clear up the juror\u2019s confusion. <em>See United States v. Anderton, </em>629 F.2d 1044, 1049 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
