Y. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In the case cited the court held that the plaintiff was subrogated to the rights of the holder of a promissory note as against the maker and the indorser thereof where payment of the note had been made by the maker with the proceeds of sale of merchandise belonging to the plaintiff; and while the rights of plaintiff and defendant maker were based on an existing contract between them there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant indorser. See <em>Hough </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Life Insurance Company, </em>57 Ill. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It follows that the complaint states a cause of action and that the order should be reversed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings granted, with ten dollars costs, with leave to defendant to withdraw demurrer and to serve an answer within six days after service of a copy of the order entered hereon on payment of said costs. Appeal from order denying motion for resettlement dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Bijur and Mullan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
