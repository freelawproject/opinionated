J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKa\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">This Court expressed, at the time, the regret it felt in being compelled to reverse the judgment reviewed in <em>Wilmer </em>v. Placide, 137 Md. 107, by reason of the error of the lower court in refusing, to permit the plaintiff to introduce any further testimony in the case. Y7e referred to* the fact that there were seven counts in the declaration, only two- of which in terms named the Madison Avenue property, connected with .which there had been so much litigation, and that there had been no demurrer filed to' the declaration or to any of the counts in it. After citing some decisions to show that, in passing on the admissibility of evidence, the court was required to examine the pleadings in order to ascertain whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the evidence was admissible, we said: \u201cThere is nothing before ns to show what was to- be offered by the plaintiff, and we know of no case which would authorize us to treat an objection to evidence as equivalent to a demurrer and thereby enable us to pass on the sufficiency of the declaration, or the different counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We said enough to remind attorneys of the position this Court has taken when it. was sought to obtain relief from a judgment or decree alleged to have been obtained by perjured testimony, and to \u201cshow how suits for malicious prosecution in civil cases, including the alleged abuse of process of courts, are regarded by it, and not encouraged,\u201d and we did assume that no attorney familiar with the oases referred to by us in that opinion would ask this Court, or the lower court, to give relief under such a declaration as the one' in this case, on such testimony as there is in this record and other records, to which these litigants, were parties, which have been before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">If we could have legally known, as we know now, the kind of evidence the appellant proposed then to- offer, and the lower -court excluded by its ruling in that ease, we would not have felt bound to reverse that, judgment. It is trifling with the Court to- ask it, with the record in this case and the records and decisions of this Court in the prior oases between these- parties before it, to reverse the judgment now appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">It is not necessary, for the' purposes- of this, appeal, to refer to them, but anyone concerned, or curious to- know what has already been decided by us, can be gratified by referring to <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>118 Md. 305; <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>119 Md. 49; <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>123 Md. 532; <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>127 Md. 340, in which case this Court, through Judge Stockbridge, said: \u201cFor all practical purposes, the bill is one under which the complainant seeks to- obtain a retrial of the questions which were involved and had been passed upon in tbe case reported in 118 Md., and the grounds upon which this was asked t-o be\u00a1 done were, first, fraud, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>second, newly discovered evidence.\u201d The fraud alleged was said to consist of perjured evidencei in the trial of the first case, and the allegation as to newly discovered evidence consisted in the discovery of certain witnesses, who it was averred would contradict the perjured evidence, and that such witnesses' were heyond the reach of the complainant, or that he was ignorant of them at the time. An order sustaining a demurrer to the bill of complaint was affirmed and the bill dismissed in that case. The next one is <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>128 Md. 168, then <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>131 Md. 399 \u2014 the latter being; an appeal from a decree setting aside a deed from Wilmer to his sister, alleged to he fradulent, which was affirmed, and that opinion ref ers to the previous cases and \u25a0states: \u201cThat litigation finally resulted in a personal decree against Wilmer1 in favor of Miss Plaeide for $2,193.15 and it was determined that the house on Madison Avenue belonged to her, 118 Md. 305. When that litigation and its results are considered in connection with the testimony in this case, we can have no doubt that the deed was made with a \u25a0deliberate intent to hinder the appellee from collecting what was decided to he due her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Then the appellant, notwithstanding all that had been decided, instituted this suit .at law, which we felt called upon to reverse for the reasons already stated, hut we there said: \u201cWhile the case reported in 127 Md. was an effort to set aside and vacate a decree, the principle involved in this ease is the same. Indeed, a court of equity would he more anxious to set aside a decree obtained by perjured testimony than a court of law could he to sustain such a suit as this. There must he an end to litigation somewhere, and if the litigant who loses his case is to he permitted to sue the opposite party for alleged perjury and gains that case, what is to prevent that party from suing him on the same ground, and thus indefinitely continuing the litigation?\u201d 137 Md. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The case of <em>Maryland Steel Company </em>v. <em>Marney, </em>91 Md. 360, in which we followed and adopted the reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Throckmorton, </em>98 U. S. 161 and <em>Pico </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Cohn, </em>91 Cal. 129, Las been cited with approval by us several times since it was decided, including some of tlie numerous cases of <em>Wilmer </em>v. <em>Placide, Pressler </em>v. <em>Pressler, </em>134 Md. 243, and others, and the subject is no longer an open question in this State. There is nothing to take this case out of the fixed rule, but on the contrary it is peculiarly one that should be governed by it. Judge Pattisobt, in concluding the opinion of the Court- in 118 Md., which decided some of the most important controversies between these parties, said: \u201cAs we have stated, there are many exceptions to the admission and rejection of testimony, all of which we have carefully considered, <em>but as ufe have reached our conclusion almost exclusively upon the conceded testimony in this case,. </em>we think it unnecessary to pass upon them, for our conclusion would not be affected thereby.\u201d Moreover, in 118 Md., Wilmer s two sons answered the bill of Miss Placide and admitted all ,of its allegations, and stated that she was. always- regarded as the absolute owner of the Madison Avenue property, and that their father spoke of it as her property. They also said that they had never heard of the \u201csecret\u201d deed from the plaintiff to their mother, which was set aside, until shortly before it was by their father filed for record \u2014 being many years after its .date. Mr. Morse, the husband of the deceased daughter of Wilmer, said in his answer that he had no personal knowledge of many of the matters and things alleged in the bill, \u201calthough he has understood from statements made by his- wife and others that said allegations are substantially true as therein stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">There is nothing in the present, record or in any of the of hors before us to suggest that the lower court was in error in rejecting the two prayers offered by the plaintiff, or in directing a verdict in favor of defendant, and we must affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs above and below.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
