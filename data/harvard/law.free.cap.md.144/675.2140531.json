B. Olemmer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The defendant pleaded that he never was indebted, and that he did not- promise as alleged, and the trial of the case on the issue joined on those pleas resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $1,000, from which the defendant has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the contract referred to, and also offered evidence tending to show that he was an attorney-at-law, and engaged at Denton, Caroline County, Maryland, in the business of selling real estate and \u201chandling mortgage loans\u201d; that the defendant came to his office on the 11th of August, 1921, to sell him some stock in the Adamantes Brick Company, and that he entered into1 the contract mentioned \u201cfor the purchase of $1,000.00 worth of the stock\u201d; that lie had been engaged for seven years \u201cin buying and selling mortgages,\u201d was \u201cin touch\u201d with \u201cthe finances -x- -x- x j-jj COunty,\u201d and kept \u201ca tabulated list of the buyers and sellers\u201d and \u201cof all stock transactions,\u201d and that the \u201cservices\u201d referred to in said contract were to consist in his giving the defendant the \u201cresult of that compilation,\u201d which \u201cincluded the latest copy of that list showing those purchasers\u201d; that he gave the defendant \u201c'a portion of\u201d the names and addresses of the parties the first day he came to see him, and later gave him an \u201cadditional number of names,\u201d &amp;c.; that the defendant and Mr. Eaton, who was working for the defendant, came to see him four times during the period of two or three weeks for information in regard to the parties whose names he had given them; that the defendant required him to sign an application for the stock, dated August 11th, 192 L, because he said \u201cthat Was necessary in order to get the stock properly issued\u201d; that no demand was ever made on him to pay for the stock because it \u201cwas considered a paid-up application\u201d; that he had demanded delivery of the stock, but it had never been delivered to him, and that the defendant had refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The defendant testified that he was secretary of the Adam-antes: Brick Company, which was incorporated in July, 1921, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and .that he went to the Eastern Shore for the purpose of selling the stock of that company; that after trying to do so for several days he determined to try to get somebody there to sell it and went to see the plaintiff for that purpose; that he thought the plaintiff through Ms influence could assist him in selling the stock, and that plaintiff told Mm that he thought he could sell the stock to \u201cthe amount of $10,000 at least,\u201d and that he, witness, fixed the rate of his commission at ten per cent.; that the plaintiff said, \u201cIf you will sign, an agreement to the effect that yon will give me $1,000 worth of the stock I will give yon my list of names and give you all the names that I 'have of people in this section, and, to make it stronger, I would suggest that I sign an application for $1,000 of stock, and you can show the people up there that I have become a stockholder in the concern\u201d; \u2019that he went to see two people whose names had been given him by tbe plaintiff, and that later Mr. Eaton, the vice-president of the company, spent ten days interviewing the people whose names had been furnished by the plaintiff, but that uo stock of the company was sold.on the Eastern Shore; that the word \u201cservices\u201d in the contract meant that the plaintiff \u201cwas going to give every assistance and even talle to people himself in behalf of the sale of stock, and that if any sales were made as a result of that, he would have certainly paid the plaintiff a commission of ten per cent.; that .the stock was not delivered because the witness \u201cdid not think that the plaintiff earned it in any sense of the word. Plaintiff did not sell .any stock of the company and really did not give any assistance in selling any stock of the company as was agreed upon verbally by us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The only exception in the ease is to the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer and the rejection of the defendant\u2019s first, second and third prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">By Ms first and second prayers the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury that the verdict must he for the defendant (1) because there was no evidence in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and (2) because the plaintiff had failed to offer any evidence \u201cto show the fair and reasonable value of the services alleged to have been rendered by\u201d him, and by his third prayer the defendant asserted that the verdict should he for him. because the plaintiff' had \u201cfailed to offer any proof as to the value of the 100 shares of stock * * * as of the date said stock was to have been delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer is as follows.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff prays the court to instruct- the jury that (if they find that) the amount of money due the plaintiff by the defendant, for work and labor performed and materials furnished or for services rendered by the plaintiff1 under such contract as they may find to have been the contract between the parties, has not been paid to the plaintiff, then he is entitled to recover in this action the value under said contract of said work and labor1 performed and materials furnished or services rendered by him as shown by the evidence in the cause, notwithstanding they may find that there was a provision in such contract, as they may find, as aforesaid, that the said plaintiff was to receive the payment named in the signed agreement dated August 11th, 1921, offered in evidence, in stock of the Adamantex Brick Company of Maryland; provided they believe-the defendant never tendered the plaintiff said stock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In the case of <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Hagerstown, Brewing Co., </em>136 Md. 151, the appellant agreed in writing to serve the appellee for the period of five years at a salary of $150.00 per month, \u201cpayable as follows: Thirty dollars per week in cash * * * the balance of salary, thirty dollars. ($30.00) per month, to he paid in Brewery Company stock, par value $100.00 per share, making a total salary for the year of eighteen hundred dollars ($1,800.00), and the same to- follow every year.\u201d The cash compensation was paid the appellant, hut none of the stock which was to form a part of his salary was ever issued, and the appellant brought suit to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>cover the par value of the stock. In disposing of the case this Court said: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s theory is that he is entitled to recover the par value of the stock because of the fact that the stock itself was never delivered. But this is not the proper measure of his right. It was the actual value of the stock, and not its nominal par value, which determined the real amount of his compensation by that form of payment. Consequently the actual value of the stock at the time provided by the contract for its issuance was the true measure and limit of his recovery. This was the rule applied in <em>Alexander </em>v. Macauley, 6 Md. 359, and recognized also' in <em>Orange, A. &amp;. </em>M. <em>R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Placide, </em>35 Md. 315.\u201d Applying the rule stated to this case, it becomes apparent that there was no error in the rejection of the defendant\u2019s prayers. The plaintiff having offered evidence tending to show a breach of the written contract by the defendant, upon the finding of such breach by the jury he was entitled to recover at least nominal damages <em>(McGrath </em>v. <em>Gegner, </em>77 Md. 331), and the court could <em>not </em>properly have directed a verdict for the defendant on the ground that there was no evidence in the case legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, or because he had failed to show the value of his services or the actual value of the stock at the time it was to have been delivered to him under the contract. The appellant insists as a further reason why said prayers should have been rejected, that the written contract itself furnishes at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the value of the stock and brings the case within the decision in <em>Orange, A. &amp; M. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Placide, supra. </em>That contention, however, is also disposed of by the case of <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Hagerstown Brewing Co., supra, </em>where the court held that the mere statement of the par value of the stock in a contract very much like the one in this case did not amount to an agreement between the parties as to the \u201cprice or rate of valuation at which the stock was to he issued to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>It is also apparent that the court, below erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, because, in addition to its faulty construction, it instructed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the services, etc., rendered hy him, notwithstanding the jury found that hy the terms of the contract the plaintiff was to he paid in the stock of the Adamantex Brick Company, provided they further found that the defendant \u201cnever tendered the plaintiff said stock.\u201d The refusal of the defendant to deliver the stock could not change the measure of damages for the breach hy the defendant of the written contract, which, under the rule we have stated, was the actual value of the stock at the time it should have been issued in accordance with the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because of the error in granting the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, the judgment must be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant, and a new trial aivarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
