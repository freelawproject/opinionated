R. Grace 'and Company, a corporation, which filed a bill of complaint against the Frederick AY Lipps Company of Baltimore City. The bill was filed by the plaintiff corporation, \u201cacting on its own behalf, and on behalf of all others similarly situated who may come in and contribute to the expenses of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>proceeding\u2019s\u201d; it alleged that the defendant corporation was insolvent, and prayed for the appointment of a receiver and for the dissolution of said defendant corporation. Receivers were appointed and a larg\u2019e number of claims Were filed against the insolvent estate, one of which was that of the Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation for $290,233.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">To this claim, and several others, exceptions were filed by appellees, as creditors, through Barton, Wilmer &amp; Barton, their attorneys. These attorneys, together with the receivers, for more than a year were negotiating with the Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation looking to a compromise. The testimony indicates that at one time they hoped to have the claim reduced by about one-half, and were informed that such a settlement had been advised by claimant\u2019s attorney. But these negotiations apparently failed/ By reason of the delay Mr. Culbreth, who represented the plaintiff, one of the largest creditors, became impatient and undertook to m\u00e1ke an analysis of the finance corporation claim, which resulted in the discovery that included in that claim was about twenty-three per cent, interest on a much larger original claim, amounting to more than two-thirds of the claim filed, which discovery he believed could be successfully used to bring about a satisfactory settlement, inasmuch as the charge of usurious interest, in his opinion, endangered the claim not only to the extent of the overcharge of interest, but for the full amount, and possibly made claimant liable for a large sum which it had already collected by the sale of certain collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Whereupon he, in the name of his client, filed a petition setting out the facts, citing section 124 of article 23 of the Oode\u00a1, and suggesting that it would be convenient to have decided the questions of law involved before any evidence was taken, the questions of law being: (a) Are said loans and said security absolutely null and void ? (b) If said loans' and said security are not absolutely null and void, to what extent, if any, are they null and void? On which petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the Court ordered that said questions be raised for the opinion of the court and that- a copy of the petition and order be served on said claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Some months later the receiver tiled a petition reporting to the court that they had been advised by the solicitors for W. R. Grace and Company and for Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation \u201cthat they have agreed to settle and compromise the matters in dispute between them by the deduction of the sum of $12.5,000 from the amount of the claim of said Manufacturers\u2019 Corporation as filed in the cause, said agreement having been made subject to tbe approval of this honorable court\u201d; that the receivers \u201cdeem a settlement on the aforesaid terms to be advisable and recommend the approval thereof by\u201d tbe court. A formal approval was also filed by Mr. Culbreth as solicitor for W. R. Grace <em>&amp; </em>Company, and by the solicitors for the Finance Corporation; and the court so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Whereupon Mr. Culbreth filed a petition in which he set out the facts hereinbefore recited; that the result of the settlement obtained by him \u201cis to reduce the claim of Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation from $290,733.23 to $165,-733.23, and its dividend from $74,707.25 to $42,593.44, thereby increasing the fund for distribution $32,113.81, and reducing the total amount of claims from $788,938.48 to $663,938.48. That your petitioner has received no compensation for said services; and while his client is able and willing <em>to </em>compensate him, yet your petitioner respectfully submits bis services were for the benefit of all tbe creditors other than Manufacturers\u2019 Finance Corporation, and his compensation should be paid out of the fund.\u201d The prayer of the petition was that petitioner \u201cbe allowed reasonable compensation out of said fund .for said services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The court allowed a fee of $3,500 to appellant, subject to exceptions. Exceptions were filed to this allowance in the audit and the court sustained the exceptions. Whereupon this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>A motion was duly filed to dismiss the appeal, on the ground: 1. That the appellant is not a party of record to the proceedings in which the order was passed from which the appeal was taken. 2. That he has no such interest in the subject matter in controversy, as is contemplated by the Code, art. 5, sec. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">That section is as follows: \u201cAn appeal shall be allowed from any final decree or order in the nature of a final decree passed by a court of equity by any one or more of the persons parties to\u25a0 the suit, etc.\u201d In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Jack, </em>32 Md. 253, it was held that this provision of the 'Code cannot be construed as restricting the right of appeal in all cases to such persons only as are <em>technically </em>parties to the suit; \u25a0 but that it contemplates all persons who are directly interested in the subject matter of the decree. Obviously the appellant was not a technical party to the suit. Had he, then, a direct interest in the subject matter of the order appealed from?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The subject matter was the insolvent estate of the defendant in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">It is contended with much force by appellant that his client, the plaintiff, having instituted the suit, \u201cacting in its own behalf, and on behalf of all others similarly situated who may come in and contribute to the expenses of these proceedings,\u201d it was the right, as well as the duty, of counsel for plaintiff to control the suit, if not absolutely, at least to the extent of protecting the estate against improper claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">If that was the duty of counsel for plaintiff it was such in his capacity <em>as counsel for plaintiff, </em>and because it was the duty of <em>plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Assuming all that to be true, and assuming further, without deciding, that the services rendered by counsel for plaintiff in this case came within the principle of the decisions in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, and <em>Terminal Heating Co. </em>v. <em>Whitelock, </em>120 Md. 408, possibly <em>plaintiff, </em>in the character of a <em>quasi-trustee, </em>might properly have asked for an allowance out of the common fund for .expenses, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>counsel fees, incurred by it in protecting the common interest of a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">But it does not follow that <em>counsel </em>could, as a matter of right, make such request in his own behalf and thus acquire an interest in the subject matter of the suit. He was not employed by any one except the plaintiff, and he could look to no one but the plaintiff for compensation. It is true that a practice has grown up. of allowing fees in certain cases on application by counsel, but this Court has more than once expressed disapproval of such practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gemmell, </em>13 Md. 565, Judge Miller, who filed a separate opinion, in speaking of counsel fees., said: \u201cThe claims for those allowances are not made by petitions filed by their client, according to the usual practice, but by petitions filed by themselves in their own names ; and it is only by treating them as <em>bona fide </em>assignees of their proportional parts, of the judgment, as specified in the contracts for their contingent fees, that relief can be granted them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">This Court, through Chief Judge Boyd, said in <em>Marshall v. Dobler &amp; Mudge, 97 </em>Md., at page 558, <em>that </em>was the theory on which the allowances were made in the Gemmell case. It is to be noted that, there is nothing in the record in the present case to indicate that there was any such contract between appellant and his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">It is also to be noted that neither in the Gemmell case nor in the Heating Co. case were counsel <em>appellants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In our opinion the question is concluded by the cases of <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Dobler &amp; Mudge, supra, </em>and <em>Karr </em>v. <em>Shirk, </em>142 Md. 118, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs to appellees.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
