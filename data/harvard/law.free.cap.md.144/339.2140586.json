The prayer of the petition was that said caveat be dismissed by the orphans\u2019 court, and that court passed an order requiring the, said Addie Blanche Measley to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On the 8th of June, 1021, Mrs. Measley filed an answer to-said petition, .in which she alleged that her mother did make a, will which was duly executed by her, and that before leaving the cemetery, on the day of her mother\u2019s funeral, Isaac Shaver announced that the will would be read at her mother\u2019s house; that she went from the cemetery to her mother\u2019s house, and that then and there the said Isaac Shaver read what- purported to he her mother\u2019s last will and testament; that- thereafter she expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of said veill to George M.

Housman, Wilson Housman and G.

She has failed to show that she has been injured. 2. She has failed to show any misstatement of facts. 3. She has failed to show that she relied on any false statement of facts as distinguished from a mei*e statement of opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In regal\u2019d to the first of the \u201cessentials\u201d mentioned, even if we were to assume that the requirement of proof of damages in actions of fraud and deceit is applicable where the fraud is relied on as a defense to the enforcement of such a contract, it would seem unnecessary to discuss the question of proof of damages in this case, whei\u2019e the record shows that the alleged fradulent contract (by which the plaintiff agreed to accept $2,000 and a legacy of $500) is set up as a complete bar to plaintiff\u2019s right to caveat an alleged will of her mother, hv which the defendants, her nephews., after the payment of a legacy of $500, are given the entire residue of an estate valued by them at $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In considering the other \u201cessentials\u201d referred to by counsel, it is important to bear in mind that the only question here is whether there is any evidence in the ease which should have been submitted to the jury upon the issue of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Section 324 of aidiole 93 of the Code provides how a will, or any clause thereof, may be revoked by a testator by \u201cburning, cancelling, tearing or obliterating the 3ame,\u201d and this Court has adopted the rule stated in 1 <em>Bedfi&amp;ld on Wills </em>(3rd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ed.), star paging 307, see. 8: \u201cThe rule of evidence in the ecclesiastical courts, in regard to presumptive revocations, from the absence or mutilation of the will, seems to he, that if the will is traced into the testator\u2019s possession and custody, and is there found mutilated, in any of the modes pointed out in the statute for revocation, or is not found at all, it will be presumed that the testator destroyed, or mutilated it, <em>animo revocandi.\" Eschbach </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>61 Md. 478; <em>Home for Aged </em>v. <em>Bantz, </em>106 Md. 147; <em>Home for Aged </em>v. <em>Bantz, </em>107 Md. 543; <em>Safe Dep. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Thom, </em>117 Md. 154. As we have shown, the evidence in the record is to the effect that, after the will was executed by Mrs. Baker, it was put in an envelope, which was sealed and endorsed by Mr. Shaver, who prepared it, and then delivered to the testatrix; that after Mrs. Baker\u2019s death, George M. Housman and Benny Bull, the father of G. Orville Bull, delivered to Mr. Shaver a shoe box containing the \u201cpapers and valuables\u201d of Mrs. Baker, which they had found in her desk \u201cup stairs\u201d in her house; that when Mr. Shaver opened the box be found among other papers and valuables the envelope in which the will had been placed torn open at one end; that- he found in the envelope only parts of the will that had been prepared by him and executed by Mrs. Baker, and that the clause by which the residue of the estate was devised and bequeathed to the defendants (being the third clause of the will) was completely tom out, and was not in the envelope; that Mr. Shaver then drove to Mrs. Baker\u2019s home, where he met George M. TIousman and told him of the condition of the will, \u201cand showed it to him\u201d; that after waiting for the .arrival of Benny Bull, Mr. Shaver, George M. Housman and Benny Bull went up stairs to hunt for the missing part of the will, and that while they were examining the contents of an old desk belonging to Mrs. Baker, George M. Housman found the detached clause of the will among what Mr. Shaver describes as \u201ca lot of * * old rubbish\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d ; that George M. Housman gave it to Mr. Shaver, who took it home and, after procuring some \u201ctransparent sticker's,\u201d fitted it in the will and \u201cput the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>stickers on it\u201d; that on Saturday after Mrs. Baker\u2019s funeral Mr. Shaver read the will, in the condition to which, it had been restored, at Mrs. Baker\u2019s house to those present, including the plaintiff and the defendants, .and that after reading it he said that that was the condition in which he had received it, or the condition in which it had come into his. hands; that he then put the will hade in the envelope, and on the following Tuesday, March 22nd, 1921, presented it to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Baltimore County and the entire will was admitted to probate. There can be no question that this evidence was sufficient to justify the presumption that the testatrix tore the clause mentioned out of the will <em>animo revocando </em>and, so far as the plaintiff\u2019s right to caveat the will admitted to probate is concerned, it can make no difference whether Mrs. Baker intended thereby to revoke the entire will or simply the third clause thereof. <em>Home for Aged </em>v. <em>Bantz, </em>106 Md. 147; <em>Home for Aged </em>v. <em>Bantz, </em>107 Md. 543. The suggestion of the appellees that the presumption of revocation is overcome by the probate of the will, which cannot be attacked collaterally, and the case of <em>Tilghman v. France, </em>99 Md. 611, have no application here. This case is not an attempt by the plaintiff to impeach the probate of the will, but .an effort on the part of the defendants to set up' an alleged fraudulent contract as a bar to plaintiff\u2019s right to make .a direct attack upon the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The evidence also- tends to show that when George M. Housman went to see the plaintiff at her request, she told him that she \u201cwas going to fight the will\u201d and that he replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t fight that will, that will is perfectly all right, your mother1 was all right when she made the will and it is all right, you can\u2019t break it,\u201d that he also told her that he could not do anything then, but that she should go with him to see Wilson Housman, that Wilson Housman, after she told him that she was going to fight the will, said to her, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. We will meet tomorrow evening at Mr. Shaver\u2019s and make agreement what we will give you\u201d; that, relying upon these statements of the defendants, the plaintiff met them at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Mr. Shaver\u2019s the following day, April 1st, and executed the agreement of that date; that the plaintiff never heard or knew anything about the condition in which the will was found until the 20th of April; that at the time she executed the contract in question she believed what George M. Housman said to her, and thought that was the only way she could get .any money, and that if she had known of the condition in which the will was found after her mother\u2019s death she Would not have signed the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is urged by counsel for the appellees that no confidential relation existed between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that they were not hound to make any disclosure to her. But even if we assume that the defendants were under no obligation to disclose to the plaintiff the condition in which the will was found, it by no means follows that the case is devoid of any evidence of fraud in the procurement of the contracts. In the case of <em>Brager </em>v. <em>Friedenwald, </em>128 Md. 327, this Court said: \u201cWhere one is under no legal obligation to speak, his mere silence or his mere non-disclosure of material facts will not he sufficient, hut if in addition to non-disclosure he makes 'some active mis-statements of fact, or, at all events, such a partial and fragmentary statement of fact,\u2019 as entirely misleads one to his injury the legal situation is entirely changed,\u201d and Judge Burke, speaking for the court, quoted with approval the statement of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Laidlaw </em>v. <em>Organ, </em>2 Wheaton, 195, who, after saying, \u201cThe court is of opinion that he was not hound to communicate,\u201d then said: \u201cIt would he difficult to circiimseribe the contrary doctrine within proper limits <em>where the means </em>of intelligence are equally accessible to both parties. But, at the same time, each party must take care not to say or do anything tending to impose upon the other. The court thinks the absolute instruction of the judge was erroneous, and that the question <em>tohether any imposition was practiced by the vendee upon the vendor ought to have been submitted to the jury.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Counsel for the appellees also insist that the statement of George M. Housman to the plaintiff, \u201cYou can\u2019t fight that will, that will is perfectly all right, your mother was all right when she made the will and it is all right, you can\u2019t break it,\u201d was a mere expression of his opinion, as to the outcome of an attempt on her part to break the will, and not a mis-statement of fact. Without expressing our approval of that construction of the language quoted, it is sufficient to say that the fraud complained of does not rest upon that statement alone, for in addition to that statement there is evidence tending to show a concealment of the true condition in which the will Was found by inserting in it a clause that had been tom out and was not found in the envelope containing the rest of the will. All who participated in the concealment are liable for the result. 12 <em>R. C. L., </em>sec. 147, p. 399; <em>Kerr on Fraud and Mistake </em>(4th ed.), 442. It is said in 2 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity </em>(4th ed.), section 877: \u201cIn a majority of instances it (the misrepresentation) is made by means of language written or spoken; but it may consist of conduct alone, or external acts, when, through this instrumentality, it is intended to convey the impression, or to produce the conviction, that some fact exists, and such result is a natural consequence of the acts.\u201d The same principle is stated in <em>Kerr on Fraud and Mistake </em>(4th ed.), 63, and 12 <em>R. C. L., </em>sec. 13, pp. 243, 244. It cannot be said as a matter of law that this evidence satisfies the requirement stated in <em>Brager </em>v. <em>Friedenwald, supra, </em>and <em>Laidlaw </em>v. <em>Organ, supra, </em>that even where one is under no obligation to disclose the real facts, \u201ceach party must take care not to say or do anything tending to impose upon the other,\u201d and we think the court below erred in withdrawing the case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>Ruling reversed and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
