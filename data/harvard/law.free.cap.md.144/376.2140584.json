If the appeal is, from, the action of the orphans\u2019 court, on April 25th, reaffirming its decision of March 27th in regard to the counsel fee, then the evidence produced or the facts presented to the orphans\u2019 court at tire hearing mentioned in the record should have been set out in the record, so as to enable this Court to review the action complained of. \"When the orphans\u2019 court has the power to allow a counsel fee, \u201cthe amount must, in a great measure, be left to its discretion,\u201d and if the allowance is objected to- on the ground that it is, not a reasonable one, or is excessive, in the absence of the evidence or the facts before the orphans! court in disposing of the objection, this Court must .assume that its decision was, correct. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Gehr, </em>91 Md. 709; <em>Wilson, In re Martin, </em>135 Md. 195; <em>Harrison &amp; Wife </em>v. <em>Ridgely and Ward, </em>No. 14 Appeals, October Term, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As no' appeal was taken from the order of the orphans7 court of March 27th within the time allowed by the statute, .and as this Court cannot, for the reasons stated, review the action of that court on April 26th reaffirming its decision of March 27th, the appeal in this ease must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
