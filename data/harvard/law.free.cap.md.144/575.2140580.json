The first was from, rulings of the Baltimore City Court made in the trial of issues involving1 the validity of a certain paper writing proposed as the will of Dr. Edward M. Wise, who was at the time of his death a resident of Baltimore City. The second isi from an order of that court setting aside the verdict of the jury tryingi the issues in favor of the plaintiff, on an issue involving the testamentary capacity of the decedent, and awarding' a new trial as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">There are one hundred and five exceptions involved in the first appeal, one hundred and four of which have to do with the rulings of the trial court upon matters of evidence, and the other of which relates to its action on the prayers, but the exception\u00ae which we are called upon to consider are not nearly so' numerous. The greater part of the exceptions relate to the third issue submitted to the jury \u2014 the issue involving, testamentary capacity \u2014 upon which the jury found their verdict for (the plaintiff' and against the defendants, the caveatees. Since the court, set aside that ver dict and directed a new trial of the issue, those exceptions have become wholly immaterial and irrelevant, and are not before us for review. Hor would the case be any different if the trial court had not taken that action, because in that event, the verdict being for her, would have demonstrated that the caveator could not possibly have been injured by the rulings of which she complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The outstanding question raised by the first appeal, is whether there is evidence to be found in the record legally sufficient to support the hypothesis that the disputed will was procured by undue influence or fraud, practiced upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>decedent by Laura Kaiser, sole beneficiary under it. The trial court, at the conclusion of the ease for the caveators, directed the jury to find their verdict for the. caveatees on the issues involving respectively the execution of the will, knowledge of its contents, undue influence, and fraud. The uncontr\u2019adicted testimony being that the testator signed the will and that his signature was attested by two witnesses in his presence-, and in the presence of each other at his- request, the caveatees were clearly entitled to a directed verdict on the issues involving the- proper execution of the- will by the decedent, and knowledge of its contents by bim, and no- error- can be imputed to the court for its. ruling in respect to tho-se- issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The record in this case contains 936 pages. A comparatively small part of it however relates to the is-sue of undue influence, and an even smaller part, to- the issue of fraud, and all the evidence: in relation to tho-se issues: which is material to- the question before us may be briefly stated. Stated narratively it is in substance this.:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Edward Mi Wise-, at the: time of his death, was about sixty-seven years, old. He was. a physician and until a few years before his death had practiced -his profession in Baltimore. He- appears to have been a. cultivated, kindly man, naturally genial and generous and he- made- some- warm friends. About eighteen or twenty years before his death he became afflicted with a. very distressing; nervous disease referred to in the testimony as chronic progressive, chorea, which affected the co-ordination of his: muscular1 system, and which manifested itself in Various, spasmodic, involuntary muscular contortions, twitchings, and jerks. As the disease- progressed and its physical manifestations became-more and more noticeable-, it became app-ar\u2019ent that there was: accompanying bis physical decline also a perceptible mental deterioration. His: habits changed, he became regardless of appearances and conventions, he- became slovenly and filthy, he exposed his person in the most public, places, without any regard for decency or decorum; he was guilty of grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>offensive familiarities with women whom he had <em>never </em>known, strangers whom he met casually in public conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">He had no near relatives. His nearest known relative was the appellant in this ease, his first cousin, and while he was on friendly terms with her and her daughter, he saw them so infrequently that when they met on the .street a few months before bis death, notwithstanding his peculiar and distinct appearance, neither of them knew the other certainly or definitely, until their respective identities were made certain through mutual inquiries and greetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">He left an estate valued at more than $200,000, which, as has already been stated, be attempted to bequeath to Mrs. Laura, Kaiser, the only beneficiary under the paper writing in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">\"When or where or bow* be first met her does not definitely appear, since ,sbe herself did not testify in the case, and no one else seemed to know. Kaiser was her maiden name. She was a divorced woman. She bad been married to a Mr. Pteck, with whom she bad lived for some years in Canada and from whom she was later divorced. While she was living in Canada she received from time to time substantial sums- of money from Wise, and when she and her husband separated, Dr. Wise paid the expenses of the proceeding which resulted in a- decree divorcing her from her husband, and after she returned to Baltimore be continued his attentions to her. He gave her many costly presents, including furs and jewelry, and a house and lot on West Saratoga Street in Baltimore City, and gave her brother a farm in Anne Arundel County. When she returned to- Baltimore he established her in the house on Saratoga Street and for a time visited her there, but finally made his home with her altogether and openly kept her there as bis mistress.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">That they were not unconscious- of the odium which would naturally attach to them because of their conduct, was manifested by various false statements which they gave when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>visited by acquaintances not familiar with the circumstances, in explanation of Mrs. Kaiser\u2019s presence in Wise\u2019s home. Ho referred to her as \u201cAnnie1 Wise,\u201d a, cousin, and she explained her \u2022 apparent affluence by saying that she had received a legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">As time went on, the disease from which he suffered grew steadily worse, and the physical symptoms of his mental and bodily decay more conspicuous. As he fell more and more under the influence of the disease from which he suffered, his relations with Mrs. Kaiser became closer and more intimate, until at length, as already stated, he kept her openly in his. home as his mistress, and that relation continued until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Towards the end of his life, his condition imposed a very considerable burden upon any one who assumed the duty of giving him such care and attention as he required. That duty Mrs. Kaiser assumed, and she seems to1 have discharged it conscientiously and well. She appears, to have treated Dr. Wise, when he had become almost helpless from the inroads of his disease, with every attention, care and kindness. But whilst she was his mistress, and whilst she acted also- as his nurse and his housekeeper, and whilst she treated him kindly and considerately when 'they were together, her motives nevertheless were mercenary, and she had no real affection for him, at least at that time. She on more than one occasion said that she wished he were dead, and that, his condition was more than she could stand, and that she would g,et all out of him she could while he lived. Hot only were the personal relations between Wise and Mrs. Kaiser what we have described, but she also took a part, in his business affairs. S'he kept the keys of his safety deposit boxes, she aided him in buying and selling his property, her brother collected his rents, and she urged him to make a will, and after she had insisted that, that be done, she went with him to a lawyer\u2019s office, where he made a will in which he gave all of his1 prop1ertv to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>As the end of his life approached, and his bodily infirmities increased, his mind became correspondingly weaker, and be was more easily influenced, until he reached a stage when he could he influenced by anybody, and at that time Mrs. Kaiser1 exercised a controlling and dominating influence over him, which he was unable to resist, and it was as a result of that influence that he made the will which is in issue in this case, but it does not appear that she suggested or knew what the contents of that will would be, although her anxiety to have <em>it </em>executed indicates that she believed it would be favorable to her. At that time her influence over the decedent was complete; be was constrained to do what sire asked him to do, and when she insisted that he make a will, he felt that he must comply. That this is not too1 strong a statement will appear from these brief extracts from, the testimony. Mi\u00f3la Conyer, colored, a servant, in describing the decedent\u2019s appearance and behavior said: \u201cI guess often he would worry Mrs.. Kaiser\u2019s nerves by the way he twitched himself \u2014 T don\u2019t know how she felt about it; anyway to see a man and take care of him because he is nervous, he would make me nervous to see him that way, and I felt sorry for him myself. I felt sorry for doctor, because he was in such a way; he was no good to himself, he couldn\u2019t 'enjoy things, and Mrs. Kaiser used to tell me doctor used to* do everything Mrs. Kaiser said, because. Mrs. Kaiser said she could make doctor do anything she wanted him to do. * * * So when they g;ot ready to build a home in Anne Arundel Oounty that old house was moved hack and the new house was put forward and so then after we all came hack I heard Mrs. Kaiser sav to the doctor \u2014 iihe doctor was talking about buying some trees to plant at the Anne Arundel home, he wanted English walnut trees and plum trees \u2014 there were two at the Saratoga Street house, I sawed them off, they got in my way, I sawed them down, they got in my way \u2014 Mrs. Kaiser said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and there has to- he a will made, and the doctor said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and then they got ready and they went out. I asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Mrs. Kaiser1 \u2014 it wasn\u2019t by business, but I asked Mrs. Kaiser, I said, \u2018Who is that home going to be,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mine.\u2019 I said, 'That will be1 fine\u2019; she said, \u2018Ko, doctor is going to give that home to John, but that will be fixed, for if I am the longest liver it comes bade because John is grafting, Mabel is not John\u2019s daughter, that is only his stepdaughter.\u2019 \u201d Laura Stockton, another witness, who. appears to have been on confidential terms with Mrs. Kaiser, speaking of an occasion in November preceding; Dr. Wise\u2019s death, s-aid: \u201cA. I saw her and I saw Dr. Wise. He came down and he was ready to <em>go </em>out. That was the last time I saw him alive and he said to me \u2014 she told me to go and shake handsi with him, and she went in the kitchen and kissed him goodbye; she told bim to be careful, she was very solicitous about him. She said, \u2018I don\u2019t, know how much longer I can stand this, it is near setting; me crazy, his actions.\u2019 She said, \u2018He promised to bring the will home today, I want, to see the will, I don\u2019t-believe no man, and he also promised to make the house over1 to me today. Q\u2019. What was it she said with reference to the <em>will'( </em>A. She said he promised to bring the will home that night; she wanted to see what was in the will, she didn\u2019t trust no man. Q. Mrs. Stockton, have you stated that exactly as Mrs. Kaiser1 said it to you, she didn\u2019t trust no man ? Did she put in any word ? A. Yes, sir, she made it a little plainer. Q. Tell the jury how she said that ? A. She said she didn\u2019t trust no damn man.\u201d She also said: \u201cA. She (Mrs. Kaiser) said she believed the doctor was; losing his mind, he was nearly setting her crazy and she said that she was going: to get all she. could before he; died. * * * She told me the doctor\u2019s mind was getting so bad he could be influenced by anyone and she; kept him in the house after that pretty1 much, she didn\u2019t let him go out. * * * She said that she was praying every nigjht that the doctor would die and after he died she was going to have one wonderful time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aab\">(latherine Frazier, colored, gave this testimony: \u201cDid you ever hear Mrs. Kaiser say anything with reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Dr. Wise ? A. I never -heard hear say anything with reference to Dr. Wise, just only when he was laying a corpse, that is all I know when .she vised to come out to- the house and go on the poor excursion, he \u2018dasn\u2019t\u2019 leave the house until she came. Q. (The Court) : What do you mean ?' A. She didn\u2019t allow him to leave until she came and got him. Q. What do you mean ? A. He was a member of the poor excursion and she told him not to leave; and he didn\u2019t leave because she had the influence over him. Q. She asked him out? A. Yes, sir. Q. He wouldn\u2019t leave until she told him? A. Ho.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Maria, Brown, colored, testified: \u201cDid you hear Mrs. Kaiser say anything at the house at that time whilst sire was engaged in removing1 Dr. Wise\u2019s furniture and effects from the house ? A. Well, the Misses Key was speaking of how the doctor would throw himself and break up&gt; things. Q. Miss Key was speaking of what ? A. Of how the doctor would throw himself and break up chairs, would throw himself on a chair and break it; Mrs. Kaiser said, \u2018When he breaks my things I make him get more.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mrs-. Kaiser, can you make him do anything\u2019; she said, \u2018Yes, I can make him do anything I want.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">And four or five weeks before his death the following conversation took, place between him .and Mrs. Kaiser\u2019s-father1: \u201cYou were by yourself with him in the house? A. Yes, sir. He told me \u2014 -he says \u2014 he always called me Bop\u2014 he said, \u2018Bop-, come here.\u2019 I went, there and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t you think Laura has enough in $40,000.\u2019 Q. Who said that?1 A. The doctor .said that. Q. The doctor? A. S-aid to- me. Q. S-aid \u2018Don\u2019t- you think Laura has enough with $40,000'?\u2019 A. I said, \u2018If she hasn\u2019t enough with $40,000 and the interest, she ought to hide herself. That is what I told him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">And Mrs. Kaiser accompanied him to the lawyer\u2019s- office where the- will was executed, and remained there in -an outer room until he had' executed it, and when it was executed it was placed in a safe deposit box to which she held the key.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Whether this statement of the facts relating to the issue of undue influence and fraud is true or false is entirely collateral to any question before us. In making it we have assumed the truth of all evidence .tending to support the caveator\u2019s theory that the will Was produced by fraud and undue exercise, but we have done that only because the defendant\u2019s \u201cE\u201d and \u201cD\u201d prayers, which were granted by the court, conceded the truth of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The inquiry then is are the facts stated legally sufficient to support the inference that the will was obtained by undue influence or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The law relating to testamentary disposition induced by undue influence and fraud is too Well settled to justify any extended or elaborate exposition, but the difficulty lies in determining whether a given state of facts will support an inference that such a disposition of property in a given case is the result of fraud or undue influence. The general principles controlling such an inquiry are stated in the case of <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Spiker, </em>12 Md. 301, where it was. said: \u201cUndue influence is that degree of importunity which deprives a testator of his free, agency, which is such as he is too weak to resist, and will render the instrument not his free and unconstrained act. It is closely allied to actual fraud; and like the latter, when resorted to by an adroit, and crafty person, its presence often becomes exceedingly difficult to. detect. Indeed, the more skillful and cunning the accused, and the more helpless and secluded the victim, the less, plainly defined are the badges which usually denote, it. Under such conditions, the results accomplished, the divergence of those results from the course which would ordinarily be looked for, the situation of the party taking benefits under the will towards the one who has executed it, and their antecedent relations to each other, together with all the surrounding circumstances, and the inferences legitimately dedueible from them, furnish,, in the absence of direct evidence, and often in the teeth of positive testimony to. the contrary, ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ground for concluding'' that fraud or undue influence has been resorted to and successfully employed.\u201d And what was said in that case was complemented in <em>Frush </em>v. <em>Green, </em>86 Md. 501, in which it was said: \u201cUndue influence is not, of course, every mere entreaty or pressing solicitation that may be invoked to sway the conduct or to persuade the judgment of another; but it is that degree of importunity which de\u00a1pr\u2019ives one of 'his free agency \u2014 such as he is too- weak or too feeble to resist, and ,such: as. will render the instrument exetouted under its. supremacy not his free and unconstrained act. It often closely resembles and is near akin to actual fraud, and like the latter when most cunningly employed is. exceedingly difficult to expose. From the very nature of the wrong itself, it is rare that direct evidence can be procured to unmask it, and hence the results accomplished in a gjiven ease, the divergence of' those results from the course which would ordinarily and naturally be looked for, the situation of the parties taking benefits under an instrument, alleged to be the product of its dominion towards the person who has executed that instrument, their antecedent relations to and intercourse with each other; the legitimate, but unrecognized claim\u00a9 of others upon the bounty of the one who has discarded them; their dependence upon him; his prior declaration; the instincts of justice and the promptings, of gratitude of which every unbiased mind is sensible; the natural ties of .affection, together with all the circumstances surrounding the entire transaction under investigation, and the inference legitimately dedncible from them, often furnish, even in the teeth- of directly contradictory testimony, ample ground for the conclusion that undue influence has been successfully resorted to, to accomplish an end which is .grossly unjust and whose very existence cannot be satisfactorily accounted for or explained except upon the theory that undue influence has produced it.\u201d The principles announced in these two cases have been repeatedly approved by this Court and must be regarded as the settled law of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>State. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Y. W. C. A., </em>137 Md. 360. And the statement of the law in those cases comprehends all the legal principles applicable to the facts before ns.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">While the existence of undue influence or fraud in a given ease is inconsistent with a lack of .testamentary capacity in the person whose act they are said to have affected, since the assertion that a will was procured by undue influence must assume that a will which but for such influence or fraud is valid exists, and necessarily concedes that such a person was at the time possessed of sufficient mental capacity to make a valid will <em>(Stirling </em>v. <em>Stirling, </em>64 Md. 138), yet in all cases where they are in issue, the mental and physical condition of tlie person whose act is under consideration are relevant and material, since they bear directly upon the question of what resistance such person was able to oppose to the alleged influence, coercion, or fraud which is said to have been exercised upon him, although, as we have said, in dealing with issues involving the existence of undue influence or fraud in relation to the execution of a will, it is assumed that the testator was possessed of sufficient testamentary capacity to make a valid testament. <em>Stirling </em>v. <em>Stirling, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The mere fact that a person maintained illicit relations with another in whose favor a testamentary disposition was made by such person does not in itself raise a presumption of law or of fact that such disposition was obtained by fraud or undue influence, and the general rule embodying that principle is set out in the following language in <em>Alexander on Wills, </em>par. 590: \u201cThe mere fact that illicit relations exist between a man and a woman raises no presumption of undue infl menee because of a testamentary disposition by one in favor of the other. It is not essential to a will or a deed that the motives which led to the act should be virtuous or that the object of tbe donor\u2019s bounty should be meritorious. To tbe argument that the influence of a mistress is illegal because it sprang from an unlawful relationship, it lias, been said that \u2018however reprehensible such influences, may be, if a testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>voluntarily chooses tot be actuated by them, it is a privilege he may enjoy under the law \u00a1that secures to every one alike the right to dispose of Ms property without restraint upon his own judgment 'and conscience.\u2019 \u201d But the fact that such relations existed between the decedent and the sole beneficiary under the proposed will is a fact to be considered in connection with other facts bearing upon the question, in determining the weigjht and sufficiency of evidence adduced to show .that a will wlas made as a result of undue influence or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The weigjht to be given such a fact must depend largely on the other facts wMeh accompany it, and the circumstances of each particular case1, and no more specific or definite rule than this can be formulated, that is, that while the existence of such relations between a testator and a beneficiary under his will is not in itself and by itself sufficient to support an inference that .the will was the result of fraud or undue influence, yet it is sufficient to throw suspicion upon the will and to intensify the care and diligence with which courts should examine the facts relating to the execution of it under such circumstancesi, and it may give to such facts a significance which they might not otherwise have.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In <em>Saxton </em>v. <em>Krumm, </em>107 Md. 401, in dealing, with that question it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cThe position of the appellant is .that it was competent for the jury, as matter of law, to infer the will was procured by undue influence from the testator\u2019s illicit relation with the legatee, and from the unnatural disposition of the property, which disposition is contrary to. his previously expressed purpose. To this, proposition, which was earnestly pressed upon us by the very able arguments of the appellant\u2019s counsel, we cannot assent. There appears to be a general concurrence in the authorities that neither an illicit relation, nor an unjust and unnatural disposition of the property is sufficient <em>per se </em>to warrant a conclusion of undue influence. Thev are- circumstances properly to be considered by the jury in connection with evidence of undue influence, but they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in themselves evidence1 either1 of fraud, or undue influence. Where there is evidence of external acts of fraud, or undue influence, and especially where there is evidence that the capacity of the testator was impaired, the circumstances here relied on would he of great weight, as is evidenced from the cases of <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Spiker, 11 </em>Md. 300, and <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Weik, 78 </em>Md. 439. In <em>Layman </em>v. <em>Conrey, </em>60 Md. 286, and in <em>Dalrymple </em>v. <em>Gamble et al., </em>68 Md. 523, the principle here stated is fully recognized and applied. In the latter case the Oonrt said: \u00a3A good deal was said in argument as to the relations which existed between the testator and this legatee, but assuming them to be as reprehensible and as immoral as they have been pictured, still such immoral conduct., of which they were both equally guilty, did not deprive him of the power of making a will in her favor, nor her of the right to. receive whatever property that will gave her.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cIt would be a, great inconsistency and absurdity to accord to a testator the power to dispose of his estate in any way he may think proper, consistent with the settled principles of the law, and at the same time say that, this will may be annulled, if it appears that its. disposition is unjust, inequitable, or unaccountable. The effect of such a, principle would he the practical denial of the free right of testamentary power in a very large class of oases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">And whatever may be the law elsewhere it is undoubtedly time that in this State the rule, is as stated in that case. There are decisions to the contrary, such as in the case of <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Elias, </em>186 N. Y. 371, 11 L. R. A. N. S. 554, and <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>229 Pa. St. 644, in which the existence of such relations were held sufficient, to raise a presumption of fact sufficient to warrant an inference that a testamentary disposition by one party to such a relation in favor of the other is the res nit of undue influence, but in the case referred to this Court has expressly declined to go so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Applying these principles, to the facts, stated by us., we are unable to agree with the conclusion of the trial court that there was in the case no evidence legally sufficient to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>an inference that the will was procured by undue influence. It was made, if we assume the truth of all the evidence supporting the caveators, by a man whose body had been so racked .and enfeebled by the ravages of a distressing, and exhausting disease that he was unable to care for himself, whose mind and will had become so weakened that he was unable to resist any influence exerted upon him, less 'than three weeks before his death, in favor of a woman with whom he had lived for years as his kept mistress and who completely dominated and controlled him. It was made in response to her demand that it must he made, and in it he devised and bequeathed her his whole estate, valued at. more than $200,-000, notwithstanding the fact that in his life time he had lavished upon her many valuable gifts, and notwithstanding the fact that only a short time before the decedent had asked Mrs. Kaiser\u2019s father if $10,000 was not enough for her. He had, it is true, no relatives nearer than his first cousin, Mrs. Griffith, hut his relations with her and with her daughter appear to have always been friendly and affectionate, and while it cannot be said that they had any claims upon his bounty, or that he was in any way obliged to1 consider them in the disposition of his estate, nevertheless they were his nearest blood relation and he had, if we assume the truth of certain excluded testimony which should have been admitted, expressed an intention of providing for them in his will, and the fact they werb not even referred to in his will, in connection with the other facts to which we have referred, is not without significance. While we do not mean to say that those facts or any of them exist, we do\u00a1 say that, if they exist, they .are sufficient toi justify an inference .that the will was procured through undue influence exercised upon the decedent by Mrs. Kaiser, because it may well be inferred from them that but for such influence it would not have been executed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In regard' to the issue involving fraud, it is sufficient to say that the record contains no&gt; evidence legally sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>to have warranted its submission to a jury, and we find no error in the ruling on the prayer relating to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Gaming next to those exceptions involving the rulings of the trial court on matters of evidence, we will only consider those which relate to the issue of undue1 influence, since! for reasons already stated the exceptions relating to the other issues are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In the examination of Miss Alice Griffith, she Was asked this question: \u201cDo you know * * * as a matter of fact hy family history, what estate Dr. Wise received from his mother?\u201d An objection to that question was sustained and that ruling, which is the subject of the first exception, is obviously correct, since \u201cfamily history\u201d could not well he accepted as the best evidence of the extent and value of an estate. But the caveator then made this offer: \u201cWe offer to prove hy this witness, Miss Griffith, that Dr. Wise received from Ms mother an estate of approximately $60,000 and also, through his mother, from his aunt, Margaret Hays, his mother\u2019s sister, an estate of approximately $80',000, and that this constituted the substantial hulk and corpus of the estate which he left at the time of his death,\u201d and upon the defendants\u2019 objection the court overruled that offer, and that ruling is the subject of the second exception. By overruling that offer, the court in effect conceded that the witness if permitted could prove1 the facts embodied in it, and the only question open is whether such facts are relevant and material to the issue which the jury had been sworn to try. In <em>Underhill on Wills, </em>page 188, it is said: \u201cIn all oases where the procurement of a will by undue influence or fraud is alleged, the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, should be permitted to take a very wide rangei. The nature of the relations and dealings between the testator and the beneficiaries, the extent of the property of the tstator, His social and commercial standing, his family connections, the claims of particular persons upon his bounty, the situation of the beneficiaries, social and pecuniary, the1 situation and the mental condition of the testator, the nature and the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>will itself, and all the circumstances under which it was-executed, may be considered as facts from which fraud and undue influence may be inferred, or by which they may be disproved,\u201d and in <em>Alexander on </em>Wills, page 910, the rule is stated in this language: \u201cTo ascertain when coercion and consequent subversion of intention exist requires a very extended and refined inquiry in a probate case, and for this reason the courts allow great latitude on an issue of undue influence. The financial worth of a contestant is admissible to show why he did not receive a larger share. It has been said that when the issues before the jury are fraud and undue influence, any evidence, however slight, tending to prove the .issues, is admissible.\u201d The facts embodied in the offer were material both as reflecting upon the business character and ability of the decedent, as well as upon the influences which affected him in disposing of his property. It required less acumen and . business ability to hold property acquired through the bounty of others than to accumulate it through \u25a0 his own efforts, just as. it would have been natural in disposing of such property to at least consider in connection with the other circumstances affecting him the source from which the property came. Such facts had not, it is true, any conclusive force, but they did have some weight, and the caveator's were entitled to have them considered by the jury together' with all the other facts in the case. What has been said in reference to this exception also, applies to the eighty-eighth, eighty-ninth, and ninetieth exceptions which were taken to the action of the trial court in excluding evidence tending to show the source from which the property possessed by Dr. Wise at the time of his death came1, and that evidence also should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In the' course of the examination of Miss Alice Griffith, she was asked this question: \u201cHow, then, tell the facts of the relationship! of your Aunt Ellen to your mother .and yourself during her lifetime, and the disposition of her property, and then what did Dr. Wise state, if anything, about it?\u201d The court sustained .an exception to that question and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>caveator then made this offer: \u201cWe offer to. prove by this witness, Miss Griffith, that after the death of her mother\u2019s aunt, Ellen Matthews, in 1907, Dr. Wise frequently remarked upon the failure of Aunt Ellen Matthews to- leave-all her estate to Mrs. Griffith, as .she during her- lifetime, and as Dr. Wise knew and remarked, she had repeatedly declared she intended to; that on one occasion, when that matter was again the subject of discussion, in the year 1908, Dr. Wise stated that the fact that Mrs. Ellen Matthews had not left her estate to Mrs. Griffith would really make no- great differ-, enee to Mrs. Griffith, because his own mother before her death had requested him to leave the estate,, which he might receive from her, to Mrs. Griffith and her daughters, and that he, Dr. Wise, intended to leave- to- them, Mrs. Griffith and her daughters, substantially his whole estate.\u201d The, court overruled that offer, and those rulings are the subject of the fourth and fifth exceptions. During the redirect, examination of this witness, she was asked this question: \u201cHow, Miss Alice, with reference to that, Mr. Dinneen asked you whether he had said anything of that sort to, you before, and in answer to- that- you replied he had given you a very definite promise he-fo-re. Tell the jury what that promise was?\u201d An objection to that question was -sustained, and that ruling is the subject of the ninth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The general rule is that declarations of a testator, whose will is attacked on the ground that it was procured by undue influence, indicating an intention to make- a disposition of his property different from that made in the will, are always relevant, as reflecting upon his mental condition at the time he made such statements,, when they are not too, remote in point of time. The general principle controlling the admissibility of such evidence: is stated in <em>Alexander on Wills, </em>pp. 920 to 923, as follows: \u201cDeclarations of a testator, not part of the <em>res gestae, </em>are- not admissible either to prove- or disprove any statement, of fact, contained in them, nor for the purpose of showing thei exercise of undue influence. But undue influence- is associated with testamentary capacity, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>strong and vigorous mind being better able and more likely to resist .any influence than one which is we\u00e1k and vacillating. For such reason\u00ae declarations of a testator, either before or after the execution of the will, are admissible because from a fair inference from .all tbe circumstances such declarations show the party\u2019s mind at the time the will was executed, his susceptibility to the influence, and his relations with those around him and the persons1 who are the beneficiaries of bis bounty. Where mental capacity is involved, as upon the issue of undue influence, it is only necessary that the declarations testified to should be sufficiently near in point of time so as to be of value in determining the matter in issue. The question of remoteness is one for the court to' determine according to all the circumstances of the case, and the weight of the testimony is to be governed according to the facts. * * * On the issue- of undue influence two elements are involved: (1) The conduct of the party charged with exercising the influence, 'and (2) the mental state of the testator as affected by such influence which may require a disclosure of his strength of mind and of his purpose as to the disposition of his property. * * * While declaration\u00ae of a testator are not sufficient to establish the fact of undue influence, they are admissible to show* its extent and effect.\u201d And in 28 <em>R. C. L. </em>page 107, where it is said: \u201cOn the issue of undue influence declarations of a testator are admissible in evidence when they are part of the <em>res gestae, </em>but it i\u00ae not essential that statement\u00ae made by him should be of the <em>res gestae </em>to render them admissible, though their value as evidence diminishes in pro-portion as they are remote from the date of the will. It is a generally recognized rule that they may be introduced in evidence to show the state- of -the testator\u2019s mind, as, for example, to show that he felt that he was obliged to make the will in question to keep peace in the family.\u201d And the principles thus stated have been frequently applied by this Court. <em>Grill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>113 Md. 634; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>68 Md. 338, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Applying these principles to the facts involved in these exceptions, there was error in overruling the caveator\u2019s offer, which is the subject of the fifth exception. The questions which are the subject of the fourth aud ninth exceptions are not in proper form, and the objections to them were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The ninety-second, ninety-third, ninety-fourth, ninety-seventh, ninety-eighth, ninety-ninth, and one hundred and first exceptions refer to*the testimony of Mrs. Catherine Hays Griffith. Through the questions involved in those exceptions the caveator sought to prove, (1) the relations between her and her daughter and Dr. Wise, aud (2) the fact that he had some twelve or fourteen years before told her of his intention in respect to disposing of his property. This testimony was relevant and should have been admitted, unless the witness was disqualified under the- terms of article 35, section 3, C. P. G. L. Md. But it was held in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>131 Md. 508, 510, that that statute did not apply to parties to a caveat to a will. In that case this Court, speaking through Chief Judge Boyd, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\"Thomas Hamilton, one of the caveators, was called by them. He testified without objection to a number of things and was afterwards asked: 'Did you ever hear any conversation between your father and Charlie after Charlie came there in March in regard to the property?\u2019 He answered: 'Yes, sir\u2019; and tiren was asked: 'Just tell the jury about the conversation; where it took place \u00a1and what was said?1\u2019 'Charlie\u2019 is the appellant. lie is the executor and sole devisee and legatee named in the will, and was, by the order of the orphans\u2019 court, made defendant, and the appellees, who were the caveators, were made plaintiffs in the trial of the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\"The appellant\u2019s objection is based on the contention that Thomas Hamilton was not a competent witness under section 3 of article 35 of the Code. He was undoubtedly competent to testify to what Charlie said, and what his father said to Charlie could not possibly have injured the appellant, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>did not reflect upon the question of testamentary capacity and rather tended to show that he was not susceptible to undue influence. Beyond that no authority has been cited to sustain tbe appellant\u2019s position \u2014 that he was incompetent. The. practice in this State has been to permit the caveators and caveatees to testify on the trial of issues framed on caveats to wills. They are not proceedings \u2018in which judgments! or decree may be rendered for or .against them,\u2019 as no judgment is entered in the law court where they are tried. Other reasons might be given for not applying the statute-to the trials of issues on caveats to wills but as such is the established practice, and our reports show that caveators and caveatees have been without question permitted to testify since the present statute was passed, we do not deem it necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In addition to what is said there, it is apparent that the reason for the statute does not exist in such cases. The statute was intended to prevent one party to a transaction from testifying to the acts and declarations of a decedent whose acts 'are under consideration in a proceeding to which the witness is a party, to enforce obligations arising from such transactions. In our opinion therefore the witness, should have been permitted to answer these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In regard to tbe remaining exceptions it is sufficient to say that after examining them carefully, we have discovered no harmful error in any of the rulings involved in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">This brings us to the question presented by the second appeal. In connection with the question presented by that appeal we have been referred to' the entire record in the case, but .after a very careful examination of it, it is- not necessary in our opinion to giive any detailed or extended analysis of its contents. By that appeal we are asked to review the action of the lower court in granting a new trial as to the third issue, which involved the testamentary capacity of the testator at the time he executed the will in question, and the argument of the appellant amounts to a request that we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>disregard and overrule the eases decided by this- Court in which it has been held that the action of a. trial court in granting or refusing a new trial is within the discretion of such court and will not be reviewed on appeal. In <em>Archer </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Md. 460, it was said: \u201cIn, civil oases no hills of exceptions have been ever allowed on motions for new' trials, and the rulings of courts upon such motions are entirely within their discretion, and from them no- appeal lies to this Court. <em>Sauer </em>v. <em>Schulenberg, </em>33 Md. 289; <em>Balto. City Pass. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>35 Md. 249, 250; <em>Sittig </em>v. <em>Birkestack, </em>38 Md. 165; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. </em>Co., 33 Md. 481. The bill of exceptions not being properly before this Court, and the ruling of the circuit court upon the motion for a new trial, not being subject to review by this Court, this appeal,, so far as that motion is concerned, must be dismissed.\u201d And' what was said there was affirmed in the later oases of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>135 Md. 382, and <em>Myers </em>v. <em>State, </em>137 Md. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The appeal constitutes an attack on the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>on the somewhat nebulous ground that principles, of abstract justice require that those decisions, should he dis\u00a1regarded because of the peculiar exigencies of the case before us. But we are not at liberty to consider any such appeal. The doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is a part, of our judicial system, and it rests upon the principle, that the law by which men are governed should he fixed, definite and known, and that when it is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to construe it, such declaration, in the absence of palpable mistake or error, is itself evidence of the law until it is changed by competent authority. The rule which we have stated was announced by our predecessor's after a full and careful consideration of the principles which it invokes, and' has been affirmed again and again, and must be regarded as controlling in this. case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">But even if we were at liberty to review the ruling of the sourt involved in the second appeal and the evidence relating to it, it may he said that, after a very careful examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of it, we have discovered nothing in it which would warrant us in holding that the conscientious and learned judge who tried this ease in the lower court acted arbitrarily or that he abused the discretion vested in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">From what hasi been said it follows that tire rulings involved in the appeal in Ho: 77 on the Docket of the October Term, 1923, of this Court will be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, while the appeal in Ho. 78 on that Docket will be dismissed with costs to the appellees, the cost of volume 3 of the record in the combined appeals to be taxed as part of the costs in Ho: 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Some point was made by the appellants that the record in these cases is unnecessarily large&gt; and in violation of rules 4, 5 and 6, of this Court, in that it included much matter irrelevant to the questions presented by the appeals, such as colloquies between court and counsel, remarks of counsel, and the like. That objection is undoubtedly well taken, but since, in the absence of any -specific or definite statement of what part or proportion of the record is extraneous and irrelevant, it would impose a burden upon this Court which, would seriously interfere with its discharge of the imperative duties imposed upon it, if it were to undertake the additional duty of segregating from the records in cases before it such parts of them as were extraneous or irrelevant, and since -counsel have not, except in the most general way, indicated those parts of the record which are unneces^sary to a consideration of the question\u00ae before us, that objection will not be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\"><em>Rulings in No. </em>77 <em>on the Docket of the October Term, </em>1923, <em>reversed and case remanded for a new trialj the appeal in No. </em>78 <em>on the Docket of the October Term, </em>1923, <em>dis&lt;missed with costs to the appellees, the costs to include the cost of Volume </em>3 <em>of the record \\in the combined appeals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>On motion for modification of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The motion for a modification of the opinion in this case must he overruled. The reasons! for the motion are not definitely stated hut may he inferred from the following statements which it contains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">(1) \u201cThe demurrer prayers in this ease conceded that the statements attributed by the caveatrix\u2019s witnesses to Mrs. Kaiser and to the testator had been made. That concession, however, did not go to the extent of admitting as facts the truth of such statements. Necessarily, therefore, any deduction made from the premise that all of the admissions charged by caveatrix\u2019s witnesses against Dr. Wise and Mrs. Kaiser were in point of fact true is, in the nature of things, erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The point of this contention is not altogether dear. It is an essential rule both of law and of logic that a prayer which challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence in a given case to- justify the hypothesis that certain, controverted facts exist.,' must concede the truth of all the evidence in the case which tends to establish such facts, together with any inference which may he legitimately and naturally drawn therefrom, regardless of whether such evidence is or is not contradicted. That rule has been so often stated that citation of authority in support of its is scarcely needed, hut for illustration, reference may he made to the following' cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\"><em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>45 Md. 144, in which it is held that such a prayer cannot be granted without assuming the truth of all the evidence given by the adverse party, although contradicted by the evidence of the party asking for such, instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\"><em>Merchants &amp; Miners Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Story, </em>50 Md. 4, in which it is decided that to sustain a prayer denying the right of a plaintiff to recover, there must not only he proof to- support the hypothesis of the prayer, hut the facts stated must constitute a complete bar to the action, notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>truth of all the facts in the cause, and a-11 inferences fairly deducible therefrom; and in</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><em>Leopard </em>v. <em>Ches. &amp; Ohio Canal, </em>1 Gill, 222, which decides that before the court can grant such an instruction it must assume the truth of all the testimony given to the jury tending to sustain his right to recover and all inferences of fact fairly deducible therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Other cases might be cited but these are sufficient to illustrate what we have said.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">(2) The second point is presented in the following statement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201cUnder point 2 this Court, in effect, says that the evidence under the 'undue influence and fraud issues, conceded for demurrer purposes to be true, establishes the fact that Mrs. Kaiser exercised a controlling and dominating influence over him (the testator) which he was unable to resist, and it was as a result of that influence that he made the will * * * in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">\u201c* * <em>* </em>In the instant case the statement is made by this Court as a conclusion of fact: (1) that the testator was \u2018easily influenced\u2019; (2) that Mrs. Kaiser \u2018exercised a controlling and dominating influence over him,\u2019 and (3) that \u2018as the result of that influence (which would exclude every other factor from consideration) he made the will * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201cIt is respectfully but earnestly submitted that the language in question should be modified. That request is made, not merely for the purposes of the instant case, but in order that an unfortunate precedent may not be set. The evidence from which the Court drew the stated inference was that of two or more colored women and a white one, who testified as to certain statements which Mrs. Kaiser made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">What has been -said in reference to the first point also applies with equal force to this, and it is sufficient to add that when the will involved in this case was attacked on the ground that Mrs. Kaiser procured its execution by undue influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>exercised and practiced npon the testator, it is not apparent why her admissions concerning the nature and extent of her influence over him should not he regarded as evidence of that fact, and it is difficult to see how that principle can be affected by the consideration that the witnesses who gave the evidence as to' the statements were \u201ctwo or more colored women and a white woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">It seems hardly necessary to add that, in dealing with facts relating to- the propositions presented by the prayers challenging the legal sufficiency of the evidence1 in the case to show undue influence, we did not and could not decide that those facts had actually been established in the case, but we did decide and meant to decide that the existence of such facts could have been inferred from evidence in the ease, the truth of which for the purposes, and only for the purposes, of considering those prayers, we assumed as a necessary postulate of the propositions submitted by the prayers., and while to. iterate and reiterate principles so obvious seems unnecessary, nevertheless in the opinion it is explicitly stated that the existence <em>vel non </em>of the facts referred to was only assumed for the purposes, of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Our attention has been called to the award of costs in these eases. The allowance in Ho. 77 was inadvertent and has been corrected, but the allowance in Ho. 78 will be allowed, to stand, since in that case the Oourt was not dealing with an appeal from the rulings of the lower court made in the trial of issues from the orphans\u2019 court, but with the limits of its own jurisdiction. <em>Kamps </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>133 lid. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Motion for modification of opinion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Filed January 31st, 1924.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
