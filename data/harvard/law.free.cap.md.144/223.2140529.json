That he is engaged in the business of <em>selling the use of motor vehicles </em>to reputable persons duly licensed to drive the same, and that on or about the 17th day of January, 1923, for the purpose of engaging in such business in the City of Baltimore, State of Maryland, he leased the premises known as Nos. 1723-1725 North Charles Street, in the City of Baltimore, State of Maryland, for a period of five years, at and for the rental of fifty-four hundred and twenty dollars ($5420.00) per year, all of which will more fully appear by reference to the lease of said premises from \u00a5m. J. Myers, Inc., et al., to your orator attached hereto marked Complainant\u2019s Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and prayed to be taken as part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">\u201cSecond. That in preparation for the conduct of his business in the City of Baltimore, your orator assembled at the aforesaid premises, and now has there eleven pneumatic tired motor vehicles of the character and kind known as touring cars and sedans, and has ordered and made a cash deposit for fifteen additional similar motor vehicles to be used here for the same purpose, deliveries of which are expected within a short time. That all of said eleven motor vehicles on hand at your orator\u2019s place of business have been properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>registered at the office of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, and license tags, registration cards and titles have been issued for same in your orator\u2019s trade name, \u2018Drive It Yourself Company,\u2019 as owner, all of which is well known to the said E. Austin Baughman, who is the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of Maryland, his deputies, assistants, agents and employes. That in anticipation of carrying on his said business your orator engaged, and has in his employ at high wages, two additional employes expert in this business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThird. That your orator opened his aforesaid place of business and <em>began selling the use </em>of his said motor vehicles on January 22, 1923. That every person desiring to use one of your orator\u2019s motor vehicles is required to fill out and sign in his own handwriting a card giving your orator information, among other things, as to his full name, home address, the number of his operator\u2019s license, his place of employment, references, and other matters essential to his identification as a proper person to be allowed the use of one of your orator\u2019s motor vehicles. In addition, every such applicant is required to exhibit to your orator, or his representatives, the license carried by such person entitling him to operate a motor vehicle within the State of Maryland. A sample of the identification card required to be filled out as described above is filed herewith marked Complainant\u2019s Exhibit \u2018B\u2019 and prayed to be taken as part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cFourth. That every person desiring to use one of your orator\u2019s motor vehicles is <em>required to enter into a written agreement </em>under which a charge is made by your orator of twelve cents (12c) per mile in the case of certain kinds of motor vehicles and eighteen cents (18c.) per mile in the case of other kinds of motor vehicles for each mile that said motor vehicles, or any of them, are. used. A deposit of fifteen dollars ($15) or twenty-five dollars ($25), depending on the make of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the motor vehicle to he used, is required from each person entering into a contract for the use of same as a guarantee against loss by damage to the motor vehicle while in possession of the person who contracts for the use of the same. A sample of the form of agreement referred to above is filed herewith marked Complainant\u2019s Exhibit \u2018C\u2019 and prayed to be taken as a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cEifth. That your orator had been in the business described herein for a period of two days when he was notified by E. Austin Baughman, Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, the defendant, and by deputies representing said Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, that a business of the nature and character conducted by your orator was not, in their opinion, permitted under the Motor Vehicle Laws of the State of Maryland, and that the defendant, under the duty imposed upon him by Section 136 of Article 56 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, title \u2018Licenses,\u2019 sub-title \u2018Motor Vehicles,\u2019 intended to exercise every effort to prevent the carrying on of such business, and to enforce what the defendant conceived to be the Motor Vehicle Law of the State, and to that end advised your orator that a continuance of the aforesaid business would result in your orator\u2019s arrest and in the arrest of each and every person found by the defendant, his deputies, assistants, agents and employes, engaged in operating one of your orator\u2019s cars under agreements such as have been above referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cSixth. That your orator has been engaged in the same business as described herein for a period of three years in the City of Washington, District of Columbia, and that other individuals, firms and corporations are engaged in the same or similar businesses in almost all of the large cities in the United States. Your orator has complied with all of the provisions of the law relating to the proper registration and titling of motor vehicles, and has offered to comply with any additional rules or regulations or classifications to which the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>fondant may believe he can be properly subjected, but the defendant has declined to allow your orator to continue to conduct his business, except under provisions of law which are manifestly not applicable to your orator\u2019s business, and with which it is impossible to comply. The defendant has advised your orator that under the provisions of Section 134 of Article 56 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, title 'Licenses,\u2019 subtitle 'Motor Vehicles,\u2019 every person who pays your orator for the use of a motor vehicle must be regarded for the purpose of the Motor Vehicle Laws as the owner of such motor vehicle; and that such person, therefore, is required to obtain a new set of registration tags or markers, a new registration certificate, and also to have the title of such motor vehicle transferred to the name of such person under the provisions of Section 157 of Article 56 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, title 'Licenses,\u2019 sub-title 'Motor Vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cIn practically every case in which a motor vehicle owned by your orator is used in accordance with the agreement above referred to the use extends only for a period of four or five hours and, at the most, one day. In rare instances motor vehicles are allowed to he used for two or three days and never for a period as long as a week. The attempt made by the defendant to require each person desiring to use a motor vehicle for a period of a few hours to surrender the license tags or markers now attached to yonr orator\u2019s motor vehicles and to purchase new tags, thus paying double for a portion of a quarterly period of use under the Motor Vehicle Laws; and to require the transfer to such person of a certificate of title, with the payment of the consequent fee, is necessarily prohibitive of the business in which your orator is engaged and is not justified by any provision of the Motor Vehicle Laws of the State. That your orator is advised and, therefore, alleges, that he is entitled by law to conduct his business in the manner in which he has heretofore conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the same as outlined above, and that the requirements of the defendant are unlawful and unwarranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cSeventh. That on account of the action of the defendant here, his deputies, assistants, agents and employes, and their threats to arrest your orator, and to arrest each and every person who contracts for the use of the motor vehicles owned by your orator, it has been impossible for your orator to continue to do business, as no one can be expected to contract with him under threat of arrest; and it has, therefore, become necessary for your orator to close his place of business pending the determination of your orator\u2019s right to do business as aforesaid. That your orator\u2019s property in the aforesaid lease and the aforesaid motor vehicles is lying idle and unremunerative and his rights therein are being seriously and irreparably damaged. That if the defendant is not restrained from ordering the arrest of your orator, and of all persons who may use his motor vehicles under the agreement above referred to, your orator\u2019s business will be destroyed and rendered worthless and a multiplicity of criminal proceedings, not only against your orator, but against a number of other persons over whom he has no control, will result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cEighth. That your orator has no adequate remedy at law against the threatened action of the defendant, his deputies, assistants, agents and employes, since your orator\u2019s arrest, and the arrest of each and every one of his customers, will impair his standing in the community and ruin his opportunities for conducting his business in the City of Baltimore, and will compel each of the parties arrested to defend themselves in each of the criminal proceedings which the defendant has threatened to institute. That your orator is being deprived of the use of his property and the opportunity of conducting a lawful business therewith, and of making a livelihood therefrom, and that he is entitled to the interposition of a court of equity by the writ of injunction to prevent such interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The prayer of the hill was that complainant\u2019s right to conduct his business as aforesaid he established and that the defendant and al'1 persons acting under him be restrained by injunction from interfering with the complainant, his representatives or employees in the1 conduct of his. business, so long as he shall conduct the same iu the name set out in the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Perhaps the most satisfactory as well as the most concise way to state the position of appellant is to set out the demurrer in full. It is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201cThe defendant, E. Austin Baughman, files herewith his demurrer to the hill of complaint heretofore filed against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201c1. And the said E. Austin Baughman demurs to said hill of complaint and each paragraph thereof and for cause of demurrer shows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c(a) That no facts are alleged which entitle the defendant to any relief in equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c(h) That in accordance with the Motor Vehicle Law of Maryland, Section 134-, any person, association or corporation having the exclusive use of an automobile under contract is the owner thereof within the meaning of the sub-title \u2018Motor Vehicles.\u2019 That in accordance with Section 142 upon the transfer of ownership of any motor vehicle, its certificate of registration and the plates and/or markers aforesaid shall expire, and the registration markers shall be removed at the time of transfer or possession unless said owner shall give the purchaser written permission to use said markers for a period of five days. That after said five days have expired, it shall he the duty of the <em>purchaser </em>to remove said markers promptly and return them either to the original owner of the motor vehicle or the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, and it shall he unlawful for the purchaser or any person other than the person to whom such markers were originally issued to have the same in Ms possession after the expiration of such five days whether in use or not, provided, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in the case of a transfer of ownership, the original owner may register another vehicle under the same number upon the payment of a fee of $1.00, etc., etc. The contemplated business and methods set out in said bill of complaint are in direct violation of the sections of the motor vehicle law above set forth. That Section 157 of the Motor Vehicle Law provides that in the event of the sale or transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle to which an original certificate of title has been issued as aforesaid, the original holder of such certificate shall endorse on the back, etc., etc., and deliver the same to the purchaser or transferee at the time of the delivery to him of such motor vehicle. The purchaser or transferee shall then present such certificate assigned as aforesaid to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, etc., etc. That the contemplated conduct of business is in direct violation of said Section 157 of said Motor Vehicle Law, and is an attempt to avoid the payment of the fee set out in said section. That as the method of business set out in said bill of complaint is unlawful, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">With the hill of complaint was filed as an exhibit the form of receipt taken by appellee on hiring car\u2019s, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cDrive It Yourself Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">1725 Morth Charles Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Baltimore, Md.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201cReceived in good order from the Drive It Yourself Co., herein referred to as the lessor, one automobile described hereon, which I agree to return in the same good order except for ordinary wear.

The transaction, as appears from the whole case, is really a hiring, in which the user of the car has possession and control of the car for a brief period. Ac cording, to the averment of the bill, \u201cin practically every case * * * this use extends only for a period of four or five hours and, at the most, one day. In rare instances motor vehicles are delivered to ha used for two or three days and never for a period as long as a week.\u201d The said control however1 is by1 the terms of the agreement liable to be terminated at any time by the appellee. The question to he decided is: When a motor vehicle is hired under a written agreement which gives the party in temporary possession exclusive control of the motor vehicle for a short period of time, not exceeding two or three days, but co-extensive with the period of hiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(unless the use be sooner terminated by tbe true owner) is the person to whom the vehicle is hired the <em>owner </em>for the purposes of registration, titling, etc., under the provisions of the Code, art. 56, section 134, <em>et seq. </em>? Onr answer to that is, Vo.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In <em>Berry on Automobiles </em>(3rd ed.), section 255, cited by appellant, it is said: \u201cA statute requiring the \u2018owner or custodian\u2019 of an automobile to register the same within a certain number of days after \u2018acquiring;\u2019 it, has reference to persons having an independent and permanent interest in an automobile, and does not include a servant or a person having only temporary control thereof.\u201d It is a cardinal principle, that statutes must be construed reasonably and with reference to tbe purposes sought to be accomplished by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Section 134 of article 56 of the Code defines \u201cowner\u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018owner\u2019 shall include any person, firm, association or corporation owning a motor vehicle or having the exclusive use thereof under contract of purchase, lease, hiring or rental thereof or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">To bold that the Legislature meant to include in this definition a person hiring an automobile for a few hours or days, would impute to it an intention to prohibit the use of such a vehicle by any one whose possession w'as to- continue for only such a short time, for obviously it would be impracticable, or at least unreasonable, to require registration or titling by such a person It would, of course, equally prohibit the business, of owning automobiles for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">If such had been the intention of the Legislature it is. natural to suppose that it would have expressly made unlawful the business of hiring motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">In cur opinion the further provision in section 134, that \u201cthe Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall have authority in <em>disputed </em>cases to determine the extent of the applicability of the definitions herein contained\u201d was not intended to apply to a case such as this; for it cannot be assumed that the word \u201cdisputed\u201d was intended as here used to mean anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>more than \u201cdoubtful,\u201d otherwise we would be imputing to the Legislature an intention to give the official an arbitrary discretion. <em>Goldsworthy </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, </em>141 Md. p. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We have examined carefully the authorities cited by appellant and find in none of them anything in conflict with the views above expressed. They deal with entirely different states of fact. The true principle in all of them is that statutes must be so construed as to give effect to the manifest intention of legislators in view of the purposes sought to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Having indicated our view as to the proper construction! of the statute involved, which does not support the contention of appellant, it will be unnecessary to discuss the question raised by appellee as to their validity, if they had to be construed in accordance with appellant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs to- appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
