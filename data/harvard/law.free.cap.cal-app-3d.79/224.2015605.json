Franklin, born November 29, 1938, sustained a cumulative trauma injury to her heart, arising out of and occurring in the course of her employment from January 2, 1957, through November 17, 1973, while employed as a registered nurse and attendant by the County of Los Angeles/University of Southern California Medical Center (County). Franklin sustained a myocardial infarct on November 17, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">On reconsideration the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) found that Franklin\u2019s heart disability established a 79 rating. The Board also found that one-half of Franklin\u2019s disability preexisted her industrial injuiy. Accordingly, the Board awarded 39'A percent disability against County, her employer, and also awarded Franklin benefits against the Subsequent Injuries Fund (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4751 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Franklin contends that there should be no apportionment and that all the disability related to her heart condition is the liability of her employer. She argues that the present apportionment is not based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>proper \u201clegal\u201d theories but rather upon \u201cmedical\u201d theories which do not rest upon the legal principles of apportionment. Franklin asserts that if there is apportionment, then the disability apportioned away from the employer\u2019s liability should be the liability of the Subsequent Injuries Fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Subsequent Injuries Fund agrees in part with Franklin and argues there is no basis for apportionment in this case and hence it has no liability since there was no preexisting disability prior to the industrial disability\u2014a necessary precondition to the imposition of liability upon it. Subsequent Injuries Fund further asserts that there is also no basis for apportionment to the natural progression of the preexisting disease (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4663) since, in order to so apportion, the preexisting condition must be actually disabling at the time of the industrial injury. In making the latter assertion, Subsequent Injuries Fund contends our Supreme Court in <em>Zemke </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 794 [69 Cal.Rptr. 88, 441 P.2d 928], has so interpreted Labor Code section 4663.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">County and its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier for the period prior to July 1, 1969, State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund), contend that the Board properly apportioned under section 4663 50 percent of Franklin\u2019s disability as nonindustrial. County and State Fund argue that in the special case of the cumulative trauma injury apportionment should be made to the various industrial and nonindustrial factors which concurrently contributed to Franklin\u2019s disability. State Fund and County also assert apportionment is justified since there is competent medical evidence that 50 percent of Franklin\u2019s disability exists irrespective of any industrial contribution. Additionally, State Fund and County contend that apportionment is justified on the grounds that if Franklin had been examined prior to her myocardial infarct restrictions would have been placed upon her regarding her heart disease. State Fund and County acknowledge the latter argument would appear to conflict with the appellate decisions in <em>Hulbert </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 634, 640 [121 Cal.Rptr. 239]; <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 397, 404-405 [118 Cal.Rptr. 609]; and <em>Amico </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Hence, the present award against Subsequent Injuries Fund cannot stand. We annul the award herein and remand to the Board for further consideration in light of the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Summary Of Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Before this court the parties agreed that Franklin sustained injury to her heart as the result of the stress and strain of her employment at County. Apportionment is the issue. Our review of the medical evidence is consequently limited to those portions pertinent to apportionment and Subsequent Injuries Fund liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Rueben Merliss, M.D., reported on behalf of Franklin. In his report of September 18, 1974, Dr. Merliss attributed Franklin\u2019s infarct to her work; he also opined Franklin at that time was totally temporarily disabled. As to the cause of her disability, Dr. Merliss stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u201cI believe that this patient\u2019s myocardial infarction is primarily due to arteriosclerosis, due in turn to her hypertension and a genetic disturbance in fat metabolism. However I believe that the infarct itself was both precipitated and aggravated by the patient\u2019s work. She gives a convincing description of hard work, which, although she was devoted to it, was quite taxing. The attack itself appeared to occur directly while the patient was working, although she might have had some symptoms of a lesser degree for some days before, also while she was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u201cConsequently I would believe that the patient\u2019s work has probably brought the attack on sooner than it would have come as a result of natural causes alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">\u201cI believe therefore that all of the disability due to this attack is industrial. . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">State Fund had Franklin examined by Alvin Markowitz, M.D. As indicated in his report of October 26, 1974, Dr. Markowitz\u2019 diagnoses were:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201c1. Disease of the heart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201ca) arteriosclerotic</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cb) healed myocardial infarction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201cc) angina pectoris</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201cd) Class III B [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Previous history of hypercholesterolemia.\u201d[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Dr. Markowitz felt that Franklin\u2019s heart condition was industrially related. However, Dr. Markowitz felt that apportionment was indicated: \u201cApportionment is appropriate. The patient had a preexisting disability. The high cholesterol was caused and accelerated as a predisposing factor to the development of coronary arteriosclerosis. It is medically probable she would have had heart disease because of this genetic defect of the high cholesterol no matter what her occupation was, and this would be a preexisting disability. Had she been examined with a treadmill test and/or coronary angiogram prior to the infarct, indeed probably several years ago she would have been found to have advanced coronary artery disease, which although asymptomatic, would have been productive of producing a disability against certain work activities and against emotional stress. I therefore feel that 75 percent of this lady\u2019s permanent disability was not related to her work, but related to her high cholesterol, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>a metabolic and genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease. But, I do feel that this patient was under emotional stress as an RN, especially since the sectioning, which has occurred at the county hospital, which has brought on added duties and does account for 25 percent of her permanent disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">County and Franklin then agreed to utilize Bernard M. Smolens, M.D., as an agreed medical examiner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Smolens found Franklin\u2019s condition permanent and stationary. Dr. Smolens went on to state; \u201cThe factors of permanent disability are loss of myocardial contractility, excessive fatigue and the subjective complaints of angina on effort. According to the Guidelines for Work Capacity,. .. she is best described by h. (Disability Resulting in Limitation to Sedentary Work). The next question is that of apportionment, which I also feel. . . , is appropriate. There is no question but that she had some cardiac disability which could have been demonstrated on a treadmill and/or coronary angiogram. There is also the question in my mind that she would have ultimately sustained a myocardial infarction but the rather severe degree of physical and emotional stress under which she worked accelerated the ultimate infarction by impinging on her decreasing cardiac reserve. As a physician who also has spent time at the USC County Medical Center, I too, find entirely credible the patient\u2019s description of her work as to physical and emotional stress and overtime. Regarding the apportionment, I would feel that 50% of her permanent disability was industrial and 50% was related to her inborne metabolic disturbance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Dr. Smolens was then cross-examined by the parties. Dr. Smolens at one point admitted he was apportioning along the lines of Dr. Markowitz, that is, had Franklin been examined by a treadmill or by an angiogram prior to her infarct she would have been placed on restrictions because of her coronary artery disease. Dr. Smolens then testified that based upon reasonable medical probability Franklin would have had 50 percent of her present disability irrespective of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>industrial contribution. Dr. Smolens also opined that within a reasonable medical certainty Franklin would anyway have had her infarct within three years from the time she actually had it even if she had not worked for the County. However, Dr. Smolens admitted that prior to the infarct, Franklin\u2019s preexisting heart disease was not causing her any incapacity to work and from a subjective point of view she had no total or partial loss of function of her body prior to her infarct.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The question here is whether substantial evidence supports the decision of the Board on apportionment and the correlative issue of Subsequent Injuries Fund liability. <em>(LeVesque </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 637 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432]; see also, <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978]; <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451]; <em>Redmond </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 302, 305 [111 Cal.Rptr. 530].)  In resolving the issue of apportionment, the Board must rely on expert medical opinion. An expert\u2019s opinion, however, which does not rest upon relevant facts or which assumes an incorrect legal theory cannot constitute substantial evidence upon which the Board may base an apportionment finding. <em>(Zemke </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 794, 798; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 786, 791; <em>Amico </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 592, 604-605; <em>Redmond </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d 302, 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Accordingly, this court must examine whether the facts and the medical evidence establish apportionment in accord with proper legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">A. <em>Apportionment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u201cThe statutes governing apportionment generally are Labor Code sections 4663 and 4750. Their purpose and limitations are cogently stated in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>28 Cal.App.2d 682, 684 [83 P.2d 295]: \u2018[T]he Industrial Accident Commission [now the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board] is not authorized, in computing the percentage of permanent disability of an employee caused by an industrial injury, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>include any percentage of such disability attributable to a prior industrial or nonindustrial disease or injury; nor is it justified in including in an award any amount as compensation for the disability attributable solely to the prior injury or disease and for which the employment was in no wise responsible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Quick) </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 681, 684 [16 Cal.Rptr. 359, 365 P.2d 415].) (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">1. <em>Lack of Substantial Evidence to Support Apportionment Pursuant to Section 4750.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Section 4750 provides: \u201cAn employee who is suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment and sustains permanent injury thereafter shall not receive from the employer compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment. The employer shall not be liable for compensation to such an employee for the combined disability, but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cThis section has been interpreted to mean that, \u2018An employer [or his insurer] of a workman who has a permanent physical impairment and who thereafter sustains a compensable injury resulting in permanent disability, is not liable for compensation for the ensuing combined disabilities, but only for that portion of permanent disability which is caused by the last injury.\u2019 <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>44 Cal.2d 364, 365 [282 P.2d 64]. See also <em>Edson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>206 Cal. 134, 138-139 [273 P. 572].) The purpose of this statutory provision is to encourage the employment of physically disabled persons by assuring an employer that he will not be liable for the total combined disability present after an industrial injury, but only for that portion which is attributable to the subsequent industrial injury.

(5) The previous condition, as to which apportionment is sought, must be actually \u201clabor disabling.\u201d <em>(Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Allen), supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 842, 845-846; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 469, 477; <em>Bookout </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 214, 229 [132 Cal.Rptr. 864].) \u201cWhile the permanent partial disability need not have existed prior to work exposure <em>(Dow Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>[67 Cal.2d 483,] fn. 9 at p. 495) nor need it be of industrial origin, known to the claimant at the time of the subsequent injury, or the subject of a prior rating <em>(Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 56, 62 [84 Cal.Rptr. 140, 465 P.2d 28]), or known to the employer <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 469, 470), nevertheless it must antedate the subsequent injury <em>(Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 136, 145 [37 Cal.Rptr. 844]) and it must be permanent in character <em>(Dow Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Although the prior disability need not be reflected in the form of loss of earnings, if it is not, it must be of a kind upon which an award for partial permanent disability could be made had it been industry caused. This is necessary to distinguish [it] from a \u2018lighting up\u2019 aggravation, or acceleration of a preexisting physical condition where the employer is to be held liable for the whole. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Com., supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 469, 477-478; <em>Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.

Appeals Bd., supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 214, 229.) Further, the preexisting disability need not have interfered with the employee\u2019s ability to work at his employment in the particular field in which he was working at the time of the subsequent industrial injury. <em>(Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Allen), supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 842, 845-846; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 469, 477; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 650, 658.) The ability of the injured to carry on some type of gainful employment under work conditions congenial to the preexisting disability does not require a finding that the preexisting disability does not exist. <em>(Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Baldes) </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 392, 402 [1 Cal.Rptr. 833, 348 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">A preexisting disability cannot be established by a \u201cretroactive prophylactic work restriction\u201d on the preexisting condition placed on the injured after the subsequent industrial injury in absence of evidence to show that the worker was actually restricted in his work activity prior to the industrial injury. <em>(Hulbert </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 634, 640; <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 397, 404-405; <em>Amico </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Where the injured was actually under a prophylactic restriction for a preexisting condition at the time of the industrial injury, apportionment to a preexisting disability is proper. It is only the <em>retroactive </em>application of a prophylactic restriction to an otherwise nonexistent previous disability that is prohibited. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The prohibition against \u201cretroactive prophylactic work restrictions\u201d to establish a preexisting disability is not inconsistent with the fact that prophylactic restrictions are ratable factors of permanent disability stemming from the industrial injury. <em>(Gross, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 404.) Applying a prophylactic work restriction retroactively creates \u201ca sort of factual or legal fiction of an otherwise nonexistent previous disability or physical impairment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Apportionment involves a factual inquiry.

Here again petitioner, before her injuries, suffered from no total or partial \u2018loss of function of the body.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u201cFaced with a problem somewhat akin to ours, the court in <em>State of Cal. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 544, 551, stated: \u2018We can find neither in the original [workmen\u2019s compensation] act, nor in its present form, any indication that the Legislature intended that either the term \u201cdisability\u201d or \u201cimpairment\u201d as used therein was not to be limited to <em>actual manifest and symptomatic disabilities </em>which antedated an industrial injury.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">This analysis was later reiterated by the same court in <em>Hulbert </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 634, 640, footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">It is not possible to reconcile <em>Hulbert </em>and <em>Gross </em>with the other numerous cases cited herein on the grounds that <em>Hulbert </em>and <em>Gross </em>deal with apportionment pursuant to the already quoted section 4750 while the other cases, for the most part, deal with Subsequent Injuries Fund liability. The approach to apportionment pursuant to section 4750 should be consistent with Subsequent Injuries Fund liability since the liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the Subsequent Injuries Fund is correlated to the liability of the employer. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Hutchinson), supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 45, 55; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Appeals Bd., supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 214; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 903.) Therefore, any contention that the rules for determining a preexisting disability for the purposes of apportionment pursuant to section 4750 and for the purposes of Subsequent Injuries Fund liability differ must be emphatically rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Hulbert </em>and <em>Gross </em>suggest a narrower definition of preexisting disability in that the \u201cpreexisting disability\u201d must cause \u201cactual incapacity to perform tasks usually encountered in one\u2019s employment\u201d and that the preexisting conditions must be known to the employee and be an actual manifest and symptomatic disability. This implies that even if in other occupations the employee would have been disabled, there can be no apportionment to the preexisting condition if such condition did not cause disability in the employee\u2019s occupation at the time of the subsequent industrial injury and was unknown to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Our Supreme Court had already rejected this definition in <em>Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. (Talcott), supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 56, 62. The high court there stated: \u201cThe applicant may obtain benefits from the [Subsequent Injuries Fund] on the ground that the combination of his prior disability and the disability resulting from the subsequent injury is greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone even though he was unaware of the existence of a prior disability before he brings the compensation proceeding to collect benefits for the subsequent injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Similarly, earlier in <em>Subsequent Injuries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Allen), supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 842, 846, the high court held that a prior hearing loss, the actual existence of which was first shown by the tests of examining doctors, rendered the applicant, Allen, permanently partially disabled for the purpose of an award against the Subsequent Injuries Fund even though at the time of the subsequent injury the applicant was not aware that he was suffering from a hearing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The court at pages 845-846, stated: \u201cIt is clear that under these tests Allen\u2019s preexisting permanent partial loss of hearing was sufficient, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>circumstances, to support the finding that he was permanently partially disabled, that such disability was labor disabling even though it had not resulted in loss of earnings and had not interfered with his employment <em>in the particular field in </em>which he was then working, and that it was of a kind which could ground an award of permanent partial disability. As pointed out by the commission, a condition of substantial deafness can reasonably be expected to handicap an employe\u2019s [\u00bfv'c] ability in the general labor market to get and hold a new job, if once he should be displaced from the job he has had.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Consequently, neither the fact that the preexisting disability did not interfere with the occupation the injured was engaged in at the time of the subsequent injury nor the fact that it was unknown to him is determinative. The question is whether it can be demonstrated by competent evidence that the preexisting condition did interfere or would have actually interfered with any type of work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Accordingly, we reject the narrow view of <em>Hulbert </em>and <em>Gross </em>to the extent it is inconsistent with the better and higher authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Reviewing the medical evidence in light of the foregoing principles it is clear that the apportionment to preexisting disability is not supported by substantial evidence. Dr. Markowitz\u2019 and Dr. Smolens\u2019 statements that had they seen Franklin before the infarct they would have placed work restrictions on her is an attempt to apportion improperly via a retroactive prophylactic restriction. Neither is there any evidence that prior to the infarct the nonindustrial aspects of Franklin\u2019s heart condition had caused any medically demonstrable impairment of any bodily function. In fact, Dr. Smolens\u2019 testimony is to that she had no such impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The attempts by Dr. Smolens and Dr. Markowitz to apportion to preexisting disability suffers from a far more fundamental defect. Any possible disability existing prior to the infarct would at least in part be the result of the industrial exposure. Therefore, the preexisting disability found prior to the infarct would, in part, be merely a component part of the industrial injury itself. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 903, 915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Accordingly, the finding of preexisting disability and apportionment pursuant to section 4750 must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>2. <em>Apportionment and Section 4663\u2014Aggravation of Prior Disease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cSection 4663 of the Labor Code provides: \u2018In case of aggravation of any disease existing prior to a compensable injury, compensation shall be allowed only for the proportion of the disability due to the aggravation of such prior disease which is reasonably attributed to the injury.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cIt is settled that the section must be read in the light of the rule that an employer takes the employee as he finds him at the time of the employment. Accordingly, when a subsequent injury lights up or aggravates a previously existing condition resulting in <em>disability, </em>liability for the full disability without proration is imposed upon the employer, and the appeals board may apportion <em>the disability </em>under the section \u2018only in those cases in which part of <em>the disability </em>would have resulted, in the absence of the industrial injury, from the \u201cnormal progress\u201d \u2019 of the preexisting disease.

(2 Hanna, California Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 14.03[1], at p. 14-18.) \u2018The underlying theory is that the employer takes the employee subject to his condition when he enters the employment, and that therefore compensation is not to be denied merely because the workman\u2019s physical condition was such as to cause him to suffer a disability from an injury which ordinarily, given a stronger and healthier constitution, would have caused little or no inconvenience.\u2019 <em>(Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.

Correspondingly, to allow apportionment, the issue is what part of the total <em>present disability </em>is actually related to the natural progression of the heart disease that would be present absent industrial exposure. Accordingly, Franklin is entitled to all disability reasonably related to the industrial injury but that portion of her present disability that is actually attributable to the natural progression of the preexisting nonindustrial condition is not the liability of her employer. Thus, the mere fact that Franklin would have been disabled to a certain extent absent the industrial injury is irrelevant to the extent the present disability is, in fact, due to the industrial injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he identified \u2018cause\u2019 [of the disability] cannot be made to yield to purely hypothetical ones.\u201d <em>(Bstandig </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 988, 998 [137 Cal.Rptr. 713].) This appears to be the intent of the language of section 4663 that the employer is liable \u201cfor the proportion of the disability <em>due to the aggravation </em>of such prior disease which <em>is </em>reasonably <em>attributed </em>to the [industrial] injury.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The early Supreme Court case of <em>Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 615 [52 P.2d 215], demonstrates the correct approach. In <em>Tanenbaum </em>when the injured suffered an industrial injury she had a preexisting dormant, nondisabling, nonindustrial condition which was aggravated by the industrial injury. The injured claimed in light of the nature of the preexisting condition no apportionment was permitted. The court in <em>Tanenbaum </em>rejected the injured\u2019s contention, stating: \u201cAs we read the record in this proceeding, the petitioner is now suffering from a disability made up in part of an industrial disability growing out of the injury, including the aggravation or \u2018lighting up\u2019 of the preexisting dormant arthritic condition, and, in part, though in a lesser degree, of what may be termed a nonindustrial disability resulting from the normal progress of the preexisting arthritis. Obviously, the latter disability is not attributable to industry and should not be saddled thereon. It is this latter or nonindustrial disability, resulting from the natural and normal progress of the preexisting condition, that underlies the finding that petitioner\u2019s permanent disability is \u2018partly caused by preexisting dormant disease and partly by said injury\u2019 and requires the apportionment here made. Such apportionment finds ample support in at least one of the medical reports filed with the commission wherein it is declared, in part, that \u2018all direct effects of the injury should have passed away in a month or two, and if effects of the injury persist after a year and a half, it could partly be from an acceleration of her preexisting disease caused by the injury. I would feel that it would be fair to consider that <em>half of her disability at the present time is due to the acceleration of her arthritis from the injury and the balance is due to the natural progress of a preexisting arthritis in a person of her age.\u2019\u201d </em>(Italics in original.) [4 Cal.2d 615, at p. 618.]</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Thus, in <em>Tanenbaum </em>there was apportionment since part of the <em>existing disability </em>was not due to the industrial injury or the aggravation, acceleration, or \u201clighting up\u201d of the preexisting condition but due to the natural progression of the preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Bowler v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1955) 135 Cal.App.2d 534, 539 [287 P.2d 562], the court correctly explains apportionment pursuant to section 4663: \u201cIf the resultant disability is due entirely to the lighting up or aggravation of the preexisting condition by the industrial injury, the employer is required to compensate for the entire disability and there can be no prorating the extent of the disability due to the accident itself on the one hand and that due to the aggravation caused by the employee\u2019s physical condition. <em>(Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>supra, </em>4 Cal.2d at pp. 617, 618.) However, if the <em>resultant disability </em>is partly due to an industrial disability growing out of the injury, including the aggravation or \u2018lighting up\u2019 of the preexisting dormant condition, and in part, of what may be termed a nonindustrial disability resulting from the normal progress of the preexisting disease or condition, then the commission must apportion the percentage of 'the disability due to the injuiy and the percentage due to the continuance of the disease apart from the injury. <em>(Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d at p. 618; see also <em>Industrial Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>95 Cal.App.2d 443, 449 [213 P.2d 11].)\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Nothing in <em>Zemke </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 794 in any way alters <em>Tanenbaum </em>and requires the preexisting condition to be symptomatic and disabling at the time of the industrial injury to apportion pursuant to section 4663. While in <em>Zemke </em>the preexisting condition was asymptomatic and nondisabling, the court did not refuse to apportion under section 4663 merely because of these factors. Rather the court in <em>Zemke </em>annulled the apportionment under section 4663 since the medical reports nowhere indicated that the injured\u2019s disability was partially \u201cdue to the natural progress\u201d of the preexisting disease. <em>(Zemke, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 800-801.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">To require for apportionment under section 4663 that the preexisting condition be symptomatic and disabling is not only erroneous under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Tanenbaum </em>and <em>Zemke, </em>but also ignores the difference in the language of section 4750 and section 4663. To apportion under section 4750 there must be a preexisting disability but not under section 4663. Any other interpretation makes the sections duplications in contravention of accepted principles of statutory construction. (See <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230-231 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; <em>Tidewater Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

Citing <em>Zemke </em>and <em>Tanenbaum, </em>the court there noted that under section 4663 the \u201cpermissible pattern of apportionment\u201d involved \u201cascribing a part of the [injured\u2019s] disability to the \u2018normal progress\u2019 of her [preexisting] psychological propensities.\u201d <em>(Bstandig, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 997.) Explaining it is the \u201cdisability\u201d that is apportioned rather than the medical factors which resulted in the disability <em>{ibid.), </em>the court stated: \u201c[Apportionment in terms of sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of stress is permissible only insofar as a discreet [j/c] and discernible portion of the disability can be imputed to each source.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 998.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Applying the foregoing discussion to Franklin\u2019s injury, it must be noted that there are two \u201ccomponents\u201d to Franklin\u2019s present heart disability. The first is the heart damage and continuing symptomatology related to the infarct; the second component is the disability related to the underlying heart (cardiovascular) disease (hereinafter heart disease).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">All the disability related solely to the infarct component is compensable and the liability of the employer. This is because industrial factors aggravated the heart disease and accelerated the occurrence of the infarct, which absent the industrial exposure would not have occurred when it did.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The underlying heart disease may be the result of nonindustrial causes and industrial causes. Disability related to Franklin\u2019s underlying heart disease is compensable to the extent work stress caused the heart disease. If absent industrial exposure, Franklin would not have had any heart disease which would result in medically recognizable restrictions, then there is no apportionment. That is, if Franklin merely had a preexisting propensity to heart disease which alone would not have resulted in medically determined disability absent industrial factors, then no apportionment is indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Apportionment of the disability from the heart disease is indicated where the nonindustrial aspects of the heart disease form part of the basis of the present disability. Thus, after removing that portion of the heart disease related to the stresses of employment one looks to see if the remaining nonindustrially caused heart disease would be disabling. Apportionment is then allowed to the extent that this disability makes Franklin\u2019s total disability greater than the industrial infarct disability plus the industrial heart disease disability. This does not involve improper apportionment based upon a retroactive prophylactic restriction. The doctor would not be saying had he seen the injured before the industrial injury he would have restricted her; rather the doctor is merely defining the basis of the injured\u2019s <em>present </em>disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Thus, for apportionment under section 4663, unlike under section 4750, it is irrelevant that the injured\u2019s preexisting condition was nondisabling prior to or at the time of the industrial injury. The pertinent question is whether part of the injured\u2019s present disability actually is related to the natural progression of such preexisting condition rather than the result of the industrial injury aggravating, accelerating or \u201clighting up\u201d such condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">For purposes of further clarification, the following procedure should be followed in apportioning Franklin\u2019s disability pursuant to section 4663\u2014aggravation of prior disease:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">(a) All the factors of disability resulting from the heart condition must be determined in order to ascertain the entire permanent disability. (See <em>Hegglin </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 162, 171-172 [93 Cal.Rptr. 15, 480 P.2d 967].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">(b) Determination of apportionment pursuant to section 4663.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>Step One:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">What disability is due to the infarct and its effect on the underlying heart disease? All of this disability is compensable. Here, since Dr. Smolens says the infarct would have occurred in three years absent the industrial exposure, it appears the industrial exposure accelerated the occurrence of the infarct. All the disability related to the infarct is compensable since the industrial exposure is <em>in fact </em>the cause of this aspect of the disability. If all of Franklin\u2019s present disability rating can be accounted by the disability from the infarct, then there is no apportionment of the award and the inquiry regarding apportionment pursuant to section 4663 is ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\n<em>Step Two:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">What disability does Franklin have due to the underlying heart disease irrespective of the infarct?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\n<em>Step Three:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Subtracting the industrial aggravation of the underlying heart disease, would the residual heart disease give rise to any disability? If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d there is no apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\n<em>Step Four:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">If the answer in step three is \u201cyes,\u201d then what would be the residual heart disease disability after subtracting the industrial aggravation? This disability is not the liability of the employer and should not be included in calculating the permanent disability award.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>Step Five:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The factors of infarct disability must then be \u201ccombined\u201d with the factors of the industrial portion of the heart disease to achieve a single disability rating. Simply adding the two together would obviously result in the \u201cpyramiding\u201d or \u201cduplication\u201d of the various factors of disability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The \u201cmultiple disabilities table,\u201d which is contained at page 82 of the Schedule for Rating Permanent Disabilities (for an explanation see <em>Mihesuah </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

First, in <em>Baker </em>the court applied the erroneous \u201cany substantial evidence\u201d test in reviewing the apportionment. As held in <em>LeVesque </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.
