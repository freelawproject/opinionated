J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-I\">The defendant, Jordan, demurred to the complaint in this action, and such demurrer was overruled and an order entered on March 10, 1887, which, after reciting the interposition of demurrer and the trial thereof, read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cIt is ordered that said demurrer be and the same hereby is overruled, and that plaintiff have judgment thereon with costs, but with leave to the said defendant, Mary A. Jordan, to answer within twenty days on payment of costs, the said costs to be adjusted by the clerk of this court; and that thereupon an interlocutory judgment be entered herein, in accordance with the terms of this order as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On March 12, 1887, an interlocutory judgment was entered without notice, whereby, after reciting the previous proceedings, the entry of the order of March 10, 1887, (which it is said directed the entry of the interlocutory judgment) and the adjustment of the costs by the clerk, it was adjudged, that the demurrer be overruled, and that unless the defendant, Mary A. Jordan, pay the costs and answer within twenty days, the plaintiff should have final judgment against her as prayed for in the complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A motion was thereupon made to vacate and set aside the said interlocutory judgment, upon the grounds that the same did not conform to the order of March 10, 1887, in that the interlocutory judgment directs what final judgment should -be recovered, whereas the said order did not so direct; that the judgment-roll did not contain any record or recitation of record as provided in sections 1222 and 1223 of the Code of Civil Procedure; that final judgment was not directed as prescribed in section 1021 of the Code, and that the action was not one specified in section 420 of the Code. This motion being denied, an appeal was taken from the order denying the motion and also from the interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The case of Smith <em>v. </em>Rathbun (88 <em>N. Y. </em>660)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> seems clearly to decide that the practice pursued by the plaintiff -was irregular. In that case it is said that section 1021 of vthe Code of Civil Procedure provides that the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the court upon the trial of a demurrer must direct the final or interlocutory judgment to be entered thereupon; and that where it directs an interlocutory judgment with leave to the party in fault to plead anew or amend, it may also \u2022direct the final judgment to be entered if the party in fault fails to comply with any of the terms imposed ; and that section 1222 provides that final judgment upon an issue of law where no issue of fact remains to be tried, and final judgment has not been directed as provided for in section 1021, may be entered upon application to the court or by the clerk in an action specified in section 420. It is thus seen that the decision of the court must direct not merely \u2022that <em>an </em>interlocutory judgment be entered, but <em>the </em>interlocutory judgment to be entered ; that is it must fix its terms with definiteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In the case at bar, by the order embodying the decision, no such direction was given. By that order, it was simply directed that the demurrer be overruled and the plaintiff have judgment thereon, with costs, and that upon the taxation of such costs, an interlocutory judgment be entered herein, in accordance with the terms of the order aforesaid. The order contained no <em>\u201c </em>terms aforesaid.\u201d The previous provision of the order was that the plaintiff have \u201c judgment thereon with costs;\u201d what judgment the plaintiff thereon should have, with costs, is not specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The case at bar is undoubtedly one in which, upon default, application would have 'to be made under sections 1214 and 1215 of the Code, for judgment. Upon such application it would be the duty of the court to determine the precise relief to which the plaintiff would be entitled, and if the defendant had appeared, notice of such application must have been given to her and she was entitled to be heard thereon. The plaintiff would not necessarily be entitled to the relief prayed for in the complaint, but it could have judgment only for such relief as the facts alleged in the complaint entitled it to. In the case at bar, however, although the decision of the court upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>demurrer did not direct \u201cthe interlocutory judgment\u201d to-be entered, and \u2022 did not determine the precise relief to which the plaintiff was entitled, <em>an </em>interlocutory judgment has been entered directing in favor of the plaintiff final judgment against the defendant, Jordan, granting the plaintiff particular relief, viz., the relief prayed for in the complaint,, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This interlocutory judgment, therefore, attempts to fix the precise relief which the plaintiff is to obtain upon default, although the court has at no time determined the precise relief to which the plaintiff is entitled. It is urged upon the part of respondent that the clerk has power to enter judgment in any case, if directed so to do by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">But the court has not in every case legally the power to-direct the entry of judgment; and unless the provisions of the law which give the court the power to direct the entry of a judgment are complied with, the judgment so entered is irregular, and must be set aside upon a proper application made for that purposed In the case at bar the court had no-power to direct the entry of this interlocutory judgment without notice to the defendant. There is no evidence that, any notice was given to the defendant, and we may well assume that none was given because the interlocutory judgment shows upon its face that it is entered because of the-supposed direction contained in the_ order of March 10, 1887, that it should be entered, and no exercise of judicial discretion is pretended except such as was embraced in the-order of March 10; and that order does not by any means direct the entry of the interlocutory judgment in question, and nowhere determines that, under any circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">It may be suggested that upon application for final judgment after failure to comply with the terms of an interlocutory judgment, notice should be given to defendant, and that then the court could determine to what specific relief the facts alleged in the complaint entitled the plaintiff. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>is not very difficult to imagine,\u2014if upon such application the defendant should insist that the facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not entitle it to all the relief asked for,\u2014with what confidence the plaintiff would call the attention of the court to the fact that by the interlocutory judgment already entered, and which the defendant had not moved to vacate or set aside, that question had been determined.</p>\n<summary id=\"b397-10\">II. <em>April, </em>1888.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWF\">When this case was before the court upon a previous practice appeal, an endeavor was made to define, with reasonable clearness, the' steps necessary to be taken in order to perfect judgment after a demurrer to a complaint had been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">It was held that the order entered upon the overruling of the demurrer did not authorize the entry of the interlocutory judgment complained of, or any definite interlocutory judgment, and that such judgment must be set aside, because of the defects in the order overruling the demurrer. These defects the court which originally made the order had power to supply, and it proceeded to correct the errors by the resettlement of the order upon notice to the defendants. This was necessary to render the decision upon the demurrer effective. Simply because the court erred in the form of the order entered upon- the overruling of the demurrer, it was not deprived of the power to cause to be entered an order in proper form. This was all the court attempted to do, of which the defendants had due notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">It would appear from the record that the whole course, of the defense in reference to this question of practice has been to afford the court as little assistance as possible, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>get all the delay possible by objection and to give no assistance by suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The order entered seems to comply with the suggestions made upon the former appeal, and is definite and certain as to the obligations of this defendant thereunder, which is all that she can ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Beady and Daniels, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Upon the merits of the action, the opinion of the special term was as follows :</p>\n<author id=\"b400-9\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANL\">There is but one cause of action set up in the complaint\u2014that is to recover the debt due plaintiff from Cornelius Poillon, deceased, and as required by thei Code; all of the heirs at law of the debtor are parties defendant, the action being.against them jointly <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 1846). The fact that, by the consent of the heirs at law and other parties, the proceeds of certain real estate of the deceased debtor was deposited with the United States Trust Co. as a fund for the payment of any debts owing by the deceased, and that the depository of that fund, and all parties having an interest in it are made parties to this action; and plaintiff asks as further relief that such sum or some part of it should be applied to payment of plaintiff\u2019s demand does not add a new or distinct cause of action. The action is to recover the demand due' the plaintiff. The fact alleged in the complaint would justify a judgment against the heirs at law for the demand due to the plaintiff, and whether that demand is to be paid out of the fund provided for that purpose, or by judgment and execution against the heirs at law, affects the relief to be given, and does not create a new or a distinct cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The defendants all appear to have some interest in the. controversy, and are proper parties defendant under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>447 of the Code. It is not, however, a ground of demurrer, \u25a0if the defendant, against whom a good cause of action is pleaded, that there are parties defendant who are. not proper parties to the action (Nicholas <em>v. </em>Drew, 94 N. <em>Y. </em>26). The \u2022demurrer must be overruled, and judgment ordered for the plaintiff with costs, with leave to defendant to answer within \u00a1twenty days on payment of costs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b401-6\"><em>Wellesley W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">The demurrer interposed to the complaint states as grounds :</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">1st.

That it does not appear on the face of the complaint 'that said causes of action are consistent with each other, nor \u2022does it appear that they affect all the parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The allegations of the complant, so far as necessary to-\u25a0state them, seem to be about as follows : That Cornelius</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Poillon died intestate, possessed of certain real estate, leaving certain of the defendants named his only heirs at law, and owing debts to the plaintiff and certain of the defend\u2022ants. That the real estate descended to such defendants in \u25a0certain proportions named. That his personal estate was not sufficient to pay his debts, and that the plaintiff has been and will be unable with due diligence to collect said debts \u2022or any part thereof, by proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court. That subsequent to his death, the defendant Mary A. Jordan, \u25a0one of his heirs at law, brought an action to partition his real estate, which resulted in a sale thereof. That some of the purchasers at said sale refused to take title to the property purchased, unless part of the proceeds sufficient to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the creditors of said Cornelius Poillon was deposited in the-United States Trust Company, to be used for the payment of the debts of the said Poillon, and $20,000 of the proceeds of sale were deposited wjth the defendant, the United States-Trust Company, under the following agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Jordan <em>et al. v. </em>Poillon <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">It is hereby stipulated and agreed by the parties in-interest herein, that there shall remain on deposit in the United States Trust Company, to the credit of this action,, the sum of $20,000, to be considered as real estate, for the-purpose of providing for any deficiency in the assets in the hands of the administratrix of Cornelius Poillon, deceased,, with which to pay any lawful, claims of creditors of said Cornelius Poillon, deceased, for which the real estate of said Cornelius Poillon is or may be liable, or for the payment of which his real estate could be sold or applied, and the referee is hereby authorized and empowered to make-such deposit accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Said amount shall'not be withdrawn, except upon application to the court, and on notice to the purchasers and all parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Dated March 8, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Wellesley W.

That the United States Trust Company is made a party because-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>it is the stakeholder. That certain of the defendants, naming them, are the purchasers referred to and entitled to notice of any claim made against the money in the trust company, and for that reason are made parties. That certain other of the defendants, naming them, being the heirs at law of said Poillon, and the executor of a deceased heir, claim the fund \u25a0as owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Judgment is prayed that the plaintiff be paid out of the fund, and if his pro rata share be not sufficient to pay his debts, that he recover judgment for the balance from the heirs at law in the proportions in which they have inherited and to the extent of such inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">That there is but one cause of action set forth in the complaint seems to be apparent, and although all the defendants may not be affected alike, yet all have an interest and were entitled to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The action is simply to enforce a right given to the creditors of Cornelius Poillon, of which the plaintiff is-one, by his heirs at law, at the instance of purchasers at the partition sale, to be paid their debts out of certain moneys deposited for their benefit with the defendant, the United States Trust Company, which right is dependent upon the establishment of a claim against the heirs of Poillon as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The claim for a judgment for a deficiency against the heirs so far as they have received assets of the estate is merely fbr the purpose of completing the remedy if the security provided should prove insufficient. It is simply ancillary to the principle cause of action, viz. : the enforcement of rights against fund provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Beady and Daniels, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Note on Interlocutory Judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">An interlocutory judgment is an intermediate or incomplete judgment, by which rights of the parties are adjudicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>but something is left to be done to fix the extent or limits of \"the actual relief to which those rights entitle the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The main importance of the distinction between an interlocutory and a final decree or judgment has heretofore been in the fact, that an interlocutory judgment or decree is not' Teviewable by an appeal to the court of last resort, except as it is involved in and reviewable on appeal from a final judgment'or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Where contest is made the court ought not, therefore, in .general, to grant a decree such as can be executed by passing possession, or otherwise terminating the rights of the parties, unless the cause is ready for'final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The function of an interlocutory decree is to establish the principles determining the rights of the parties, and to direct those steps which are to be c.onducted according to those principles, in order to reach the point at which final judgment may be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In foreclosure, for instance, where plaintiff sues to collect his demand by having the property of the defendant sold, and \"the debt paid, and deficiency, if any, awarded, the determination of the question of right, that is to say of debt and of mortgage, is deemed the final judgment; and the sale is regarded as rather in the nature of execution ; so that upon a \u2022decree of foreclosure directing sale, immediate appeal will lie as from a final judgment, without awaiting the result of the .sale and the distribution. If after affirmanoe of the judgment of sale, a sale is had, and questions arise as to surplus or \u2022deficiency, these are regarded as matters to be determined upon motion and reviewed by appeals from orders: and the fact that a final judgment has been entered for foreclosure -and sale, does not preclude the entering of another final judgment for deficiency, if any be found to arise after sale, and to be chargeable personally upon a defendant. The power to -enter such a judgment, however, does not exist unless expressly given by statute or rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On the other hand, where, as in actions for partition and for dower, the question of separate possession is -the main \u2022question, and a sale is only necessary of property, otherwise indivisible, in order that the proceeds may be divided, the deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>mination of the question of right is not regarded as the final judgment, nor is the direction for sale, where that is necessary;, hut these are regarded as only intermediate steps necessary to-convert the fund in question into a condition in which the court can compute and apportion the relative shares, the final judgment is that which is made after sale, or after survey and allotment, and which puts each party in possession of his share.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The practice of entering an interlocutory judgment to mark the determination of part of the issues in a cause, or after a decision of all the issues, where other proceedings were necessary or permissible before final judgment, originated in chancery; and its adoption in some classes of jury-cases, is not yet generally familiar to the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">It is now the proper practice, irrespective of the nature of the action, where the cause has been heard on demurrer, and a decision rendered either way, with leave to plead over or to-amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In respect to its use on the trial of issues of fact in cases-of a common law nature, it is first to be observed, that if a jury is waived, and the cause tried before a judge, and a proper case is made out, an interlocutory judgment may be rendered the same as if the action were originally triable by the court. Cornell <em>v. </em>Cornell, 96 N. <em>Y. </em>108. [Citing Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 1207; and Murtha <em>v. </em>Curley, 90 <em>Id. </em>372.]</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The opinion in Cornell <em>v. </em>Cornell, above cited, contains a dictum that in a cause triable and actually tried before a jury,, an interlocutory judgment cannot be had. But this proposition, though probably well stating a general professional opinion and usage, is subject to so many exceptions, as to be practically misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">And, first, it is worthy of notice that although the general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in reference to interlocutory judgments, contain no express authority for it in cases tried before a jury, the provisions of the statute relative to particular actions, such as partition, for instance, do authorize interlocutory judgments, although the issues be triable by jury. N. <em>Y. Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1544.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>So in a widow\u2019s action for dower (\u00a7 1607), which is triable oy jury (\u00a7 968), and equally in case a widow claims dower when an action to determine claims to title is brought (\u00a7 1648), an interlocutory judgment is to be entere^ on the verdict for <em>dower; </em>and such judgment will direct the admeasurement to be had before final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">So in an action for waste, which is triable by jury (\u00a7 968) if it be between joint tenants, or tenants in common, and plaintiff gets a verdict, he may take an interlocutory judgment for partition and sale (\u00a7 1657).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">And recently, kuan action triable and actually tried by jury, where the right was established, but* an accounting was found necessary in order to ascertain the sum for which judgment should be given, or the measure of damages depended on facts not yet ascertainable, the court of appeals held that an interlocutory judgment might be taken, .and a reference ordered. Peck <em>v. </em>Vandemark, 99 <em>N. Y. </em>29, 35; <em>aff\u2019g </em>33 <em>Hun, </em>214.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Also compare Cogswell <em>v. </em>N. Y., New Haven, &amp;c. R. R. Co., 105 <em>N. Y. </em>319; Watson <em>v. </em>Manhattan Ry. Co., 17 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>289; People <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Tel. Co., 11 <em>Id. 304; </em>and s. c., after further trial, 31 <em>Hun, </em>596.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">These instances show that there is no incongruity between jury trial and interlocutory judgment; and that wherever the nature of the issues is such that trial by jury does not establish all the elements necessary to enable the court to proceed to final judgment, and the case is such that the failure to do so is not a denial of the right of trial by jury, the court may put upon record an adjudication embodying the verdict of the jury, as an interlocutory judgment, and then proceed, \u2014by reference, or by settling special questions for a jury, or by appointing commissioners to admeasure or partition as the case may require,\u2014to prepare for and render final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Among the incidental advantages of interlocutory judgment, under the N. Y. Code of Civil Procedure, the cliief are four:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">I. Interlocutory judgment so fixes the right of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that subsequent death does not prevent the entry of final judgment in the names of the original parties (\u00a7 763). The statute gives the same force to the verdict, report or decision; but these may be set aside on some grounds which do not \u2022\u25a0avail to set aside an interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">II. By taking an interlocutory judgment, directing that a party do or refrain from an act (other than certain, payments into court, etc.) it may be enforced by serving a certified \u25a0copy, and by proceedings for contempt, without awaiting final judgment. \u00a7 1241, subd. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">III. If the complaint demands judgment for such relief, arrest may be ordered if defendant threatens to leave the jurisdiction. \u00a7 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">IV.

That depends upon this; whether the decree of foreclosure and sale is to be considered as the final decree in the-sense of' a court of equity, and the proceedings on that decree a mere mode'of enforcing the rights of the creditor, and for the benefit of the debtor;; or whether the decree is to be deemed final only after the return and\u2019 confirmation of the sale by a decretal order of the court. We are of opinion that the former is the true view of the matter. The original-decree of foreclosure and sale was final upon the merits of the controversy. The defendants had a right to appeal from that decree, as final\u2019 upon those merits, as soon as it was pronounced, in order to prevent\" an irreparable mischief to themselves. For, if the sale had been completed under the decree, the title of the purchaser under the decree-would not have been overthrown or invalidated, even by a reversal of the decree, and consequently the title of the defendants. to the lands would have been extinguished, and their redress upon the reversal would have been of a different sort from that of a restitution of the-land sold. \u201d Whiting <em>v. </em>Bank of United States, 13 <em>Pet. </em>6, 15; s. p., Ray <em>v. </em>Law, 3 <em>Oranch, </em>179, where a decision of the court below, that: a decree for sale was not final, was disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\"><em>Adjudication of amount due, and direction for sale nisi final.) </em>Foreclosure of a railroad mortgage was instituted on the ground that the-, company was in arrears for interest on the bonds secured by the mortgage.

The decree appealed from found: 1. That the junior mortgage is still a valid and subsisting lien, and that the right of its trustee and beneficiaries to redeem had not been cut off by the proceedings for the foreclosure of the earlier mortgage. 2. That those claiming title under the sale upon the foreclosure of that \u2022.mortgage, and certain other parties were entitled to redeem the junior mortgage \u201cby paying off the amount due\u201d thereon, \u201cat such time as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u25a0shall hereafter be fixed and determined by a further order or decree to be entered in this cause.\u201d 3.

Here, however,such is not the case, because still the court must act judicially in making the partition it has ordered.
