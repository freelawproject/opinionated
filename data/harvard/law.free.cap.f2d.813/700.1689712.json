EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Leroy Williams appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A Louisiana state jury convicted Williams for heroin distribution, and he is currently a prisoner in Orleans Parish. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus on the grounds of procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Williams\u2019 conviction stems from his sale of heroin to August Wells, an undercover agent for the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Wells was introduced to Williams by a confidential informant. Williams argues that he deserves habeas corpus relief because he was unable to locate the informant. We hold that this claim is procedurally barred because Williams failed to either object or move for a continuance at his state court trial. <em>Ramirez v. Estelle, </em>678 F.2d 604, 606 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Williams requested that the prosecutor furnish him with the name and address of the confidential informant before trial. In accordance with <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60-62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627-29, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), the court ordered the prosecutor to reveal the informant\u2019s name and make an effort to furnish his address. The prosecutor disclosed the informant\u2019s identity but failed to disclose his address because the information was not contained in the prosecutor\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">Although Williams\u2019 counsel had not received the informant\u2019s address on the morning of trial, the trial commenced without objection. Williams waited until after the first witness was sworn in to complain that he needed the confidential informant\u2019s address \u201cso I can subpoena him as a witness.\u201d The judge responded by calling an <em>in camera </em>conference in which he told Williams\u2019 attorney to ask DEA agent Wells for the address during Wells\u2019 upcoming testimony. On cross-examination of agent Wells, Williams\u2019 attorney asked for the addrdfes, and Wells testified that it was located in his file at the DEA office. The court granted a recess to allow Williams\u2019 attorney time to use the information to locate the informant and bring him to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">After a twenty-five minute recess, the trial resumed without objection by Williams\u2019 attorney. Williams\u2019 attorney did not move for a continuance in order to locate the confidential informant and call him as a witness. The State rested its case after agent Wells testified, and Williams rested his case without calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The jury convicted Williams and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Williams\u2019 conviction was upheld by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals of Louisiana. <em>State v. Williams, </em>453 So.2d 276 (La.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 So.2d 1018 (La.1984). Williams\u2019 petition for federal habeas corpus was denied by the district court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">Williams\u2019 habeas petition presents an amalgam of claims relating to the disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant. First, Williams argues that he deserves habeas corpus relief because the prosecutor disobeyed the state trial court\u2019s pre-trial disclosure order. Even assuming that the state court\u2019s order was disobeyed, we agree with the district court that this does not present an error of constitutional magnitude. Mere errors of state law are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>not cognizable on habeas review. <em>Johnson v. Thigpen, </em>806 F.2d 1243, 1248 n. 3 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Second, Williams argued that he was unable to fully prepare for trial without the confidential informant\u2019s address. Although Williams requested this information before trial, he allowed the trial to commence without objection. If Williams needed to locate the informant to prepare for trial, then he should have moved, before trial, for a continuance pursuant to Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 729.5(A). The failure to contemporaneously move for a continuance is grounds for a procedural default. <em>Ramirez v. Estelle, </em>678 F.2d 604, 606 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam). Williams\u2019 omission precludes relief based on any alleged error of the prosecutor to disclose the informant\u2019s name and address before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Finally, Williams argues that he was denied a fundamentally fair trial because he was unable to locate the informant during trial in order to call him as a witness. The court granted Williams\u2019 motion for a recess in order to locate the informant. When the informant could not be located during the recess, Williams failed to contemporaneously move for a mistrial or a longer recess. The trial resumed without objection from Williams. Williams\u2019 failure to move for a mistrial or a longer recess is grounds for a procedural default. <em>See Ramirez, </em>678 F.2d at 606. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s belief that a particular witness\u2019 testimony is crucial to his case should be brought out at the state trial, giving the state trial court the opportunity to determine the importance of the missing witness.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>678 F.2d at 606. As in <em>Ramirez, </em>if the informant\u2019s testimony were truly crucial to Williams\u2019 defense, he should have moved for a mistrial or a longer recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Because Williams has articulated neither \u201ccause\u201d nor \u201cprejudice\u201d to justify either of the above-mentioned procedural defaults, his habeas claim is therefore procedurally barred. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Although the district court dismissed Williams' habeas corpus appeal based on the merits, we affirm the dismissal of Williams\u2019 habeas petition on the grounds that it is procedurally barred. <em>See Johnson v. McCotter, </em>803 F.2d 830, 834 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
