In their \"as-applied\" challenge, Plaintiffs focus on the manner in which Defendants applied the University's \"large-scale events\" policy to a speech given by Mr. Shapiro on February 26, 2018. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court grants Defendants' motion in part and denies it in part. The Court grants Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' \"facial\" First Amendment challenge, but denies Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' \"as-applied\" First Amendment challenge. Further, the Court grants Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claims. The Court explains its reasoning at greater length below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There are three Plaintiffs in this case. Plaintiff Young America's Foundation (\"YAF\") is a nonprofit organization that was founded by the late conservative thinker William F. Buckley in the 1960s. (Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 25-2] \u00b6\u00b6 24, 79.) YAF hosts and co-sponsors conferences and lectures around the country, with the goal of introducing young people and university students to conservative viewpoints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Students of a Conservative Voice (\"SCV\") is a registered student group at the University of Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) SCV attempts to introduce their classmates to \"alternative,\" often conservative, viewpoints by way of \"flyers, signs, peaceful demonstrations, hosting tables with information, inviting speakers to campus, and talking with fellow students.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.) According to SCV, this mission is important because \"conservative viewpoints are notably absent from educational\n   instruction at the University of Minnesota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Ben Shapiro is an \"American political commentator, nationally syndicated columnist, author, radio talk show host, and attorney.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There are five Defendants in this case. Defendant Eric W. Kaler is the President of the University of Minnesota, a public university created by the State of Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, 51.) President Kaler \"is responsible for the enactment, implementation, and enforcement of [University of Minnesota] policies affecting students, student organizations, faculty, and guests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Michael Berthelsen is the Vice President of University Services at the University of Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Plaintiffs allege that Vice President Berthelsen consults with President Kaler over \"certain University policies,\" and \"their application to student speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Matthew Clark is the Chief of Police at the University of Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Plaintiffs allege that Chief Clark also consults with President Kaler (and Vice President Berthelsen) over \"certain University policies,\" and \"their application to student speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Troy Buhta is a Lieutenant in the University of Minnesota Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Eric Dussault is the Assistant Director of Student Unions &amp; Activities at the University of Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Large-Scale Events Process (\"LSEP\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This litigation centers around a University of Minnesota student affairs policy called the \"Large-Scale Events Process\" (\"LSEP\"). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. 1 [Doc. No. 1-1] (\"LSEP\").) Because the Complaint does not allege when or how the LSEP came into existence, the Court simply details what the LSEP says on its face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neubauer v. FedEx Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277422\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/400/#p403\">\n    849 F.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (8th Cir. 2017) (noting that, in deciding a motion to dismiss, a court may directly consider \"all documents ... attached to the complaint as exhibits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The LSEP sets forth a process to be followed \"by any registered student group proposing to host a large-scale event on the University of Minnesota campus.\" (LSEP at 1.) The LSEP first defines \"large scale event\" as a \"student group sponsored event taking place in a large campus venue or outdoor space that will draw a significant amount of the campus population, a large off-campus crowd, or represents a significant security concern (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , public figure, celebrity, etc).\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The LSEP then states that, although a student group has a right to reserve a \"large campus venue\" for such an event, \"the reservation will only be confirmed upon approval by the Large-Scale Events Committee (\"LSEC\").\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The LSEC includes representatives from various campus departments, such as \"the University of Minnesota Police Department, University Services, Parking and Transportation, [and] Student Unions and Activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) To secure approval from the LSEC for a venue reservation, the student group must put together a \"Large Scale Event Proposal,\" containing a variety of relevant logistical details, and then must meet with the LSEC, if asked. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ultimately, the LSEC's \"determination of whether the campus can support the [student group proposed] event\" will be based on factors such as \"other events happening on campus, human resources needed to support the event, the impact of the event on the campus community, and the impact of the event on the community surrounding campus.\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the LSEP is unconstitutional, on its face, under either the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-70.) This is largely because the LSEP purportedly \"does not provide any objective, non-content-based and non-viewpoint-based criteria for [University officials] to use when deciding to impose [ ] restrictions on a proposed event,\" and, further, \"does not limit the discretion of [University officials] when deciding whether to apply the policy to student organizations' events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Shapiro Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sometime in fall of 2017, SCV decided that it wanted to bring Mr. Shapiro to campus for a lecture. This was so because, although SCV found Mr. Shapiro \"to be an incredibly articulate, consistent, and academically accomplished leader in conservative thought,\" SCV \"believed that Mr. Shapiro's viewpoints [were] treated unfairly on campus by University of Minnesota faculty and administrators alike.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) With the assistance of YAF, SCV reached out to Mr. Shapiro, and Mr. Shapiro, in turn, agreed to come speak to University of Minnesota students (and members of the surrounding community) on February 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-80;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80 (noting that YAF provided \"assistance and financial support to bring Mr. Shapiro to the University of Minnesota's campus\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In October 2017, several months before Mr. Shapiro's speech, SCV informed the University that it intended to bring Mr. Shapiro to campus the following February. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) According to Plaintiffs, \"[b]efore any specific details were provided by SCV, Defendant Dussault [the Assistant Director of Student Unions &amp; Activities] explicitly informed SCV that the Shapiro event would be subject to [the LSEP] and stated that he would schedule follow up meetings to discuss details.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Nonetheless, because Defendants had allegedly used the LSEP to relocate one of SCV's prior events (a speech by conservative commentator Lauren Southern) \"on three occasions without obtaining SCV's prior permission\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85), Plaintiffs allege that SCV immediately took the initiative of reserving \"multiple potential rooms\" on the centrally-located Minneapolis campus \"to avoid being forced to host the Shapiro event in an undesirable location and to make sure that at least one room was available.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Because SCV's goal was to hold Mr. Shapiro's speech \"in the largest venue available on the Minneapolis campus,\" the student group \"placed reservation requests both verbally and via e-mail for several locations,\" with seating capacities ranging from 450 to 4,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.) Plaintiffs allege that, as of December 6, 2018, at least two of the three rooms SCV reserved were open and available for use on the evening of February 26, 2018 - Mayo Hall, which seats 455 attendees, and Willey Hall, which seats 1,056 attendees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-102.) Consequently, on that date, SCV \"formally requested use of Willey Hall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities has a St. Paul campus that is, by Plaintiffs' admission, only a bus ride away from the Minneapolis campus (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139), Plaintiffs allege that \"they always intended to host the Shapiro lecture on the Minneapolis campus\" because that campus is \"more convenient for the majority of students,\" and because hosting the lecture on the St. Paul campus \"would inhibit attendance\" and \"burden the effectiveness of the speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-04.) Indeed, Plaintiffs allege, \"many students on the Minneapolis campus go their entire undergraduate careers without ever visiting the St. Paul campus,\" in part because evening\n   busses between the two campuses only run every 15-20 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, in late December 2017, Defendants, acting pursuant to the LSEP, determined that the Shapiro speech would be held in a venue on the St. Paul campus that could accommodate a maximum of 500 attendees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Chief of Police Clark sent an e-mail, which was later forwarded to SCV, stating that \"the admin has asked that we try to move this visit to the St. Paul campus. It's going to be a security issue with past lectures at other universities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106-07;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108 (alleging that, \"upon information and belief,\" President Kaler and Vice President Berthelsen participated in this decision).) Lieutenant Buhta and Mr. Dussault allegedly concurred with this assessment, and further asserted, in e-mails to SCV, that Willey Hall's \"access to the [West Bank] Skyway\" rendered the location unsafe to host Mr. Shapiro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-18.) In these exchanges, Lieutenant Buhta also referred to the University's decision to move Mr. Shapiro's speech to the St. Paul campus as \"unfortunate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' security concerns lacked support, especially two months prior to the event, and therefore constituted a mere pretext to \"banish\" Mr. Shapiro's \"controversial\" conservative views to an out-of-the-way location, where SCV and Mr. Shapiro would receive less attention from the campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105, 113-14.) In further support of this \"pretext to discriminate\" contention, Plaintiffs allege that (a) the University \"routinely controls access to its West Bank Skyway,\" including by closing off the Skyway every weekday night after 10:00 PM and all day on Sundays (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118-23), and (b) concerns about \"access to the West Bank Skyway\" did not prevent the University and/or student groups from hosting well-known \"liberal\" public figures with \"university-favored viewpoints\" in centrally-located lecture halls connected to that Skyway,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September 2014, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in October 2016, former U.S. Senator Al Franken in June 2017, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and then-U.S. Representative Keith Ellison in October 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response, SCV decided to reserve the North Star Ballroom, a 400-person venue on the St. Paul campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.) According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]ickets for the event sold out in only a few short hours after they were made available,\" with SCV receiving \"725 inquiries within the first 24 hours of offering the tickets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.) This success prompted Plaintiffs to \"renew[ ] their request for use of [the 1,000-seat] Willey Hall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143.) Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that, after they renewed their request for Willey Hall, a member of the University's Board of Trustees \"sent an e-mail to Defendant Dussault,\" on January 26, 2018, \"requesting further information\" about the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.) Plaintiffs further allege that this inquiry led the University to hold a press conference on February 9, 2018 to address \"the backlash received by the Board of Trustees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149.) Plaintiffs describe this press conference, organized by Matt Kramer, Vice President of University Relations, as an \"attempt[ ] to justify\" the University's \"refusal\" to accommodate \"SCV's request for the available Willey Hall venue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150-51.) It appears that, after this press conference, Plaintiffs did not request to move the Shapiro speech again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Shapiro ultimately spoke to a crowd of around 450 people in the North Star Ballroom on February 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.) However, Plaintiffs contend, Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   actions prevented Plaintiffs from \"deliver[ing] their message to hundreds of students that wanted to attend the event,\" which \"deprived\" those students \"the opportunity to ... participate in an important dialogue on matters of public concern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155.) Moreover, Plaintiffs allege, \"[n]o more than two dozen protestors appeared outside the Shapiro lecture on the day of the event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because of this experience, Plaintiffs' complaint concludes, SCV has \"modified, self-censored and suppressed its speech ... by choosing not to invite certain speakers to campus whose content and viewpoint Defendants or other members of the campus community will consider to be more objectionable or controversial than other speakers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 193.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the LSEP violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment, both facially and as-applied to the Shapiro speech, and accordingly requested damages for past harm, as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants \"from enforcing\" the LSEP, or \"otherwise disrupting or preventing Plaintiffs from engaging in lawful First Amendment activity at the University.\" (Compl. Prayer for Relief.) Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety a little over a month later, on August 22, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Br. at 10-14.) Plaintiffs disagree, and argue that the following allegations sufficiently demonstrate \"personal involvement\": (a) as high-ranking University officials, all three Defendants were ultimately responsible for the LSEP (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-42); (b) Defendant Clark's e-mail stated that \"the admin\" had ordered the Shapiro speech to be moved to St. Paul (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-08); and (c) the University held a press conference a\n   month before the speech to justify the \"admin's\" decision (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150-51). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp. Br. at 6-10.) With respect to Defendants Kaler and Berthelsen in particular, Plaintiffs note that, \"[w]hile 'the admin' [referenced in Clark's e-mail] could conceivably refer to persons other than Defendants Kaler and Berthelsen, the question of 'to whom the phrase refers' may not be disposed of at the pleadings stage of this case and Plaintiffs must be given the opportunity for discovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants with respect to President Kaler, but disagrees with Defendants with respect to Chief of Police Clark and Vice President of University Services Berthelsen. As an initial matter, the Court notes that \"it is important that [it] is reviewing a record in which discovery has yet to take place,\" and must accordingly afford Plaintiffs' complaint all \"reasonable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012691\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/673/#p679\">\n    552 F.3d at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying motion to dismiss state prison official based on lack of \"personal involvement\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178985\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/537/#p543\">\n    747 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). However, by the same token, affording a complaint \"reasonable inferences\" does not require the Court to keep a high-ranking state official in a litigation based on the \"sheer possibility\" that the official was personally involved in allegedly unconstitutional decision making.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching its decision here, the Court keeps that balance in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the Court finds that the Complaint presents more than a \"sheer possibility\" that Clark and Berthelsen were personally involved with the LSEP, including its application to the Shapiro speech. With respect to Clark, the Complaint specifically alleges that Clark sent an e-mail explaining why \"the admin\" was not going to allow Mr. Shapiro to speak on the Minneapolis campus, which Clark then passed along to his Lieutenant, Defendant Buhta, to communicate to SCV. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106-07.) As for Berthelsen, the LSEP states that his department, \"University Services,\" is one of the departments responsible for enforcing the LSEP (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   LSEP at 1), and the Complaint alleges that one of Berthelsen's fellow University Vice Presidents, Matt Kramer of University Relations, gave a press conference \"justifying\" the University's decision to move the Shapiro speech, one month before the speech occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 149-52.) It is reasonable to infer from these facts that Berthelsen was involved with, or at least aware of, the \"admin's\" decisions concerning the Shapiro speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By contrast, the Court finds that the Complaint's allegations of \"personal involvement\" fall short with respect to President Kaler. That Kaler is \"responsible for the enactment, implementation, and enforcement of [University of Minnesota] policies affecting students, student organizations, faculty, and guests\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53), and that the University held a press conference about the Shapiro speech, show nothing more than a \"sheer possibility\" that President Kaler was the \"admin\" referenced by Clark's e-mail, or that Kaler is responsible for the creation and enforcement of the LSEP.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, on its face, the LSEP appears to simply be a \"Student Unions &amp; Activities\" policy, rather than the kind of official school policy a University President would normally be involved with. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LSEP.) Thus, these facts are unlike the Ninth Circuit decision cited by Plaintiffs, in which a majority of the panel found that a plaintiff student group sufficiently pleaded \"personal involvement\" by Oregon State University's President in the application of a \"newspaper collection bin\" policy because the complaint cited e-mails showing that the President \"knew that\n   [his] subordinate,\" the University's Director of Facilities Services, was enforcing the at-issue policy against plaintiffs, yet \"did nothing to stop him.\"\n   <em>\n    Or.

For example, in the Oregon State University case mentioned above, the Ninth Circuit found that a student group plaintiff adequately pleaded \"unbridled discretion\" when a university \"policy\" restricting the location of student newspaper distribution bins was neither \"written\" nor \"otherwise established by practice,\" and hence provided \"no standards by which [university] officials could be limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632347\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/1053/#p1070\">\n    699 F.3d at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because there is no dispute that the LSEP is viewpoint-neutral on its face, Plaintiffs primarily rely on an \"unbridled discretion\" argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 11-15.) In particular, Plaintiffs contend that\n   the LSEP unduly risks viewpoint discrimination because it vests Defendants with \"unbridled discretion\" to (a) \"determine which events must comply with the restrictions of the policy,\" (b) \"approve or decline any event,\" and/or (c) \"impose restrictions on any event such as the location of the event, the time of the event, the size of the event, and whether to charge security fees, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.) Plaintiffs also note that the LSEP \"requires no written justification for placing any restrictions on a speaker,\" and fails to offer an \"appeal process or other recourse if the restrictions are applied in error.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court disagrees. First, almost all of the \"unbridled discretion\" cases cited by Plaintiffs involved state government regulations in \"traditional public fora,\" and hence provide little guidance in this situation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 983-84.) Indeed, as the Court noted above, it is unclear to what extent this \"unbridled discretion\" case law even applies in the educational setting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n.2.) However, assuming this case law applies, the LSEP provides sufficient criteria by which to guide the discretion of the LSEC. The policy is only limited to \"student group sponsored large-scale events,\" not to \"any\" event, as Plaintiffs suggest, and it provides specific examples of those kinds of events. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LSEP (listing examples as \"events taking place in a large campus venue or outdoor space that will draw a significant amount of the campus population, a large off-campus crowd, or presents a significant security concern (i.e., public figure, celebrity, etc)\").) Moreover, although the LSEP vests the LSEC with significant discretion to approve, deny, or alter a venue request for a \"student sponsored large-scale event,\" the Policy provides sufficient criteria by which to guide this discretion: the LSEC must consider \"other events happening on campus,\" \"human resources needed to support the event,\" \"the impact of the event on the campus community,\" and \"the impact of the event on the surrounding community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Importantly, too, as its title suggests, the LSEP is a collaborative \"process\" between student groups, administration, and other campus stakeholders (including campus police and parking authorities), rather than a binary \"yes/no\" permit from the Director of Student Services. Given this collaborative context, the lack of a written decision or appeals process is not particularly troubling.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Victory Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203308\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/329/\">\n    640 F.3d at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a school district backpack flyer distribution policy did not vest the district with \"unbridled discretion,\" in part because the policy was created \"with input from various sources\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The (admittedly scant) on-point case law further buttresses this conclusion.

Plaintiffs argue that, when the allegations recited in Section I.C,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , are taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it is plausible to infer that Defendants \"banished\" Mr. Shapiro's speech to the St. Paul campus, not because of genuine \"security concerns,\" but because his conservative message was seen as \"controversial\" on a liberal university campus. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 15-17.) What is more, Plaintiffs point out, even if Defendants did not themselves find Mr. Shapiro's speech disagreeable, viewpoint discrimination may still have occurred if Defendants moved Mr. Shapiro's speech simply to appease liberal students, faculty, or community members, without a genuine security concern to justify that appeasement.

Br. at 19.) Moreover, Defendants contend, \"Plaintiffs have not alleged facts giving rise to the inference of the existence of a nexus between the views of potential protestors and Defendants' actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On this point, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs. Taken together, and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the allegations in the Complaint plausibly allege that Plaintiffs' \"controversial\" viewpoint may have motivated Defendants' decisions with respect to the Shapiro speech. For instance, contrary to Defendants' argument that the Complaint \"makes clear\" that the University acted \"only on the basis\" of security concerns, the Complaint alleges that \"Defendants decided to move the event to the St. Paul campus two months before the event and in the absence of any specific information regarding the event at the University.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 109.) This allegation matters because, \"in the absence of any specific information\" about planned protests in response to Mr. Shapiro, or other potentially disruptive behavior, it is plausible that Defendants' decision to move the speech to the St. Paul campus may have been based merely on concerns that some \"persons on the [ ] campus objected to [Mr. Shapiro's] viewpoint,\" which, the Eighth Circuit has held, is not a \"constitutionally valid reason\" to prohibit someone from speaking in an otherwise-available limited public forum like Willey Hall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199977\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/668/#p676\">\n    119 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that University of Minnesota-Duluth officials violated history professors' First Amendment rights when it required them to remove photographs of themselves holding firearms from a departmental display case, simply because some campus members found the photographs \"insensitive\" and \"inappropriate\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, the Complaint alleges that numerous well-known liberal speakers were allowed to speak in centrally-located University spaces connected to the skyway (all of whom had some need for security by virtue of their celebrity), while Mr. Shapiro, a well-known conservative speaker, was barred from doing so, based in large part on the purported \"security concerns\" raised by Willey Hall's \"access to the skyway.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 114-30.) Taken as true, this kind of \"unique scrutiny\" raises a plausible allegation of viewpoint discrimination, given the Eighth Circuit's recent holding that \"imposing\" \"unique scrutiny\" on a campus speaker with a particular viewpoint, as compared to other speakers who do not share that viewpoint, potentially suggests that impermissible viewpoint discrimination is afoot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerlich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276218\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/697/#p704\">\n    861 F.3d at 705-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying university officials' motion for summary judgment on First Amendment claim, largely because of the \"unique scrutiny\" officials gave to plaintiff, a pro-marijuana\n   student group, when rejecting plaintiff's application for use of the university's trademark).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For these reasons, the Court denies Defendants' motion with respect to Plaintiffs' as-applied First Amendment challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Qualified Immunity Defense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Of course, even if the facts alleged in the Complaint plausibly suggest that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, the doctrine of qualified immunity requires the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim if the constitutional right Defendants allegedly violated was not \"clearly established\" as of late December 2017.\n   <em>\n    Gerlich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276218\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/697/#p704\">\n    861 F.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Defendants opposed this request, and argued that the motion was futile because, even accepting the allegations in the Amended Complaint as true, Plaintiffs' claim still failed to state any plausible constitutional violations. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 27.) The Court has considered the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint, and has determined that the motion will be granted to the extent it relates to Plaintiffs' \"as-applied\" First Amendment claim, and denied to the extent it relates to all of Plaintiffs' other claims; any amendment to the latter set of claims would be futile.\n    <em>\n     Accord\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Popp Telcom v.
