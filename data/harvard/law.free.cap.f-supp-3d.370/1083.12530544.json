On October 15, 2018, Ms. Ochoa voluntarily dismissed her petition, leaving Petitioner as the sole remaining petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 8, 2018, Petitioner filed a \"Motion for Emergency Stay of Removal\" seeking an order from this Court staying any removal of Petitioner. Dkt. 7 (\"Motion\"). On October 19, 2018, Respondent filed an Opposition to the Motion arguing, among other things, that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Dkt. 17 (\"Opposition\" or \"Opp.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Per order of the Court (Dkt. 11), the matter having been fully briefed, for the reasons set forth below, the Motion is GRANTED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.

Dkt. 9 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 11, 2018, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the Court extended Respondent's time to respond to the Motion to Friday, October 19, 2018. Dkt. 11. In the stipulation, Respondent advised that Petitioner would not be removed before October 23, 2018. Dkt. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 15, 2018, Petitioner filed a Supplemental Memorandum in support of the Motion (Dkt. 15 (\"Supp. Mem.\") ) and a Declaration by Petitioner (Dkt. 13). In the Supplemental Memorandum, Petitioner argued that the removal proceedings violate the United Nations Convention Against Torture and the Equal Protections Clause, arguing \"Petitioner may not be removed without a review of his claims and adjudication of legitimate claims.\" Supp. Mem. at 3. Petitioner's Declaration described: his arrest in Texas in 2005 by immigration officials; his receipt of papers in English that he was unable to read; his lack of receipt of any notice to appear in immigration court; his advisement of his then-current address in Orange, California, an address from which he was later evicted; his arrest at his home by ICE in August 2018 two days after he accompanied his eleven year old daughter to California state court proceedings arising from an allegation that his daughter had been a victim of a sexual assault; his fear of returning to Honduras caused by threats to his family by criminals, resulting in Petitioner sending money to his family to pay extortion to the criminals; his reason for coming to the United States, that is, because gangs murdered a friend and threatened to murder Petitioner; and Petitioner's fear that if he returns to Honduras, he will be murdered or kidnapped and tortured for money. (Dkt. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Opposition, Respondent asserts in August 2005 in Texas, Petitioner was arrested and immigration proceedings commenced, at which time Petitioner was served with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") informing him that removal proceedings had been initiated and directing him to appear before an immigration judge in San Antonio, Texas at a date and time to be set.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondent asserts Petitioner was also served with a release order which directed him to, among other things, report in writing or in person to a deportation officer in San Antonio at an address provided, on the first Tuesday of each month at 8:00 a.m., and if Petitioner reported in writing, that he include his current address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Opp. at 2-3. On August 16, 2018, Petitioner moved to reopen his case in immigration court, raising various arguments, including\n   that he was not served with the NTA, that the NTA is defective on its face under\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and that he now faces persecution in his home country of Honduras.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. On September 30, 2018, two days after the filing of the Petition in this Court, an immigration court denied Petitioner's motion to reopen without a hearing, finding, among other things, that the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   decision was limited to the narrow issue of the application of the so-called \"stop-time\" rule ending the period of continuous presence, and did not invalidate all NTAs lacking specific date and times for removal hearings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The immigration judge (\"IJ\") did not address Petitioner's claim that he was afraid that he would be the victim of violence upon removal to Honduras. (Opp. Exh. 7.) Rather, the IJ found that Petitioner's motion to reopen was time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Subsequent to the IJ's denial of Petitioner's MTR, counsel for Petitioner made attempts to bring notice of Petitioner's fear of persecution upon removal to his home country directly to the attention of ICE officials, which were not received or ignored. (\"Declaration of Willard Bakeman,\" Dkt. No. 12-4.) Absent the issuance of an injunction, Petitioner may be removed today, October 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Respondent argues the Motion should be denied because: (1) district courts lack jurisdiction to review challenges to an order of removal, with such challenges properly brought only in the courts of appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) substantively, Petitioner is not entitled to a credible fear interview for various reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    at 4-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Standard for the Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner's request for an immediate stay order is, in the context of this action, analogous to a request for a preliminary injunction. A preliminary injunction is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish four elements: \"(1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that the plaintiff will likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor, and (4) that the public interest favors an injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo &amp; Co. v.

A preliminary injunction may also issue if a plaintiff demonstrates under the \"serious questions\" test. According to this test, a plaintiff can obtain a preliminary injunction by demonstrating \"that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,\" in addition to the other\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   elements.\n   <em>\n    Alliance for the Wild Rockies v.

Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655526\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/969/\">\n    499 F.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2007) (ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in habeas petition were not jurisdictionally barred by 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(5) or (b)(9), which apply only orders of removal or actions taken to review an order of removal). The Court finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Petitioner's claims regarding due process violations and to issue adequate injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chhoeun v. Marin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524817\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/306/1147/#p1159\">\n    306 F.Supp.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159 (C.D. Cal. 2018) (finding jurisdiction over habeas petition asserting due process challenge on grounds that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , petitioners were not permitted adequate opportunity to seek reopening of immigration proceeding to challenge years-old orders of removal.) At least one other district court has found that the possibility of removal prior to adequate hearing on motions to reopen implicates due process concerns and is properly subject and may properly be reviewed by a district court.\n   <em>\n    Sied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201142202\">\n    2018 WL 1142202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court finds that Petitioner challenges not only his final order of removal, but also due process violations arising from the failure of the IJ to address his request for a credible or reasonable fear interview. While Petitioner's briefing presents his claims with less than crystalline clarity, it appears that he is challenging, on due process grounds, the denial of a meaningful opportunity to be heard on his motion to reopen, which is itself based in part on the assertion that he is entitled to asylum or withholding of removal on the grounds of changed country conditions in his home country of Honduras. Petitioner's Motion to Reopen, while also cursory, appears to have adequately raised before the Immigration Judge that fact that Petitioner was \"now\" afraid to return to his home country on the grounds that he faces extortion upon arrival. In a declaration subsequently submitted to this Court, Petitioner asserts that, starting in approximately March of 2018, gang members in Honduras began to threaten his family, and that he now fears that he will be killed or tortured upon return. The IJ, however, failed to address Petitioner's assertion of changed country conditions at all and denied the motion on other grounds. Petitioner now faces removal more than a week prior to the October 30 deadline for appeal of this decision, which may deny him the opportunity for a meaningful hearing as to his eligibility for reopening on the basis of changed country conditions. Now, because of his imminent deportation, Petitioner may be removed \"without a review ... and adjudication of legitimate claims.\" (Supp. Mem. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court is particularly concerned that Petitioner will be deported prior to having an opportunity for a full and fair hearing on this question given the IJ seems to have erred in failing to address whether country conditions have changed in Honduras since Petitioner's 2005 removal order. While the IJ found that Petitioner's MTR was time-barred, the Board of Immigration Appeals has found that there are no limitations as to the number of motions to reopen that may be filed for petitioners seeking reopening to apply for asylum and withholding based on changed country conditions, and that such petitions are not subject to time limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J-G-\n   </em>\n   , 26 I&amp;N 161 (BIA 2013) (MTRs based on changed country conditions are not subject\n   to time or number limits); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The Court finds that there is a serious question as to whether Petitioner's removal without even summary adjudication of motion to reopen that could lead to potentially meritorious claims for asylum or withholding under the Convention Against Torture would violate due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Irreparable Harm, Balance of Equities, and Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Respondent does not contest that the other\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   elements weigh in Petitioner's favor. The Court finds that they weigh in favor of granting a stay. Removal without an adequate hearing may deprive Petitioner of constitutional rights and possibly result in his wrongful removal to Honduras and exposure to death or torture. Deprivation of constitutional rights \"unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p994\">\n    872 F.3d 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 994 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Torture and death are also clearly irreparable harms. In contrast, the government has not identified any hardship or burden that would result from a temporary stay of removal sufficient to allow Petitioner to seek review of the IJ's possibly erroneous decision. The Court finds that Petitioner is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay and that the balance of equities weighs strongly in his favor. Finally, a stay of removal is in the public interest, as there \"is a public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries where they are likely to face substantial harm,\" the risk of which is sufficiently grave in this case as to outweigh the more general public interest in the prompt execution of Petitioner's removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p436\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p436\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p436\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.

The Court orders that the government may not remove Petioner Marcos Villanueva-Bustillo from the United States. This injunction and order will terminate upon:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   1. Villanueva-Bustillo's failure to either (1) timely appeal to the BIA the IJ's adverse ruling on his motion to reopen and file a simultaneous motion to stay removal with the BIA or (2) file an additional motion to reopen before Villanueva-Bustillo's immigration proceedings on the basis of changed county conditions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   2. A decision on a motion to stay removal by the appropriate United States Court of Appeals; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   3. A final, non-appealable decision vacating Villanueva-Bustillo's removal order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
