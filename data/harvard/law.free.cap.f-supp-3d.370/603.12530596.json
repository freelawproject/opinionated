NORTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the court on Kevin Hennelly's (\"Hennelly\") motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ECF No. 29. The court grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter arises from an action of alleged defamation and libel brought by James McGlothlin (\"McGlothlin\") against Hennelly. McGlothlin is a founding member of The United Company, which is the parent company of Scratch Golf, LLC, a South Carolina corporation. Hennelly lives in Beaufort County, South Carolina. Scratch Golf owns Hilton Head National Golf Course (the \"Property\") in Beaufort County, South Carolina. In July 2016, Scratch Golf submitted an application to Beaufort County to amend the rezoning of the Property (\"Rezoning Application\"). On May 22, 2017, the Beaufort County Council denied the Rezoning Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McGlothlin alleges that Hennelly made three separate posts on Facebook and on the website of the Island Packet, a local newspaper, that contained various defamatory statements about him, in an effort to imply that McGlothlin is corrupt or may have committed crimes. McGlothlin attached images of those statements to his complaint. For the most part, these statements relate to the Rezoning Application. Those posts and their statements are below.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Internet Comment 1\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   May 12, 2017 post by Hennelly on his own Facebook Page, ECF No. 1-1 (\"May 12 Facebook Post\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Statement: \"A little something the Island Packet overlooked\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The May 12 Facebook Post included a link to this Washington Post article (\"Washington Post Article\"):\n   <em>\n    Virginia governor's wife was paid $36,000 as consultant to coal: How Robert McDonnell reported role affected what he had to disclose on annual financial reforms.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Internet Comment 2\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   May 14, 2017 comment on the online version of a May 12 article from The Island Packet newspaper (\"Island Packet Article\"), ECF No. 1-2,\n   <em>\n    Hilton Head National developers: Why golf lost its swing there and what the future holds\n   </em>\n   (\"Island Packet Comment\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Statement: It looks like they left out a few pertinent facts.

These guys are crony capitalists and will break every rule in the book to get a government favor or handout. Let's vote NO to zoning change and send these carpetbaggers packing. Let's tell them loud and clear our elected officials are not for sale and are above reproach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Internet Comment 3\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   May 23, 2017 post by Hennelly on his own Facebook page, ECF No. 1-3 (\"May 23 Facebook Post\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Statement: A few final observations. This was never about a project; there is no project. This is about a request for zoning change for the sole purpose to quadruple the value of the land. The crooked owners wanted a government handout and not give anything in return. This is Crony Capitalism. I hope it is clear to these crooks from Virginia this will not fly in Beaufort County. It is sad that Brian Flewelling believes public input is external drama and distracts from the process. Brian you are wrong. Chairman Paul Summerville did an excellent job from the beginning providing a fully transparent process and bent over backwards to hear all public comment, thanks Paul. We saw how the board should function and should demand the same from Beaufort County school Board. Tabor Vaux did an excellent job and proved himself a leader in our community. He tried to get a development agreement but wisely. The Island Packet gets an \"incomplete\" grade on their coverage of the issue. For some reason the refused to print the documented corruption of the owners of the United Company. Martin Kent and James McGlothlin were up to their eyeballs in the recent scandals in Virginia with the Governor and his wife. McGlothlin gave the Governors wife a no show job at the heart of the ethical and criminal activity Beaufort County and Bluffton residents; you rock. What an outpouring of opposition. Over 3700 people signed the petition. Proud to live in the community with informed involved residents. Last, hats off to Collins Doughtie, you gave so much to our community ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   McGlothlin first sued Hennelly in the Middle District of Florida (the \"Florida Suit\"). Hennelly responded by filing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and (3), based on lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. McGlothlin opposed this motion, and the court found that the Florida Long Arm Statute did not confer jurisdiction over non-resident Hennelly. The court granted the motion to dismiss but gave McGlothlin two weeks to amend his complaint. McGlothlin chose to voluntarily dismiss the Florida Suit two weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   McGlothlin filed suit in this district on January 30, 2018, based the same facts. The complaint brings causes of action for defamation and negligence/ gross negligence/ recklessness, and requests injunctive relief. McGlothlin asks for actual and punitive damages of an amount in excess of $75,000. McGlothlin also asks the court to enjoin Hennelly from making or publishing any other false, defamatory, and/or libelous statements as to McGlothlin, and to order him to remove all information and statements he has already disseminated. Hennelly filed a motion to stay action and award fees under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(d) on February 15, 2018, ECF No. 6, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 16, 2018, Hennelly filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 29. On December 10, 2018, McGlothlin filed his response in opposition, ECF No. 32, and on January 8, 2019, Hennelly filed his response, ECF No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on January 31, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion to dismiss has been fully briefed and is ripe for the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

In regards to the first factor, McGlothlin has claimed that Henelly's online comments were false and defamatory. On May 12,\n   2017, Hennelly posted on his Facebook page a link to the Washington Post Article, including the statement \"a little something the Island Packet overlooked.\" May 12 Facebook Post, ECF No. 1-1. McGlothlin claims that this was done \"in an effort to imply that [McGlothlin] is corrupt or may have committed crimes that constitute a felony, and in order to impugn [his] character publicly.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 9. However, McGlothlin has not alleged that either the contents of the Washington Post Article or Hennelly's statement that the Island Packet overlooked this article were false. Even if McGlothlin did allege the falsity of the Washington Post Article, Hennelly could not be held liable for reposting an article that was not even published by him but by a newspaper. Thus, the court finds that McGlothlin may not base his defamation claims on the May 12 Facebook Post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court next considers the May 23 Facebook Post. McGlothlin alleges that Hennelly published the following false and defamatory statements about him on Facebook: (1) McGlothlin is a \"Crony Capitalist\" and a \"crook\" (appears in both the Island Packet Comment and the May 23 Facebook Post); (2) McGlothlin gave the corrupt Governor McDonald of Virginia['s] wife a \"no show\" job (appears in both the Island Packet Comment and the May 23 Facebook Post); (3) McGlothlin is a \"crooked owner\" seeking a government handout (appears only in the May 23 Facebook Post); and (4) that McGlothlin, as an owner/operator of United, engaged in documented corruption, relating to a highly-publicized scandal involving the Governor of Virginia and his wife (appears in both the Island Packet Comment and the May 23 Facebook Post). ECF No. 1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Turning to the Island Packet Comment, the Island Packet Article itself discusses how McGlothlin built many golf courses over the last thirty years and references the efforts of McGlothlin's company to redevelop Hilton Head National Golf Club. In the comment section below the web version of the Island Packet Article, Hennelly wrote that \"McGlothlin gave the corrupt Governor McDonald of Virginia['s] wife a 'no show' job\" and refers to McGlothlin and others as \"crony capitalists.\" ECF No. 1-2. McGlothlin does not specifically allege in his complaint that any of these statements in the Island Packet Comment are false and defamatory. Rather, the only statements that he explicitly claims to be false and defamatory are those \"made and published on Facebook,\" which are enumerated in the preceding paragraph.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 14. However, because most of these statements in the May 23 Facebook Post-which McGlothlin has explicitly identified as false and defamatory in paragraph 14 of his complaint-also appear in the Island Packet Comment, the court will construe the complaint as alleging that these statements in the Island Packet Comment are false and defamatory as well. Thus, the court finds that McGlothlin has sufficiently alleged that Hennelly made four false and defamatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the complaint sufficiently alleges that Hennelly's statements constitutes an unprivileged publication to a third party. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, the complaint sufficiently alleges that Hennelly is at fault for \"publishing\" these statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the court must consider whether McGlothlin has sufficiently alleged that Hennelly's Island Packet Comment and May 23 Facebook Post caused him special harm, or that the statements are actionable\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , regardless of special harm. South Carolina courts have found that \"essentially, all libel is actionable\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Holtzscheiter II\n   </em>\n   , at 502. Thus, as Hennelly's allegedly defamatory statements were written libel, and are therefore actionable\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , the court finds that McGlothlin has sufficiently pleaded the final factor of South Carolina's defamation cause of action. If the court were to stop at this point, it would deny the motion to dismiss and find that McGlothlin need not plead special damages. Yet the court must first consider what limitations the First Amendment's right to free speech places on the reach of McGlothlin's defamation suit against Hennelly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. First Amendment Limitations on Defamation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although a plaintiff might be able to prove all of the elements of South Carolina common law defamation, his claims might still be circumscribed by the First Amendment protections of free speech. The court first analyzes McGlothlin's claims under the framework established by the Supreme Court for suits brought by both public and private figures against defendants who have made opinion statements on matters of public concern. Next, the court considers whether any of Hennelly's allegedly defamatory statements are inactionable due to their rhetorical nature or because they are, as Hennelly argues, opinions based on disclosed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

The two remaining defamatory statements are that McGlothlin gave the corrupt Governor McDonald of Virginia's wife a \"no show\" job, and that McGlothlin, as an owner/operator of United, engaged in documented corruption relating to a highly publicized scandal involving the Governor of Virginia and his wife. The court finds that Hennelly's contention that McGlothlin gave the governor's wife a \"no show\" job is not so much a statement of fact as it is a personal opinion deriving from his statement that McGlothlin engaged in documented corruption relating to the scandal that surrounded the Governor of Virginia. However, as this statement reads more as an actionable opinion than an inactionable rhetorical hyperbole, the court considers it in conjunction with Hennelly's statement regarding McGlothlin's involvement in documented corruption with the Governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Gertz\n   </em>\n   standard, the court views these statements as opinions related to matters of local public concern, specifically because they were made (1) in a comment to an online article regarding McGlothlin's\n   business and his attempts to rezone Hilton Head National and (2) in a Facebook post issued the day after the Beaufort County Council denied the Rezoning Application, in which Hennelly summarizes his thoughts on the rezoning effort and on the people involved. The Rezoning Application was publicly known and was voted on by the Council after public meetings with members of the community who were given the opportunity to voice their concerns. Clearly, one of Hennelly's concerns was that the man behind the company reportedly had some ethical shortcomings, which could reasonably affect the public's view of the Rezoning Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court must next determine whether the plaintiff is a public figure or a private figure. If the court finds that McGlothlin is public figure, or even a limited-purpose public figure, then McGlothlin must prove that Hennelly posted all of these statements with actual malice-with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard to their falsity. The Fourth Circuit has offered the following test to help courts determine whether a plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) the plaintiff had access to channels of effective communication; (2) the plaintiff voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in a public controversy; (3) the plaintiff sought to influence the resolution or outcome of the controversy; (4) the controversy existed prior to the publication of the defamatory statements; and (5) the plaintiff retained public figure status at the time of the alleged defamation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478143\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/666/#p668\">\n    691 F.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668 (4th Cir. 1982). Given that this question is before the court upon a motion to dismiss, constraining the court to consider only the facts alleged in the complaint or contained within the documents attached to the complaint or referenced therein, the court needs more facts outside of those alleged in these documents to determine with proper certainty whether McGlothlin is a public figure. This is a question more appropriate for a summary judgment motion after discovery has been conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even presuming that the court finds McGothlin to be a private figure plaintiff, because these allegedly defamatory statements involve a matter of public concern, McGlothlin is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Gertz\n   </em>\n   from obtaining any relief beyond actual damages unless he proves that Hennelly acted with actual malice regarding the falsity of the statements. The court suspects that a jury would likely find that Hennelly did not act with actual malice in regards to these statements. On the contrary, the Washington Post Article could easily allow a jury to determine that Hennelly reasonably believed that his statements were true. However, McGlothlin has alleged that Hennelly \"engaged in [ ] defamatory conduct as to [McGlothlin], intentionally making and publishing false statements concerning [McGlothlin], with the intent to harm his reputation, or alternatively, making and publishing such statements with reckless disregard for the truth ... so as to lower [his] reputation in [ ] the community.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 11. Thus, the court finds that he has sufficiently alleged actual malice for purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The other important result of this First Amendment analysis is that, if McGlothlin were found to be a private plaintiff, he must prove that the statements are false and that he suffered harm in order to collect actual damages. Ordinarily under South Carolina defamation law, the fact that the statements are libel would qualify them as actionable\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , which removes the requirement that that\n   the plaintiff prove that he suffered general damages. However, the\n   <em>\n    Gertz\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   First Amendment standard reasserts this requirement that McGlothlin prove his actual damages, despite South Carolina common law not requiring this for actionable\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   defamatory statements. McGlothlin's complaint alleges that Hennelly's statements have injured his business and his reputation in the community, that he has suffered \"injured feelings, mental suffering and anguish, and personal and public humiliation,\" and finally that he has \"suffered damages, including but not limited to, lost opportunities, diminished sales and trade relations, and harm to his goodwill associated with his ongoing business and reputation in the community.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, 34, and 35. The court again finds these allegations sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, given that the specific details supporting these alleged harms might be produced during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In conclusion, the court is unable to dismiss McGlothlin's entire complaint at this stage of the litigation based on the above First Amendment framework. The court will revisit this question should the parties choose to bring a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Rhetorical Hyperbole\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court next considers whether some of Hennelly's allegedly defamatory statements are inactionable due to their rhetorical and hyperbolic nature.\n   <em>\n    Gertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   , and subsequent Fourth Circuit case law has carved out greater protections for \"statements that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/\">\n    497 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the Court did make clear that it wished to provide \"assurance that public debate will not suffer for lack of 'imaginative expression' or the 'rhetorical hyperbole' which has traditionally added much to the discourse of our Nation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They are not capable of being proven false or even properly defined. And the \"general tenor\" of these statements in the context of a Facebook post and a long, emotive comment on a newspaper article \"negates any impression that the speaker is asserting actual facts\" in regards to these particular statements. The court concludes that these rhetorical statements in the Island Packet\n   Comment and May 23 Facebook Post warrant First Amendment protection and that McGlothlin may not base his claims on these statements going forward. The only remaining statements upon which McGlothlin may continue his defamation suit, therefore, are Hennelly's statement that McGlothlin \"as owner / operator of United, engaged in documented corruption, relating to a highly-publicized scandal involving the Governor of Virginia and his wife\" and his related statement that McGlothlin \"gave the corrupt Governor McDonald of Virginia['s] [sic] wife a 'no show' job.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

However, all of the law that Hennelly cites for the \"well-established\" proposition that \"opinions based on disclosed facts are protected\" involve situations where the defamatory statement is made in conjunction with the disclosed facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"170285\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/11/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Agora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20F.%20Supp.%202d%20697\">\n    90 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   704 ).

The court found that \" '[h]efty' is the author's opinion of the mark-up based on his estimate that the wholesale cost of the items in the Gift Pac was under $8\" and that \"[b]ecause the bases for the 'hefty mark-up' conclusion are fully disclosed, no reasonable reader would consider the term anything but the opinion of the author drawn from the circumstances related.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517482\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/1087/\">\n    993 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1093 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Comm. v.

The court recognizes that his statements regarding McGlothlin's engagement in documented corruption with the Governor of Virginia and giving the Governor's wife a \"no show\" job could reasonably be viewed as his interpretation of the facts laid out in the Washington Post Article. However, these statements were not made in conjunction with the facts from the Washington Post Article. If Hennelly\n   had made these statements alongside his May 12 Facebook Post, which included the Washington Post Article, then they would not have been actionable. In that case, the Washington Post Article would have provided all of the facts upon which these two comments were made, and the reader could easily have interpreted them as Hennelly's interpretation of this article. However, the Island Packet Comment is not at all connected to the Washington Post Article, and the Island Packet Article itself does not sufficiently provide the factual basis for Hennelly's comments. The court considered whether Hennelly's May 23 Facebook Post was sufficiently close in time and proximity to the May 12 Facebook Post which included Washington Post Article, in a way that would allow the reader to rely on the facts in the Washington Post Article when reading Hennelly's May 23 Facebook Post. The court was not provided with any evidence that the two Facebook posts were adjacent to one another to allow such a reading. More importantly, as discussed above, when courts have found that a statement is an inactionable opinion based on disclosed facts, those \"facts\" were actually disclosed within the same statement-they were written in the same article or existed within the confines of the allegedly defamatory statement. Here, by contrast, the facts in the Washington Post Article were not \"disclosed\" in the May 23 Facebook Post. The disclosure of the Washington Post Article occurred in a separate Facebook post from Hennelly's statements in the May 23 Facebook Post. Thus, a reader could have viewed Hennelly's May 23 Facebook Post with the allegedly defamatory statements without the benefit of seeing the Washington Post Article, and thus without being able to view Hennelly's statements as mere interpretations of the facts in the Washington Post Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Island Packet Comment and the May 23 Facebook Post did not disclose the facts upon which they were based, and \"an unsupported statement of opinion that implies defamatory facts can be actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Moldea v.

Surely he does not presume that the court will construe every sentence in the online posts as false-for example, that \"Chairman Paul Summerville did an excellent job\" or that \"Beaufort County and Bluffton residents; you rock.\" The only place that McGlothlin has provided guidance regarding which statements he contends to be both false and defamatory is in paragraph 14 of the complaint.
