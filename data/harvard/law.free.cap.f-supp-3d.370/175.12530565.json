The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"D.C. Circuit\") has held that contributions to such independent expenditure-only political action committees \"cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption\" and therefore limits on contributions to these groups are unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    SpeechNow.org v.

Cir. 2010) (en banc). The upshot of this holding is that certain political action committees, commonly known as \"Super\n   PACs\" can \"receive unlimited amounts of money from both individuals and corporations\" and \"engage in unlimited electioneering communications, so long as their activities are not made 'in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of' a candidate, his or her authorized political committee, or a national, State, or local committee of a political party.\"\n   <em>\n    Stop This Insanity, Inc.

The Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\" or \"Commission\") disagreed explaining that under\n   <em>\n    SpeechNow\n   </em>\n   the Super PACs actions were lawful. Accordingly, the FEC dismissed the administrative complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this action alleging the FEC acted \"contrary to law\" when it dismissed the administrative complaint against the Super PACs because the FEC relied on\n   <em>\n    SpeechNow\n   </em>\n   --an allegedly unlawful judicial ruling. Pending before the Court is FEC's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs have the daunting task of persuading this Court to rule inconsistently with the D.C.
