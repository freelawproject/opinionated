Gray Wolves\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained by Judge Sullivan, I adopt her conclusions that the Forest Service's \"No Effect\" determination violated the ESA and NEPA. I clarify,\n   however, that upon remand, the agency must properly consult with the FWS under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402.14, meaning that it must comply with the ESA consultation requirement by formally consulting under \u00a7 402.14(a)\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   it is excepted from formal consultation by meeting the requirements set forth in \u00a7 402.14(b) and \u00a7 402.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. Elk Habitat\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons explained by Judge Sullivan, I adopt her conclusions that the Forest Service violated NFMA and NEPA in regard to the elk habitat claims. In their objections, the Federal Defendants argue that Judge Sullivan exceeded the scope of her authority under the APA by ordering the Forest Service to map calving sites and wallows upon remand. I do not read the F &amp; R in quite the same way. In assessing whether the Forest Service complied with the Forest Plan's requirements regarding protection of elk calving sites and wallows, Judge Sullivan explained that the while the SFEIS contained some seasonal restrictions applicable to known sites, the SFEIS and ROD failed to identify where known calving sites and wallows are located or how they relate to the Project open routes. F &amp; R at 20. She also noted the absence of maps or otherwise documented locations of specific elk wallows to which timing restrictions would apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the SFEIS and ROD do not identify where known wallows are located or how they are located in relation to Project open routes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Sullivan acknowledged Defendants' argument that the Forest Service is entitled to deference regarding how to meet its obligations to minimize disturbances and to protect calving sites and wallows.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (further acknowledging the argument that the Forest Plan does not contain specific mandates on how the Forest Service must minimize disturbance and does not impose specific seasonal use restrictions). She explained however, that the issue was not one of scientific interpretation or judgment to which agency deference would apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, she found that without data identifying the location of the sites, the Forest Service could not meets its obligation to protect the sites or minimize disturbance to them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As I understand her reasoning, Judge Sullivan found that without data regarding the location of elk calving sites and wallows, the Forest Service failed to offer a rational explanation for how the Project meets the Forest Plan's requirement to protect those sites and minimize disturbances. While I agree with Judge Sullivan that without more specific information regarding the locations of the sites in relation to the Project's proposed designated routes, the Forest Service fails to sufficiently explain how it protects the sites and minimizes disturbances to them, I do not read the F &amp; R as requiring actual mapping of the sites. It may be that such mapping is the best way to provide the missing explanation but there is no specific directive in the F &amp; R that the agency\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   produce maps. The problem with the SFEIS and the ROD is the failure of a rational explanation showing how the Forest Service is complying with these particular Forest Plan directives. How the Forest Service chooses to remedy this error is not something the F &amp; R expressly dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. Riparian Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons explained by Judge Sullivan, I adopt her conclusions regarding the riparian claims under NFMA and NEPA with one exception: I disagree with her finding that the Forest Service properly supported its modification of INFISH RMOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Forest Service modified INFISH RMOs for woody debris, stream temperature, and width/depth ratios. Judge Sullivan agreed with the Forest Service that it provided sufficient justification for those modifications. F &amp; R at 41-42. She explained that the Forest Service analyzed habitat indicators and used specific criteria to determine how well each indicator functioned in the watersheds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 42 (citing AR 25355-64). The indicators were water quality, including stream temperatures and sediment/turbidity, habitat access including physical barriers to fish passage, and habitat elements including large woody material, pool frequency and quality, and channel width/depth ratios.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She explained that the Forest Service analyzed the RMOs for stream temperature based on references concerning the size of, and average temperatures of, streams where redband trout are typically found and the average maximum temperatures suitable for spawning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 25355-57). The agency modified the width/depth ratio RMO by adopting a more nuanced stream system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 25356-61; Supp'l AR 942). Judge Sullivan concluded that these studies provided specific data for the Forest Service, applying its expertise, to modify the RMOs under \"the deferential standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I agree with Judge Sullivan that the Forest Service analyzed various habitat indicators and cited to certain studies in support of the RMO modifications. If INFISH did not have more specific modification requirements, I would agree with Judge Sullivan that the agency's conclusions were supported under the deferential standard. But, I agree with Central Oregon Landwatch that INFISH mandates specific watershed or stream reach specific data supporting the change to an INFISH RMO. Because that did not occur here, the SFEIS does not comply with INFISH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   INFISH created interim RMOs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which are subject to modification, but only after certain prerequisites have been met. At the time they were adopted in 1995, the interim RMOs were \"considered to be the best watershed scale information available.[.]\" AR 2564. INFISH recognized that specific watershed or stream reach conditions based on local geology, topography, climate, and potential vegetation should be considered in refining RMOs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It encouraged Forest Service managers \"to establish site-specific RMO's through watershed analysis or site specific analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   INFISH requires the \"completion of watershed analysis\" before establishing non-interim, site-specific RMOs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In lieu of that analysis, it also allows modification of an interim RMO in the \"absence of watershed analysis where watershed or stream reach specific data support the change.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as I read the INFISH requirements, a Forest Service manager may replace INFISH interim RMOs with site-specific non-interim RMOs only after \"completion of watershed analysis\" and may modify INFISH interim RMOs for particular projects in the absence of watershed analysis only where \"watershed or stream reach specific data support the change.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The SFEIS cites the interim INFISH RMOs which are relevant to the Project and redband trout. AR 25351-52 (water temperature, bank stability, large woody debris, pool frequency). In modifying the INFISH RMOs for large woody debris, stream temperature, and width/depth ratios,\n   the Forest Service explained that the modified RMOs described the habitat in the Project Area better than INFISH. AR 25351 (RMOs varied from INFISH based on studies \"for RMOs [that] better describe the habitat in the project area than INFISH\"); AR 26028 (acknowledging INFISH RMOs but noting that other RMOs \"have been better defined for the project area\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to large woody debris, the Forest Service modified the INFISH RMO (more than 20 pieces per mile of woody debris that is greater than 12 inches in diameter and 35 feet long), AR 2566, to one that provided for debris of the same diameter and length but increased the frequency to more than 48 pieces per mile in class IV streams and more than 69 pieces per mile in other streams. AR 25356. The SFEIS explained that this change was based on a 1995 study addressing \"[r]eference conditions\" for large woody debris documented in Oregon's Blue Mountains, which the SFEIS described as a \"physiographic province more similar to the watersheds within the [Project] area.\" AR 25359.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As for stream temperature, the INFISH RMO provides for no measurable increase in maximum water temperature, with a maximum water temperature below 59\u00b0F within adult holding habitat and below 48\u00b0F within spawning and rearing habitats. AR 25352. The SFEIS explained that \"[r]edband trout have been found to typically be present in small- to medium-sized streams between 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) and 61\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), [and] outside of this range they are less likely to be present (Meyer et al 2010).\" AR 25357. The Forest Service considered that the \"state of Oregon assumes that waters\" with a \"seven-day average maximum temperature\" that does not exceed 18.0\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F) \"will provide water temperatures suitable for redband trout spawning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on this information, the agency used RMOs that classified stream temperature as \"Good\" if its seven-day-average maximum temperature was between 10\u00b0C (50F) and 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), as \"Fair,\" if it was between 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) and 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F), and \"Poor\" if it was greater than 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F). AR 25355, AR 25357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to width/depth ratios, the INFISH RMO has a width/depth ratio objective of less than ten for all stream systems regardless of specific characteristics. AR 2566. The Forest Service modified the RMO based on a study by Rosgen that identified width/depth ratios based on the type of stream. AR 25356, 2536; Supp'l AR 942.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Forest Service's explanations for its modifications to the INFISH interim RMOs do not cite to \"watershed or stream reach specific data support[ing] the change.\" Instead, the Forest Service cites to a study conducted in the Blue Mountains (large, woody debris), information based on state standards for streams identified as having salmon and trout rearing and migration (stream temperature), and a 1996 \"Applied River Morphology\" study which provided width/depth ratios based on stream type (width/depth ratio). None of these references and studies appear to have relied on data from watersheds or specific stream reaches in the Ochoco National Forest. Because such data is unambiguously required by INFISH before modification to an RMO may occur, the SFEIS violates INFISH. Accordingly, I decline to adopt the portion of the F &amp; R which found that the Forest Service complied with INFISH requirements in modifying RMOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Other than the clarifications provided above regarding the claims related to gray wolves and elk habitat, and other than the INFISH RMO modification claim, I adopt\n   all of the F &amp; R's other findings and recommended conclusions. Thus, the Court ADOPTS Magistrate Judge Sullivan's Findings &amp; Recommendation [89] in part, and therefore, the parties' motions for summary judgment [48, 57, 58, 69] are granted in part and denied in part as explained in the F &amp; R and as modified herein.

The Forest Service proposed an OHV trail system to meet the demand for OHV recreational opportunities and address unauthorized user-created trails. AR 8581-83.

LandWatch's argues that the Forest Service's determination\n   that the Project would have \"no effect\" on endangered gray wolves is flawed in part because the Project would affect elk, the wolves' primary prey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 25479. However, the Record already indicates that, and the Forest Service has considered that, the Project would impact elk habitat and distribution, and this indicates potential effects on gray wolves via effects on their prey. Maps overlaying the Project Area, elk security habitats, vegetation management activities, and other special habitat types, as proffered by LandWatch, do not contribute to, inform, or alter this analysis. Although elk, their habitats, and the Project's effects on those habitats are relevant to the parties' ESA claims regarding gray wolves, the specific subject matter of these maps is not.

For the same reasons that LandWatch's maps do not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Lands Council\n   </em>\n   exceptions, amicus' map is not admissible under the APA. It was created after the administrative process and was not before the agency. It does not demonstrate, beyond what the Administrative Record already contains, how the Forest Service purportedly failed to consider the Project's impacts on gray wolves, and it does not explain terms or subject matter too technical or complex for the Court to otherwise understand. As for the ESA, the proffered map does not contribute to the Administrative Record as is relevant to the Court's analysis. The parties' ESA arguments simply rely on the fact that wolves disperse through the Project Area, which the Administrative Record already indicates. Amicus' proposed submission is not properly considered as extra-record evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The Passarelli Declaration, therefore, is not submitted in support of federal defendants' arguments on the merits or the substance of the parties' Motions for Summary Judgment. It is thus fundamentally different from LandWatch's and amicus' proposed submissions. Because it is not presented for purposes of adjudicating the parties' claims under the APA or the ESA, the above-described standards do not govern the Passarelli Declaration's admissibility. Rather, the question is whether the Declaration is relevant and admissible for these limited evidentiary purposes under generally applicable rules of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court has determined that LandWatch's and amicus' proffered evidence is not properly admitted, and the Court's determination thereon does not rely on the Passarelli Declaration.

AR 25518-19. Table 8 in the SFEIS Transportation Section repeats 1,069 miles of existing open road. AR 25283.

AR 25532, 25540, 25567-70. The SFEIS does not explain why user-created trails were excluded from the road density analysis. Presumably, elk are unable to distinguish between user-created and Forest-Service-created motorized routes, especially given that open road density is one of the main factors influencing the effectiveness of big game habitat. AR 1676. Adding in 700 miles of user-created roads raises the road density to 3.75 mi/mi\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   , well above Forest Plan limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Moreover, the SFEIS elsewhere states that there are 1,820 miles of open road in the Project Area. AR 25280, 25343. The derivation of this number is unclear, as is how many of these miles could have been excluded from the road density calculations, or why. It appears that the Forest Service may have used the larger 1,820-mile figure when it analyzed certain of the Project's impacts in order to minimize their appearance. For example, with regard to Project impact on soils, the SFEIS states that \"new trails add only 3 percent to the total 1,820 miles of roads and trails .... Total existing road and trail acreage impacts would be increased by less than 0.014 percent ....\" AR 25341. And, \"new trails add only 4.6 percent of the total 1,820 miles of road ... in the project area.\" AR 25345-46. The Forest Service argues that 669 miles of these are closed\n   roads, and that the road density requirement applies only to open roads. However, this yields (1,820 - 669) 1,151 miles of road, yielding an even higher road density calculation, when added to user-created trails and new Project routes. Further, defendants admit that these closed roads receive unauthorized OHV use, AR 25472, which adds to and repeats the problem of arbitrarily excluding user-created trails from road density calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Forest Service's provision of these unexplained, significantly different mileage figures, and its omission of user-created trails from road density calculations, was arbitrary and capricious. The use of and conflicting data and calculations undermines the legitimacy and validity of the Forest Service's determinations regarding whether it has complied with the substantive road density requirements. These figures make the SFEIS and ROD internally inconsistent, and arbitrarily and capriciously skew the road density calculations. This also violates the agency's obligation to be accurate and transparent in calculating figures so that the public is provided with quality information, and to ensure that meets Forest Plan requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p960\">\n    418 F.3d at 964-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In response to plaintiffs' contentions, the Forest Service argues that the agency has discretion in the administrative process regarding the road calculations. Defendants argue that the Forest Service exercised its discretion in choosing which roads to include in the road density analysis. However, there is no explanation or justification for the exclusion of user-created trails. Defendants argue that the Forest Plan does not explicitly require the inclusion of closed or user-created trails in the road density analysis. The question is whether the Forest Service has adequately explained and justified the decision to exclude these trails, which the Forest Service has not done. They argue that the 1,820 mile figure is irrelevant because it is for a \"separate analytical purpose,\" Fed. Def. MSJ, at 43 (Docket No. 69), but do not explain this purpose or why the Forest Service could use different calculations of total mileage to reach conclusions in certain contexts and different conclusions in others.

The Forest Service did not properly analyze how trail designation would minimize impacts to special landscapes, such as scablands and old growth management areas, and to wildlife and wildlife habitats, particularly with regard to elk calving sites and wallows. It also failed to sufficiently analyze how trail designation would minimize conflict among other users of roads and trails, such as equestrians and hikers.

During the administrative process, Guardians submitted scientific studies regarding recommendations for minimizing such effects.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , AR 27020-21, 27053-65.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    With regard to route designation, Guardians also argue that defendants violated NEPA by not providing adequate baseline data regarding Project routes through scablands. Although Guardians' arguments repeat broad calls for \"accurate\" and \"relevant\" baseline data, the only specific datum Guardians call for is regarding whether routes through scablands would be on open system roads, closed roads, or non-system roads. Guardians otherwise do not indicate how the Forest Service's provision of data regarding routes through scablands was deficient. In any event, the SFEIS provided the total number of trail miles through scabland areas under each action alternative that would be on newly constructed trails (new disturbance), on closed or decommissioned roads (existing disturbance), and on open roads. AR 25592. The ROD includes maps showing the routes through scablands on decommissioned or closed roads, on open roads, and on new trails. AR 28721-22. The Forest Service discussed the effects of the Project and how it minimize such effects.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    Defendants argue that the parties previously agreed that the question of remedies would be subject to additional briefing, were the Court to find agency error, and that the Court determined that it would receive additional briefing on remedies; defendants cite to the December 8, 2017 Scheduling Conference transcript.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sched. Conf. Tr. (Docket No. 82); Fed. Defs. Reply, Ex. 1 (Docket No. 83-1). However, careful reading of the transcript shows that, while the Court did entertain whether to separately address the question of remedies, and whether that would be subject to separate briefing, the Court did not make a determination on this question, did not formally order as such, did not bifurcate the case, and so forth.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 35-36. Further, the Court finds that this matter has received more than sufficient briefing and that further briefing is not called for. The Court finds that it may properly consider, and issue a recommendation on, the question of remedies based on the briefing and record presently before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
