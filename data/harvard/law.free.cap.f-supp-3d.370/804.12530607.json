Having considered the parties' submissions, the Court concludes that oral argument is not necessary to resolve the issues presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W.D. Mich. LCivR 7.2(d). For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a lifelong resident of Michigan (Verified Compl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 1). He first registered to vote in 2002, has voted in most primary and general elections since then, and is a qualified elector under Michigan law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Ruth Johnson is the Secretary of State of the State of Michigan (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Secretary Johnson has the duty to \"[a]dvise and direct local election officials as to the proper methods of conducting elections.\" MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 168.31(b). Further, Secretary Johnson has the power to investigate and refer violations of the challenged provisions for prosecution. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 168.31(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff owns and usually carries a cell phone that can capture digital photographs and video and upload such files to social media accounts (Verified Compl. \u00b6 11). On November 6, 2012, Plaintiff responded to a prompt on social media to write-in vote for an acquaintance from college for an office in the Michigan general election (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). After voting, Plaintiff not only disclosed his vote but also provided a photograph of part of his marked ballot, i.e., a \"ballot selfie,\" which he took with his cell phone within a voting station inside a polling place (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 13 at PageID.41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 9, 2016, Plaintiff filed a three-count Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, alleging the following counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I. MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 168.579 and \u00a7 168.738(2) Violate the First Amendment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   II. The Secretary of State's Instruction and Order Regarding Photography in Polling Places (\"Secretary's Rule 1\") Violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   III. The Secretary of State's Instruction and Order Regarding the Use of Cell Phones in Voting Stations (\"Secretary's Rule 2\") Violates the First Amendment\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (ECF No. 1). According to Plaintiff, his lawsuit endeavors to respect the integrity of the voting process, including ballot secrecy, \"while calling upon this Court to recognize that circumstances today-namely, the advancement of technology and the advent of new outlets for political speech through social media on the Internet-require existing law to be more reasonably tailored\" (ECF No. 13 at PageID.42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 23, 2016, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 12), requesting this Court enter an order enjoining Secretary Johnson from \"enforcing MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7\u00a7 168.579, 168.738(2) against the photographing of one's own ballot and display of such photographs outside of polling places\" and to \"enjoin enforcement of orders identified as Secretary's Rule 1 and Secretary's Rule 2\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.38). On October 24, 2016, before the 2016 presidential election, this Court issued the Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 19). Secretary Johnson filed an interlocutory appeal, and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Preliminary Injunction, reasoning, in pertinent part, that Plaintiff's \"belated challenge to Michigan's election procedures prejudices the State's interest in holding orderly elections\" (ECF No. 30; ECF No. 26 at PageID.320).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently moved to amend his Complaint to add a new Count IV: \" MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7\u00a7 168.579, 168.738(2), Secretary's Instruction 1 and Secretary's Instruction 2 Violate the Fourteenth Amendment\" (ECF No. 50). Following a motion hearing on October 11, 2017, this Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend his Complaint to add the due process claim (Order, ECF No. 64). This Court's Order also set forth a briefing schedule on Defendant's proposed motion to dismiss Count IV, limited to the issue of standing (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), a motion that has since been fully briefed (ECF Nos. 70-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Motion Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Secretary Johnson brings her motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) (ECF No. 71 at PageID.725).

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Secretary Johnson argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue Count IV. In Count IV, Plaintiff alleges that MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7\u00a7 168.579, 168.738(2), and Secretary's Instructions 1 and 2 violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because \" MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7\u00a7 168.579, 168.738(2) provide no opportunity to be heard before depriving Michigan voters, including Crookston, of the right to vote\" and \"[e]nforcement of the Secretary's Instructions 1 and 2 threaten to deprive Michigan voters, including Crookston, of the right to vote without any opportunity to be heard\" (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-47, ECF No. 65 at PageID.695).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 579 of the Michigan Election Code governs voting in a primary election and provides in pertinent part that \"[i]f an elector, after marking his or her ballot, exposes it to any person in a manner likely to reveal the name of any candidate for whom the elector voted, the board of election inspectors shall reject the ballot and the elector shall forfeit the right to vote at the primary.\" MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 168.579. Section 738 of the Michigan Election Code, which governs all elections, similarly provides in pertinent part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If an elector shows his or her ballot or any part of the ballot to any person other than a person lawfully assisting him or her in the preparation of the ballot or a minor child accompanying that elector in the booth or voting compartment under section 736a, after the ballot has been marked, to disclose any part of the face of the ballot, the ballot shall not be deposited in the ballot box, but shall be marked \"rejected for exposure\", and shall be disposed of as are other rejected ballots. If an elector exposes his or her ballot, a note of the occurrence shall be entered on the poll list opposite his or her name and the elector shall not be allowed to vote at the election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 168.738(2). Moreover, Michigan law provides that \"[a]ny person who shall be found guilty of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this act shall, unless herein otherwise provided, be punished by a fine of [sic] not exceeding $ 500.00, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding 90 days, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.\" MICH.

Secretary Johnson argues that Plaintiff has similarly failed to allege an injury-in-fact based on enforcement of the Instructions because he has never been subject to enforcement based on violating the Instructions, and in any event, the penalty for violating the challenged photography prohibition is not loss of the right to vote (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.722-725).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that he and any other qualified Michigan voter need not be disenfranchised before seeking vindication of the activity of taking a ballot photograph while voting (ECF No. 72 at PageID.726). Plaintiff argues that his right to vote is a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized under the Michigan Constitution and law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.729-730). Plaintiff argues that the current procedure in place for rejecting his ballot should he engage in ballot photography does not adequately protect his procedural due process right: \"it provides no procedure whatsoever outside of a judgment call by poll workers in consultation with the Defendant\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.730). Plaintiff argues that his injury is \"actual or imminent\" in that poll workers can see voters taking a ballot photograph while voting and that he must choose, every time an election approaches, \"between engaging in constitutionally protected speech and being subject to disenfranchisement\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.731). Plaintiff concludes that Secretary Johnson \"may not be empowered with forfeiting a voter's right to vote in a haphazard fashion in the name of\n   <em>\n    protecting\n   </em>\n   voting rights\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.732 [emphasis in original] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reply, Secretary Johnson argues that Plaintiff's mere \"intent\" to take a photograph does not satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement (ECF No. 73 at PageID.756). Secretary Johnson again emphasizes that Plaintiff has no actual injury, nor is there a \"substantial risk of forfeiture\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.756-757).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Again, standing is comprised of the following three elements: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the complained-of conduct; and (3) the injury can be redressed by a favorable ruling.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties did not address the causation and redressability elements in their motion papers, focusing instead on the first element, an injury-in-fact (ECF No. 72 at PageID.728-729; ECF No. 73 at PageID.756). Injury in fact is defined by the Supreme Court as \"the invasion of a legally protected interest, which is (a) concrete\n   and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   at 560,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff identifies his \"legally protected interest\" as his \"right to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment before forfeiting his right to vote\" (ECF No. 72 at PageID.729-730).
