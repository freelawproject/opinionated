SIPPEL, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs in this matter are more than sixteen hundred Peruvian children who live near Defendants' lead smelter in La\n   Oroya, Peru. Plaintiffs allege that they were injured after being exposed to toxic lead emissions from the smelter. The corporate defendants are United States companies, who through their Peruvian subsidiary, owned and operated the lead smelting and refining complex. The individual defendants in this matter are the directors and/or officers of the defendant companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss this case pursuant to the doctrine of international comity, arguing that the principles of international comity require abstention. In a separate motion for the determination of foreign law, Defendants assert that the law of Peru applies to all aspects of this case. Plaintiffs oppose abstention and argue for the application of Missouri law. Significantly, Defendants are also defendants in a companion case in this Court,\n   <em>\n    A.O.A., et al. v.

Perry ruled upon similar motions filed by Defendants in that case based on the same facts, legal theories, and claims in the present case. Because these same issues were decided in Judge Perry's case, I will adopt her reasoning and conclusions of law. Under the principles of issue preclusion Defendants are barred from re-litigating these issues in this case. Even if Defendants were not precluded from raising these matters again, I will deny each motion on the merits of their claims. I conclude that abstention based on international comity is not appropriate and that the law of Missouri should apply to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mo. 2018). The underlying facts of the companion case and this action are the same. Defendants are defendants in both actions and request identical relief - dismissal upon the grounds of international comity and a determination that Peruvian law applies. Defendants present the same legal theories in both cases to support their arguments. Under the principles of issue preclusion, Defendants are barred from re-litigating the same issues in this case that have already been conclusively decided in the companion case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment is determined by federal common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Defendants are the same corporate entities and individuals. The factual underpinnings of both cases are the same, as both cases involve the alleged lead poisoning of hundreds of children from Defendant's metallurgical complex in Peru. The only significant difference between the cases is the identity of the plaintiffs. Defendants raise the same legal theories in both cases, arguing that comity requires dismissal of this action because this Court's ruling will infringe upon Peru's sovereignty. In their motion based on foreign law, Defendants argue that the internal affairs doctrine mandates the application of Peruvian law, that Missouri and Peruvian law are in conflict, and that Peru has a greater interest under the most significant relationship test, thus Peruvian law should apply. Moreover, the parties rely on the same evidence and expert testimony regarding comity and determining foreign law. Judge Perry already rejected these legal theories, reasoning that comity will not infringe upon Peru's sovereignty and this Court could hold defendants liable for their tortious conduct in Missouri.\n   <em>\n    Rennert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528774\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/818/\">\n    350 F.Supp.3d at 853-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the companion case held the internal affairs doctrine is not applicable in this matter and that there is no conflict on the substantive claims between Missouri and Peruvian law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528774\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/818/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 835-36 and 847-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, the companion case actually decided and resulted in a final adjudication of both the comity and foreign law issues.

The principles of issue preclusion are not rigidly applied, thus the focus when applying the principles of collateral estoppel \"will work an injustice on the\n   party against whom estoppel is urged.\"\n   <em>\n    Oldham v.

Defendants fully briefed both matters before Judge Perry and had the opportunity to litigate the issue. I note that Defendants moved for a foreign law determination early on in that lawsuit and Judge Perry withheld a determination so that further discovery could be conducted relevant to that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid v. Doe Run Res. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226174\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/1015/#p1026\">\n    74 F.Supp.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026 (E.D. Mo. 2015). Defendants will not be unfairly prejudiced by the preclusive effect of the companion case because as the same parties, Defendants have fully participated in and have had the opportunity to be heard on the issues now before me.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irving\n   </em>\n   , at 648-649. Because all of the requisite elements for issue preclusion to apply have been met in this case, Defendants are precluded from asserting the same relief and legal theories with respect to international comity and determining foreign law issues they previously raised in the companion case before Judge Perry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I note that the parties did not the raise the preclusive effect of Judge Perry's rulings in the companion case. However, I may raise the issue sua sponte. \"If a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue presented, the court may dismiss the action sua sponte, even though the defense has not been raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413818\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/392/#p412\">\n    530 U.S. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413818\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/392/#p412\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413818\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/392/#p412\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). A court may raise the issue sua sponte because doing so is consistent with policies that underlie the purpose of preclusion: avoiding the burdens of a party unnecessarily litigating an action twice and preserving judicial resources. Although Judge Perry's rulings in the companion case are currently on appeal before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the mere appeal of a ruling does not defeat the preclusive effect of a valid and final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Ross ex rel. Ross v. Board of Educ. of Tp.

Defendants have raised the exact same legal theories, presented the same evidence, and relied on the same facts as in the companion case. All elements necessary to assert issue preclusion have been satisfied. As a result, the motion to dismiss pursuant to the doctrine of international comity and the motion to determine foreign law will be denied under the principles of issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. International Comity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if Defendants arguments regarding international comity are not precluded, I find that comity is not warranted as grounds for abstention. Defendants argue that maintaining this action would interfere with Peru's sovereign interests and would improperly impose United States' standards to regulate the environment and mining operations in Peru. Plaintiffs' assert that Defendants have waived this argument or that it is governed by the law of the case. This argument is without merit. \"[Q]uestions of comity can be raised on the court's own initiative,\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Defendants advocate for dismissal based on the factors set out in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 403 (1987) and under the concept of prescriptive comity. Plaintiffs discuss the concept of prospective adjudicative comity. Under any of the tests, I conclude that abstention on international comity grounds is not required or appropriate here, for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 403 of the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law cites eight factors that a court should consider in determining whether exercising jurisdiction is reasonable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (a) the link of the activity to the territory of the regulating state,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the extent to which the activity takes place within the territory, or has substantial, direct, and foreseeable effect upon or in the territory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (b) the connections, such as nationality, residence, or economic activity between the regulating state and the person principally responsible for the activity to be regulated, or between that state and those whom the regulation is designed to protect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (c) the character of the activity to be regulated, the importance of regulation to the regulating state, the extent to which other states regulate such activities, and the degree to which the desirability of such regulation is generally accepted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (d) the existence of justified expectations that might be protected or hurt by the regulation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (e) the importance of the regulation to the international political, legal, or economic system;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (f) the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the traditions of the international system;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (g) the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (h) the likelihood of conflict with regulation by another state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Prescriptive comity, or \"legislative comity,\" is comity afforded to lawmakers, often legislatures.

After all, citizens of Peru have come to this Court seeking recompense for what they allege are improper actions taken in America by American defendants. Although there is no doubt that Plaintiffs suffered the consequences in Peru, an American court is in\n   the best position to consider the American conduct of American defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While Defendants have consistently argued that this case is not about their conduct in the United States, Plaintiffs have alleged that it is based on Defendants' alleged actions here in the United States.

Discussing the internal affairs doctrine, the court recognized that the issuance of stock is part of the internal affairs of a corporation, which would \"require[ ] the application of the laws of the state of incorporation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993838\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/844/56/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993838\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/844/56/\">\n    at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court, however, nevertheless noted the flexibility of the internal affairs doctrine as applied to pseudo-foreign corporations as well as the most-significant-relationship test used by other courts to apply local law to a foreign corporation's internal affairs, and determined that the internal affairs doctrine did not require application of Delaware law to the agreement in the circumstances of that case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993838\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/844/56/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993838\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/844/56/\">\n    at 61-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Comment e of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 302 explains that matters regarding a corporation's internal administration, such as the election or appointment of directors, the adoption of bylaws, the issuance of corporate shares, or cumulative voting requirements should be governed by a single law.

For each of Plaintiffs' claims under Missouri law, a comparable form of relief exists under Peruvian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Counts I and IV state negligence claims against the corporate entities and individual defendants. Peruvian law recognizes negligence as a cause of action under Articles 1985 and 1981 of the Civil Code of Peru. Article 1981 creates a broad duty of care for those engaged in \"the exercise of their duties\" when \"another person under his command is responsible for said damage\" of a person. [Doc. # 282, Ex. JJJJJ, Espinoza Report at \u00b6 5.52] Defendants were directly or indirectly responsible for the La Oroya Complex and the alleged discharge of pollutants. Article 1985 is analogous to both direct cause and proximate cause, two essential elements for a claim of negligence. Plaintiffs allege that their harm was a foreseeable consequence when Defendants allegedly failed to implement measures to reduce environmental harm. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.62] Article 1985 assesses damages for any consequences derived from the action or omission that generated the harm. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.61] Additionally, Articles 142.1 and 142.2 of the General Environmental Law create a right of action against anyone that causes damage to the environment or human health, specifically defining environmental damage as \"any material impairment suffered by the environment ... that may be caused through the breach of legal provisions and which results in actual or negative potential effects.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.46] The reference to breach of legal provisions is similar to the breach of duty required under American negligence law. Read together these Articles indicate that Peru recognizes claims analogous to negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Counts III and VI state strict liability claims against the corporate entities and individual defendants. Under Article 1970 of the Civil Code, \"anyone through the exercise of a risky or dangerous activity, causes damage to another person, is required to redress said damage.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.30] In discussing multiple cases and health regulations, Professor Espinoza concludes mining and the related mine safety of the environment are considered an implicitly risky activity because these\n   activities can affect the health of persons. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.31-5.40] Additionally, Articles 142.1 and 142.2 of the General Environmental Law allow claims analogous to strict liability because the text of the statute creates a right of action for anyone that causes damage to the environment or human health while engaging in an activity. The text of the statute defines environmental damage as \"any material impairment suffered by the environment...that may be caused through the breach of legal provisions and which results in actual or negative potential effects.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.42] Moreover, Article 142.2 establishes liability for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damage to the environment in connection with an illicit action because of the irregular nature of the activity at issue. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.49]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Counts II and V state conspiracy claims against the corporate entities and individual defendants. Under Peruvian law, Articles 1981 and 1983 establish joint liability for the actions of a parent and subsidiary, an analogous claim to civil conspiracy. Under Article 1981, liability can be established from an underlying illicit act and if multiple parties are engaged in the illicit act, then all parties are jointly liable on the basis of fully compensating the victims. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.28. When the underlying act is one of strict liability, then both principal and agent are jointly liable. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.29] Under Article 1983, mere environmental damage can suffice to establish joint liability. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.55] These articles are analogous to a conspiracy claim because it is the participation in an illicit act itself, which is a similar to an act that is in the furtherance of a conspiracy. Further, the Peruvian bar for a conspiracy claim is lower than the Missouri requirements because Missouri requires an underlying tort to satisfy the unlawful act, whereas Peruvian law does not have this requirement and mere environmental harm can suffice to establish liability. For similar reasons Count VII, contribution against all defendants, does not conflict with Missouri law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although Peruvian law may not identify the claims at issue by the same doctrinal name and Peru's litigation procedure is different than in Missouri, this does not mean that the same substantive relief cannot be obtained in both jurisdictions. Given the similarity in the causes of action under Peruvian and Missouri law, making a further choice-of-law analysis is unnecessary. Defendants have failed to prove a true conflict exists between Missouri and Peruvian law. If the movant fails to prove foreign law with reasonable certainty, a district court should apply the law of the forum.\n   <em>\n    Banque Libanaise Pour Le Commerce v. Khreich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539702\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/1000/#p1006\">\n    915 F.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006-07 (5th Cir. 1990). The parties offer conflicting experts on Peruvian law, who reach opposite conclusions regarding the same provisions of Peruvian law. This indicates a lack of reasonable certainty regarding which controlling law to apply, either Missouri or Peru. Missouri law will apply in this case because of the lack of conflict between Peruvian law and that of Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   C. Missouri Law Applies Under the Most Significant Relationship Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if a conflict were present, under the principles of the most-significant-relationship test, Missouri law would still control. There is no doubt that the injuries occurred in Peru, but that does not mean that the conduct giving rise to injuries occurred solely in Peru. Plaintiffs allege that the decisions made by Defendants in Missouri directly gave rise to Plaintiffs' injuries. Missouri has a substantial connection with this case because Missouri is the principal place of business of several of the corporate defendants and most of the individual defendants resided\n   or worked here during the relevant times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Ill.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1207422\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/644/594/#p613\">\n    644 F.2d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (7th Cir. 1981) (noting an interest because of principal place of business).

Missouri has an interest in applying its tort law because - as the state where several Defendants are incorporated and the misconduct occurred - Missouri has a greater ability to control corporate behavior by deterrence or punishment than Peru, the place where the injury occurred.\n   <em>\n    In re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Ill.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1207422\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/644/594/#p613\">\n    644 F.2d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
