INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Juan Carlos Ramirez-Ortiz was charged with violating Title 8, United States Code, Section 1325(a)(2). (ECF No. 1 \"Compl.\"; ECF No. 16). The Government alleged that on January 2, 2019, a Border Patrol Agent intercepted Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz and two other individuals in a remote area of Copper Canyon, located approximately three miles east of the Otay Mesa, California Port of Entry and approximately one mile north of the boundary between the United States and Mexico. (Compl.; ECF No. 12 at 2-3). Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz told the Border Agent he was a citizen of Honduras without permission to be in the United States. (Compl.) Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz was arrested and transported to a Border Patrol Station to be questioned. (Compl.; ECF No. 12 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 3, 2019, Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz appeared before a magistrate judge with his assigned Federal Public Defender and was charged with \"knowingly elud[ing] examination and inspection by Immigration Officers\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). (ECF No. 3). On January 23, 2019, Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz moved the Court to dismiss the Complaint. (ECF No. 9). On January 31, 2019, the Court denied Mr. Ramirez-Ortiz's Motion and proceeded with the bench trial. The Court found Defendant guilty of Count 1 of the Misdemeanor Information. (ECF No. 24). The Court stated that it would place its reasons for the denial of the motions in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant moved the Court to dismiss the complaint based on (1) a violation of equal protection and due process; (2) a violation of his statutory right to apply for asylum; (3) violation of international treaty obligations; and, (4) the unconstitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(ECF No. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court will address each of Defendant's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Equal Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant argues that individuals charged with \u00a7 1325 in this district are treated more harshly than other defendants facing equivalent or lesser offenses, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. (ECF No. 9 at 3-6). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant makes the same equal protection arguments that other courts in this district have soundly rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant has introduced no evidence showing that the scheduling or treatment of \u00a7 1325 defendants is based on alienage rather than the offense at issue. And even if the distinction were premised on alienage, \"rational basis review would apply and satisfy equal protection analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Mazariegos-Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20338923\">\n    2019 WL 338923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2. Misdemeanor \u00a7 1325 cases are handled together rather than on the CVB calendar because it makes \"organizational sense\" given the volume of \u00a7 1325 cases and divergent jurisdictional underpinnings of CVB court.\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   , 18-mj-20098-AJB, ECF No. 29 at 6;\n   <em>\n    Mazariegos-Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20338923\">\n    2019 WL 338923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2. The Court adopts the reasoning of these other courts in this district and rejects Defendant's equal protection argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant argues that a separate \u00a7 1325 calendar violates substantive and procedural due process under the United States Constitution. The Court rejects both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To state a substantive due process claim, the conduct must \"shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency.\"\n   <em>\n    Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

Cal. 2018). Defendant falls short of the required showing. Defendant offers only the conclusory argument that \"it 'shocks the conscience' for the Government to blatantly deprive \u00a7 1325 defendants of the substantial benefits of CVB court while extending those benefits to defendants charged with similar or\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   serious crimes who have similar or\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   risk of flight.\" (ECF No. 9 at 7 (emphasis in original) ). But the record lacks any evidence of conditions or practices that Ramirez-Ortiz himself experienced that offend notions of human decency, and Defendant does not explain how the process he received-independent hearings and a trial before a district judge-shocks the conscience.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mazariegos-Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-mj-22276-WQH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20338923\">\n    2019 WL 338923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2019) (holding \u00a7 1325 prosecution does not violate Due Process Clause). Defendant's procedural due process argument also fails because Defendant has not identified what constitutionally guaranteed process he was denied as an asylum seeker who violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The Court concludes that Defendant was not deprived of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Statutory Right to Apply for Asylum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant alleges that the prosecution violates his statutory right to apply\n   for asylum and therefore must be dismissed. (ECF No. 9 at 9). Defendant cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), which provides: \"[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States [ ] whether or not at a designated port of arrival ... [ ] irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.\" Defendant urges the Court to consider that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) requires immigration officers to refer an alien for an asylum interview if he or she expresses \"an intention to apply for asylum ... or a fear of persecution,\" even if the officer determines the alien is otherwise inadmissible. However, Defendant manufactures hypothetical scenarios instead of showing how he was personally deprived of this purported right to apply for asylum. (ECF No. 9 at 9). Moreover, a plain reading of the statutes suggests that they are not in conflict and that Congress chose not to grant immunity to asylum seekers who face criminal prosecution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). (ECF No. 12 at 9). The Court concludes that any statutory right to apply for asylum has not been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. International Treaties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues that his prosecution violates his rights under Article 31(1) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\"the Convention\"). (ECF No. 9 at 10). Although the United States did not sign the Convention, it acceded to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (the \"Protocol\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khan v.
