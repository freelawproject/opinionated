In pursuit of this objective, the Foundation expends time and resources \"to ensure that voter rolls ... are free from ineligible registrants, noncitizens, individuals who are no longer residents[,] and individuals who are registered in more than one location.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In September 2017, the City of Philadelphia reported that a \"glitch\" at various offices of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had enabled noncitizens to register to vote when acquiring or renewing their driver's licenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). The Pennsylvania General Assembly convened hearings on the \"glitch\" and other issues concerning noncitizen registration and voting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020501\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 42, 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Secretary Torres, Commissioner Marks, and representatives of the Foundation all testified at these hearings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47, 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contemporaneous with the hearings, the Foundation sought access to records \"concerning noncitizen registrants, including records related to their removal from the voter registration lists and referrals to law enforcement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). The Foundation first requested these \"voter list maintenance\" records from Commissioner Marks by letter dated October 23, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-69; Doc. 1-8 at 1-3). A Foundation representative attempted to inspect the requested records in person at the Bureau two days later. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 71-75). A Bureau employee denied access to the records, and a representative from the Office of Chief Counsel to the Department indicated that the Foundation's request was under review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-74). On October 30, 2017, agency open records officer Rebecca Fuhrman (\"Fuhrman\") asked for an additional 30 days to respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76; Doc. 1-9 at 6-7). When that timeframe elapsed without a response, the Foundation renewed the records request to Commissioner Marks and Fuhrman by letter, indicating that a Foundation representative would visit the Bureau on December 6, 2017 to inspect the records. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 79-81; Doc. 1-9 at 1-2). The letter contained the following language: \"This is your first notice that if you\n   fail to make these records available for public inspection, you will be in violation of the NVRA and subject to an action to enforce the public records provisions of the NVRA.\" (Doc. 1-9 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 5, 2017, Kathleen Kotula (\"Kotula\"), deputy chief counsel for the Department, emailed the Foundation indicating that the records would not be available for inspection the following day. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 82). The Department did not permit the Foundation's representative to inspect the records on December 6, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 86). Kotula emailed a letter to the Foundation from Commissioner Marks which formally denied the Foundation's records request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88). In the letter, Commissioner Marks explained the Department's position that the Foundation was not entitled to the records under the NVRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 20, 2017, the Foundation sent Commissioner Marks a letter entitled \"NVRA violation notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-10). Citing to the applicable NVRA provisions, the letter identified the Department's denial of the Foundation's records request as a violation of the statute and stated that \"[t]he Department is hereby notified that it now faces federal litigation should it continue to deny access to the requested records.\" (Doc. 1-10 at 1 (emphasis omitted) ). The Foundation also noted that, because the purported violation occurred within 120 days of an election,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Department had 20 days to correct it under the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 1 \u00b6 98). The Department never responded. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Foundation commenced this action alleging that defendants violated the Act's public disclosure provision by withholding access to the list maintenance records. Defendants move to dismiss the Foundation's claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for disposition. Defendants also request oral argument on their motion under Local Rule of Court 7.9. (Doc. 13). Because we find oral argument unnecessary to disposition of the instant motion, we will deny this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Such jurisdictional challenges take of one two forms: (1) parties may levy a \"factual\" attack, arguing that one or more of the pleading's factual allegations are untrue, removing the action from the court's jurisdictional ken; or (2) they may assert a \"facial\" challenge, which assumes the veracity of the complaint's allegations but nonetheless argues that a claim is not within the court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Benefit Life Co. v.
