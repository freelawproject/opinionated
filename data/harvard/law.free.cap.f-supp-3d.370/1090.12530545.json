The Court heard oral arguments on February 28, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 13, 2018, the jury returned a verdict finding the Defendant Mongol Nation, an unincorporated association, guilty of (1) substantive RICO;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) RICO conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 320. The guilty verdict triggered the forfeiture phase of trial. On January 11, 2019, the jury returned a Special Verdict finding certain property to be subject to criminal forfeiture, including the rights associated with and appurtenant to collective membership marks and specific items of personal property bearing the marks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 353. The jury also found forfeitable ammunition, body armor, and firearms entered into evidence. The Special Verdict capped months of trial and ripened legal challenges to the Government's requested criminal forfeiture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213165\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1134/#p1138\">\n    220 F.3d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Mongol Nation and its members display specific words and images on leather vests, flags, bandanas, belt buckles, and other property. Some of these words and images are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a type of trademark called a \"collective membership mark.\" For example, one of the Mongol Nation's registered collective membership marks is the \"Combined Mark,\" consisting of the word \"MONGOLS\" and the drawn image of a Genghis Khan-type character with sunglasses and a ponytail, riding a motorcycle, with the letters \"M.C.\" appearing below the motorcycle:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Mongol Nation and its members use the collective membership marks solely for the purpose of identifying the persons displaying the marks as members of the motorcycle club. Unlike a typical trademark (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"Pepsi\" or \"Dr. Pepper\"), the words and images are not used to distinguish the source or origin of particular goods or services in commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are used only to identify membership in the collective. This type of trademark allows an organization, union, club, or other type of association-be it the National Rifle Association,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   American Thyroid Association,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Christian Deer Hunters Association,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   International Brotherhood of Teamsters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or Navy Seal Team\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -to prevent others from using the words or images in a way that violates trademark law, including by creating public confusion about the origin of goods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in 2012 the Hells Angels Motorcycle Corporation filed a lawsuit against Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. for selling yo-yos with a design confusingly similar to the motorcycle club's \"Death Head\" collective membership mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For more than a decade the United States has expended resources seeking forfeiture of the Mongol Nation's collective membership marks. Why? It is beyond question that the Government has a legitimate interest in attacking the economic roots of a criminal organization like the Mongol Nation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But what does the United States accomplish by seizing control of the intellectual property rights associated with a motorcycle club's associative symbols? The Government's own prior admissions shed light on the objectives underlying more than ten years of their efforts: The collective membership marks are \"potent emblem[s]\" used to \"generate fear among the general public,\" and the Government has sought orders to prevent use of \"the trademark to create an atmosphere of fear through public display.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government has stated publicly that it has sought to \"stop [a] gang member and literally take [a] jacket right off his back.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government is not merely seeking forfeiture of the ship's sails. In this prosecution the United States is attempting to use RICO to change the meaning of the ship's flag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Now that the preliminary order of forfeiture is before the Court, the Government contends that its request is limited; the Government argues at length about what the requested preliminary order of forfeiture does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   authorize.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Reply ISO Mot. for POF\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 25 (\"the POF merely forfeits\n   <em>\n    Defendant's\n   </em>\n   right to limit use of the Marks-the POF in itself does not confer any right upon the government to do so\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (\"The government has ... requested nothing more than the entry of a POF, and it is unreasonable to presume that the mere entry of that order could or would lead to seizures or a reasonable belief that seizures would occur[.]\"). But the First Amendment \"protects against the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy of\n   <em>\n    noblesse oblige\n   </em>\n   \" or any promise to use power \"responsibly.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    559 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Government has included language in its proposed POF stating that the order \"standing alone\" does not authorize seizure of property bearing the symbols and that the Government \"shall not apply to any Court (other than this Court) requesting seizure or enforcement authority based upon this Order.\" Dkt. 354-1 at 6. This is not enough to remedy the chilling effect the forced transfer of a symbol to the United States government has on the Mongol Nation, its members, and society at large. The Government has not been forthright with this Court and the public regarding whether the United States can feasibly use the Mongol Nation's collective membership marks or transfer the marks to a third party for their exclusive use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   These statements to the Court have been accompanied by public threats made by the United States Attorney regarding the\n   Government's intention to strip vests off members' backs. Most recently, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Los Angeles Field Division, stated that the Government had successfully seized a \"unity symbol.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the forced transfer of symbols to the United States immediately chills the Mongol Nation's and its members' continued rights to display or otherwise use the collective membership marks without fear of legal retaliation or payment of a licensing fee at any point following forfeiture, the forced transfer of the collective membership marks to the United States violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government's request also violates the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause and must be denied on this basis alone. The Mongol Nation is a convicted criminal entity, and its members have pleaded guilty to heinous acts of murder, attempted murder, drug trafficking, and other crimes. But in this case the jury found that the Government did not prove the requisite nexus between the collective membership marks and the substantive RICO offense; the jury found the collective membership marks forfeitable as to RICO conspiracy alone. The forfeiture of the rights associated with a symbol that has been in continuous use by an organization since 1969 is unjustified and grossly disproportionate to this offense. To hold otherwise sets a dangerous precedent that enables the Government to target the associative symbols of organizations it chooses to prosecute for RICO conspiracy. For example, the United States brought multiple RICO actions against James Hoffa and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"Teamsters\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of Am., AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513626\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/634/#p636\">\n    3 F.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (2d Cir. 1993). The purpose of these prosecutions was to rid the union of \"the hideous influence of organized crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513626\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/634/#p636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Today the Teamsters continue to own and use the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS collective membership mark,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the group's more than one million union members display their symbol on clothing, including on vests (albeit fleece, not leather).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timbs v.

The Court thus DENIES the request for a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture in its current form.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   the requested POF violates the Mongol Nation's and its members' First Amendment rights.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   the requested POF violates the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, pending the filing of an amended POF consistent with this Order, the Court conditionally GRANTS the Government's request to forfeit all body armor, firearms, and ammunition entered into evidence during trial as well as items of tangible personal property bearing the collective membership marks, including vests or \"cuts,\" patches, clothing and documents,\n   that are currently in the custody of the United States. This requested forfeiture raises no constitutional concerns before an ancillary proceeding is conducted to determine ownership interests in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreover, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion for acquittal and motion for a new trial. Having reviewed the evidence presented during trial, the Court declines to overturn the jury's finding by beyond a reasonable doubt that the Mongol Nation is guilty of substantive RICO and RICO conspiracy. And the Court finds no legal basis to overturn the guilty verdict. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit's previous ruling in this case, the evidence demonstrated that the Mongol Nation is distinct from the Mongol Gang; and the Mongol Nation is legally capable of committing the underlying RICO acts. The Mongol Nation is guilty of substantive RICO and RICO conspiracy. The criminal organization is subject to sentencing fines and criminal forfeiture consistent with this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

At the June 22 hearing, the Government revealed for the first time that the mark it sought to forfeit was a collective membership mark. Previously, in its Ex Parte Application for Post-Indictment Restraining Order, the Government referred to the mark simply as a trademark, which was \"purportedly for use in commerce in connection with promoting the interests of persons interested in the recreation of riding motorcycles.\" (Ciccone Decl. \u00b6 4.) In contrast to commercial trademarks, which are used in commerce and generally not entitled to full First Amendment protections, collective membership marks are used by members of an organization to \"indicat[e] membership in a union, an association, or other organization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The use and display of collective membership marks therefore directly implicate the First Amendment's right to freedom of association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Supreme Court has recognized that \" 'implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment' is 'a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.'

In this case, the Government targets an even narrower group of individuals, a single motorcycle club.

The Government is requesting the forced transfer of the rights associated with the club's symbols to the United States. There is a realistic danger that the transfer of the rights associated with the symbol to the Government will have a chilling effect, restrain speech, and limit associational rights, especially in light of the Government's own statements about its objectives. The Court does not agree that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require entry of the POF and notice to third parties before the First Amendment challenges can be resolved. As the Government notes, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2 provides the procedural process by which third parties (including individual members) can assert their\n   <em>\n    ownership\n   </em>\n   interests in the property sought to be forfeited. Mot. for POF at 12-13. But the question before the Court is not one of ownership. The Mongol Nation, an unincorporated association, owns the collective membership marks. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the entity intervened in previous legal proceedings to declare its ownership of the marks. Any attempt to assert otherwise at this stage is unavailing. Ownership is not dispositive of First Amendment standing. Individual members of the motorcycle group will be harmed by the forfeiture of the collective membership marks because they use the marks as members of the collective and face future repercussions for infringing use of the symbols after title vests in the United States. The Court does not need to send notice or engage in \"pre-hearing\n   discovery\" to reach this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, if the Court agreed with the Government's procedure-based arguments, it is not clear that individual members of the Mongol Nation would ever have the ability to assert their constitutional rights in an ancillary proceeding.

It is important to acknowledge the Government's own statements regarding the marks and why they have spent years seeking forfeiture of the rights associated with these symbols. As the United States Attorney for the Central District of California stated in October 2008: \"If the court grants our request... then if any law enforcement officer sees a Mongol wearing his patch, he will be authorized to stop that gang member and literally take the jacket right off his back.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government has described the marks as \"potent emblem[s]\" used to \"generate fear among the general public\" and \"create an atmosphere of fear through public display.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most recently, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Los Angeles Field Division, stated, \"We are proud our work resulted in their unity symbol, the Mongol patch, being forfeited.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government has lost credibility when it now suggests the sole purpose of more than a decade of prosecution is only to limit the Mongol Nation's ability to bring infringement lawsuits against other entities. In the ATF special agent's own words, the Government is after the club's\n   unity symbol. The forced transfer of the legal rights associated with these symbols to the United States government presents immediate harms and chills the Mongol Nation's and its members' right to display the marks given the Government's threats and seizure attempts. The Government's attempt to seize symbols has chilling effects on speech nationwide. After title vests in the Government, this Court has serious concerns about future United States Attorneys in different districts and circuits using the rights associated with these symbols in harmful ways. The forced transfer of a collective membership mark has lasting chilling effects despite representations made to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The current POF-which would vest title in the United States-functions as a prior restraint on future speech.

In this case, the RICO conspiracy is a serious offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the collective membership marks were acquired in 1969 upon first use and have been maintained through continuous use for decades. The symbols have immense intangible, subjective value to the Mongol Nation and its members. Indeed, numerous members have permanently tattooed the images on their backs and elsewhere. And the connection between the rights associated with intangible property and the RICO conspiracy is attenuated. The jury's finding of a requisite nexus is understandable given RICO's extraordinary breadth. But in evaluating Constitutional excessiveness, the Court notes that the Government did not introduce any evidence connecting the use of intellectual property rights to an overt act. Individual Mongol Nation members may have displayed the symbols while committing crimes, but the defendant association did not use the rights associated with the collective membership marks in furtherance of those acts. Evidence showed that certain wings and other patches were awarded to members, but the Mongol Nation did not use intellectual property rights to prevent hangarounds from wearing symbols they did not earn. And the collective membership marks are not the fruits of any illegal activity. They were legally acquired via first use in 1969 and were legally maintained via continuous use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bajakajian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p333\">\n    524 U.S. at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182447\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/321/#p333\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The money was the proceeds of legal activity and was to be used to repay a lawful debt.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court also notes that dozens of individual Mongol Nation members pleaded guilty in connection with several of overt acts. The defense witnesses at trial included a Mongols member who is serving multiple life sentences for committing murder in aid or racketeering, among his offenses. The Government has secured prison sentences and significant forfeiture of the criminal organization's assets and property, including motorcycles. And as a result of the conviction in this case, the Government will secure forfeiture of weapons,\n   ammunition, body armor, and items of personal property seized during raids. The Government will also pursue fines at sentencing. Given the punishments already secured by the United States, the forfeiture of the collective membership marks is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the RICO conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   To hold otherwise sets a dangerous precedent.

Allowing the Government to forfeit the rights associated with and appurtenant to purely associative symbols of organizations it chooses to prosecute is a slippery slope. The Court notes the Government has for the first time sought forfeiture of the rights associated with the symbol of a largely Latino motorcycle club. The Government has not sought symbols in previous prosecutions against high-ranking members of rival motorcycle clubs, unions, churches, sports leagues, and fraternities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government apparently has not chosen to pursue the Hells Angels' symbols despite a lawsuit filed by that motorcycle club against Toys \"R\" Us. This in no way suggests that the Mongol Nation is not a criminal organization deserving of significant punishment for the harms it has caused numerous victims. And the Court notes again that dozens of individual persons were convicted and are currently serving prison sentences for their crimes. But the Court finds the Government's creative forfeiture request to be unjustified and grossly disproportionate to the RICO conspiracy offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Forfeiture of collective membership marks is violative of the Excessive Fines Clause.

Fifth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Mongol Nation argues that the requested Preliminary Order of Forfeiture would allow the Government to deprive individuals of their liberty and property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Opp'n to Mot. for POF at 7. The Mongol Nation's primary contention is that the collective membership marks are not owned by the Mongol Nation, but are rather owned by the members and \"merely held in trust by the club for the benefit of\n   the individual users.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623902\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Defendant, if the POF is entered, \"[n]ot a single unindicted member of the defendant organization ... has the opportunity to call witnesses, cross examine government witnesses, or argue their case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court is baffled by Defendant's argument. On July 20, 2010, the \"Mongols Nation Motorcycle Club and its successor, Mongols Nation Motorcycle Club, Inc.\" intervened in a criminal proceeding and filed a motion to vacate a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture, arguing in part that because it owned the collective membership mark, the District Court erred in allowing forfeiture as to the individual.\n   <em>\n    Cavazos\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 3946 at 26. Now Defendant claims it does not own the mark, but merely owns title to the mark. If ownership of the collective membership marks were genuinely at issue, the Court would follow the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to determine the ownership interests and afford individuals due process, including a hearing and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendant's due process argument based on ownership is circular. The Mongol Nation argues that an ancillary hearing as set forth in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should not be held because the Preliminary Order of Forfeiture violates the Constitution and must be denied outright. The Mongol Nation then argues that the Preliminary Order of Forfeiture violates due process because it does not afford members an ancillary hearing as set forth in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court agrees that the Constitutional issues must be resolved immediately, and that the members have First Amendment rights associated with the marks that may be resolved without their direct participation. But denial on due process grounds related to ownership, which would be evaluated during an ancillary proceeding, is not proper at this time. The Court would determine whether every member has an ownership interest in the collective membership mark, and whether the Mongol Nation merely holds title to the marks, at an ancillary forfeiture hearing. This process is not necessary because the requested Preliminary Order of Forfeiture violates the First and Eighth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Collective Membership Marks in Gross\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The requested POF must be denied for the reasons stated above. Because this appears to be a matter of first impression, the Court provides the following observations regarding the feasibility of any transfer of the collective membership marks and whether RICO allows for the forced transfer of this property in gross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   There is no doubt that RICO authorizes the forfeiture of both tangible and intangible property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims, and securities.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). As the Government argues, the criminal forfeiture of rights and interests in intangible property is not unique to RICO forfeitures. Reply ISO POF at 4 (listing statutes). Indeed, the forfeiture of such intangible rights and privileges is fairly common. For example, as Amicus points out, federal courts have authorized the forfeiture of licenses including: a medical license used by a doctor to distribute controlled substances; a pharmacist's license used to distribute illegal drugs; and a liquor license used to run a business where cocaine was distributed.

Defendant provides no basis for veering from this path as to unincorporated associations. As this Court instructed the jury, it is not enough that various members and associates were involved in spontaneous criminal acts as an individual or as a small group of individuals. In other words, the spontaneous rogue acts of individual members and associates do not create guilt for an association. However, to the extent that an illegal act was committed at the express or implied direction of the leadership of the defendant Mongol Nation, the entity may be found guilty.

A trademark cannot be registered if it is \"merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive\" of goods, \u00a7 1052(e)(1), or if it is so similar to an already registered trademark or trade name that it is \"likely ... to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,\" \u00a7 1052(d).\n    <em>\n     Matal v.
