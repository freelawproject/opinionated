EMC now moves for summary judgment on the invalidity of dependent claim 11 on two grounds: (1) IV is collaterally estopped from asserting claim 11 or (2) there is no genuine dispute that claim 11 is invalid as obvious under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) over\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C490%2C250\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,490,250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Reschke\").

The '442 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying patent from the prior claim construction opinion (Docket No. 236). As background, the '442 patent relates to a type of computer architecture known as a symmetric multiprocessor system or shared-memory multiprocessor system (\"SMP\"). '442 patent, col. 1, ll. 17-18, 65-66. In a conventional SMP, two or more processors are connected to a shared memory device via one shared \"bus\" - or communication channel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C490%2C250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 1, ll. 18-21. The claimed system of the '442 patent seeks to scale the classic SMP and solve for a \"bottleneck\" problem by using a \"switched fabric\" for data transfers which provides multiple concurrent buses for transactions between the processors and shared memory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C490%2C250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 1, ll. 50-53. Each component - including the switches in the switch fabric, microprocessors, and memory - communicates with a corresponding \"interface.\" So in the '442 system, processors and the shared memory device exchange data with and communicate through microprocessor and memory interfaces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C490%2C250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 2, ll. 59-67.

Application to Claim 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on this precedent, EMC argues: given that under\n   <em>\n    XY\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fresenius\n   </em>\n   , PTAB decisions have a preclusive effect in district court, and under\n   <em>\n    Soverain\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ohio Willow Wood\n   </em>\n   collateral estoppel operates to preclude assertion of unadjudicated claims that do not \"materially alter the question of invalidity,\" it follows that PTAB decisions have a collateral-estoppel effect in district court on unadjudicated claims that do not \"materially alter the question of invalidity.\" Docket No. 202 at 18. The Court agrees. While the Federal Circuit has not ruled directly on this precise question, the logic of the caselaw discussed above applies with equal force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The PTAB's decision finding claim 1 unpatentable is final and estops IV from relitigating the validity of claim 1 in district court. IV, which had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues, declined to appeal the PTAB's decision on the '442 patent to the Federal Circuit, rendering the PTAB's decision a final judgment on the instituted claims and resulting in the cancellation of claim 1. The remaining question is whether the differences between claim 11 and claim 1 (namely \"the microprocessors and the memory device\") materially alter the invalidity analysis under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the undisputed facts in the record, they do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   EMC argues that claim 11 is not patentably distinct from claim 1 because \"[w]hile independent claim 1 focuses on the\n   <em>\n    interfaces\n   </em>\n   to the microprocessors and a memory device, dependent claim 11 merely adds the microprocessors and memory device\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   .\" Docket No. 176 at 22. The record supports this argument. While finding claim 1 obvious over Reschke, the PTAB pointed out that the Reschke system, like the '442 system, is premised on the use of microprocessors and shared memory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FWD at 52-53 (finding that Reschke \"discloses the microprocessor interfaces 'exchang[ing] the data with a plurality of\n   <em>\n    microprocessors\n   </em>\n   ' \" and \"discloses a memory interface 'exchang[ing] the data with a plurality of a\n   <em>\n    memory device\n   </em>\n   ' \" (alternations in original) (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   IV does not dispute that Reschke \"expressly discloses at least one shared memory device.\" Docket No. 198-1 \u00b6 9. But, relying on its expert Dr. Richard Wesel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   IV argues that Reschke does not disclose the use of microprocessors because the \"processor units\" described in Reschke cannot be conflated with microprocessors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 198 at 17. This expert opinion conflicts with admissions made by IV before the PTAB in the prior IPR proceeding. In its preliminary response before the PTAB on EMC's petition, IV described the Reschke system as follows: \"A data switching unit transfers data between shared memory and\n   <em>\n    multiple microprocessors\n   </em>\n   using one set of buses. Here, the dark green blocks are the\n   <em>\n    multiple microprocessors\n   </em>\n   (131-134). Figure 1 shows them as 'PU.' \" Docket No. 137-6 at 37 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Thus, before the PTAB IV explained that Reschke included microprocessors, and that it understood \"PU\" or processing units, to mean \"microprocessors.\" IV made this same representation in the subsequent Patent Owner\n   Response before the PTAB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 179-8 at 51 (\"In Reschke, a data switching unit transfers data between memory and\n   <em>\n    multiple microprocessors\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). During the IPR proceeding, IV attempted to argue that Reschke did not disclose\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   elements of the '442 patent's claims, but it did not dispute that the Reschke system involved multiple microprocessors and shared memory.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker Oil Tools, Inc. v. Geo Vann, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747933\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1558/#p1562\">\n    828 F.2d 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (finding prior assertion before the PTO during an interference proceeding did not have preclusive effect but could be considered a party admission). Regardless, Dr. Wesel's declaration does little to explain how any distinction between \"processor units\" and \"microprocessors\" materially alters an obviousness analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 198-7 \u00b6\u00b6 40-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Soverain\n   </em>\n   the Federal Circuit held that independent claim 15, which described a \"hypertext statement system,\" was invalid as obvious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051576\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1311/#p1314\">\n    778 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1314 n.2, 1319.

The Federal Circuit ruled that the assertion of the dependent claim was barred by issue preclusion because the patentee did not invent the Internet, hypertext, or URL, and therefore the \"routine incorporation of Internet technology into existing processes\" could not work to make claim 39 valid when claim 15 was invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051576\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1311/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051576\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1311/#p1314\">\n    at 1319-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
