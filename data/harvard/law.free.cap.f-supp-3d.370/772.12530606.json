BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs purchased or leased a 2015-2017 Z06 from a GM-authorized dealership. As self-described \"track enthusiasts,\" Plaintiffs say they purchased their Z06 for use on both public roadways and specialized closed race tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that GM marketed and sold the Z06 for use on race tracks - as evidenced by GM's information kits and brochures, the car's track-focused features, owner manuals for the car, press kits, and GM-sponsored track events - and that Plaintiffs relied on this marketing in deciding to purchase their cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The 2015 vehicle information kit, for example, described the benefits of a \"track-focused\" performance package as \"faster lap times,\" including \"[q]uarter-mile times of 10.95 seconds at 127 mph with the eight-speed and 11.2 seconds at 127 mph with the seven-speed transmission.\" The 2015 product information brochure noted that the Z06 was \"developed to push the envelope of performance on the street and the track.\" The brochure likewise lauded the improved cooling components on the car,\n   and specifically proclaimed that the Z06's design provided \"increased track capability\" - representations that Plaintiffs allege were intended to assure consumers that the Z06 could handle the high temperatures associated with track driving. In numerous promotional materials, GM described the car as \"track-proven\" or \"race-proven.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Consistent with the marketing materials, GM equipped the Z06 with features that a person would associate with a car designed for track racing, including a specific \"Track App\" software component and a heads-up tachometer display used for racing. Additionally, the Z06 owner manuals contemplated track use - offering detailed instructions on track driving and describing a \"Competitive Driving Mode\" for \"use at a closed course race track.\" Meanwhile, GM sponsored track events featuring the Z06 and promoted a \"Corvette Owner's School\" where owners were encouraged to develop their track skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Despite GM's numerous representations that the Z06 was designed for track use and \"track-proven,\" Plaintiffs say a design defect causes the Z06 to overheat unexpectedly and makes the car unsuitable for track use. Plaintiffs allege that due to a defective cooling system, \"the engine will overheat if it operates on the track during a typical track session, which causes the Z06 to go into \"Limp Mode\" to prevent permanent damage, or causes the driver to see the overheat gauge and pit the car before it goes into Limp Mode.\" When the car enters Limp Mode, Plaintiffs say it can \"immediately go from well over 100 mph to a substantially lower speed and lose power.\" Plaintiffs claim that it is inherently dangerous for the car to overheat, lose power, and/or enter Limp Mode either at the track or on public roads; loss of engine power and sudden deceleration increases the risk of collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, GM knew of the defect but continued to market the cars for track driving. Plaintiffs allege that GM conducted extensive track testing of the Z06, which would have revealed the alleged defect. Plaintiffs say a February 2015 statement by Corvette's chief engineer, Tadge Juechter, demonstrates GM's awareness of the problem. In the statement, Juechter acknowledges that a Z06 with an automatic transmission reaches \"thermal limitations...more quickly,\" and advises customers who \"plan[ ] to run extended track-day sessions at 'professional' speeds...to go with the manual transmission, or to paddle shift the automatic and select higher gears when conditions warrant it.\" In addressing why the Z06 did not have higher temperature limitations, Juechter said that GM has \"used the 'pro driver at 86 degrees' criteria for generations of Corvettes and for the vast majority of customers, it has resulted in excellent performance for their usage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs also offer examples of online consumer complaints regarding the overheating issue, and they allege that GM monitors the online forums where complaints were lodged. The earliest consumer complaint Plaintiffs cite was published May 17, 2015. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that GM effectively admitted to the defect when it stopped production of the Z06 in 2016 due to the overheating issue and modified the cooling system in the 2017 model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This action was one of five parallel proceedings filed by the same plaintiffs' counsel against GM in different federal courts. The other cases were transferred to this district and reassigned to this Court. Following reassignment, the Court entered a stipulated order consolidating the cases and requiring Plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated\n   class action complaint on May 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to represent a nationwide class and - for 18 states - statewide classes of purchasers and lessees of a 2015-2017 Z06: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs bring a claim for violation of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\") on behalf of the nationwide class, alleging that GM breached its express warranties by equipping the Z06 with a defectively designed \" 'track-proven' powertrain system\" that \"fails to operate as represented by GM.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege individual claims under the consumer protection statutes of the states in which they seek to represent, based on GM's alleged misrepresentations regarding the track capabilities of the Z06 and on its alleged failure to disclose that the Z06's \"track-proven\" powertrain system has a defect that leads to overheating and causes the car to go into Limp Mode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   All Plaintiffs other than the two representing Florida also allege individual state law claims for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, as well as claims for fraudulent concealment and unjust enrichment based on the same alleged misrepresentations and omissions supporting the claims under the state consumer protection statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   GM filed a motion to dismiss on July 10, 2018. It is fully briefed. In their response, Plaintiffs withdraw their implied warranty claims under the laws of New York, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington (Counts 49, 65, 69, and 73, respectively).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests a complaint's legal sufficiency. The federal rules require that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' 70 remaining claims (excluding the four they withdrew) fall into two major categories: warranty claims and fraud claims. As an alternative to the contract-based warranty claims, Plaintiffs bring claims of unjust enrichment. The Court addresses each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    A. NEW YORK CLASS ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   GM argues that the Court should strike Plaintiffs' New York class allegations because there is no named plaintiff with standing to represent the alleged New York class, defined as \"[a]ll persons or entities who purchased or leased a 2015-2017 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 in the State of New York.\" GM says the sole New York plaintiff, David Lawrence (\"Lawrence\"), is inadequate and not within the class definition because he did not purchase or lease a car in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs say it is premature to decide whether Lawrence has standing to represent the proposed New York class, and that the definition of the New York class could be expanded to include those who were deceived by GM's misrepresentations and omissions in New York, regardless of whether they purchased or leased their car in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Although class-certification analysis may precede standing analysis when the class certification issue [is] logically antecedent to the standing issue ... our Court has held that \"the 'logical[ly] antecedent' language should be construed in a manner that permits consideration of the standing issue ... prior to class certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Wozniak v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:17-CV-12794,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20108845\">\n    2019 WL 108845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 4, 2019) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Lawrence purchased a Z06 in Maryland and leased a Z06 in Michigan. He, therefore, does not fall within the New York class definition and does not have standing to represent the proposed New York class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs do not ask to amend the New York class definition; however, if they did, the Court would not allow it. Lawrence, and possibly others, would then fall within multiple class definitions (i.e., New York and Michigan), and proceeding with different scopes of definitions for different states would present other unknown issues that would unreasonably complicate the management of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Lawrence attempts to bring Counts 46-50 on behalf of the New York class. The second allegation under each of those counts is either, \"This claims is brought by [Lawrence] on behalf of the New York Class[ ]\" or \"[Lawrence] brings this Count on behalf of the New York Class.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because Lawrence lacks standing to represent the New York class, the Court STRIKES Plaintiffs' New York class allegations. Moreover, because Counts 46-50 were brought on behalf of the now-stricken New York class, the Court DISMISSES those claims and Lawrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. IMPLIED WARRANTY CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   All Plaintiffs other than Florida Plaintiffs allege implied warranty of merchantability claims: Counts 6, 10, 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, and 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because Plaintiffs withdrew their implied warranty claims under the laws of New York, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington (Counts 49, 65, 69, and 73, respectively), the Court need not address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   GM says the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' implied warranty claims because Plaintiffs fail to plausibly/sufficiently allege that their cars were unmerchantable at the time of sale.

They also say it is plausible to infer that GM had prior knowledge of the defect based on pre-release testing. Finally, Plaintiffs say consumer complaints about the overheating issue on websites GM monitors gave GM further notice of the defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   GM says Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege knowledge, arguing that: (1) Juechter's statement did not acknowledge or address the overheating defect; (2) Plaintiffs' allegations regarding pre-release testing are speculative and do not establish that GM knew of the defect; and (3) consumer complaints are insufficient to plead that GM had knowledge. Alternatively, GM says that even if Plaintiffs can rely on consumer complaints to allege knowledge, the complaints do not help certain Plaintiffs who purchased their car before the earliest-cited complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Knowledge of the Alleged Defect in the 2015-2016 Z06s\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   With respect to the 2015 and 2016 models, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that GM knew of the defect at the time of sale based on Juechter's statement and their allegations of pre-release testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In his February 22, 2015 statement, Juechter said, among other things, that: (1) the Z06 is designed to be able to \"burn through a full tank of gas\" on a \" 'typical racetrack\" on an 86 degree Fahrenheit day; (2) GM has \"used the 'pro driver at 86 degrees' criteria for generations of Corvettes\"; (3) if the Z06 was designed to higher temperature limits, it would require a lot of cooling hardware; (4) the Z06's automatic transmission \"optimizes lap time performance\" but also taxes the engine more, causing \"thermal limitations [to be] reached more quickly\"; (5) because the automatic transmission causes the car to reach \"thermal limitations ... more quickly,\" a person who \"plan[s] to run extended track-day sessions at 'professional' speeds[ ] [is] advised to go with the manual transmission, or to paddle shift the automatic and select higher gears when conditions warrant it\"; and (6) \"[o]ur team validates the durability of the Z06 cooling systems with a 24hr accumulated track test to simulate the most aggressive track-day usage by our customers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Based on these statements and allegations in the complaint - including allegations regarding GM's testing results for the Z06 in marketing/information materials, which one could plausibly infer were created before GM released the Z06 - it is clear that GM tests the Z06 extensively before it reaches the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Although its testing showed that the Z06's design caused the car to reach thermal limitations more quickly - and admittedly made the automatic transmission unsuitable for extended track use - GM maintained the same 86 degree limitation it used for \"generations.\" Nevertheless, as Plaintiffs allege, GM promoted increased cooling components on the car, and specifically proclaimed in the Z06's 2015 product information brochure that the car's design provided \"increased track capability.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No 17, PgID 337, \u00b6 158 (\"The larger vents provide more cooling air to the engine,\n   brakes, transmission and differential for increased track capability.\") ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Thus, on the one hand, GM represented that the Z06 had better cooling components to increase its track capabilities; yet, on the other, Juechter represents that the Z06 was designed with the same thermal limitations that were used for generations, because to design for a higher temperature limit would require adding a lot of cooling hardware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   It is clear that Juechter and his team - which \"validates the durability of the Z06 cooling systems with a 24hr accumulated track test to simulate the most aggressive track-day usage by [ ] customers\" - thoroughly test the limitations of the Z06 prior to its release. Thus, considering Plaintiffs' allegation that the Z06 \"\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   overheat ... during a typical track session,\" it is plausible to infer that GM knew of the overheating defect based on the fact that it tested the Z06 under conditions that simulate the\n   <em>\n    most aggressive\n   </em>\n   track-day usage. This inference becomes even more plausible based on a sampling of the consumer complaints cited in the complaint - which show the Z06 overheated frequently and quickly when used on a track: (1) \"My first track day was last weekend....I was taking it easy and not pushing the car. Ambient temperatures were 85 degrees and ... [a]fter 5-6 laps the car overheated\"; (2) \"1st open track day, 1st run, 12 minutes in, oil temp [overheats] and alarms go off on the dash\"; and (3) there are \"many reports from owners overheating the [Z06] in 80 degree weather or even 70 degree weather. This limitation of the car as sold will be exacerbated in the coming summer months. Many media outlets have reported overheating ... include[ing] every occurrence when Motor Trend tested the ... Z06.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In fact, accepting as true Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the frequency in which the Z06 overheats and enters Limp Mode when used on the track, and in light of how rigorously Juechter says GM track-tests the car, it would be implausible to infer that GM was not aware of the car's alleged defective cooling system as a result of its testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Plaintiffs' specific allegations regarding GM's pre-release testing of the Z06's track-based performance capabilities, coupled with Juechter's February 2015 statement, make it reasonable to infer that GM knew of the overheating defect prior to the release of the 2015 and 2016 Z06s. Thus, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that GM knew of the overheating defect prior to, or at the time of, sale of the 2015 and 2016 models.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCA Gearshift Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278044\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/975/#p1003\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1002 ;\n   <em>\n    Falco v.

Because the Court dismisses Lawrence on other grounds,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section V(A), it need not discuss his fraudulent concealment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Herold alleges claims under South Carolina law; he is the only Plaintiff who alleges claims on behalf of the proposed South Carolina class. Herold purchased his Z06 in May 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   GM argues that Herold cannot plausibly allege it had knowledge about defects in the 2017 Z06 based on complaints about the 2015 and 2016 cars, because the 2017 model had design changes, including \"a new hood with larger vents and a new\n   supercharger cover.\" GM says the only two cited complaints concerning the 2017 Z06 postdate Herold's purchase. Therefore, GM says, Herold fails to sufficiently allege knowledge as required for a duty to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Court agrees with GM. No consumer complaint regarding the 2017 model Z06 pre-dates Herold's date of purchase, and because the 2017 Z06 had design changes, Herold cannot rely on complaints about the 2015-2016 Z06 to show GM's knowledge. Similarly, Herold cannot rely on Juechter's statement, because it concerned the 2015-2016 models.

The Court agrees with Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   GM is correct that Manukyan and Kanas do not allege that their cars have gone into Limp Mode. However, Manukyan alleges his car overheated and lost engine power on a public road; he also alleges that, on a separate occasion, his car got stuck in gear while on the highway, \"immediately de-rated and slowed down to around 40 mph, and would not shift or go any faster.\" Kanas alleges that his car has overheated on public roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Court finds Manukyan and Kanas sufficiently allege manifestation of the defect to survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Manifestation of the defect is not limited to the car experiencing Limp Mode; rather, Plaintiffs allege the Z06 has a defective cooling system that causes the engine to overheat, leading to unexpected loss of power and sometimes Limp Mode. They allege overheating and loss of engine power on public roads and/or a race track undermines the Z06's reliability and makes the car inherently dangerous. Manukyan and Kanas plausibly allege injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The Court DENIES GM's motion to dismiss Manukyan and Kanas' fraudulent concealment claims (Counts 5 and 43) for failure to allege injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

However, they say GM ignores settled law holding that class actions may continue even if a state consumer protection statute precludes them, so long as applying Fed. R. Civ.

June 28, 2017) (holding that \"Ohio law does not allow tolling of the consumer protection statute\" and \"[t]he parties did not identify, and the Court did not locate, any case applying a fraudulent concealment theory to toll an [OCSPA] claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Despite this conflicting law, the Court need not determine whether fraudulent concealment can toll the limitations period for an OCSPA claim; even assuming that it can, Plaintiffs fail to plead sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment should toll the statute of limitations for their OCSPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Plaintiffs say they sufficiently allege fraudulent concealment based on paragraphs 750-760 of the complaint (which are all the allegations under their OCSPA claim) and based on the general allegations supporting their common law fraudulent concealment claims. However, all of these allegations go toward GM's alleged misrepresentations and omissions of material fact\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs bought their Z06, which GM allegedly made to induce Plaintiffs into buying their cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Importantly, however, Plaintiffs cannot rest on GM's alleged fraudulent concealment that purportedly induced them to purchase a Z06. Rather, for fraudulent concealment to toll the statute of limitations, Plaintiffs must show GM took affirmative acts which were \"designed to prevent, and which [did] prevent, discovery of the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phelps v.

Nevertheless, the Court DENIES GM's motion to dismiss Nakel's consumer protection claim (Count 55) for failure to allege injury because: (1) GM fails to cite a case addressing injury and manifestation of a defect under the Pennsylvania consumer protection statute; and (2) Nakel pled sufficient facts to survive dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    F.
