Gregg Bloche and Jonathan H. Marks seek documents from multiple federal government entities related to the role of medical professionals in the design and implementation of interrogation tactics in the early to mid-2000s. Presently before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to three Defendant agencies' responses to Plaintiffs' FOIA requests-those agencies being (1) the Department of the Navy, (2) the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (\"OASD-HA Policy\"), and (3) the Department of Defense's Office of the Deputy General Counsel for Personnel and Health Policy (\"OASD-HAGC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of these three agencies performed its own search in response to\n   Plaintiffs' requests, and Plaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of those searches. Plaintiffs have for years, however, tussled with these agencies over the propriety of several FOIA exemptions that the agencies have asserted to withhold many responsive documents in full or in part. As the Court will explain below, the agencies have established that many of their claimed exemptions are proper-but not all. Where the agencies have fallen short, the Court concludes that summary judgment in neither side's favor is appropriate at this juncture. The Court instead orders that the agencies produce the documents at issue for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review and provide more specific justifications for the asserted claims, to which Plaintiffs will have an opportunity to respond. Defendants' motion is thus granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiffs' motion is denied, though in part without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this case, the adequacy of the Defendants' searches is not at issue-as the Court noted above. Instead, Plaintiffs dispute only the validity of certain FOIA exemptions that Defendants have claimed. The majority of Plaintiffs' challenges relate to Defendants' invocations of the deliberative process privilege, which falls within the ambit of FOIA Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). The Court therefore begins its analysis below with a discussion of that exemption. The Court then addresses three more discrete issues concerning: (1) Exemption 1, which permits the withholding of certain classified information relating to national defense or foreign policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(1) ; (2) Exemption 7(E), which permits the withholding of information related to \"techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(7) ; and (3) Exemption 6, which permits the withholding of information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Navy and OASD-HAGC have also met the latter requirement: they submitted declarations stating that they have released all segregable information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schrock Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Decl. of John A. Casciotti \u00b6 3, ECF No. 61-5. OASD-HA Policy has not, however, submitted such a declaration. The agency instead asks the Court to infer that it has met its obligation based on the fact that it has released a large portion of its privileged documents in part. But the Court declines this invitation; courts typically require sworn declarations or affidavits to avoid such conjecture. Thus, although OASD-HA Policy, like the other two Defendants, has shown a willingness to segregate information, it has failed to establish that no\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   reasonably segregable information exists within the material it has withheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742243,3575196\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/32/\">\n    550 F.3d at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It therefore must re-review its withholdings, produce to Plaintiffs any remaining non-privileged, segregable material that has not yet been released, and submit an affidavit or declaration confirming that all segregable material has been released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exemption 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As the Court said earlier, aside from Plaintiffs' challenges to Defendants' claims of deliberative process privilege, there are three additional discrete issues raised in the parties' motions for summary judgment. The first relates to FOIA Exemption 1, which protects material \"specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and\" that is \"in fact properly classified pursuant to such [an] Executive order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Plaintiffs dispute the Navy's assertion of Exemption 1 to withhold in part one document: Navy 42, an interrogation log from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The Navy argues that it is authorized to partially withhold this document based on Executive Order 13526, which permits the classification of information that, if disclosed, \"reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism,\" in a manner that \"the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%20707\">\n    75 Fed.

Courts \"lack the expertise necessary to second-guess ... agency opinions in the typical national security FOIA case.\"\n   <em>\n    Krikorian v. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3810472,10514035\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/984/461/\">\n    984 F.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (D.C.

Courts therefore \"must accord substantial weight to an agency's affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record,\" and they must remain cognizant of the fact \"that any affidavit or other agency statement of threatened harm to national security will always be speculative to some extent, in the sense that it describes a potential future harm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Am.

As the Court already said, the Navy has asserted that the parts of the document are classified at the \"Secret\" level. In the Court's view, it certainly makes sense that a classified detainee interrogation log would contain information about intelligence sources and methods, and the agency's declaration explains that there are many reasons why revelation of those sources and methods could risk national security and the defense against transnational terrorism. For one, intelligence sources, the declaration states, \"can ... be expected to furnish information only when confident that they are protected from retribution by the absolute secrecy surrounding their relationship to the United States government.\" Schrock Decl. \u00b6 17(s). The declaration also explains that \"[d]etailed knowledge of the methods and practices of an intelligence agency must be protected from disclosure because such knowledge would be of material assistance to those who would seek to penetrate, detect, prevent, avoid, or damage the intelligence operations of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And the declaration says that \"[d]isclosure of information the U.S. government obtains through intelligence sources or methods could reasonably be expected to enable persons and groups hostile to the United States to identify U.S. intelligence activities ... and to design countermeasures to them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This justification is logical and plausible, and it is not \"contradicted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of the agency's bad faith,\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Exemption 7(E)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the Navy's assertion of FOIA Exemption 7(E) over two documents: Navy 35 and Navy 38, both of which contain a six-page memorandum titled \"An Alternative Approach to the Interrogation of Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\" that was sent by the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (\"NCIS\") to the Navy General Counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schrock Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17(l), (o). Navy 38 also includes an eleven-page appendix titled \"Specific Recommendations for Interrogators of Al-Qa'ida Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\" that \"discuss[es] in detail proposed interrogation strategies and techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17(o).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Exemption 7(E) permits the withholding of \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but\n   only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information ... would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E). The Exemption imposes, then, at least two basic requirements on government agencies. First, to establish that the documents at issue were \"compiled for law enforcement purposes,\" the agency must \"establish a rational nexus between the investigation and one of the agency's law enforcement duties,\" as well as \"a connection between an individual or incident and a possible security risk or violation of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v.

Cir. 1998) ). Second, the agency must \"demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayer Brown LLP v.

Cir. 2009) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Neither of these requirements are particularly demanding, but the Navy has not met them here. As justification for claiming Exemption 7(E), the Navy's declaration merely says that the withheld material \"identif[ies] Law Enforcement and/or National Security techniques and procedures that are not widely known\" and that are sometimes \"intended for covert use.\" Schrock Decl. \u00b6 17(o). Disclosure of this information, the Navy contends, \"would diminish or negate the effectiveness of these techniques and procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17(o). This reasoning is conclusory; it essentially just restates the applicable legal standard in different words. With respect to the Exemption's first requirement, the Navy's declaration names no relevant \"law enforcement duty\" and no \"individual or incident\" at issue. And with respect to the second requirement, the declaration identifies no \"law\" that would be easier to violate if the information were released. To be sure, Plaintiffs do not appear to have challenged certain aspects of the Navy's assertions here, and the Court can easily assume that NCIS qualifies as a law enforcement agency. The Court can also imagine an argument that the disclosure of the specifics of interrogation methods might make it easier for detainees to resist interrogation. But the Court cannot be required to make such assumptions; the burden is on the Navy to establish the requisite nexus. As things currently stand, then, the Court is unable to conclude that the withheld material was \"compiled for law enforcement purposes\" or that its release \"could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E).

Should Defendants choose to exercise this option, Plaintiffs may file a response within twenty-one days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    As a formal matter, OASD-HA Policy and OASD-HAGC are not actually Defendants; they are instead components of a named Defendant, the Department of Defense. For simplicity, however, the Court will occasionally refer to them as Defendants in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 96 and 97) with respect to six other Defendant entities-the Army, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Joint Task Force Guantanamo, United States Central Command, and the United States Special Operations Command-will be resolved in a separate forthcoming opinion and order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    All three of the above examples are admittedly fairly long documents. According to Plaintiffs, any parts of these and other similar drafts that were eventually \"formally or informally adopted in final versions must be disclosed.\" Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Opp'n\") at 14, ECF No. 62. This is not the law, though; FOIA does not require an agency to release portions of any draft that are ultimately repeated in the final policy. For one, as Defendants correctly note, this \"would be a waste of time and elevate form over substance, as FOIA requesters would only receive what they already had.\" Defs.' Reply at 20, ECF No. 65. But also, even these repeat disclosures would have consequences for the agencies: they \"would divulge information regarding 'decisions to insert or delete material or to change [the] draft's focus or emphasis' and thus 'would stifle the creative thinking and candid exchange of ideas necessary to produce good ... work.' \"\n    <em>\n     Hardy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274644\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/155/#p162\">\n     243 F.Supp.3d at 174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alternation and omission in original) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Dudman Commc'ns Corp. v.
