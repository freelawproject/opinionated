Code \u00a7 2949.221 -.222 (\"secrecy bill\") and this Court's protective orders (ECF Nos. 629 and 838) prevented Plaintiffs from learning the identities of the Drug Source Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 1576, at PageID 69513-16.) Plaintiffs insist that despite every avenue for discovering the\n   identities of the Drug Source Defendants being impeded, Plaintiffs have made good faith efforts to learn those identities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at PageID 69517-18.) Plaintiffs point to the fact that they served twenty Rule 45 third-party subpoenas on different compounding pharmacies required to produce documents to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\"ODRC\"), and a Rule 45 subpoena on the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy, to obtain the identities of possible Drug Source Defendants, only to learn that the compounding facilities had no responsive documents and to receive from the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy a list of tens of thousands of possible entities. Plaintiffs thus renew their requests for the Court to modify its protective orders, and also implore the Court to await the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in a case involving challenges to Ohio's Execution Secrecy Law, to wit:\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Hogan Lovells U.S., L.L.P. v. Department of Rehab. &amp; Corr.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2016-1776. (ECF No. 1576, at PageID 69518-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Magistrate Judge found \"that Plaintiffs have acted diligently in their efforts to discover the identity of the Drug Source Defendants by seeking to set aside the secrecy bill and opposing the protective order[,]\" but that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated good cause for their failure to effect timely service because \"the evidence is equivocal regarding efforts to learn the identities of the Drug Source Defendants by means other than discovery from the State Defendants.\" (ECF No. 1798, at PageID 73347.) The Magistrate Judge noted that the service of Rule 45 subpoenas was not fruitful and questioned how a decision by the Ohio 818Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hogan Lovells\n   </em>\n   would solve Plaintiff's dilemma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 73347-48.) The Magistrate Judge thus found no good cause and no reason to modify the protective orders in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 73349.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs object first to what they characterize as the Magistrate Judge's legal error in failing to begin his analysis by determining whether there was good cause for the Plaintiffs' failure to effect timely service. (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74146-47.) In his Supplemental Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge noted, \"[a]ctually, the first finding Rule 4(m) requires is whether service has been made within ninety days of filing the complaint. If not, the Court 'must dismiss the action without prejudice' against the unserved defendant.\" (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74764.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge and OVERRULES Plaintiff's objection. As the Court noted above, under a plain reading of Rule 4(m), a plaintiff's failure to effectuate service on a defendant necessitates dismissal without prejudice, absent a showing of good cause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nafziger v. McDermott Intern., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802644\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/514/#p521\">\n    467 F.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (6th Cir. 2006) (\"Dismissal of the action 'shall' follow unless the 'plaintiff shows good cause' for failure to meet the [90]-day deadline.\" (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrief v.

Whether a plaintiff can demonstrate good cause is not the first determination that Rule 4(m) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs agree with the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that they were diligent in their efforts to identify the Drug Source Defendants by challenging Ohio's secrecy bill and the Court's protective orders, but object to the Magistrate Judge's characterization of the evidence of Plaintiffs' efforts to identify the Drug Source Defendants going forward as \"equivocal.\" (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74147-48.) As the Court noted above, the Magistrate Judge stated that the service of Rule 45 subpoenas was not fruitful and questioned how a decision by the Ohio\n   Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hogan Lovells\n   </em>\n   would solve Plaintiffs' dilemma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 73347-48.) Ultimately, the Magistrate Judge concluded that \"there is not, at present, reasonable prospect of identification and service[ ]\" upon the unknown Drug Source Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 73349.) In their objections to the Magistrate Judge's failure to find good cause, Plaintiffs construe the Magistrate Judge to have \"found at least some evidence in Plaintiffs' favor[ ]\" as to their efforts to identify the Drug Source Defendants. (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74147.) \"[D]espite the paucity of the Magistrate Judge's conclusions respecting good cause,\" Plaintiffs continue, \"there is no other finding that would otherwise undermine at least\n   <em>\n    the implicit finding of good cause arising from the finding that Plaintiffs have been diligent in their efforts\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74148 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs object to the Magistrate Judge's finding that evidence of their efforts was \"equivocal,\" and proceed to recount the efforts they have taken to identify and serve the Drug Source Defendants. (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74149-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his Supplemental Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge referenced the Advisory Note to the 2015 amendment of Rule 4(m) that shortened the time for service from 120 days to 90 days, remarking that the Note \"expresses the hope that this will 'reduce delay at the beginning of litigation.' \" (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74764 (citing 2015 Advisory Committee Comment).) \"That and the permission to raise the service issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Magistrate Judge continued, \"speaks to the obligation of district courts to actively manage cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Magistrate Judge proceeded to reiterate why he found that Plaintiffs failed to show good cause. Specifically, the Magistrate Judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In two and one-half years, [Plaintiffs] have not identified a single one of the Drug Source Defendants, They have issued subpoenas attempting to discover names of compounding pharmacies, even though all executions scheduled, attempted, or complete[d] since October 7, 2016, have used manufactured drugs. They resisted the suggestion of the Court that they sue entities named in the FDA Orange Book as manufacturing the drugs Ohio has been using with the excuse that the Orange Book changes every year and only includes manufacturers. They have, without any explanation, failed to name the two prominent manufacturers of drugs used in Ohio executions who are\n   <em>\n    amid curiae\n   </em>\n   in the mandamus case in the Supreme Court of Ohio seeking to learn whether they are manufacturers of execution drugs presently in possession of the ODRC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74764-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his Supplemental Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge also expressly disavowed that he had made any implicit finding of good cause stemming from his finding that Plaintiffs had been diligent. (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74765.) The Magistrate Judge explained, \"[w]hat the Report concluded was that Plaintiffs had been diligent in their efforts to have\n   the Secrecy Bill and the Court's Protective Orders set aside[,] [b]ut that finding was followed by a description of the insufficient efforts to learn Drug Source Defendant identity by means other than discovery from the State.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs object to the Magistrate Judge's Supplemental Report, arguing first that the Magistrate Judge erred in relying on policy considerations underlying the 2015 amendment to Rule 4(m). Plaintiffs explain that since the inception of this case was in 2004, \"any reduction in delay between filing and service was realized long ago and no longer applies.\" (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74783.) Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court disagrees with and OVERRULES that objection. As State Defendants argue and this Court's own reading of the Magistrate Judge's Supplemental Report confirms, it is clear that the Magistrate Judge's reliance on the Advisory Note to the 2015 amendment was simply a recognition of the ongoing obligation that district courts have to actively manage cases from their inception and throughout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In their objections to the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that they failed to demonstrate good cause, Plaintiffs also criticize the Magistrate Judge's reliance on the failure of their efforts to produce results rather than on the efforts themselves. (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74783-84.) Plaintiffs argue that \"success is not the barometer of whether Plaintiffs' efforts were sufficient to find good cause for not yet serving Drug Source Defendants[,]\" where, as here, circumstances have prevented Plaintiffs from obtaining information they need to identify and serve certain defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge's reasoning and OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objection. In arguing that they have demonstrated good cause for their failure to timely serve the Drug Source Defendants sufficient to warrant an additional appropriate amount of time to effect service, Plaintiffs have failed in more than two and a half years to identify a single Drug Source Defendant. They reject suggestions the Magistrate Judge made for identification and, even if they had legitimate bases for rejecting those suggestions (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74784-87), Plaintiffs have not offered a single prospect of their own for how they intend to identify any Drug Source Defendants. They defend their service of Rule 45 subpoenas to discover the identity of compounding pharmacies on the ground that \"Defendants have expressly included in recent revisions of the Ohio execution protocol language stating that compounding pharmacies are a potential source of execution drugs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74788.) Even if efforts to learn the identity of compounding pharmacies that Ohio might use in the future to produce execution drugs are not unwarranted, that fact alone does not bolster a showing of good cause for Plaintiffs' failure to identify any Drug Source Defendants or the prospect of identifying Drug Source Defendants with more time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Difficulty obtaining information about defendants can constitute good cause for failure to effectuate service. In\n   <em>\n    Clemons v. Soeltner\n   </em>\n   , 62 Fed. App'x 81, 83 (6th Cir. 2003), the Sixth Circuit found good cause where the district court had failed to enforce orders compelling the Attorney General to provide addresses and had placed blame for the failure to effect service a plaintiff who was incarcerated and had repeatedly sought assistance to effect service).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Del Raine v.

The Magistrate Judge further determined that, \"Defendants on the other hand, note that they cannot obtain a final appealable judgment as long as unnamed and unserved Defendants are parties to the case.\" (ECF No. 1798, at PageID 73349.) Ultimately, the Magistrate Judge concluded, as noted above, \"[i]t is not a reasonable interpretation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) to allow a case to continue to pend against defendants as to whom there is not, at present, reasonable prospect of identification and service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs first \"object to the extent that the R &amp; R does not provide [the opportunity to serve the complaint 'within a specified time'], or make any explicit finding as to the exercise of the Court's discretion, in the absence of a good-cause finding.\" (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74148.) The Court disagrees with and OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objection. The Magistrate Judge made findings as to the absence of prejudice to Plaintiffs from dismissal of the Drug Source Defendants without prejudice, as well as to the prejudice Defendants would suffer if the unserved Drug Source Defendants remained as parties. More importantly, the Magistrate Judge's determination that there existed no reasonable prospect of Plaintiffs identifying and serving the Drug Source Defendants was tantamount to a finding that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they were deserving of additional time to serve the Drug Source Defendants-the very showing they complain they were not given an opportunity to make. As discussed more fully above, the Court agrees upon its own review of the Reports and objections that Plaintiffs have offered no reasonable basis for believing that, with additional appropriate time, they are likely or even possibly likely of effectuating service on the Drug Source Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs also object that \"because they would be greatly prejudiced by dismissal, whereas the DRC Defendants are not prejudiced at all by permitting the Drug Source Defendants to remain[ ],\" Plaintiffs should be afforded additional appropriate time to identify and serve the Drug Source Defendants, or be permitted to proceed against the Drug Source Defendants pseudonymously as suggested in Plaintiffs' earlier responses.\" (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74152-53.) Plaintiffs explain that while filing a separate suit later upon identification of Drug Source Defendants would be logical in \"ordinary\" civil litigation, that is not the case here because of \"significant procedural hurdles or practical impediments imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act that Plaintiffs have already satisfied in this case but which would be resurrected in a new case, including matters such as full payment of filing fees for a new case even with\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs dispute that Defendants would suffer prejudice in the form of being unable to obtain a final appealable judgment while unnamed and unserved Drug Source Defendants remain on the case, arguing on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Plaintiffs also argue that, \"[a]lternatively, this Court could enter a final judgment as to all claims against the DRC Defendants by complying with Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -that is, by entering an 'express determination that there is no just reason for delay' and making 'an express direction for the entry of judgment.' \" (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74153-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the Supplemental Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge noted that Plaintiffs raised no objection to his finding that they would suffer no prejudice from a dismissal of the Drug Source Defendants without prejudice with respect to the statute of limitations, but that Plaintiffs instead object that they would suffer \"great prejudice\" because of hurdles created by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, to wit: full payment of filing fees. The Magistrate Judge was unpersuaded by that objection, stating that the current filing fee is $ 400, that no separate fee is charged for intervenors, and that if this case were still pending when Plaintiffs identified one or more Drug Source Defendants, there would be no filing fee at all for an amended complaint adding a party. (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74766.) Plaintiffs raised no objections to these findings in their response to the Supplemental Report. In any event, the Court upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review cannot find that Plaintiffs have articulated any material prejudice they would suffer from dismissal of the drug source defendants without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the Supplemental Report, the Magistrate Judge rejected Plaintiffs' assertion that allowing the Drug Source Defendants to remain on the case would not defeat State Actor Defendants' ability to obtain a final appealable judgment, noting Defendants' argument that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision relied upon by Plaintiffs is both unpublished and therefore not binding on later panels and contrary to the position taken on this issue by the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74766 (citing Response, ECF No. 1858, at PageID 74584-86).) The Magistrate Judge concluded that it cannot be said with certainty whether the Sixth Circuit would treat as final and appealable any judgment including unserved Drug Source Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs object at length. (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74792-95.) Plaintiffs insist that \"under\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , any unserved Drug Source Defendants would not be considered parties at the time of a hypothetical judgment, and thus such judgment would be considered final for purposes of Rule 54(b).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74792.) Plaintiffs also reiterate their argument that this Court could \"certify an immediate appeal under Rule 54(b) in the event it dismisses all the claims against the DRC Defendants even if the claims remain pending against the unserved Drug Source Defendants[,]\" and fault the Magistrate Judge for not addressing this solution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74792-93.) Plaintiffs continue by objecting to the Magistrate Judge's determination that the unpublished\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision cannot be relied on to guarantee that the Sixth Circuit would treat a judgment as final and appealable despite the inclusion of unserved Drug Source Defendant. Plaintiffs argue that that this determination \"overlooks the highly persuasive nature\n   of the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision, particularly when considered in the context of the other (published) decisions from sister circuits with which the court grouped it in\n   <em>\n    Cambridge Holdings Group, Inc. v.

Cir. 2007).\" (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74793-94.) To this point, Plaintiffs also object as incorrect the Magistrate Judge's agreement with Defendants that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is contrary to published decisions on the same issue by the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74794-95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court disagrees with and OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objections. The Court has read the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision and understands its holding to be an that appeal from a judgment dismissing a suit against all served defendants was sufficient for purposes of a final decision under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that any remaining unserved defendants were not parties to the case.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , No. 97-3107,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20321045\">\n    1998 WL 321045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20U.S.%20App.%20LEXIS%2011766\">\n    1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 11766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (6th Cir.

But the bottom line is that the perceived persuasiveness of the unpublished\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision, which does not appear to have been cited by a single court within the Sixth Circuit in the eleven years since it was issued, and other published decisions by sister circuits cannot guarantee certainty, plausibility, or likelihood that the Sixth Circuit would treat as final any judgment in this case that included unserved Drug Source Defendants sufficient to find that State Actor Defendants will not suffer prejudice by allowing unserved Drug Source Defendants to remain on this case-especially where the relief Plaintiffs seek, additional time to effectuate service, remains unlikely to result in Plaintiffs ability to identify and serve the Drug Source Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Another set of objections raised by Plaintiffs with respect to the relative prejudice the parties might sustain concern the Magistrate Judge's rejection of Plaintiffs' proposal to proceed against the unnamed Drug Source Defendants pseudonymously. In their Objections to the Magistrate Judge's original Report and Recommendations, Plaintiffs argued that State Actor Defendants would not be prejudiced if Plaintiffs were permitted to proceed against the Drug Source Defendants pseudonymously in the same manner as they have proceeded against execution team members pseudonymously. (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74152-53.) In the Supplemental Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge rejected the viability of that suggestion, explaining that the situations are completely different because \"[t]he execution team members are known identified people who have either been served with or waived process and who are vigorously litigating this case.\" (ECF No. 1907, at PageID 74766.) The Magistrate Judge continued, \"[n]o Drug Source Defendant fits any of those criteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs object, insisting that the two situations are \"precisely alike for all relevant purposes.\" (ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74790.) \"Indeed,\" Plaintiffs continue, \"the Drug Source Defendants are more favorably positioned than the Execution Team Members were at the analogous stage of the case because they already possess the benefit of secret identity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs dispute that at the time Judge Frost created the pseudonymous framework under which Execution Team Members' identities were kept secret but Plaintiffs' claims against them were allowed to proceed, the team members were actually known identified people or were vigorously litigating this case, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs continue their reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [T]he same rules should apply to the Drug Source Defendants. Like the\n   Anonymous Execution Team Members, their identities have been cloaked in secrecy at least as to Plaintiffs. But also like the Anonymous Execution Team Members in 2008, other Defendants know the actual identities of the Drug Source Defendants. Thus, they are \"known\" and \"identified\" in the same way that the Anonymous Execution Team Members were \"known\" and \"identified\" before being given pseudonyms for purposes of this litigation and subsequently named and served as Defendants. And in the same way that the Anonymous Execution Team Members either accepted service via counsel in the Ohio Attorney General's office or waived process and then vigorously litigated this case, service of the Drug Source Defendants can easily be facilitated through counsel in the Attorney General's office that know the specific identities of the relevant persons or entities. At that point, a pseudonym can be assigned to each Drug Source Defendant, thus permitting that person or entity to vigorously litigate this case just like the Anonymous Execution Team Members\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74791.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants respond that the Magistrate Judge correctly dismissed this suggestion. (ECF No. 1919, at PageID 74825-26.) Defendants first assert that while the Execution Team Members' interests are closely aligned with the named State Actor Defendants who can and do appear in court to represent ODRC, the Drug Source Defendants' interests are not so aligned. Defendants dispute that it would be possible for a Drug Source Defendant to remain anonymous while simultaneously sending leadership of its entity to court. \"And even if the drug entities or involved individuals were anonymous in court,\" Defendants continue, \"their legal counsel would not be; thus the source of that counsels' employment could be traced and used to 'out' the entities' true identity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74825.) Defendants next assert that \"even a pseudonymous appearance in court could jeopardize Ohio's ability to obtain execution drugs from the Drug Source Defendants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 74826.) Finally, Defendant dispute any suggestion that the Ohio Attorney General's Office, which represents many State Actor Defendants, could represent Drug Source Defendants or facilitate service to, or waive service on behalf of, any Drug Source Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court agrees with Defendants and OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objections. In view of the obvious reality that the Ohio Attorney General cannot be expected to represent the Drug Source Defendants or even necessarily facilitate service to them, Drug Source Defendants proceeding pseudonymously would still have to be represented in court by an agent of the entity or individual and counsel. It seems impossible to this Court that any Drug Source Defendants proceeding pseudonymously but not absently could shield their identities as the Execution Team Members appear to have been able to do. The risks associated with a Drug Source Defendant's identity being revealed have been litigated and upheld, and demonstrate that the need for Drug Source Defendants to maintain their secrecy different in nature and scope than that of the Execution Team Members. The Court is aware of no evidence or suggestion that the pseudonymous framework has been insufficient to maintain secrecy of the Execution Team Members' identities, but the Court is not persuaded that the same framework would be sufficient to shield the Drug Source Defendants' identities in view of the need for them to have in court a representative and/or counsel through whom their identities could surely be learned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objections going to the Court's discretion to allow extra time to effectuate service in the absence of a showing of good cause for not achieving timely service. (ECF No. 1814, at PageID 74152-54; ECF No. 1913, at PageID 74792-95.) Balancing the amount of time already elapsed and lack of prospects that additional appropriate time is likely to lead to identification of the Drug Source Defendants; the uncertainty of State Actor Defendants obtaining final appealable judgment while unserved Drug Source Defendants remain on the case (even if recent developments in this litigation make it unlikely that there will be any final appealable judgment in the near future); the absence of evidence establishing one way or the other whether the unserved Drug Source Defendants have actual notice of Plaintiffs' claims against them (even if it is likely mat the Drug Source Defendants are aware of Plaintiffs' claims against them); and that there exists no risk of Plaintiffs' claims against the unknown Drug Source Defendants being time-barred-the Court cannot find that additional time to effectuate service is warranted. Although the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs exercised diligence in challenging the secrecy bill and the Court's protective orders in an effort to identify the Drug Source Defendants, their efforts since then do not warrant the grant of additional time to effectuate service on the Drug Source Defendants. Plaintiffs issued a handful of Rule 45 subpoenas that bore no fruit or leads, they have done nothing since the issuance of those subpoenas to identify the Drug Source Defendants, and they have proposed no prospects for identifying the Drug Source Defendants. Rule 4(m) favors dismissal without prejudice of the Drug Source Defendants under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A final set of objections raised by Plaintiffs concerns their request that this Court wait until after the Ohio Supreme Court issues a decision in the case of\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Hogan Lovells U.S. L.L.P/, et al., v. Dep't of Rehab. &amp; Corr.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2016-1776 -a mandamus action filed by records requesters seeking to compel ODRC to release record related to ODRC's acquisition and supply of lethal injection drugs. In the original Report and Recommendations, the Magistrate Judge stated that Plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate how a decision in\n   <em>\n    Hogan Lovell\n   </em>\n   would solve their dilemma of not being able to identify Drug Source Defendants. (ECF No. 1798, at PageID 73348.) In their objections, Plaintiffs assert that the decision \"may well be the disclosure of the identities of Drug Source Defendants if they did not expressly follow the statutory requirements to invoke anonymity protection under Ohio's now-expired execution secrecy law, Ohio Rev.
