The Third Circuit has not yet addressed the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Ninth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Sequoia\n   </em>\n   , established the \"rational relationship\" test. It held that dismissal of a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action pursuant to \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) is appropriate only if the government has a valid governmental purpose, and dismissal is rationally related to accomplishing that legitimate governmental interest.\n   <em>\n    Sequoia\n   </em>\n   , 151 F.3d at 1145-47. If the government satisfies this test, \"the burden switches to the relator to demonstrate that dismissal is fraudulent, arbitrary and capricious, or illegal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1145.

The court explained that it could \"not see how \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A) gives the judiciary general oversight of the Executive's judgment in this regard.

Is the judge an observer, a mediator, or a participant in the debate? Certainly, if the government's right to dismiss is limitless, the judge is not an adjudicator. The judge has no decision to make if the government's right to dismiss is unchallengeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Requiring a hearing assures that the decision to dismiss is not arbitrary and without a valid governmental interest. The False Claims Act was created by Congress to enhance the government's ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the government. S. REP.

Requiring some justification, no matter how insubstantial, for a decision not to pursue a\n   false claim, acts as a check against the Executive from absolving a fraudster on a whim or for some illegitimate reason. It prevents the Executive from abusing power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The rational relationship test strikes a balance among the branches of government. It does not give unlimited power to the Executive to dismiss a legitimate action the Legislature created. Nor does it give the Judicial Branch unrestrained power to stop the Executive from acting to dismiss an action in the government's interest. Requiring the Executive to give a reason for a decision to dismiss a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action the Legislature intended to be pursued is consistent with the notion of independent, co-equal branches of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In short, because the rational relationship test gives meaning to the requirement of a hearing and guards against arbitrary dismissal of an action intended by Congress, we conclude that it is the proper standard to be applied in analyzing a government motion to dismiss a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, under the\n   <em>\n    Sequoia\n   </em>\n   rational relationship test, the government has articulated a legitimate interest and dismissal will accomplish that interest.

Relators do not contend that the government engaged in fraud or illegal action to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action for improper reasons.
