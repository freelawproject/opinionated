Plaintiff Photographic Illustrators Corporation (\"PIC\"), a Massachusetts company specializing in commercial photography, licensed photographs to Osram Sylvania, Inc. (\"OSI\") of lighting products that OSI manufactures and sells. Defendant Orgill, Inc. is a distributor of OSI products and uses some of these images in its online and print marketing materials. PIC brought claims against Orgill under the Copyright Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), and the Lanham Act based on Orgill's use of its photographs. In 2015, the Court granted summary judgment to Orgill on the DMCA and Lanham Act claims but denied Orgill's request for summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Photographic Illustrators Corp. v.

In November 2017, the arbitrator issued an award resolving all of the claims in the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Orgill has now renewed its motion for summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim. Orgill asserts that it received a sublicense that authorized its use of PIC's images and argues that the arbitrator's award precludes PIC from contesting this defense. PIC has also moved for summary judgment, contending that Orgill did not receive a sublicense, its use of approval images falls outside its sublicense, and its sublicense is conditioned on including attribution to PIC on the images, which Orgill did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DENIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   PIC's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 172) and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLOWS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Orgill's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise stated.

PIC provided OSI with these images to use in sales and marketing. To this end, PIC had a licensing agreement with OSI (the \"PIC-OSI Agreement\"), which gave OSI \"a non-exclusive, worldwide license in and to all the Images and the copyrights thereto to freely Use, sub-license Use, and permit Use, in its sole and absolute discretion, in perpetuity, anywhere in the world.\" Dkt. No. 173-11 \u00b6 9. According to the terms of the PIC-OSI Agreement, \"Use\" is to be given the \"great possible interpretation,\" and includes, but is not limited to, the right to \"copy, edit, modify, prepare derivative works, reproduce, transmit, display, broadcast, print, publish, use in connection with any media ..., and store in a database.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2(d). The licensing agreement barred OSI from \"sub-licens[ing] images in exchange for valuable consideration such as a fee (e.g., as stock photography)\" (the \"fee provision\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. It also provided that, \"[t]o the extent reasonably possible and practical, OSI shall ... include a copyright notice indicating PIC as the copyright owner and/or include proper attribution indicating Paul Picone as the photographer for Images Used by OSI\" (the \"attribution requirement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     OSI's Copyright Sublicense Agreement with Orgill\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Orgill, a wholesale distributor for OSI, maintains a network of retail dealers who sell hardware, home improvement supplies, and building materials. Orgill's inventory includes almost one thousand OSI products, and Orgill uses images from OSI in its electronic and paper catalogues. It also makes images from OSI available for its dealers to use in advertising OSI products. Orgill has used thirty-four images for which PIC holds the copyright. Before this lawsuit began, Orgill did not have direct contact with PIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 23, 2014, after PIC filed this lawsuit, OSI and Orgill executed a Confirmatory Copyright Sublicense Agreement (the \"Confirmatory Sublicense\"), effective\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   as of June 1, 2006. Under the Confirmatory Sublicense, OSI \"confirm[ed] that it previously granted permission to Orgill to Use and to sublicense the right to Use the Images to its dealers.\" Dkt No. 56-13 \u00b6 2, at 5. Its definition of \"Use\" is materially identical to the definition in the PIC-OSI Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1(E), at 5. The Confirmatory Sublicense further\n   states that \"Orgill covenants to include (and instruct its sublicensees/dealers to include), to the extent reasonably possible and practical with respect to size, prominence, aesthetics, and Use, a copyright notice indicating PIC as the copyright owner of the Images.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3(B), at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 11, 2014, PIC filed suit against Orgill and Farm &amp; City, Inc., one of Orgill's dealers, in connection with their use of PIC's images of OSI products. PIC alleged copyright infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count I); mishandling of copyright management information under the DMCA (Count II); and false designation of origin and false advertising under the Lanham Act (Count III). PIC sought permanent injunctive relief against any further infringement, the recall and destruction of all infringing copies of its images, and payment of actual damages, attorney's fees, and costs. PIC did not sue OSI, and the Court denied OSI's motion to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Orgill moved for summary judgment on all counts in February 2015. In its memorandum and order issued on July 29, 2015, the Court granted Orgill summary judgment on PIC's DMCA and Lanham Act claims.\n   <em>\n    SeePIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    118 F.Supp.3d at 406-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With regard to the copyright claim, the Court first held that Orgill received an implied sublicense from OSI to use PIC's images.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Orgill obtained the images from OSI's representatives and external website, and OSI gave Orgill implied permission to use the images to sell its products.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   OSI also reviewed Orgill's catalogues twice a year and never objected to its use of the images.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Orgill argued that the Confirmatory Sublicense gave it greater rights to use the images than the PIC-OSI Agreement gave to OSI. The Court determined that the PIC-OSI Agreement \"provide[d] the benchmark\" for evaluating the lawfulness of Orgill's conduct because OSI could not sublicense rights to Orgill that went beyond the rights it licensed from PIC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    at 403-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then decided that PIC provided sufficient evidence to raise a genuine dispute as to whether Orgill infringed its copyrights. In particular, PIC put forth evidence that Orgill sublicensed the images for a fee to Farm &amp; City and failed to include any attribution on the images before the lawsuit, which violated the fee provision and attribution requirement of the PIC-OSI Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Orgill argued that, even if it did infringe PIC's copyrights, it did not do so knowingly, but the Court found that the references to PIC in the Confirmatory Sublicense gave Orgill sufficient notice that PIC held the copyrights to the images.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    at 405-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court denied Orgill's motion for summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 26, 2016, pursuant to the arbitration clause within the PIC-OSI Agreement, OSI commenced an arbitration against PIC. OSI brought claims stemming from PIC's initiation of over thirty copyright lawsuits against OSI's customers, such as this suit against Orgill. PIC asserted counterclaims against OSI in the arbitration, including for copyright infringement for violating the fee provision and attribution requirement in the PIC-OSI Agreement. In October 2016, seven of the customers PIC sued for copyright infringement (but not Orgill) agreed to consolidate\n   their lawsuits into the arbitration. At the request of both PIC and Orgill, the Court stayed this lawsuit in November 2016 pending resolution of the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 20, 2017, the arbitrator issued a Partial Final Award that resolved all of the claims in the arbitration. As relevant here, the arbitrator found that the fee provision and attribution requirement were only covenants of the contract, not conditions on OSI's license to use the images. Accordingly, because covenants are only enforceable via contract law, OSI breached the PIC-OSI Agreement by violating the attribution requirement but did not commit copyright infringement. The arbitrator also determined that the PIC-OSI Agreement permitted OSI to impliedly sublicense use of the images to its customers, which it had done for the seven customers that were parties to the arbitration. He therefore found that those customers also were not infringing PIC's copyrights by using its images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 21, 2018, Orgill filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in this case. Orgill contends that the arbitrator conclusively determined that the attribution requirement is not a condition on its sublicense and thus cannot support a copyright infringement claim. In response, PIC filed its own motion for summary judgment. PIC argues that the Partial Final Award does not preclude its copyright infringement claim against Orgill, which was not a party to the arbitration. PIC also contends that Orgill's sublicense defense fails a matter of law because: 1) Orgill cannot prove that it had an implied sublicense to use the images; 2) the Confirmatory Sublicense made Orgill's sublicense conditional on the attribution requirement even though it was not a condition in the PIC-OSI Agreement; and 3) Orgill's use of approval images exceeded the scope of its sublicense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

However, Orgill contends that it received an implied sublicense from OSI to use the images and thus cannot be held liable for infringement. PIC counters that Orgill received no implied sublicense, Orgill violated a condition of its sublicense by failing to provide proper attribution on the images, and Orgill exceeded the scope of its sublicense by using approval images. The Court addresses PIC's three arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Existence of an Implied Sublicense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   PIC first argues that Orgill did not receive a sublicense from OSI to use its images, both based on the relationship between OSI and Orgill and because an implied sublicense is a legal impossibility. Orgill responds that the Partial Final Award precludes this challenge to the existence of its implied sublicense and that PIC's arguments fail on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preclusive Effect of the Partial Final Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Orgill correctly contends that the Partial Final Award precludes PIC from\n   contesting that the PIC-OSI Agreement gave OSI the authority to grant implied sublicenses to its customers. In his Partial Final Award, the arbitrator wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Relying on the very broad language of paragraphs 2 and 9 of the Agreement, OSI allowed its customers Use of the PIC images without the need of written authorization. While PIC contends OSI was required to employ written sub-licenses, there is no such requirement in the Agreement, a matter conceded by Mr. Picone. The language in Paragraph 9 and the acknowledgment by PIC and its counsel that the Images could be and were intended to be Used by OSI's customers provides the basis for an implied license from OSI for such customer use of the Images.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dkt. No. 169-1 at 44-45 (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This finding meets the four requirements for issue preclusion. OSI's authority to grant implied sublicenses to its customers was the same issue in the arbitration as here. Although Orgill was not itself involved in the arbitration, this issue goes to OSI's authority under the PIC-OSI Agreement, not how it utilized that authority with individual customers. The arbitrator's explanation makes clear that PIC and OSI actually litigated this issue, as PIC unsuccessfully argued that OSI had to use express sublicenses. The Partial Final Award is a final and binding judgment that receives preclusive effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manganella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638553\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/585/#p591\">\n    700 F.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The arbitrator's finding about the validity of the implied sublicenses was essential to his conclusion that OSI's customers did not infringe PIC's copyrights. Given that this issue was thoroughly litigated in the arbitration, Orgill properly invokes defensive nonmutual issue preclusion to estop PIC from relitigating this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Partial Final Award does not, however, preclude PIC from challenging whether OSI granted Orgill an implied sublicense. It is unclear whether the arbitrator decided that OSI gave all its customers implied sublicenses or just the customers who were parties to the arbitration. However, even if he did decide this issue as to all of OSI's customers, it was not necessary to do so to determine that only the customers who were parties to the arbitration did not commit copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Partial Final Award also does not preclude PIC from arguing that implied sublicenses are a legal impossibility. Orgill provides no indication that PIC raised this issue in the arbitration. Instead, PIC argued that the PIC-OSI Agreement did not permit implied sublicensing. Thus, although the arbitrator implicitly assumed or decided that implied sublicenses were possible, the issue was not actually litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In accordance with longstanding business practice, Dennis Sills has obtained product images from OSI since 1998 \"either by talking to [OSI's] rep\" on the telephone, \"calling customer service and talking to whoever is there,\" or searching OSI's external website. Orgill then uses these materials (which include the images in question) to advertise and sell OSI products through dealers like Farm &amp; City. Although Sills does not recall receiving explicit permission from OSI to use the images, he stated that such permission had \"been implied in more ways than I count,\" since \"it's understood in our\n   business that ... I'm using their pictures to sell their products.\" Moreover, Orgill has reviewed Orgill's catalogues twice a year for the past five years, and has never objected to the way that Orgill displays the images.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    PIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n    118 F.Supp.3d at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Urging the Court to reconsider this opinion, PIC first argues that the Court improperly found an implied sublicense based solely on delivery of its images to Orgill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Transfer of ownership of any material object ... does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object ....\");\n   <em>\n    Corbello v.

PIC claims Orgill cannot meet this standard because Orgill did not even know it existed before the lawsuit, let alone request that it create or deliver any of the images.

No. 56-13 \u00b6 3(B), at 6. This statement demonstrates that the parties did not intend to render Orgill's sublicense ineffective for failure to comply with the attribution requirement. This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the section under which the attribution requirement falls: \"Covenants.\" Dkt. No. 56-13 at 6. A contractual term may be both a condition and a covenant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897273\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/1373/#p1380\">\n    535 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so this title is not determinative.

No. 56-13 \u00b6\u00b6 1(E), 2, at 5 (emphasis added).

The Court need not definitively determine all the other provisions in the Confirmatory Sublicense that are conditions, but Paragraph 5, which bars Orgill from transferring the right to use the images except as specified in Paragraph 2, is one condition. And reading the attribution requirement as a condition of the sublicense itself would render meaningless the clear language that the requirement is \"[w]ithout effect on the rights of Orgill ... to Use the Images as granted in\" the preceding paragraph.

PIC contends that the PIC-OSI Agreement did not authorize OSI to use approval images and OSI therefore could not grant Orgill permission to use those images. PIC offers an affidavit from Picone who explains that he can identify the accused images as approval images based on the rugged edges around the products, which he removes in a final image, and the lack of drop shadow, which he adds in a final image.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Orgill contends that the arbitrator conclusively determined that the PIC-OSI Agreement permitted OSI to use approval images. The arbitrator did state that \"Paragraphs 2 and 9 of the 2006 License Agreement worked in tandem to grant OSI the right to Use - and authorize Use of - all of PIC's images, past and future\" and that the \"Agreement's definition of 'Images' did not distinguish between PIC images sent for 'approval' purposes or in 'final' form.\" Dkt. No. 169-1 at 44. And after OSI admitted to using approval images right before the arbitration, the arbitrator must have determined that its license permitted it do so as part of his\n   finding that OSI had not committed copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, OSI has not met its burden of demonstrating that this issue was actually litigated in the arbitration. Nothing in the Partial Final Award states that PIC argued that the PIC-OSI Agreement did not authorize use of approval images, and OSI has not submitted any briefs or transcripts showing that PIC made this argument.

PIC's response to Orgill's interrogatory was materially incomplete because it omitted an entire theory upon which PIC relies to negate Orgill's license defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   PIC's failure to disclose its approval images theory was not substantially justified or harmless. At the hearing, PIC's attorney stated that PIC did not advance this theory earlier because it had other meritorious arguments. However, a plaintiff is not allowed to PIC its battles and then seek to reopen a new front at the close of discovery. This type of strategic decision does not justify failing to disclose an entire theory upon which a motion for summary judgment is based. Picone's purported ability to easily recognize approval images belies any notion that PIC had no reason to be aware of Orgill's alleged use of approval images earlier. The failure to disclose was not harmless either, as it left Orgill with no discovery on the approval image issue. Orgill has no way of challenging the assertions in Picone's declaration that he did not intend to license use of approval images to OSI and that he recognizes\n   some of the images Orgill used as approval images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   PIC filed its complaint in this case almost four years before moving for summary judgment on its copyright infringement claim. During these four years, PIC gave Orgill no indication that its use of approval images would be an issue, even though Picone asserts that he can identify approval images by sight. Given PIC's failure to excuse its delay and the length of this litigation, the Court declines to reopen discovery to permit Orgill to investigate its use of approval images and whether its sublicense permits use of such images. Instead, the Court excludes the approval images theory pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In its 2015 ruling, this Court held that Orgill received an implied sublicense from OSI to use PIC's images. PIC's arguments that this holding was erroneous are without merit. Although the Court held that PIC raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Orgill violated the attribution requirement of its sublicense, PIC is estopped by the Partial Final Award from arguing that the PIC-OSI Agreement established the attribution requirement as a condition of Orgill's sublicense, and the Court is not persuaded that the attribution requirement is a condition of the Confirmatory Sublicense. The Court also excludes PIC's theory that Orgill exceeded the scope of its sublicense by using approval images because PIC failed to disclose this theory during discovery. Since Orgill received a sublicense to use PIC's images and did not exceed the scope of the sublicense, Orgill did not commit copyright infringement as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, PIC's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 172) is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DENIED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and Orgill's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 167) is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLOWED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    PIC dismissed Farm &amp; City with prejudice on December 31, 2015 after the Court granted Farm &amp; City summary judgment on the DMCA and Lanham Act claims and held that it at most innocently infringed PIC's copyrights when it used photographs of OSI products it received from Orgill.\n    <em>\n     SeePIC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359224\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/398/\">\n     118 F.Supp.3d at 406-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    There is an open question of whether state or federal law governs the preclusive effect of an arbitral award.\n    <em>\n     FleetBoston\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199280\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/70/#p79\">\n     638 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    79 n.10 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     W.J.
