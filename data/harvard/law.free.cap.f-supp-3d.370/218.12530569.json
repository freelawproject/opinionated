INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, retired flight attendants, bring this action against their former employer, defendant American Airlines, Inc. (\"American\"), for eliminating one of their retirement benefits. They allege breach of contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. They also seek a permanent injunction reinstating the benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When plaintiffs retired, they were covered by collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") that provided flight attendants who retired with 25 or more years of service, at age 45 or older, with free travel under the same priority boarding status as active employees (the \"25/45 Benefit\"). Plaintiffs qualified for this benefit. However, in 2014, after plaintiffs retired, American eliminated part of the 25/45 Benefit. As a result, plaintiffs no longer have the same priority boarding status as active employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs brought suit in Massachusetts state court, and American timely removed to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. American now moves to dismiss, arguing that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , preempts plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The RLA establishes mandatory procedures for resolving disputes between airlines and their employees. It categorizes disputes as \"major\" or \"minor,\" and prescribes different procedures for each. In particular, the RLA vests exclusive jurisdiction over minor disputes with arbitration boards created by airlines and labor unions. A dispute is \"minor\" if its resolution requires interpretation of a CBA. Therefore, the RLA preempts any claim that requires interpretation of a CBA to resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court finds that plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment require interpretation of CBAs. Therefore, the court is dismissing those claims. However, plaintiffs' claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation do not depend on interpretation of CBAs. Therefore, the court is denying American's Motion to Dismiss with regard to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.

However, the CBAs do not explicitly state whether qualifying retired flight attendants are entitle to the 25/45 Benefit for life or for the length of the CBA, or whether American, by changing its \"Company polices,\" can effectively eliminate the 25/45 Benefit. If indeed the CBAs only entitled qualifying retired flight attendants to the 25/45 Benefit for some period of time less than life--as the board of adjustment found with regard to the 2013 CBA--American's \"side agreements\" would conflict with the CBAs. That is, the CBAs promise one thing and the side agreements promise another. Under those circumstances, the \"side agreements\" would not be valid.
