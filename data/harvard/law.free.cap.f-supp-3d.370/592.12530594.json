Russell, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants Stuart L. Sagal (\"Sagal\") and Sagal, Filbert, Quasney &amp; Betten, P.A.'s (\"SFQB\") Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment and Request for Hearing (ECF No. 7). This putative class action arises from a\n   debt collection dispute between SFQB, a law firm representing The Maryland Management Company (\"MMC\"), and Plaintiff Crystal Jackson, a former MMC lessee. The Motion is ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2018). For the reasons outlined below, the Court will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2009 until 2010, Jackson and her husband lived in a property MMC managed. (Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1). After wearying of various living conditions on and around the property, Jackson ultimately gave MMC sixty days' advance notice, and then moved out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, SFQB, on behalf of MMC, sued Jackson in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City for owed rent, late fees, court costs, utilities, and attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). The court awarded judgment for SFQB but did not award attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). On August 15, 2017, the judgment was vacated, and the lawsuit was dismissed in response to a class-action settlement in another case,\n   <em>\n    Claiborne v. The Maryland Management Co.\n   </em>\n   , 24-C-16-004505,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204255002\">\n    2016 WL 4255002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Circ. Ct. Balt. City filed Aug. 11, 2016). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 26, 2017, Sagal sent Jackson a collection letter on SFQB letterhead (the \"Letter\") that stated she owed, \"$ 1253.58 plus attorney fees of $ 188.03 and interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 37; Defs.'

The Letter also stated, \"[U]nless suitable arrangements are made to liquidate this indebtedness, we shall have no alternative but to instigate legal proceedings. Such action will require additional cost and expense to you as well as the inconvenience of appearing at the trial of the case.\" (Compl. \u00b6 42; Letter at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 16, 2018, Jackson filed three-count Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the \"Complaint\") against Defendants. (ECF No. 1), alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the \"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2018). (ECF No. 1). Jackson alleges that Defendants' Letter falsely stated that she: owed attorney's fees when no fees were due (Count I); would inevitably owe additional costs and expenses if she were sued (Count II); and would be forced to attend court in person if she were sued. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-77, ECF No. 1). Jackson seeks compensatory damages, statutory damages, and attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 72, 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 30, 2018, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment and Request for Hearing. (ECF No. 7). On April 19, 2018, Jackson filed an Opposition. (ECF No. 10). On May 10, 2018, Defendants filed a Reply. (ECF No. 13). On October 6, 2018, Jackson filed a Surreply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A motion styled in this manner implicates the Court's discretion under Rule 12(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kensington Volunteer Fire Dep't., Inc. v.

The Court \"has 'complete discretion to determine whether or not to accept the submission of any material beyond the pleadings that is offered in conjunction with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and rely on it, thereby converting the motion, or to reject it or simply not consider it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wells-Bey v.

When the movant expressly captions its motion \"in the alternative\" as one for summary judgment and submits matters outside the pleadings for the court's consideration, the parties are deemed to be on notice that conversion under Rule 12(d) may occur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moret v.

To raise sufficiently the issue that more discovery is needed, the non-movant must typically file an affidavit or declaration under Rule 56(d), explaining the \"specified reasons\" why \"it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d). A Rule 56(d) affidavit is inadequate if it simply demands \"discovery for the sake of discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

A Rule 56(d) request for discovery is properly denied when \"the additional evidence sought for discovery would not have by itself created a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ingle ex rel.

To support her position, Jackson submitted a Rule 56(d) affidavit from Attorney Peter A. Holland (the \"Holland Declaration\"). (Holland Decl., ECF No. 10-1). The Holland Declaration lists multiple items for which Jackson seeks additional\n   discovery. Holland avers that Jackson needs written and deposition discovery to oppose Defendants' affidavit regarding their fee agreement with MMC and fees paid-such discovery \"includ[ing] a redacted fee agreement, invoices, cancelled checks, and testimony from a representative of Sagal.\" (Holland Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). Some of the items listed in the Holland Declaration may not be material to Jackson's claims, but Jackson is entitled to any discovery relevant to her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt Valley Baptist Church, Inc. v. Baltimore Cty.\n   </em>\n   , No. ELH-17-804,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204801542\">\n    2017 WL 4801542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 (D. Md. Oct. 24, 2017) (declining to convert the defendants' motion because \"[a]lthough it may not be necessary for plaintiff to explore each of its proposed discovery topics, ... plaintiff is entitled to conduct discovery relevant to its claims\"). Further, Defendants do not dispute the Holland Declaration's compliance with Rule 56(d)'s requirement that an affidavit set forth \"specified reasons\" as to why more discovery is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that Jackson's Rule 56(d) affidavit sufficiently establishes that discovery is necessary. As a result, the Court will not convert the Motion and will construe it as a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The purpose of a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) is to \"test[ ] the sufficiency of a complaint,\" not to \"resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

The Court agrees with Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The FDCPA prohibits attempts to collect nonexistent debt, including attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    81 F.Supp.2d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"[w]hen [the defendant] attempted to collect non-existent attorney[']s fees on behalf of [its client], [the defendant] violated the FDCPA\").

Nevertheless, Defendants maintain that \"in all MMC debt collection cases handled by Defendants,\" including the case against Jackson, \"MMC incurs a $ 50 minimum fee at the time the case is assigned.\" (Defs.' Mem. Supp. Defs.' Mot. at 3, ECF No. 7-1). In support of that contention, Defendants offer an affidavit from Sagal, (Defs.' Mot. Ex. 1 [\"Sagal Aff.\"], ECF No. 7), which the Court will not consider at this stage because the Court's analysis is confined to the allegations in the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Defendants do not account for the remaining $ 138.03 allegedly owed. Thus, the Court concludes that Jackson plausibly alleges that the Letter's demand for attorney's fees is false, deceptive, and misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Judging from the perception of the least sophisticated consumer, Defendants' demand for attorney's fees is also material. The Fourth Circuit has held that billing discrepancies in instances where the overstatement amount is similar to that of Defendants' Letter are material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conteh v.

Specifically, the Fourth Circuit concluded that a debt collector's overstatement of $ 165.02 (ten percent of $ 1,583.96 due) was material to the least sophisticated consumer because it \"caus[es] confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054116\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/119/#p126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the discrepancy is fifteen percent\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -even greater than the ten percent overstatement that was material in\n   <em>\n    Conteh\n   </em>\n   . That is, the least sophisticated consumer would reasonably face confusion when deciding how to respond to the Letter. As a result, such a\n   demand for attorney's fees is material to the least sophisticated consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that Jackson plausibly pleads a violation of the FDCPA related to the Letter's demand for attorney's fees. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion as to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Costs and Expenses (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants assert that the statement regarding additional costs was not false, deceptive, or misleading because Jackson would incur costs if she hired an attorney or traveled and took time off work to appear at the trial, and would have to pay court filing fees if she settled or post-judgment interest if she failed to argue her case. Defendants contend that the costs statement is immaterial when read in the context of the whole Letter. Jackson counters that the costs statement is false because it ignores the possibility that: the consumer might win, either pro se or represented by pro bono counsel; the reality that most suits are resolved without trial, and therefore without added travel expenses; and that Maryland District Court does not require entry of appearance fees. Jackson contends the Letter's threat is material because it suggests that she will inevitably pay money out of pocket regardless of the suit's outcome. The Court agrees with Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from insinuating debtors are inevitably liable for fees and expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    81 F.Supp.2d at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that a collection letter that read: \"[i]f legal action is taken, you will be responsible for attorneys fees, court costs, and pre-judgment interest, as allowed by your contract\" contained a false or misleading representation in violation of the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The crux of\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   is the use of \"will\" mandates that expenses are certain if the debt collector files suit regardless of a settlement or final ruling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case, Jackson plausibly alleges that Defendants' statement that she will incur costs and expenses is false, deceptive, or misleading. Jackson could avoid costs altogether by proceeding pro se or with the aid of pro bono counsel and by utilizing any number of free legal resources to eliminate court costs. If Jackson retains pro bono counsel to represent her, however, she could avoid attendance in court, thus eliminating any travel expenses. The same is true if the parties agreed to a pre-trial settlement. Jackson, therefore, plausibly alleges that the Letter's statement regarding additional costs and expenses is false, deceptive, or misleading under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Letter's statement implying that Jackson will incur costs and expenses is also material to the least sophisticated consumer. The\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   Court found that, while the unsophisticated consumer would understand that legal action was not certain, the letter insinuated the debtor would inevitably be liable for a string of sundry fees should suit be filed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    81 F.Supp.2d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that language like this asserting false leverage is what Congress enacted the FDCPA to combat.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even if read in the context of the whole Letter, the statement that \"[s]uch [legal] action\n   <em>\n    will require\n   </em>\n   additional cost and expense to you,\" (Compl. \u00b6 42; Letter at 1) (emphasis added), is material. Though the Letter instructs Jackson to dispute the debt within thirty days, it states within the same paragraph that any such dispute \"will not prevent [Defendants] from filing the lawsuit within that time.\" (Letter at 1). Read together, those statements would likely lead the least sophisticated consumer to understand that legal action was\n   unavoidable and would require \"additional cost and expense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n    81 F.Supp.2d at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Jackson plausibly alleges the statement about additional cost and expense is false, deceptive, or misleading and that it is material in violation of the FDCPA. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Appearance at Trial (Count III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants assert that Jackson's allegations regarding the cost and expenses statement and the appearance at trial statement are contradictory. Specifically, Defendants argue that it would be impossible to incur no additional costs while at the same time avoiding an appearance in court. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the Letter states \"[s]uch [legal] action\n   <em>\n    will require\n   </em>\n   ... the inconvenience of appearing at the trial of the case.\" (Compl. \u00b6 42) (emphasis added). Jackson's appearance at trial would only be mandatory by subpoena, and as noted above, Jackson could either settle the case or hire pro bono counsel to represent her to avoid physical attendance at trial. Pursuing either settlement or pro bono representation could still allow Jackson to avoid additional cost and expense, as discussed above. Jackson, therefore, plausibly alleges that the Letter's language requiring appearance at trial is false, deceptive, and misleading under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants also contend that this statement is immaterial because no suit had been filed at the time of the Letter. The Court again disagrees. The false statement mandating Jackson's attendance at trial is also material. Defendants correctly argue that appearing at trial would be inconvenient for Jackson, but the \"will require\" language of the Letter applies to the entire phrase \"of appearing at the trial of the case,\" not just to the word, \"inconvenience.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483666\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/81/582/#p590\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The fact that no suit was filed at the time of the Letter is irrelevant to the least sophisticated consumer's decision-making process. Such language signifies to the least sophisticated consumer to pay the amount demanded before suit or be forced to appear in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that Jackson plausibly alleges an FDCPA violation related to the statement regarding attendance at trial. Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendants' Motion as to Count III of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
