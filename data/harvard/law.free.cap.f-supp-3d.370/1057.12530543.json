But state-wide materials provide the general content standards upon which the individual school districts rely. Two such state-wide materials are at issue in this case: the Standards and the Framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The California legislature required the State Board of Education (SBE) to adopt model content standards in major subject areas, including history and social science.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n    Cal. Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 60602.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 60605, 60618. These Standards outline the topics and content that California public school students need to acquire at each grade level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standards at 0004. The SBE created the Standards in 1998,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Standards at 0002, and they have not changed since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standards Adoption Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Notably, Plaintiffs did not include in their complaint any allegations about the standards adoption process, nor do they list the standards adoption process as a basis for their Establishment Clause claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-42 (factual allegations about Standards, addressing only their content);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 144-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Establishment Clause claim based on content of Standards, process of adopting Framework, and content of Framework). This is presumably because a claim based on the 1998 standards adoption process would be time-barred. However, Plaintiffs do refer to the \"[d]isfavored treatment of Hinduism in the development of the Standards\" in their summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 3. They assert that, in drafting the Standards, \"[n]o apparent effort was made to obtain input from a person affiliated with a Hindu organization,\" unlike persons from other religious organizations, and that an Islamic group alerted the Standards Commission to language about religion \"developing,\" yet the Commission did not apply that advice to Hinduism.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the first point, Plaintiffs rely on an unsworn article about the standards adoption process, by someone without apparent personal knowledge of the facts, which they submit for the truth of the matter, and which is therefore inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Katon Decl.

On the second point, Plaintiffs rely on a selection of documents a CAPEEM board member copied from the California State Archives, representing some proposed edits to the 1998 standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2060602.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Kumar Decl.

Moreover, it seems an uncontroversial proposition that these represent some fraction of the feedback the Commission received about the Standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs make clear in their reply brief that the standards adoption process is still\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a standalone basis for their claim.

Secular Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   One of Plaintiffs' chief complaints is that the Standards and Framework treat other religions as having divine origins, but discuss only the Hindu religion from a secular perspective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 16-17 (Framework \"strips the Hindu belief system of any divine origins-it depicts the religion simply as a social construct.\"). The Court addressed a related argument at the motion to dismiss phase. Then, Plaintiffs argued that the Standards and Framework teach other religions as if they are historically accurate, and therefore endorse those religions to the exclusion of Hinduism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 42, 108; Opp'n to MTD (dkt. 100) at 20. The Court disagreed, holding that \"the text does not support\" that assertion, MTD at 10, and that \"[t]he curriculum teaches the development of Judaism, not the historical accuracy of biblical stories,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. So too with Christianity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court concluded that\n   Defendants' purpose in enacting the challenged curriculum was \"teaching the history of ancient civilizations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As evidence of Hinduism's unfairly secular treatment, Plaintiffs point to language in the Framework about Hinduism evolving or developing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 13-14 (discussing lesson that Brahmanism\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   evolved into early Hinduism); P. Opp'n to D. MSJ at 2-3 (objecting to the word \"developed\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Standards and Framework also acknowledge the role of humans in the development of other religions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Standards at 31 (\"Discuss how Judaism survived and developed\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (\"Trace the development of distinctive forms of Japanese Buddhism\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (\"List the causes for the internal turmoil in and weakening of the Catholic church\"); Framework at 236 (\"Judaism was heavily influenced by the environment, the history of the Israelites, and their interactions with other societies.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 271 (\"As it became a state religion, Christianity changed.... The teacher points out that all religions change over time.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 274-75 (\"How did the religion of Christianity develop and change over time?\"). Such language is consistent with the curriculum's secular purpose of teaching human history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs likewise contend that the Standards and Framework fail to focus on Hindus' belief in their religion's divine origins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 14-15. But the Framework does talk about the divine in Hinduism, even if it does not preface that discussion as Plaintiffs would prefer, by saying \"According to Hindu tradition, ______.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 17-18. The Framework states that \"Ancient Hindu sages\" revealed the concept \"of Brahman as the divine principle of being,\" and as an \"all-pervading divine supreme reality\" that \"may be manifested in many ways, including incarnation in the form of Deities.\" Framework at 244. In continues: \"These Deities are worshipped as distinct personal Gods or Goddesses, such as Vishnu who preserves the world, Shiva who transforms it, and Sarasvati, the Goddess of learning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It then describes how \"[t]hese teachings were transmitted orally at first, and then later in written texts, the\n   <em>\n    Upanishads\n   </em>\n   and later, the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs complain that Defendants treat the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   as mere secular literature, pointing to a line in the Standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 14 (asserting that \"sacred Hindu scripture, the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   , is not described as what Hindus believe to be the word of God, but as 'important aesthetic and intellectual traditions' and 'literature.' \") (citing Standards at 32 (\"Discuss important aesthetic and intellectual traditions (e.g., Sanskrit literature, including the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   ; medicine; metallurgy; and mathematics, including Hindu-Arabic numerals and the zero).\") ). Presumably the Standards do not explain the divine significance of the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   because there are but seven bullet points covering all of ancient India.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standards at 32. The Standards are to be read in conjunction with the Framework,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Standards at 0006, and the Framework provides a bit more context about the role the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   played,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Framework at 244 (\"These teachings were transmitted orally at first, and then later in written texts, the\n   <em>\n    Upanishads\n   </em>\n   and, later, the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita.\n   </em>\n   \"). However, it is unsurprising that the Framework treats the\n   <em>\n    Bhagavad Gita\n   </em>\n   in a secular way in the context of a history curriculum-it does the same with other religions' sacred texts, listing it along with the Torah, Hebrew Bible, Qur'an, and Christian Bible as \"classical texts\" to study when one is focused on \"the human experience and [exploring] the various ways in which human beings affect and express their relationship to their physical, intellectual, social, and political environments.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Framework at 385. In addition, though Plaintiffs object to the Framework's treatment of another sacred book, the\n   <em>\n    Ramayana\n   </em>\n   , as a \"story,\" P. MSJ at 18, the Framework states that that book, \"the story of Rama, an incarnation or avatar of Vishnu,\" is a \"text that Hindus rely on for solutions to moral dilemmas\" and \"one of ancient India's most important literary and religious texts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Framework at 246. It does not use the word \"story\" in a dismissive sense, but calls the book \"important.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Caste System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Another of Plaintiffs' primary complaints about the Standards and Framework is their over-emphasis on the caste system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 16 (\"the Framework's enormous focus on caste within its coverage of Hinduism is itself contemptuous and unlike the treatment of any other faith.\"). The Standards include, under the heading \"Students analyze the geographic, political, economic, religious, and social structures of the early civilizations of India,\" the bullet point \"Outline the social structure of the caste system,\" Standards at 32, and the Framework expressly connects the caste system to Hinduism, stating, \"Teachers should make clear to students that [the caste system] was a social and cultural structure as well as a religious belief,\" Framework at 246. Plaintiffs do not maintain that it is historically inaccurate to link the caste system to Hinduism; rather, they argue that the curriculum's spotlight on caste gives students an unfairly negative view of Hinduism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 82 (\"Many would argue that caste was not and is not a Hindu belief. But irrespective of the accuracy of the language, it is certainly derogatory and inconsistent with ... the treatment of other religions in the Framework.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P. Reply at 7 (\"highly debatable\" whether \"caste is a Hindu religious belief\"). Plaintiffs also contend that the Framework \"fails to note that the caste system has existed in India among Sikhs, Christians, Muslims and Buddhists, but not among Hindus of Indonesia and Fiji.\" P. MSJ at 18 (citing what appears to be an inadmissible article about the caste system).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While it is true that the Framework does not contain the mitigating language Plaintiffs seek, it contains other mitigating language, which makes clear that the caste system existed in a historical context and was not unique to ancient India.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Framework at 245 (\"As in all early civilizations, Indian society witnessed the development of a system of social classes.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"This system, often termed caste, provided social stability and gave an identity to each community.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Over the centuries, the Indian social structure became more rigid, though perhaps not more inflexible than the class divisions in other ancient civilizations.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 246 (\"Today many Hindus, in India and in the United States, do not identify themselves as belonging to a caste.\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"As in Mesopotamia and Egypt, priests, rulers, and other elites used religion to justify the social hierarchy.\"). This language goes a long way to contextualize and soften the subject of caste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs point next to a textbook entitled\n   <em>\n    Discovery Education, Discovery Education Social Science Techbook, Grades Six Through Eight\n   </em>\n   , which Plaintiffs assert includes an exercise for role playing the caste system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. Opp'n to D. MSJ at 3-4 (citing Kumar Decl. (dkt. 215-1) at PLS00184-87). Plaintiffs add that the book includes a lesson objective directing teachers to \"Connect the beliefs of Hinduism to the\n   caste system and other elements of ancient Indian life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (citing Kumar Decl. (dkt. 215-1) at PLS00201). This evidence is misleading. First,\n   <em>\n    Discovery Education\n   </em>\n   appears to have been adopted as part of the November 2017 instructional materials adoption,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Admin. Mot. (dkt. 196) Ex. 5 (\"2017 History-Social Science Adoption Report\")-a process that Plaintiffs do not challenge in their complaint, and which involves a different regulatory process than those pertaining to framework adoption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Reply at 11 (citing 5 C.C.R. \u00a7\u00a7 9511 - 9526 ). While the book is slightly relevant in that it demonstrates a local district's interpretation of the Standards and Framework, it is not Defendants' creation. More importantly, the role playing exercise is aimed at teachers, not students, and\n   <em>\n    it does not mention Hinduism\n   </em>\n   or even the caste system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kumar Decl. at PLS00186-87 (\"Announce to the class that society in ancient India gave different people different levels of opportunity, much like this activity.\"; \"Next, post the Essential Question: What effects did power and social class have on the lives of the ancient Indian people?\"; \"Encourage them to think about the impact that money and power may have had on their social standing, or position, within Indian society.\"). The \"Lesson Overview\" that Plaintiffs tout as linking \"the beliefs of Hinduism to the caste system and other elements of ancient Indian life\" actually relates to another lesson (lesson 6.3), not the lesson containing the role playing exercise (lesson 6.2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PLS00201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, even if the book was a part of this case and even if it explicitly directed students to participate in a caste system role playing exercise, that is not the kind of role playing that the Framework itself forbids and that courts view with great suspicion. It does not involve the role playing of a devotional act, like taking communion, but rather of a historical social system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Framework Appendix F at 867 (\"Classroom methodologies must not include religious role-playing activities or simulations of rituals or devotional acts.\");\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535045\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/1373/#p1378\">\n    27 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"active participation in 'ritual' poses a greater risk of violating the Establishment Clause than does merely reading, discussing or thinking about religious texts\");\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   n.6 (\"a reenactment of the Last Supper or a Passover dinner might be permissible if presented for historical or cultural purposes.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, on the subject of role-playing, this Court's order at the motion to dismiss phase discussed an allegation in the Complaint that the \"Commission was made acutely aware of the pain and humiliation the curriculum's portrayal of Hinduism inflicts on Hindu students,\" through the letter of a sixth grade student about a caste role-playing exercise in her classroom two years earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order re MTD at 15-16; Compl. \u00b6 85.

Aryan Invasion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also object to the Standards and Framework's treatment of the\n   Aryan Invasion Theory, which Plaintiffs claim, citing the expert report that the Court has rejected herein, is a \"long-ago debunked, Orientalist theory\" that \"present-day India and Pakistan were invaded, in approximately 1500 BCE, by the 'Aryans,' a tribe of European origin, and that the Aryans ... became the creators of Hindu civilization.\" P. MSJ at 15 (citing Joshi Report at 4). The Standards do state \"Discuss the significance of the Aryan invasions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Standards at 32, but they must be read together with the Framework,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2060000\">\n    Cal.

Treatment of Women\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs also object to the Framework's description of Hinduism as contributing to the unequal status of women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 19-20. They assert that it deliberately treats Hinduism \"as a contributor to patriarchy while not making the same acknowledgment for other religions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Not so. The Framework reflects that patriarchy was not unique to ancient India or Hinduism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The relevant language in the Framework is about ancient India, not Hinduism. It states, \"Although ancient India was a patriarchy, women had a right to their personal wealth, especially jewelry, gold, and silvery, but little property rights when compared to men, akin to other ancient kingdoms and societies.\" Framework at 246. It continues, \"They participated in religious ceremonies and festival celebrations, though not as equals. Hinduism is the only major religion in which God is worshipped in female as well as male form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   About Judaism, the Framework states: \"Judaism, in its ancient form, was largely a patriarchy. It was rare for women to own property, but Jewish law offered women some important rights and protections.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 236. About Christianity, it provides: \"Although ancient Christianity was a patriarchy and all the apostles were men, several women were prominent, especially Mary, mother of Jesus. Until modern times, Christian women had few property rights and were subordinate to men.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 240 (about ancient Athens: \"women, foreigners, and slaves were excluded from all political participation.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 231 (\"Mesopotamia was a patriarchy and men had more power than women.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs' contrary reading of the Framework is misleading.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 19 (\"For Christianity, the Framework even provides that 'male clergy, both Catholic and Protestant,' generally agreed that 'men and women are equal in the sight of God.' \")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Framework at 313 (\"In a few radical Protestant sects, women sometimes became leaders in church organizations and propagation. However, male clergy, both Catholic and Protestant, generally agreed that even though men and women are equal in the sight of God, women should bow to the will of their fathers and husbands in religious and intellectual matters.\"). While the Framework does not include Plaintiffs' desired \"interpretations of the Bible that would give women a status inferior to men,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 19, it certainly blames Christian leaders for some historical gender inequality,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Framework at 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Additional Negative and Positive Treatment of Religion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Beyond the language already discussed herein, the Framework frequently acknowledges negative aspects of other religions' histories. For example, the Framework states that Muslim leaders conquered new land and forced some non-Muslims to convert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278. It mentions that \"Christians and Muslims enslaved captives who did not belong to their own religions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 310. It notes \"extensive\" criticism of the Catholic Church over the selling of indulgences and corruption by the clergy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312. In explains that \"Protestantism added more fuel to the already growing religious persecution in Spain, which had expelled the Jews in 1492. Between 1500 and 1614, Spain expelled all Muslims and persecuted converts and dissenters in the Spanish Inquisition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It notes that Galileo Galilei \"was charged with heresy by the Catholic Church for his public support of Copernicus' theory that the earth revolved around the sun\" and \"spent his final days under house arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 316.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Framework also uses positive language about Hinduism and ancient India. It describes the Harappan civilization (about 2600 to 1900 BCE) as \"well planned\" and \"[a] flourishing urban civilization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243. It describes the Vedic period as \"build[ing] up a rich body of spiritual and moral teachings that form a key foundation of Hinduism as it is practiced today.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 244. It describes \"the central practices of Hinduism today\" as including \"above all, a profound acceptance of religious diversity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245. And it ends by discussing the\n   <em>\n    Ramayana\n   </em>\n   as an \"epic work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 246. It contains positive language about the Gupta Dynasty (280 to 550 CE), as \"a rich period of religious, socioeconomic, educational, literary, and scientific development,\" and discusses the \"[e]nduring contributions from the cultures of which is now modern India and other parts of South Asia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283. It addresses the Chola Empire, which was \"associated with significant artistic achievement,\" and states that \"Hinduism continued to evolve with the Bhakti movement,\" which \"emphasized\" \"social and religious equality and a personal expression of devotion to God.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 284.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The SAFG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs vociferously object to the role of the SAFG, the group of academics that they claim Tom Adams secretly recruited to provide anti-Hindu input on the Framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 9-11 (\"... presented the feedback to the public without acknowledging that Adams handpicked the professors ... to obtain the viewpoint he sought.\"); P. Opp'n to D. MSJ at 5-6 (same); P.

As one example of this, Plaintiffs highlight a single line in an email from an SAFG member, stating \"readers of our report can imagine that it is meant to undermine the legitimacy of Hinduism as a religion (and Hinduism uniquely among religions, at that.).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. Opp'n to D. MSJ at 14 (quoting Katon Decl. Ex. D at KEN00047). A review of the complete document reveals that the author of that line was objecting to mention of an academic debate that the author felt was too complicated and subject to misinterpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Katon Decl. at KEN00047. The author continued, \"Our critics should not be able to say that we show animus against Hinduism, or against religion generally and so dismiss our suggestions as partisan.

Far from revealing that the author/group intended to surreptitiously insert into the curriculum either false or anti-Hindu materials, the email shows that the author/group's stated intention was to make the Framework more accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Equally important, the SAFG made their positions known via public comment, which Defendants made available for public review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McDonald Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11. Although Plaintiffs object to the CDE's failure to disclose Adams's role, they do acknowledge CDE's open use of the SAFG recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. MSJ at 10 (\"Although Adams' recruitment of the handpicked SAFG was never made public, McTygue, who led the drafting of the Framework, did state publicly for the first time at the final History-Social Science Subcommittee meeting in March 24, 2016 that the subcommittee had been receiving\n   reports from the SAFG.\"). Moreover, the CDE rejected a number of the SAFG's recommendations. Of the six examples the Complaint identifies of the SAFG's allegedly anti-Hindu recommendations, the Court has already noted that \"[t]he SBE actually rejected four.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order re MTD at 19 (dismissing Equal Protection claim based on Framework Adoption process).

It now rejects Plaintiffs' strained argument that a reasonable observer would recognize that Defendants' handling of edits selectively violated California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.
