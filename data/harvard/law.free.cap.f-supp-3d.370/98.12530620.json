COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 19, 2017, the last day of the administration of former President Barack Obama, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued the final Organic Livestock and Poultry Practices Rule (Final OLPP Rule), which made more stringent the regulations that govern the certification of livestock as \"organic\" by USDA. On January 20, 2017, the first day of the administration of President Donald Trump, the White House directed executive agencies to delay implementation of all pending regulations that had not yet become effective, which included the Final OLPP Rule. USDA thereafter issued \"Delay Rules\" in February, May, and November 2017, each further delaying the effective date of the Final OLPP Rule. Eventually, on March 13, 2018, USDA formally withdrew the Final OLPP Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Organic Trade Association (OTA) challenged the delays to the effective date of the Final OLPP Rule in September 2017, while the November Delay Rule was open for public comment and not yet finalized. Between then and now, the Complaint has twice been amended and now also includes a challenge to the withdrawal of the rule. The government moves to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   OTA opposes.

OTA claims standing for itself and on behalf of its members, several of whom provided declarations in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to OTA's associational standing claims, the government argues only that the identified members have not themselves suffered a concrete and particularized injury due to the OLPP Withdrawal Rule. OTA counters with several points. It begins with the argument that its members have \"competitor standing\" because they will face increased competition in the marketplace as a result of the OLPP Withdrawal Rule. The D.C. Circuit has \"repeatedly ... held that parties suffer constitutional injury in fact when agencies lift regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow increased competition.\"\n   <em>\n    La.

Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   OTA's members state that they suffer competitive harm because they must continue to compete against other organic operators which \"achieve lower production costs by ignoring the consensus organic ... space requirements, while remaining certified.\" SAC, Ex. 15, Decl. of Gina Asoudegan (Asoudegan Decl.) [Dkt. 34-15] \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. 8, Decl. of John Lee (Lee Decl.) [Dkt. 34-12] \u00b6 10. By clarifying and ultimately making more stringent the requirements for organic certification, the Final OLPP Rule would have brought the practices, and thus costs, of other operators who want to participate in the \"organic\" market in line with those of OTA's members. Asoudegan Decl. \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RIA at 3 (finding organic egg and broiler producers \"will face additional production costs as a result of this rule\"). In contrast, the OLPP Withdrawal Rule allows operators to remain in the organic market while using cheaper practices, keeping prices down and generally competing for \"organic\" sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   USDA responds that the OLPP Withdrawal Rule \"neither enlarged the pool of livestock producers eligible to compete in the organic livestock market nor created any competitive asymmetries; it has merely withdrawn regulatory requirements in a manner that affects all market participants equally.\" Reply at 12. This effect, the government argues, cannot support standing because the competitor standing doctrine applies only \"to an agency action that itself imposes a competitive injury,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that provides benefits to an existing competitor or expands the number of entrants in the petitioner's market.\"\n   <em>\n    New World Radio, Inc. v.

Cir. 2002). But the OLPP Withdrawal Rule itself has such an effect. That is, under the Final OLPP Rule, USDA would have required all operators who wanted to compete in the certified organic market to satisfy new living space requirements for their livestock by the implementation dates in the Final OLPP Rule. Thus, the choices for operators lacking such space now were to either (a) conform to the new requirements, despite the resulting costs (that are already being expended by OTA's members), or (b) exit the organic market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By removing the new living space requirements for livestock, the OLPP Withdrawal Rule no longer forces this choice. This result undoubtedly provides benefits to existing operators who, unlike OTA's members, are not already compliant with the requirements of the Final OLPP Rule by allowing them to continue to receive USDA certification and compete in the organic market without facing additional costs. Put another way, it prevents a shrinkage of the pool of producers eligible to compete in the organic livestock market, to the detriment of OTA's members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The government next argues that OTA's competition claim requires \"impermissible speculation about the future market choices of third parties.\" MTD at 28. For example, the government argues that no market exit by competitors is certain. Further, even if competitors exit, consumers may not switch to more expensive organic eggs, even as cheaper eggs lose the organic seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the D.C. Circuit has explained, although there are \"various formulations of the standard for determining whether a plaintiff asserting competitor standing has been injured[,] ... the basic requirement is that the complainant show an actual or imminent increase in competition, which increase we recognize will almost certainly\n   cause an injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherley v.

Here, no one need speculate about an increase in competition due to the OLPP Withdrawal Rule; organic operators already compete on the axis of livestock welfare standards, which would not have continued had the new standards gone into effect. Even if those operators who do not currently satisfy the Final OLPP Rule standards had come into compliance with it and so continued to compete as \"organic\" operators-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , even if the\n   <em>\n    number\n   </em>\n   of competitors stayed the same-no competitor in the organic market could have continued to compete by lowering their livestock welfare standards-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of competition would certainly have been more limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, the Final OLPP Rule would have required an existing type of competitor to drop out of the market, which type produced organic eggs at lower costs, keeping prices down.

This argument mischaracterizes the regulatory backdrop for the OLPP Withdrawal Rule, which takes as its baseline that the Final OLPP Rule remained in effect and so saved OTA's members the cost of private-sector certification. Accordingly, the OLPP Withdrawal Rule drops the baseline for USDA certification and alters the regulatory landscape to the detriment of OTA's members. Just as OTA's members would have had standing to challenge any rollbacks of USDA's organic certification program before the Final OLPP Rule, so too they have standing now to challenge rollbacks of the USDA's certification program as constituted after the Final OLPP Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court recognizes that, given that several requirements of the Final OLPP Rule would have become effective on a rolling basis, including the broiler space requirements beginning in 2020, there is a question as to whether or not OTA's alleged injury is \"imminent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court has instructed, \"[a]lthough imminence is concededly a somewhat elastic concept,\" its ultimate purpose \"is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes-that the injury is\n   <em>\n    certainly\n   </em>\n   impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   564 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal marks omitted) (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]e have insisted that the injury proceed with a high degree of immediacy, so as to reduce the possibility of deciding a case in which no injury would have occurred at all.\").

Conversely, if OTA successfully challenges the OLPP Withdrawal Rule, there would still be no effective remedy vis-\u00e0-vis the November Delay Rule (or any earlier Delay Rule) as it is now well past May 14, 2018, and all the Delay Rules have expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Normally, a claim would be moot under these circumstances.

While the government largely concedes that the Delay Rules were too short in duration to litigate while extant, it contests OTA's assertion that its claim will recur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   OTA identifies four legal wrongs which may recur. First, it argues that rules effecting short-term delays-as a general matter, not specific to the Final OLPP Rule-are by their nature of short duration and thus evade review. While accurate, the Final OLPP Rule cannot be delayed again because it has been withdrawn. OTA's responds \"that no 'precedent requires that the very same facts must recur for the capable of repetition exception to apply.' \" Opp'n at 32 (citing\n   <em>\n    Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v.

OTA argues that this failure to consult violated the OFPA and APA, and that OTA has a legitimate basis to fear that USDA will violate the OFPA and APA in future rulemaking. For present purposes, OTA's argument is overly speculative; USDA could consult with the Board in the future as Congress intended. More importantly, USDA's statement about consultation with the Board also appeared in the OLPP Withdrawal Rule. OLPP Withdrawal Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010%2C775\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 10,778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It can thus be reviewed as part of that rulemaking without evading review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fourth, OTA argues that USDA improperly relied on the Trump Moratorium to justify the February Delay Rule and that the Court should issue a \"clarifying ruling\" that any such delays require notice and comment rulemaking beyond presidential proclamation. Opp'n at 35. The concept of regulatory moratoria is relatively recent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kathryn A. Watts, Regulatory Moratoria,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Duke%20L.J.%201883\">\n    61 Duke L.J. 1883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1889-93 (2012) (cataloging the practice since the first administration of former President Ronald Reagan). These moratoria have only been used by incoming presidents six (6) times in the last thirty-seven (37) years, generally \"as tools for presidents to control the phenomenon of midnight rulemaking by the prior administration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Duke%20L.J.%201883\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1892 and n.34. Not all moratoria have been the same. As relevant to this case, only moratoria issued by the administrations of former President Reagan, former President George W. Bush, and the current President directed agencies to delay the effective dates of published rules that had not yet become effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C227\">\n    46 Fed.

Reg. 4435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 26, 2009). The moratoria issued by former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W.

More importantly, the legal issue is how the executive agencies respond to a presidential moratorium in light of the APA. At present, it is overly speculative to predict how executive agencies might respond to a hypothetical future moratorium, since it is unclear if (1) a new administration will take office in 2021; (2) a new administration, much less a new administration of the same party, would issue a regulatory moratorium; (3) that moratorium would apply to already published rules; and (4) any such rule would affect OTA or its members. OTA has not shown a reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability that each of the above will come to pass; there is insufficient evidence in the record to justify an exception to the mootness doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court concludes that OTA's complaint against the Delay Rules is moot and no longer presents an Article III case or controversy. The likelihood of repetition is too speculative to render it a current controversy. Count I in the Second Amended Complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    2. Challenging the Withdrawal Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Count II of OTA's Second Amended Complaint alleges that the OLPP Withdrawal Rule is arbitrary and capricious\n   because it lacks sufficient reason or explanation for reversing course. The government wisely does not argue that OTA has failed to allege a legally sufficient claim against the OLPP Withdrawal Rule. Count II will move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    3. Failure to Consult the NOSB\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Count III of the Second Amended Complaint alleges that USDA violated the OFPA by failing to consult with the National Organic Standards Board when it considered and finalized the OLPP Withdrawal Rule. Following congressional direction in \u00a7 6518 of the OFPA, the Secretary established the Board \"to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary on any other aspects of the implementation of this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206518\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

OTA argues that these collective provisions impose a statutory requirement\n   <em>\n    under the OFPA\n   </em>\n   , and distinct from the APA, that USDA consult with the National Organic Standards Board when promulgating or withdrawing organic livestock regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Where Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute and different language in another, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Indep.

The OFPA describes USDA's consultation obligations with varying degrees of specificity. For example, \u00a7 6517 explicitly states that the \"National List established by the Secretary shall be based upon a proposed national list ... developed by the National Organic Standards Board\" and that the \"Secretary may not include exemptions ... other than those exemptions contained in [the Board's proposed national list].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and (2). That same section essentially gives the National Organic Standards Board veto power over the validity of exemptions and prohibitions on the National List.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6517(e). Similarly, \u00a7 6506(c), which specifically addresses wild seafood, states that USDA \"shall ... consult with\" the Board when promulgating regulations specifically related to certifying wild seafood as organic.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6506(c)(2). By contrast, although \u00a7 6509(d), under \"[a]nimal production practices and materials,\" states that the Board \"shall recommend\" livestock standards to USDA, \u00a7 6509(g) furthers states that USDA \"shall develop detailed regulations\" for livestock with notice and public comment but without requiring USDA to consult with the Board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6509(d)(2) and (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The language in \u00a7\u00a7 6517 and 6506 shows that Congress clearly knew how to compel consultation and involve the Board more closely in the promulgation of regulations. That said, \u00a7 6509 does not give the Board the same degree of input into livestock standards as it does for National List exemptions and prohibitions under \u00a7 6517. It does not even go as far as \u00a7 6506(c), on wild seafood, which specifically requires USDA to consult with the Board, instead of requiring the Board to make recommendations to USDA. Thus, the Court cannot find a blanket requirement for USDA to consult with the Board on livestock regulations because it would make those more\n   specific statutory provisions superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis Cnty.

It may be that specific requirements to consult ensure that rules affecting those specific issues, no matter how small, are always run past the Board. It may also be that the specific requirements to consult are not surplusage because not all small acts of rulemaking affecting the certification program require prior input from the Board. But it is also clear from the Senate Report that Congress intended the National Organic Standards Board to play a key role in developing the organic certification program. To restate the language: \"The Committee regards this Board as an essential advisor to the Secretary on all issues concerning [the OFPA] and anticipates that many of the key decisions concerning standards will result from recommendations by this Board.\" Senate Report at 296;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 297 (\"The Board is generally responsible for advising the Secretary on all aspects of the implementation of [the OFPA].\"). Additionally, \u00a7 6503\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the Secretary to consult with the Board when developing the organic certification program. The Final OLPP Rule was the largest and most important organic rule promulgated since the 2010 Access to Pasture Rule and USDA consulted over its development with the Board. As such, notwithstanding the uncertain consultation requirement for small rulemaking, \u00a7 6503 may have required USDA to consult on a timely basis with the National Organic Standards Board before finalizing the OLPP Withdrawal Rule, which is similarly large and important.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court will not decide this issue on the current briefing.
