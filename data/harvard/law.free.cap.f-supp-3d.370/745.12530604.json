R. EVID. 501. But what law governs potential exceptions to and waivers of the privilege is less clear. Federal law can govern waiver in a diversity case, \"even if state law provides the rule of decision.\" FED. R. EVID. 502(f) ;\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Med.

That move also spurred litigation, in which this case's Defendants jointly represented Pinnacle, Loehnert and Ayres. (DN 80-1, PageID # 780; DN 84, PageID # 1078.) Pinnacle argues that it should be allowed to access all of the Defendants' communications with Loehnert and Ayres from the period of joint representation.

Pinnacle argues that the representation continued until June 4, 2014, \"when the last settlement payment was made.\" (DN 80-1, PageID # 798-800.) In their motion to dismiss, the Defendants have conceded that the joint representation lasted at least until June 10, 2013, when \"the lawsuit with Wells Fargo was settled and dismissed.\" (DN 57-2, PageID # 492, 500.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The record in insufficient for the Court to determine precisely when the joint representation ended. But by the Defendants' conceded date of termination, Pinnacle may access all the Defendants' communications with Loehnert and Ayres made between the onset of the joint representation and June 10, 2013 which discuss matters of\n   common interest to this case's parties-whether they were made via Pinnacle's communication systems or any other platform. Such matters include, but are not limited to, Loehnert's and Ayres's relationships with Pinnacle. If any such communications are responsive to Pinnacle's discovery requests but are not yet in Pinnacle's possession, the Defendants must produce them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is undisputed that Loehnert and Ayres used Pinnacle's systems while employed there to communicate with the Defendants. (DN 80-1, PageID # 792; DN 84, PageID # 1085.) Pinnacle argues that they \"waived any purported privilege\" by doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DN 80-1, PageID # 792.)

However, elsewhere, the drafters of Kentucky's rules have stated that \"a person who legally obtains possession through ... inadvertent disclosure will not be barred from testifying to the contents.\" Evidence Rules Study Comm., Ky. R. Evid. 52-53 (Final Draft 1989). Accordingly, Pinnacle may access all of the Defendants' communications with Loehnert and Ayres which Pinnacle lawfully possesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Employees' Possible Waiver by Use of the Employer's Communication Systems\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Most courts, including Kentucky's, have not articulated a rule for this exact situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has, and both sides have asked this Court to apply its reasoning. (DN 80-1, PageID # 792; DN 84, PageID # 1083.) That court considered \"the analogous question of the employee's expectation of privacy in his office computer and the company e-mail system.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Asia Global Crossing Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013897\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/322/247/#p256\">\n    322 B.R. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   An employee's expectation of privacy in his office, desk and files may be reduced by virtue of actual office practices and procedures, or by legitimate regulation. In light of the variety of work environments, whether the employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ... In general, a court should consider four factors: (1) does the corporation maintain a policy banning personal or other objectionable use, (2) does the company monitor the use of the employee's computer or e-mail, (3) do third parties have a right of access to the computer or e-mails, and (4) did the corporation notify the employee, or was the employee aware, of the use and monitoring policies?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013897\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/322/247/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013897\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/322/247/#p256\">\n    at 256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pinnacle has not established that any third parties had actual access to Loehnert's or Ayres's company emails. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DN 80-4, PageID # 892.) However, the other three factors indicate that Loehnert and Ayres had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications they made via Pinnacle's systems. First, Pinnacle clearly prohibited personal use of its systems. Its Employee Handbook stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The communication systems are owned and operated by the Company and are to be used for the business of the Company. Employees should have no expectation of privacy of any correspondence, messages or information in the systems, regardless of the content or purpose of the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Personal use of the internet, including the sending and receiving of personal e-mails is prohibited while at work, except during the meal and break periods ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (DN 80-4, PageID # 923-24.) Second, Pinnacle clearly monitored its employees' uses of its systems. The Handbook also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Company reviews, monitors and accesses all electronic content, keystrokes and messages sent or received for any purpose, regardless of whether messages are transmitted/received via the Company's e-mail system or the employee's personal e-mail account(s). All such messages, regardless of content or the intent of the sender, are a form of corporate correspondence, and are subject to the same internal and external regulation, security and scrutiny as any other corporate correspondence.... E-mail communications are official internal Company communications, which may be subject to summons in legal proceedings....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ... The Company ... reserves the right to access, and will access an employee's messages and other electronic data at any time, without notice to the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (DN 80-4, PageID # 923-24.) Third, both Loehnert and Ayres were aware of these use and monitoring policies. The Defendants have argued extensively that the Handbook did not apply to Loehnert and Ayres because they were not \"California employees,\" were not at-will employees, and did not form any agreement permitting Pinnacle to access their emails. (DN 84, PageID # 1081, 1085; DN 92, PageID # 1180-81.) These arguments would be more persuasive if the issue was whether Pinnacle, Loehnert and Ayres formed a\n   <em>\n    contract\n   </em>\n   regarding access to communications. But it is enough that Pinnacle notified them of its policies and that they were aware of the same. Loehnert and Ayres both received copies of Pinnacle's policies,\n   and at least Ayres signed his Handbook's acknowledgment pages. (DN 84-1, PageID # 1166; DN 84-3, PageID # 1142-43.) Even if they believed that the \"California\" policies regarding use did not apply in the new Kentucky office-a belief which would prompt one to wonder why he has received a copy of them in the first place-they were aware that Pinnacle had the ability to monitor their use of its systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, Pinnacle may access all of the Defendants' communications with Loehnert and Ayres which were made via Pinnacle's systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Crime-Fraud Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pinnacle also argues that the Defendants' communications with Loehnert and Ayres are not privileged due to the crime-fraud exception. Kentucky's attorney-client privilege \"does not apply to future transactions when the person seeking the advice is contemplating the committing of a crime or the perpetration of a fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Steelvest, Inc. v.

The question is whether their communications with the Defendants contemplated any future breach of their corresponding fiduciary duties and therefore fall within Kentucky's crime-fraud exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Parties may ask courts to conduct\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review \"to determine whether allegedly privileged attorney-client communications fall within the crime-fraud exception.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pinnacle's whole-cloth request that the Court review\n   <em>\n    everything\n   </em>\n   in the Defendants' privilege logs for a \"variety of reasons\" (DN 93, PageID # 1320) is too generic. Second, this Order's other holdings could make\n   resolution of this issue unnecessary. Accordingly, the Court will not consider it further at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Submissions for\n    <em>\n     In Camera\n    </em>\n    Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Both sides have submitted select documents under seal for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, not in response to the opposite's request, but \"in accordance with\" their own briefs. (DNs 81, 85, and 94.) These unusual requests are moot. The Court is able to rule on the parties' cross-motions without reviewing the contents of the communications at issue.

(DN 80-9, PageID # 1056.) Likewise, the Defendants' motion requests \"an Order\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   excluding the introduction of all privileged communications between Loehnert, Ayres and their attorneys as evidence, as well as all argument and/or reference thereto by Pinnacle's counsel at trial.\" (DN 84, PageID # 1081-82.) These requests are premature. The motions are denied without prejudice to the extent that they seek any ruling on the admissibility of evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE DEFENDANTS' PRIVILEGE LOGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After a May 2018 telephonic status conference, the Court instructed the parties to produce privilege logs on or before May 31, 2018. (DN 78.) The Defendants have produced two privilege logs accordingly. (DNs 80-2 and 80-3.) In its motion to compel, Pinnacle also argues that the Defendants' privilege logs conceal documents which are not privileged. (DN 80-1, PageID # 803.)

The motion indicates that depositions have not been scheduled due to the attorney-client privilege dispute resolved by this Order. But under the current case schedule, the parties will still have approximately four months from the date of this Order to conduct fact discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DN 83.)

To receive a protective order, a party or person from whom discovery is sought must certify that he or she has, in good faith, conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve\n   <em>\n    the dispute\n   </em>\n   without court action. FED. R. CIV. P. 26(c)(1).

The parties have\n   <em>\n    agreed\n   </em>\n   to certain limitations on the use of materials produced in discovery. Their proposed order contains no certification of the type required by Rule 26(c)(1), nor could it under these circumstances.

(DN 93, PageID # 1304-05.) Ordinarily, the argument would be well-taken; this Court routinely requires parties to conduct a joint telephonic status conference with the Magistrate Judge before filing any motion pertaining to discovery. The Court certainly anticipated receiving a single motion to compel, not cross-motions on the issue of attorney-client privilege, when it issued its May 22, 2018 order (DN 78). However, the ordinary pre-motion conference requirement has not been docketed in this case. Under these circumstances, the Court will accept and consider the Defendants' motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In its response brief, Pinnacle presented a similar argument from Kentucky Rule of Evidence 503(d)(3).

That argument is meritless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    A dearth of on-point case law is no excuse for misrepresenting precedent to the Court. The Defendants have cited a Sixth Circuit opinion which hardly supports their stated proposition (DN 84, PageID # 1082), a Fifth Circuit opinion without disclosing that it is vacated (PageID # 1084), and a case from the Southern District of New York while purporting to present what \"Kentucky courts have held\" (DN 98, PageID # 1602).
