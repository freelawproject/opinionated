Elhady is a United States citizen and Muslim living in Wayne County. 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 8 (Dkt. 27). Defendants are officers or agents of CBP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Elhady alleges that he crossed through the Detroit-Windsor port of entry on April 10, 2015. 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 19. As he was crossing into Canada earlier that day, the Canadian inspection officer had stopped Elhady, questioned him, and asked him to provide the time he expected to cross back into the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Elhady told the Canadian officer that he would be returning to the United States around midnight, which he ultimately did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Elhady approached the primary inspection booth to return to the United States, he handed Defendant Pew his documents; Pew immediately demanded that Elhady place his hands on the steering wheel, called for backup, and referred him to secondary inspection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Defendants then surrounded Elhady's car, ordered him out of the vehicle, and handcuffed him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Defendants took Elhady's jacket and shoes, then confined him in isolation in a small, freezing-cold holding cell with excessively bright lights for at least four hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.

After several hours, he suffered from hypothermia and fell unconscious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.

Upon admission to the hospital, a nurse asked Elhady why his lips were blue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. After receiving treatment and medication, Elhady was transported back to the Ambassador Bridge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants raise several arguments. First, they argue that Elhady's claims are time-barred and that he is not entitled to equitable tolling. Next, they argue that Elhady has failed to state a due process claim. Finally, they argue that Elhady has not sufficiently pled a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim, both because he did not allege any action by any defendant that deprived him of a constitutional right and because the Court should not create a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action for conditions of confinement under the Fifth Amendment. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statute of Limitations and Equitable Tolling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Elhady does not contest that the statute of limitations expired before he filed his second amended complaint, which first listed the names of the individual Defendants. Thus, this claim is time-barred under Michigan's three-year statute of limitations unless Elhady is entitled to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8929625\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/322/#p331\">\n    422 F.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (6th Cir. 2005) (noting that the local statute of limitations applies to\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.5805\">\n    Mich.

Laws \u00a7 600.5805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (setting a three-year period of limitations for death or injury actions to recover damages).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has identified five factors to consider when determining whether equitable tolling is appropriate: \"(1) lack of actual notice ...; (2) lack of constructive knowledge ...; (3) diligence in pursuing one's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant; and (5) plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Kentucky State Police Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641802\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1086/#p1094\">\n    80 F.3d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094 (6th Cir. 1996). The first, second, and fifth elements are not relevant here, as Elhady acknowledges that he was aware of the necessary requirements to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Elhady cites a case that has many similarities to his own,\n   <em>\n    Olmstead v. Fentress Cty., TN\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204176256\">\n    2017 WL 4176256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 21, 2017). In that case, the plaintiff asked the court to allow early discovery immediately upon filing the complaint and before the statute of limitations had expired. Olmstead's claim accrued on July 20, 2015, and he filed the complaint on June 23, 2016 - just one month before the one-year statute of limitations expired. Even though the court did not address the request for early discovery until well after\n   the limitations period expired, the court allowed equitable tolling because it was \"not Olmstead's fault that the Court did not address his motion\" and because he was working to learn the names of the John Doe defendants during the Court's delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Similarly, Elhady filed his suit with some seven months to spare before the statute of limitations ran, and attempted to procure the names of the John Doe defendants even before filing a discovery motion with the Court. He served the United States Attorney on September 28, 2017, and the assigned Assistant United States Attorney did not refuse service until November 21, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   11/21/2017 Letter, Ex. A to Pl. Resp. (Dkt. 43-2). The next week, in a separate case in Virginia, Elhady's counsel issued document requests to obtain documents related to his border crossing; CBP produced the relevant documents on January 4, 2018 but redacted the names of the officers involved,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Resp. at 5 (Dkt. 43). Elhady's counsel followed up with an email requesting the identities of the agents on January 11, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1/11/2018 Email, Ex. D to Pl. Resp. (Dkt. 43-5). The day before that email was sent, the Court had issued a show-cause order for failure to prosecute, and Elhady responded by filing the motion for limited discovery on January 18, which was then refiled on January 22 following a strike order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/22/2018 Motion (Dkt. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By January 22, 2018, Elhady had exhausted his ability to personally discover the names of the John Doe defendants, and it was not his fault that the Court did not resolve the motion before the statute of limitations expired in early April (more than two months after he filed the motion for discovery). Although there was some delay between the filing of the complaint and the filing of the motion for discovery, Elhady was acting diligently during that time to discover the names of the John Doe defendants. He also allowed the Court more time to rule on his motion than the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   , who filed his complaint only one month before the statute of limitations expired. Here, Elhady filed the motion more than two months before the limitations period expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Billups v. Scholl\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-258,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203959062\">\n    2016 WL 3959062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Ohio July 22, 2016), found similarly in denying a motion for summary judgment. There, the court determined that summary judgment was not appropriate because a jury could find that the statute of limitations should be tolled where only the police department \"had access to the information regarding the names of the officers who conducted the stop and Billups repeatedly attempted to obtain information related to the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Here too, Elhady attempted to obtain information related to the border-crossing incident by making discovery requests in the Virginia case and CBP refused to provide it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This is not a case where the plaintiff waited until the last hours before filing a relevant motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farzana K. v. Indiana Dept. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2536568\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/703/#p705\">\n    473 F.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (7th Cir. 2007) (\"Waiting until the last hours is not diligent; the errors that often accompany hurried action do not enable the bungling lawyer to grant himself extra time.\"); where the moving party has a history of non-diligent action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Searcy v.

Fifth Amendment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Elhady brings a Fifth Amendment claim, as that amendment's Due Process Clause prohibits the government from imposing torture or cruel and unusual confinement conditions on non-convicted detainees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Accordingly, even though this is a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context, Defendants have provided no reasons that counsel hesitation, and thus the claim should be allowed to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To find to the contrary would be to allow \"national-security concerns\" to \"become a talisman used to ward off inconvenient claims,\" which the Supreme Court specifically warned against in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants try to do exactly that here; Defendants do not even attempt to describe how this case implicates national security, but rather claim \"national security\" in the hope that the Court will look no further. But there is no plausible national-security interest in placing a person in a room so cold that he develops hypothermia within a matter of hours, and Defendants' refusal to offer any kind of explanation speaks volumes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meshal v. Higgenbotham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357472,12309896\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/417/\">\n    804 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Pillard, J., dissenting) (\"If Article III judges must sometimes cede our rights-protective role in deference to the political branches on matters of national security, we should do so only with a responsible official's authoritative and specific assurance of the imperative of doing so. ... Before declining to recognize a cause of action because of national security concerns, the court should require the government to provide a concrete, plausible, and authoritative explanation as to why the suit implicates national security concerns.\"). By claiming national security and refusing to offer any kind of justification for that claim, Defendants essentially seek immunity for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   CBP action taken against a United States citizen at the border.\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   disavows such an attempt, and the Court will not allow that argument to win the day in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Mot. at 25. But \"just as national security cannot be used as a talisman to ward off inconvenient claims, neither does the mere incantation of the magic words 'foreign policy' cause a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy to disappear.\"\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518124\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/719/\">\n     899 F.3d at 746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants do not even attempt to explain how placing a United States citizen in a freezing-cold cell at the border would implicate foreign policy; thus there is no need to address it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McPherson v.
