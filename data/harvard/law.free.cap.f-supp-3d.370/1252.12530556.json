ECF Nos. 22, 36, 50. CHS moves for summary judgment, arguing the charity care condition is too indefinite and uncertain to enforce or, alternatively, CHS did not breach the charity care condition and the Foundation is not entitled to any remedy. ECF No. 59. The parties oppose each other's motions. ECF Nos. 58, 62. The Court held a hearing on both motions on February 26, 2019.

The Foundation uses available data from the immediately preceding year. CHS uses available data from a trailing three-year period.

As CHS notes, the Attorney General did not address whether the Foundation has constitutional standing. Instead, the Attorney General discussed the Foundation's statutory right\n   to enforce CHS's charity care commitments, an issue which neither party raised. CHS disputes this analysis and argues the Foundation would lack constitutional standing on any statutory basis. But CHS does not dispute that the Foundation has constitutional standing to claim a breach of a contract to which it is a party. And indeed, the Court assures itself that the Foundation does, in fact, have constitutional standing on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.
