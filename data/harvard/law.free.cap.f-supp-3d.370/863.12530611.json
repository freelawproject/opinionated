While the officers were at the shop, they handcuffed Tenorio and put her in a squad car for several minutes.

Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 6-9. Keeping in mind that the Defendants need only show they had indisputable probable cause for one crime to defeat the false-arrest claim, the Court will evaluate each possible crime in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Aggravated Battery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The question of whether Harris and Upshaw had probable cause to arrest Tenorio for aggravated battery hinges on one crucial, disputed fact: whether Tenorio made physical contact with either officer before they arrested her. Under Illinois law, \"[a] person commits aggravated battery when, in committing a battery, ... he or she knows the individual battered to be ...a peace officer ... performing his or her official duties.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-3.05(d)(4)(i). Battery, in turn, requires that the person \"knowingly without legal justification by any means (1) causes bodily harm to an individual or (2) makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with an individual.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-3. There are no facts to show, and the Defendants do not claim, that Tenorio caused bodily harm to either officer. So to establish probable cause for aggravated battery, they must, at a minimum, show that there is no factual dispute that Tenorio touched one of them (leaving aside whether that touching was \"of an insulting or provoking nature\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Harris and Upshaw both maintain that Tenorio bumped into Upshaw. DSOF \u00b6 32 (citing Upshaw Dep. Tr. at 68:7-11 (\"In the process of her walking back and forth, she ended up bumping me and Detective Harris, which physical contact was made.\"), 71:1-2 (\"I don't recall how she did push, but she did make physical contact.\") ); DSOF \u00b6 33 (citing Harris Dep. Tr. at 73:8-10 ('She pushed past him enough to touch him.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But Tenorio \"categorically denies\" the physical contact that Harris and Upshaw describe. Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (citing Tenorio Aff. re: Events \u00b6 3 (\"At no point did I make any physical offensive contact with the officers, push them, or in any way resist them or pull away as they placed me in handcuffs.\"); Pl. Statement Add. Facts \u00b6 36 (\"Plaintiff never made any physical contact with any officer, pushed any officer, or in any way resisted the officers as she was placed in handcuffs.\") ). She also points to the depositions of herself and Rocha, in which they both lay out a slightly different timeline than the officers. In that alternative sequence of events, Tenorio never starts pacing back and forth-she just asks for proof that the rims were stolen, and then the officers immediately handcuff her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenorio Dep. Tr. at 22:6-24, 23:1-24:4; Rocha Dep. Tr. at 14:21-17:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The only other evidence in the record besides the parties' and Rocha's accounts is the video recording from outside of Tenorio's body shop that she submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Statement Add. Facts, Exh. G. In the video, Tenorio and the officers are shown talking with another man for a few minutes. During that time, Tenorio does not appear to touch or bump anyone. Then,\n   they all walk into the tire shop, out of sight from the video.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:56. By the time they walk out of the tire shop again, Tenorio is already handcuffed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:58. The video provides no evidence that lends to an inference that Tenorio touched either officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The bottom line is that there is a genuine dispute of material fact. The Court cannot grant summary judgment on the premise that there was probable cause to arrest Tenorio for aggravated battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Obstructing or Resisting a Peace Officer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next is the obstruction possibility.

Of course, as discussed above, Tenorio denies touching either officer. Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. But besides the battery the officers insist that Tenorio committed, they also both assert that she \"snatched her arm away\" when Upshaw attempted to handcuff her.

Setting aside the question of whether that \"snatch\" would necessarily qualify as the requisite physical act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tenorio flatly denies having done it.

Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The officers' final-and best-argument is that they had probable cause to arrest Tenorio for theft. Under Illinois law, a person is guilty of theft when she \"obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have been stolen or under such circumstances as would reasonably induce ... her to believe that the property was stolen.\" 720 ILCS 5/16-1(a)(4). This is not necessarily a traditional definition of theft, but rather closer to receiving stolen property, which is what this Opinion will call it. The question of whether the \"circumstances\" should lead the person to know the property was stolen is evaluated from the perspective of an ordinary person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

In Harris's first conversation with Ziadah (after Ziadah's original complaint, but before he called in about Tenorio's shop in particular), Ziadah reported that the rims were custom painted. Harris Dep. Tr. at 57:13-20. He also \"provided pictures ... from his cellphone with the rims on a truck that they were on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:3-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   So by the time Harris arrived at Tenorio's shop on May 26, 2015 he had already seen a photograph of Ziadah's rims and believed that they were custom-painted, suggesting that the rims at the shop were unlikely to be some other set of rims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:21-23. To be sure, it is unclear exactly how Ziadah knew the rims were at Tenorio's shop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:20-55:2 (Harris testifying, \"I can't recall exactly. He said that it was either he, himself, or someone noticed the rims resembling his at the shop.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 20. But that gap in knowledge became far less relevant at the moment Harris walked into the tire shop and thought he saw a tire rim on display that exactly matched the tire rims in Ziadah's photos. Harris Dep. Tr. at 54:15-19. So Harris reasonably believed that the rims at Tenorio's shop were the ones that had been stolen from Ziadah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is a close call, but based on the undisputed facts, the officers also had probable cause to believe that Tenorio bought the tires under circumstances that should have reasonably tipped her off that they were stolen. Most significantly, Harris and Upshaw knew that Tenorio had purchased the tires for far less than the estimated value; remember, Ziadah had reported that he valued the rims at around $10,000 in total. Pl. Resp. DSOF \u00b6 14 (citing Harris Dep. Tr. at 49:18-20).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, before the arrest, Tenorio informed Harris and Upshaw that she had purchased the rims for $800: according to Harris (and not disputed by Tenorio), during Harris's first visit to the shop, Tenorio showed him the record that she had kept from the purchase. Harris Dep. Tr. at 61:18-23, 64:1-4 (acknowledging that Tenorio's record included a copy of the seller's driver's license, and the amount that Tenorio paid for the tires);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tenorio Dep. Tr. at 15:14-22 (stating that she usually keeps \"information on the\n   purchase ... on the copy of the I.D. that we keep.\"); Defs. Resp. Pl. Statement Add. Facts \u00b6 21 (stating that Tenorio provided Harris with a copy of the purchaser's ID the first time he visited the shop). The difference between the tires' value (according to Ziadah) and the extremely low price at which Tenorio purchased them established probable cause that, at the least, the steep discount should have reasonably induced Tenorio to believe that the tires were stolen-which is all that the crime requires. 720 ILCS 5/16-1(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Tenorio argues that Harris has acknowledged that he had no \"information tending to indicate that [Tenorio]\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that what she was buying were stolen goods.\" Harris Dep. Tr. at 64:19-22 (emphasis added); R. 33, Pl. Resp. Br. at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs. Resp. Pl. Statement Add. Facts \u00b6 23. But Harris's\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   assessment does not control: the analysis is objective, measured from the standpoint of a reasonable officer. Also,\n   <em>\n    knowledge\n   </em>\n   that the property was stolen is not required by Illinois law. All that a reasonable officer needed was probable cause to believe that the circumstances should have reasonably induced a belief in Tenorio that the rims were stolen. Here, the stark price differential-$10,000 versus $800-supplied probable cause. It is a close question, and no doubt some other police officers would have exercised discretion not to effectuate an arrest. Ultimately, however, probable cause does not require even a preponderance of evidence, and given the price difference the officers were aware of, no reasonable jury could find for Tenorio on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In arguing for summary judgment, the Defendants did not rely on qualified immunity. It is worth discussing qualified immunity, however, because even if there was a genuine dispute on probable cause-as a straight merits question-the closeness of the question would hand the officers a victory on qualified immunity. To be sure, the Court is not granting summary judgment on the qualified-immunity ground, because the officers did not argue it. But Harris and Upshaw did plead the defense of qualified immunity in their Answer. R. 18, Answer at 7. So they would be entitled to invoke qualified immunity at\n   <em>\n    trial\n   </em>\n   via a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. The parties and the Court would have prepared for trial, brought a venire for jury selection, presented evidence in Tenorio's case-in-chief to a jury-only to then address qualified immunity. So it is worth discussing it now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Police officers \"are entitled to qualified immunity under \u00a7 1983 unless (1) they violated a federal statutory or constitutional right, and (2) the unlawfulness of their conduct was clearly established at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p586\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Reichle v.

Alderden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258389\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/823/#p830\">\n     821 F.3d 823\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 830-31 (7th Cir. 2016) (finding that victims' statements could be considered at summary judgment because they \"were offered instead to show the officers had information giving them probable cause to arrest plaintiffs\"). Also, as discussed above, probable cause may be based on a statement of a witness or victim.\n    <em>\n     McBride v. Grice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038091\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/703/#p707\">\n     576 F.3d 703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 707 (7th Cir. 2009).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    It was reasonable for Harris to take Ziadah at his word as to the value of the rims. Ziadah had no particular reason to lie, and although his initial complaint included mistakes about the number and color of rims that were stolen, his credibility was bolstered by the fact that he clarified the mistake in a separate conversation with Harris that took place\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    he reported that the rims were at Tenorio's shop.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Harris Dep. Tr. at 95:23-96:4 (testifying that Ziadah's first report was filed in August 2014);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 96:5-21 (testifying that Ziadah made the corrections in a second conversation sometime between August 2014 and May 26, 2015). And again, Ziadah's valuation of the rims is not hearsay because it is not offered for its truth, but rather for what facts Harris knew at the time of the arrest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Indeed, Tenorio herself later acknowledged that she believed the rims were worth $1,000 each, or $4,000 in total. Tenorio Dep. Tr. at 16:12-15, 19:4-6. Given that she usually only expects to make around $100 in profit on the used rims she buys, Tenorio Dep. Tr. at 32:14-18, the fact that she anticipated making $800 on\n    <em>\n     each\n    </em>\n    of the four rims further supports the defense's view that the price differential was a reliable basis for probable cause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
