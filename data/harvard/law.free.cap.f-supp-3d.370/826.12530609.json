Varlan, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A chess game between grandmasters Friedrich S\u00e4misch and Aron Nimzowitsch, played in Copenhagen in 1923, is called the \"Immortal Zugzwang Game.\" Zugzwang, a German word roughly translated as \"compulsion to move,\" refers to a situation in chess where a player's obligation to move results in a serious and often decisive disadvantage, because each possible move puts the player in a worse position than the one occupied at the beginning of the turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Jacobs Engineering Group (Jacobs) now argues, after a four-week Phase I jury trial, that it must receive a new one or else Phase II will eventually turn into exactly the kind of lose-lose situation epitomized by zugzwang. Jacobs's argument goes like this: either the Phase II juries reexamine the negligence of its conduct in violation of its Seventh Amendment rights, or else any potential judgment against Jacobs will be deficient as a matter of law for not establishing the required link between any plaintiffs' purported disease-causing exposure and Jacobs's negligent conduct. But Jacobs's Seventh Amendment reexamination concerns are overstated and avoidable by carefully structuring Phase II, and its speculation about what plaintiffs will have failed to prove after an eventual Phase II is premature. For these and other reasons Jacobs's motion for a new trial will be denied [Doc. 439].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Jacobs's other arguments-pertaining to its motion for judgment as a matter of law-are similarly unavailing, that motion will also be denied [Doc. 437].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These consolidated cases are before the Court on Jacobs's two post-trial motions: one for judgment as a matter of law [Docs. 437, 438], and one for a new trial [Docs. 439, 440]. Plaintiffs have responded to each [Docs. 450 (JMOL), 451 (new trial) ], and Jacobs has replied [Docs. 455 (new trial), 456 (JMOL) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The facts of these cases are well-known, but some brief background is warranted here. Jacobs was hired by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to manage cleanup and remediation efforts at the Kingston Fossil Fuel Plant following the December 2008 coal-ash spill. TVA and Jacobs entered into a contract, according to which Jacobs developed a comprehensive Site Wide Safety and Health Plan (SWSHP) governing the site. The plaintiffs here are individuals who worked on the remediation efforts, plus some of their spouses. The workers suffer from a variety of medical conditions, which they claim were caused by Jacobs's negligence with respect to air monitoring, dust control, the use of personal protective equipment, and worker training, all in violation of Jacobs's contract with TVA and the SWSHP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2014 this Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that, due to its contractual relationship with TVA, Jacobs was entitled to derivative immunity under\n   <em>\n    Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136738\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/309/18/\">\n    309 U.S. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136738\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/309/18/\">\n    60 S.Ct. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136738\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/309/18/\">\n    84 L.Ed. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1940). The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity is not jurisdictional, and remanded\n   with the following instruction about the scope of discretionary-function immunity (which informs the scope of\n   <em>\n    Yearsley\n   </em>\n   immunity):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court, in holding that the discretionary-function exception applied, found that various regulations, contractual provisions, and the SWSHP all failed to prescribe a specific course of action that Jacobs had to follow. But just because certain conduct fails to be specifically mandated does not necessarily mean that the government contractor is protected from liability. Discretionary conduct may fall outside the protection of the discretionary-function exception if the conduct is not a \"deliberate or necessary result of a discretionary general policy\"; in other words, government conduct \"does not necessarily amount to an exercise of a discretionary function merely because carrying out the general policy provided the opportunity for the negligent act.\"\n   <em>\n    Bultema v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9284826\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/379/#p383\">\n    359 F.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-85 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that the prison staff's alleged failure to carry out the prison's bunk-pass-notification policy was not protected by the discretionary-function exception because, even if the policy allowed for discretion, the staff's alleged negligence was \"not a necessary concomitant of the prison's notification policy\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Adkisson v. Jacobs Eng'g Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272992\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/641/#p648\">\n    790 F.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-49 (6th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On remand, this Court denied Jacobs's motion to dismiss, which was converted to one for summary judgment [Doc. 137]. The Court held that \"there is a material question of fact as to whether Jacobs acted within the scope of its authority when performing the alleged acts that give rise to plaintiffs' claims,\" and explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Namely, there is evidence in the record that defendants would be acting contrary to the will of the government if it: (1) did not randomly select workers for mobile monitoring; (2) manipulated the monitoring results; (3) did not inform TVA safety officials of repeated complaints regarding health problems due to fly ash; (4) did not honor prescriptions for dust masks or respirators; (5) communicated to workers that fly ash was safe to consume; and/or (6) threatened workers when they asked for dust masks or respirators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [Doc. 137].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the parties were litigating Jacobs's immunity this Court also granted Jacobs's motion to bifurcate the trial proceedings into two phases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Phase I\n   </strong>\n   will be a consolidated trial for all cases and will involve issues and evidence relating to: (1) whether defendant owed plaintiffs a legal duty; (2) whether defendant breached that duty; and (3) whether defendant's breach was capable of causing plaintiffs' alleged injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Phase II\n   </strong>\n   will involve issues and evidence relating to: (1) specific causation with respect to individual plaintiffs; (2) each plaintiff's alleged injuries; and (3) the extent to which individual plaintiffs are entitled to damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [Doc. 136]. The cases thus proceeded through discovery and made their way to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Some time later Jacobs moved for summary judgment, this time on the issue of general causation. The Court denied that motion, too, mostly agreeing with plaintiffs' definition of general causation. The Court held, for Phase I purposes, that \"it is enough for plaintiffs to show that the amount of toxic constituents generally present in the fly ash at the Kingston site was capable of causing the complained-of diseases,\" that plaintiffs \"have done more than enough to demonstrate exposure sufficient to overcome summary judgment on\n   general causation,\" and that there was a factual dispute about whether \"the chemical constituents found in the Kingston fly ash are capable of causing most of the complained-of diseases\" [Doc. 307].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The cases proceeded to trial on Phase I. During those four weeks, the jury heard evidence that, among other things, employees of Jacobs:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Manipulated monitoring results by watering down stationary monitors and taking readings only when wet or raining [Doc. 412, Tr.

Vol. III at 391:9-15; 450:20-24; 459:11-23], taking dust masks away from employees who wore them [Doc. 414, Tr. Vol. IV at 561:23-24], and destroying dust masks that were available on the site [Doc 411, Tr. Vol. I at 85:7-13; 87:4-88:9];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Did not warn workers about the dangers of exposure to fly ash [Doc. 411, Tr. Vol. 1 at 70:20-71:18; 72:3-16; 73:2-8; 74:13-15; Doc. 412, Tr. Vol. 2 151:4-152:5; 154:1-155:22; 189:5-19];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Told workers that fly ash was safe to consume [Doc. 414, Tr. Vol IV at 701:11-702:22], which is not true [Tr. Vol. VIII at 1958:22-1960:9].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Also presented was testimony and evidence about the large amount of fly ash-even airborne clouds of it-present at the site [\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. Vol. III at 328:21-25; Pls. Exs. 334, 337, 328, 327]. And plaintiffs' expert witness, epidemiologist Dr. Paul Terry, testified that fly ash exposure is capable of causing the diseases from which plaintiffs claim to suffer [Doc. 421, Tr. Vol. 421, at 1482-1631].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Toward the end of the trial, Jacobs filed four written motions for judgment as a matter of law arguing that: (1) plaintiffs failed to prove breaches of professional standards of care [Doc. 388]; (2) plaintiffs failed to prove duty, breach, and causation [Doc. 389]; (3) plaintiffs failed to prove misrepresentations and reliance [Doc. 390]; and (4) plaintiffs failed to prove specific theories of negligence [Doc. 391]. At the close of proof Jacobs also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law on three additional grounds: plaintiffs' (1) failure to prove each plaintiff worked at the Kingston ash cleanup site; (2) failure to present evidence showing which plaintiff is claiming which medical condition; and (3) failure to establish plaintiff's spouses' claims for \"take-home\" ash exposure. [Doc. 420, Tr. Vol. XII at 2743-46]. The Court denied each of these motions for various reasons (except for the ones about misrepresentation and take-home exposure, which were granted as unopposed) [Doc. 406; Doc. 424, Tr. Vol. XIV at 2893-2913].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court then ruled on several matters relating to the jury instructions and verdict form. Earlier on, the parties had proposed radically different verdict forms. Plaintiffs asked the Court to give the jury a simple, two-question verdict form that did little more than ask whether plaintiffs had met their burden to show that Jacobs\n   had breached a duty, which was capable of causing plaintiffs' conditions. Jacobs's version was substantially more complex: spanning fourteen pages and twenty questions (several with multiple subsections), it asked the jury whether Jacobs breached its duty to plaintiffs with respect to air monitoring, dust control, the use of personal protective equipment, or worker training and education, and it then asked whether\n   <em>\n    each particular type of breach\n   </em>\n   was capable of causing each of the conditions from which plaintiffs claim to suffer. The disagreement was pointed: Jacobs argued that if the verdict form did not specify what conduct constituted a breach, subsequent Phase II juries would \"be invited to reweigh [ ] and consider all ten [of plaintiffs' theories of breach],\" which would effectively make Jacobs \"strictly liable for the consequences of anything the plaintiffs claim we did wrong in this case,\" even though the jury \"may have found in Jacobs' favor on nine of the ten [theories of breach]\" [Doc.422]; plaintiffs argued that, due to its complexity, Jacobs's version risked confusing and misleading the jury and would have no impact on the proof in Phase II proceedings because \"you can't tease out which [breach of] duty caused which exposure\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After hearing argument on the competing proposals, the Court submitted to the jury a verdict form that asked: (1) whether Jacobs violated its contract with TVA; (2) whether Jacobs failed to exercise reasonable care in carrying out the duties owed to plaintiffs; and (3) whether that breach was capable of causing each of ten medical conditions [Doc. 408]. The jury answered \"yes\" to all and returned a verdict for plaintiffs [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Which brings this case to the present. Shortly after trial plaintiffs filed a motion for reference to mediation, which Jacobs opposed in part due to the pending dispositive post-trial motions currently being considered. The Court granted plaintiffs' motion at a January 11, 2019, status conference and memorialized that ruling in a January 18, 2019, order [Doc. 459]. The parties were given thirty days to select a mediator (or mediators), and the Court took the instant motions under advisement. In a joint motion recently granted by the magistrate judge [Doc. 461], the parties stated that \"they have been earnestly working together to identify a mediator or mediators they can agree upon and believe that with additional time they will be able to do so\" [Doc. 460]. Because the post-trial motions will be denied, the parties can now engage in that and other parts of the mediation process unencumbered by looming post-trial litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion for a New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A jury's verdict cannot be set aside unless the trial court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake resulting in plain injustice has been committed or the verdict is contrary to all reason.\n   <em>\n    McCurdy v.

They argue that it was error to use a general verdict form, rather than a special verdict in the form of interrogatories. However, the form of jury verdict is within the discretion of the trial judge, and is not ordinarily reviewable.\"). Jacobs's problem here, however, is not with the jury instructions and verdict form per se, but rather is that those items combined with the bifurcated trial plan will inevitably lead to a Seventh Amendment violation. And, of course, this Court (like all others) has no discretion to violate the Seventh Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Jacobs's argument is twofold. A new trial must be granted, so it goes, or else one of two things will happen: either the Phase II juries will reexamine what conduct by Jacobs constituted a breach of duty, or else plaintiffs will have failed to show-in either phase-that their disease-causing fly-ash exposures were attributable to Jacobs's negligent conduct, as opposed to its non-negligent conduct (or even to serendipity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To the first argument, the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment is not, and likely will not be, violated in this case. The clause provides that \"no fact tried by a jury[ ] shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. There is clearly no Reexamination Clause violation right now, because, even on Jacobs's theory, one would occur only after a Phase II jury reconsidered a factual finding of the Phase I jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   There is Sixth Circuit precedent for not deciding this issue until the Seventh Amendment violation has, or at least clearly will, occur.

The Sixth Circuit rejected the argument, noting that, \"[a]t this stage, the district court has not formalized any procedures for resolving either the common issues or the remaining individualized inquiries,\" and that \"because the district court has not settled on a specific procedure, no constitutional infirmities exist at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517734\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/405/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517734\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/405/\">\n    at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So too here: although this trial has been bifurcated, nearly all of the nuts-and-bolts, logistical issues pertaining to Phase II have yet to be decided. Constitutionally infirm reexamination is thus by no means a certain consequence of the bifurcated proceedings in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That said, the Court is confident that Phases I and II are sufficiently distinct that no reexamination will occur in the future, either. The bifurcation order makes plain what issues fall within each phase: Phase I addressed \"(1) whether defendant owed plaintiffs a legal duty; (2) whether defendant breached that duty; and (3) whether defendant's breach was capable of causing plaintiffs' alleged injuries,\" and Phase II will address: \"(1) specific causation with respect to individual plaintiffs; (2) each plaintiff's alleged injuries; and (3) the extent to which individual plaintiffs are entitled to damages\" [Doc. 136]. The Phase II jury will be instructed that the verdict of the Phase I jury-that Jacobs breached duties owed to plaintiffs, resulting in exposure that was capable of the alleged diseases-is binding. Put differently, Phase I\n   dealt with Jacobs's conduct, and Phase II will deal with the effects of that conduct on individual plaintiffs. The task for the Phase II jury, then, will be determining whether an individual plaintiffs' exposure actually did cause the plaintiffs' disease, and if so, the resulting damages, which does not overlap with any Phase I issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This is true regardless of whether there might be some evidentiary overlap between Phase I and subsequent Phase II trials:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The existence of common factual issues is to be distinguished from the existence of overlapping evidence. For purposes of the Seventh Amendment, the question is whether factual issues overlap, thus requiring one trier-of-fact to decide a disputed issue that must be decided by a subsequent jury, not whether the two fact-finders will merely have to consider similar evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

Moreover, the Phase II jury instructions in\n   <em>\n    Blyden\n   </em>\n   , which made clear that the juries considered the same issue, were crucial to court's analysis there.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857722\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/252/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the Phase II juries here (which, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Blyden\n   </em>\n   , have not been impaneled) will not be instructed to determine what of Jacobs's conduct constituted a breach of its duties to plaintiffs, as Jacobs appears to suggest.

But the main problem, as far as the Reexamination Clause is concerned, was that each subsequent jury, in addition to damages, was also to try the issues of comparative negligence and proximate causation, which, as a matter of basic tort law, \"overlap the issue of the defendants' negligence\" determined by the first jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365458\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/1293/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365458\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/1293/\">\n    at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because, as explained above, there will be no issue overlap vis-\u00e0-vis the juries in this case, the Seventh Amendment analysis of\n   <em>\n    Rhone-Poulenc\n   </em>\n   is of limited relevance here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   That leaves Jacobs's second argument, which is that \"Plaintiffs cannot possibly satisfy\" their Phase II burden of \"showing their exposures and illnesses and showing that acts or omissions by Defendant actually did cause those illnesses,\" without \"telling the jury what Jacobs did that was allegedly negligent\" [Doc. 455]. In other words, because \"the essence of tort liability\" is \"a finding that the defendant is to blame for the plaintiff's harm,\" so Jacobs argues, and because the Phase I verdict form will leave subsequent Phase II juries \"in the dark\" about what of Jacobs's conduct was negligent, without proof of negligence in Phase II, plaintiffs will have failed to establish the requisite \"link\" between Jacobs's negligent conduct (Phase I) and plaintiffs' injury-causing exposures (Phase II).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Put one more way, Jacobs argues that because the \"initial jury verdict form is so vague ... that subsequent juries must determine for themselves factual issues already adjudicated, the combination of the bifurcation procedure and the deficient verdict form clearly violates the Seventh Amendment\" (internal quotations omitted).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365458\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/1293/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Jacobs's concerns do not equate to a Reexamination Clause problem. According to Jacobs, the Phase II juries, \"to make their own findings ... will be forced to decide again: How did Jacobs breach the\n   contract or violate the Safety and Health Plan? How did Jacobs fail to exercise reasonable care? And which act was capable of causing those ten medical conditions?\" [Doc. 440]. But this is not correct. As stated above, the Phase II juries will not be charged with making any of those determinations, so strictly speaking, no factual finding of the Phase I jury will be reexamined by any other jury. And just because the possibility remains that a second or subsequent Phase II jury could potentially\n   <em>\n    find specific causation and damages for\n   </em>\n   exposures attributable to conduct for which the Phase I jury did not find negligence, does not necessarily mean that Jacobs\n   <em>\n    will be held liable for\n   </em>\n   said non-negligent conduct. This is because, of course, specific causation and damages do not equate to liability, but are merely part of defendant's liability (recall that the other parts were decided in plaintiffs' favor in Phase I). So, even assuming that there could be some (implicit) inconsistency between verdicts-a Phase II jury's finding specific causation and damages for conduct not found negligent by the Phase I jury-the Reexamination Clause would not be violated because the Phase I and Phase II issues do not overlap at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   If, after a hypothetical Phase II, defendant still thinks it has been held liable for conduct that the Phase I jury did not find negligent and moves for relief on that basis, the inconsistency between verdicts will need to be reconciled. The parties have not cited, and the Court has not found, any cases addressing the issue that would then be presented: implied inconsistency-but not outright conflict-between two jury verdicts in a bifurcated case. When the verdict of a single jury, in an ordinary case, is inconsistent, the rule is straightforward: courts are \"constitutionally required under the Seventh Amendment to adopt a view of the case that makes the jury's answers consistent,\"\n   <em>\n    Hiltgen v. Sumrall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411009\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/695/#p701\">\n    47 F.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gallick v.

The Court sees no reason to follow a different rule here. Thus, rather than dooming the Phase I verdict, right now the Seventh Amendment appears to suggest exactly the opposite: that any speculative, implicit inconsistency between the Phase I verdict and any hypothetical Phase II plaintiffs' verdict be resolved in favor of effectuating liability where a reasonable juror could have so found. This competing Seventh Amendment interest-giving effect to the Phase I plaintiffs' verdict-weighs in favor of not granting a new trial now and thus proceeding to Phase II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In this way, Jacobs's stated concern can also be viewed as a failure-of-proof or sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument with respect to this disputed aspect of its tort liability: the so-called \"link\" between the negligent conduct of Jacobs and plaintiffs' disease-causing exposures to fly ash. And the standard governing such an argument is familiar: relief is granted where \"a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the [non-moving] party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). Moreover, in Tennessee, a general\n   verdict like the one returned in Phase I, even if there is lack of material evidence to support one or more claims, \"is nevertheless held to embrace every issue,\" so long as the record contains material evidence supporting at least one of the claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2020-9-502\">\n    Tenn.

How these two standards apply-particularly in the context of this complex, bifurcated case that is (at most) halfway finished-is unclear. But the Court does not think it fruitful to, through speculation, consider these standards with a less-than-complete evidentiary record; rather, they are best considered if at all, on a full record after entry of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Jacobs's hypothetical, which supposedly \"illustrate[s] the error in Plaintiffs' reasoning\" [Doc. 455], s unavailing. Highlighting the cases of plaintiffs Brewer, who was allowed to wear a dust mask while working, and Wilkinson, whose preexisting medical conditions prevented him from wearing a dust mask or respirator while working, Jacobs contends that proceeding to Phase II risks its being held (essentially) strictly liable for any and all fly-ash exposure at the Kingston site. According to Jacobs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [F]or all we know, the Phase I jury decided that the only theory it believed was that Jacobs \"failed to comply with the provisions of the safety and health plan with respect to the voluntary use of dust masks\" (Theory # 3). [Doc. 424, 14 Trial Tr. at 3022, 3024.] Under that scenario, Plaintiffs Brewer and Wilkinson cannot prevail against Jacobs even if it is true that \"[a]ny one (or all) of [Jacobs'] breaches resulted in Plaintiffs' exposure to potentially harmful levels of fly ash or constituent elements found in fly ash,\" and even if medical evidence presented in Phase II establishes generally that \"exposure to fly ash was a substantial factor in bringing about one or more of the diseases [of Plaintiffs Brewer and Wilkinson] for which general causation was found in Phase I.\" After all, the only thing Jacobs supposedly did wrong in this potential scenario was related to preventing workers from wearing masks. But Mr. Brewer was allowed to wear a dust mask, and Mr. Wilkinson could not wear a dust mask no matter what. Yet under Plaintiffs' purported theory of causation, both would be allowed to recover.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [Doc. 455]. But again, this concern is premature (if it even exists). First of all, Jacobs's liability is not \"strict\" as that term is normally understood. Recall that the Phase I jury returned a verdict, albeit a general one, finding a lot of what establishes negligence: that Jacobs breached duties that it owed to plaintiffs, which were capable of causing several diseases. Combined with a potential Phase II plaintiffs' verdict, Jacobs's liability, if ever imposed, would be anything but strict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Jacobs is potentially liable to plaintiffs Bewer and Wilkinson if and only if they are able to show disease-causing exposures to fly ash in Phase II (which is far from given). If, given that, Jacobs's parade-of-horribles scenario materializes, it can of course challenge the Phase II verdict for any number of reasons and can also challenge plaintiffs' ultimate burden of proof on their negligence claims on a full evidentiary record. In that scenario, Tennessee's general-verdict statute would apply, which states, \"A general verdict, although it may not in terms answer every issue joined, is nevertheless\n   held to embrace every issue,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-9-503\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-9-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That would appear to effectuate liability if a Phase II jury\n   <em>\n    does find\n   </em>\n   specific causation and damages, and where a reasonable Phase I jury\n   <em>\n    could have found\n   </em>\n   an accordant duty, breach, and general causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained above, those issues are best dealt with, if at all, on a full record, so the Court expresses no opinion on the merits of either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   An additional consideration weighs in favor of denying Jacobs's motion. Jacobs wanted the verdict form to list out each theory of breach because it maintains that, during Phase II, plaintiffs must allocate how much of their disease-causing exposures were attributable to which of Jacobs's breaches of duty. According to plaintiffs this is impossible:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Jacobs argues that each Phase II plaintiff [ ] should have to prove which specific breach of Jacobs' duties caused his or her specific harm, as if their exposure to fly ash can possibly be allocated to each type of Jacobs' negligent conduct or as if their heart attack or leukemia comes labeled with Jacobs' specific breach of duty. This was never contemplated by the bifurcation order and would place an impossible burden on Plaintiffs. Any one (or all) of Defendant's breaches resulted in Plaintiffs' exposure to potentially harmful levels of fly ash or constituent elements found in fly ash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [Doc. 451].

But this understanding reads the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   out of existence. Under that case there is of course a third category: discretionary (i.e., non-mandatory) conduct that is not susceptible to public-policy analysis. This is not only true as a matter of logic, but was also spelled out very clearly in the Sixth Circuit's decision in this very case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   The district court, in holding that the discretionary-function exception applied, found that various regulations, contractual provisions, and the SWSHP all failed to prescribe a specific course of action that Jacobs had to follow. But just because certain conduct fails to be specifically mandated does not necessarily mean that the government contractor is protected from liability. Discretionary conduct may fall outside the protection of the discretionary-function exception if the conduct is not a \"deliberate or necessary result of a discretionary general policy\"; in other words, government conduct \"does not necessarily amount to an exercise of a discretionary function merely because carrying out the general policy provided the opportunity for the negligent act.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Adkisson v.

Ex. 5f, at Att. C-2-1], and there was evidence that Jacobs did the following things arguably to the contrary: threatening to discharge workers who wanted to wear masks [Doc. 413, Tr. Vol. III at 391:9-15; 450:20-24; 459:11-23], taking dust masks away from employees who wore them [Doc. 414, Tr. Vol. IV at 561:23-24], and destroying dust masks that were available on the site [Doc. 411, Tr. Vol. I at 85:7-13; 87:4-88:9]. Jacobs is not immune for negligence based on that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Jacobs also maintains that \"Plaintiffs could not have proven that Jacobs violated any contract provision by failing to train or warn workers about the dangers of excessive fly ash\" [Doc. 438, at 6-7]. However, the SWSHP lists among the \"required elements of the information and training program\" that Jacobs must communicate \"an understanding of the health hazards of hazardous chemicals in the work area\" and \"how to recognize the symptoms of overexposure and how to protect against it\" [Pls. Ex. 3c at 12-1]. There is plenty of evidence in the record suggesting that Jacobs did not do that, at least with respect to fly ash [Doc. 411, Tr. Vol. 1 at 70:20-71:18; 72:3-16; 73:2-8; 74:13-15; Doc. 412, Tr. Vol. 2 151:4-152:5; 154:1-155:22; 189:5-19]. Jacobs (wisely) does not appear to dispute that the SWSHP required training about on-site hazards, but argues that it is immune because \"the specific content of that training is not prescribed\" in those documents. This argument misses the mark because the relevant policy-based decision (to which discretionary-function immunity would attach) was\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   to warn of hazards on the site-a decision that was made in the SWSHP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jacobs did not have discretion to avoid that obligation by not training workers about the dangers of fly ash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For a similar reason, Jacobs's argument that plaintiffs \"could not have proven that Jacobs violated any contract provisions when an employee suggested that fly ash was safe to consume\" [Doc. 438, at 7-8], also fails. Instead of providing workers with \"an understanding of the health hazards of hazardous chemicals in the work area,\" as the SWSHP required [Pls. Ex. 3c\n   at 12-1], Jacobs told them that it was safe to eat a pound of fly ash per day, something that Jacobs safety manager Sean Healey admitted was inaccurate and wrong [Doc. 413, Tr. Vol. VIII at 1958:22-1960:9]. And as the Court previously ruled, plaintiffs' failure to prove reliance does not prevent this conduct from being negligence, rather than a misrepresentation [Doc. 424, Tr. Vol XIV at 2907].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Jacobs's remaining arguments are also foreclosed by the law-of-the-case doctrine. First, Jacobs's argument that \"Plaintiffs Could Not Prove That Jacobs Owed a Legal Duty to Protect Them Against All Exposure to Fly Ash\" [Doc. 438, at 9-10], fails. It is axiomatic that duty is a question of law for the Court rather than something plaintiffs must prove.\n   <em>\n    Burroughs v. Magee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9066398\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/118/323/#p327\">\n    118 S.W.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (Tenn. 2003). Accordingly, at trial the Court held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   [T]he Court has concluded and states for the record a finding that Defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs in rendering certain professional services that were intended to prevent the workers at the Kingston site from being exposed to potentially harmful levels of fly ash or any constituent element found in fly ash\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Those obligations included, as provided in the contract and the safety and health plan, air monitoring dust control, the use of personal protective equipment at the site, and worker training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [Doc. 424, Tr. Vol XIV at 2893]. That holding was reflected in the jury instructions [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3023]. Jacobs has not explicitly challenged that instruction in this motion and in any event has forfeited any right to do so by not objecting.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maliszewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366675\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/161/992/#p1003\">\n    161 F.3d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (6th Cir. 1998) (\"A party's failure to make a 'timely objection' to a jury instruction results in the forfeiture of his right to challenge that instruction.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7633000\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/668/#p672\">\n    108 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (6th Cir. 1997) ) ). Moreover, plaintiffs have never contended that Jacobs is liable for all exposures, only excessive ones. Given the proof at trial and the adverse-inference instruction given to the jury, Jacobs is no longer entitled to avoid liability by invoking things like permissible exposure limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Second, as the court ruled at trial, [Doc. 424, Tr. Vol XIV at 2901-02], the argument that \"Plaintiffs Failed to Offer the Necessary Expert Testimony to Prove That Jacobs Breached Any Duty It Legally Owed to Plaintiffs\" [Doc. 438, at 10-13], is unavailing because the conduct at issue here is an obvious breach of the professional standard of care, and thus the common-knowledge exception applies. In Tennessee \"expert testimony regarding the applicable standard of care and the breach thereof may be dispensed with when the acts of professional negligence are so obvious that they come within the common knowledge of lay persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Sizemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406473\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/78/249/#p272\">\n    78 S.W.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272-73 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. 1986) (holding that the negligence must be so obvious that \"all mankind knows that such things are not done absent negligence\"). Such negligence \"must be 'as plain as a fly floating in a bowl of buttermilk' to trigger the common knowledge exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9982235\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/739/777/#p778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    German v. Nichopoulos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931379\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/577/197/#p202\">\n    577 S.W.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202-03 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978) ). The conduct at issue here falls under that exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Third, the argument that \"Plaintiffs Failed to Offer Any Legally Relevant Proof Regarding General Causation\" [Doc. 438, at 13-17], confuses general causation with specific and conflicts with this Court's summary judgment decision. Jacobs maintains that \"Plaintiffs presented no evidence connecting any of Jacobs's alleged misconduct\n   to Plaintiffs' alleged injuries\" [Doc. 438, at 13], but that is of course part of specific causation, where plaintiffs must show that Jacobs's conduct actually caused their injuries. Here, Dr. Terry testified about exactly what this Court held that plaintiffs were required to show: that \"the amount of toxic constituents generally present in the fly ash at the Kingston site was capable of causing the complained-of diseases\" [Doc. 307].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, Jacobs has raised two more arguments that are also unavailing. Jacobs argues that, if judgment is not entered in its favor, these same arguments at least warrant a new trial because \"this jury reached a 'seriously erroneous' result on each of the elements of Plaintiffs' negligence claims presented during the Phase I trial\" [Doc. 456]. Of course, it is true that a new trial requires a lesser showing than judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noble v. Brinker Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9141901\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/715/#p720\">\n    391 F.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720 (6th Cir. 2004) (judgment as a matter of law is warranted when \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party ... reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, in favor of the moving party\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. City of Massillon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94746\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1041/#p1045\">\n    78 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045-46 (6th Cir. 1996) (a new trial is warranted when \"the verdict [is] against the weight of the evidence\"). But, for the same reasons stated above, Jacobs has not met the lesser new-trial standard, either. Jacobs also maintains that, because \"[i]t is impossible to tell from the Phase I verdict form which of Plaintiffs' six disparate theories of wrongdoing the jury believed,\" if judgment as a matter of law is granted with respect to any one of plaintiffs' theories of breach, the Court must also order a new trial \"because there would be no way for anyone to know whether that particular theory provided the sole basis for the Phase I jury's decision and thus the sole impermissible reason to proceed to Phase II\" [Doc. 456]. But because none of Jacobs's judgment-as-a-matter-of-law arguments succeeds, this contingent argument is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
