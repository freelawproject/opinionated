IRIZARRY, Chief United States District Judge\n   On March 4, 2016, Plaintiff Jouhan Rivera (\"Plaintiff\") initiated this action against Defendant Drug Enforcement Agency Special Agent David T. Samilo (\"Samilo\") and others for alleged violations of Plaintiff's constitutional rights in connection with his arrest during a traffic stop in 2013. On March 30, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint (the \"March 30, 2018 Order\"). (Docket Entry No. 58 ). The Court dismissed all claims against all Defendants except Plaintiff's damages claim against Samilo for injuries allegedly sustained when Samilo allegedly used excessive force when handcuffing Plaintiff during his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On July 12, 2018, the Court held a pretrial conference. At the conference, the Court asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing to address the application of the intervening case from the United States Supreme Court captioned\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v.

This opinion addresses that supplemental briefing. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claim cannot stand under\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , and this action is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the evening of October 22, 2013, Samilo and other federal law enforcement officers were surveilling Plaintiff as part of a narcotics investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While following a vehicle in which Plaintiff was a passenger, the officers initiated a traffic stop. Plaintiff and the driver were searched for weapons. A search of the vehicle uncovered a duffel bag containing approximately three kilograms of cocaine in the spare tire well of the trunk. Plaintiff was placed under arrest. Plaintiff alleges that he told the arresting officers, including Samilo, that he had a hand injury, and that the handcuffs were too tight and aggravating that injury. Plaintiff alleges that Samilo squeezed the cuffs even tighter, would not let him retrieve a hand brace from the car, and that he sought medical assistance as a result of these injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 4, 2016, Plaintiff filed his complaint against Samilo and six other federal officers alleging violations of Plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), the seminal case in which the Supreme Court found an implied right of action for money damages against federal officers for certain violations of a plaintiff's constitutional rights. (Docket Entry No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 21, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(5), 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and, in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. (Docket Entry No. 39.) On March 30, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion. (Docket Entry No. 58.) The only claim that survived defendants' motion is\n   Plaintiff's claim for a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights against Samilo for allegedly using excessive force in handcuffing Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v. Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which clarified the analysis to be applied by the lower courts when deciding whether to find an \"implied right of action\" under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 12, 2018, the Court held a pretrial conference. The Court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing to address the impact of\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   on Plaintiff's excessive force claim. The supplemental briefing was completed on August 23, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Samilo Br., Docket Entry No. 71 ; Rivera Br., Docket Entry No. 73 ; Samilo Rep., Docket Entry No. 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   and separation of powers principles counsel against finding an implied right of action on the facts of this case. Plaintiff's sole remaining claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For a plaintiff to enforce his constitutional rights he must have a cause of action. That is, there must be a statute passed by Congress or a judicially implied claim for relief. Here, Plaintiff cannot point to any statute that would allow him to prosecute this action. The only question is whether there is a judicially implied claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Bivens\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.
