FEN's Second Amended Complaint describes the action as a \"preenforcement challenge to the facial constitutionality\" of the statute. (2d Am. Compl., \u00b6 1.) \"[A]s \u00a7 609.215, subd. 1 has been authoritatively interpreted under Minnesota law, the word 'assists' criminalizes not only conduct, but alternatively 'speech' that 'enables' a 'suicide.' The plaintiffs challenge the facial constitutionality of Minnesota law to the extent it therefore makes a crime of First Amendment-protected\n   speech in the absence of any physical assistance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint states that the Plaintiffs, both FEN and the individuals, suffer an ongoing, concrete, particularized injury \"inasmuch as they desire and intend to violate the Minnesota Statute as they carry out the same policies, protocols, and practices apply [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in every other State in the Union, in reliance on their First Amendment-protected right to do so, and are threatened with arrest, prosecution and punishment under Minnesota law for the exercise of their right to freedom of speech.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6.) The Plaintiffs chose the Rice County Attorney and the Dakota County Attorney as defendants (together, \"County Attorney Defendants\") because they prosecuted Melchert-Dinkel and FEN in the cases described above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.) The Plaintiffs chose the Attorney General as a defendant because \"[t]here is no reason to believe the attorney general would decline to exercise [his] discretionary ability to assist in a prosecution or appeal under the Statute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint is short on particulars as to the plans made, if any, by FEN and the individual plaintiffs to \"assist\" a person's suicide and thus violate the challenged statute.

Further, it alleges that \"[a]s part of the Exit Guide program, the volunteers sometimes sit at a person's bedside at the time of her or his death in the belief that few people wish to die alone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to Plaintiff Grossman, the Second Amended Complaint states that she is a volunteer Exit Guide and that \"FEN will probably contact Grossman about whether to accept an Exit Guide assignment in Minnesota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17.) It does not indicate what specifically Grossman would do to assist a suicide in the event she accepts an assignment in Minnesota. As to Plaintiff Schindler, the Second Amended Complaint is a bit more specific, stating that Schindler is a volunteer Exit Guide and \"has at least one ongoing relationship with an Exit Guide client in Minnesota and plans to continue to serve this person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19.) \"She intends not to provide physical assistance or the means to the person in Minnesota, but she does intend to give information in violation of the Statute when the person is ready. Schindler is considering whether to arrange for this person to travel to her home in North Carolina in order to provide counseling without running the risk of prosecution under the Minnesota Statute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.)

Fossum contends that the claims are not ripe because the Plaintiffs have not been threatened with prosecution for violating the statute. Yet, as set forth above, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that Fossum and Backstrom have prosecuted violations of the challenged statute in the past. (2d Am. Compl., \u00b6 7.) Neither Fossum nor Backstrom dispute that their counties plan to enforce the statute, or that such enforcement would cause injury to FEN. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    281 Care Committee I\n   </em>\n   , the alleged injury is not based solely on speculation about a particular future prosecution. \"Rather, the injury is speech that has already been chilled and speech that will be chilled ... because of the very existence of\" the Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.215\">\n    Minn.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl., \u00b6 13 (\"FEN is therefore threatened with prosecution ever time its volunteers talk with anyone in Minnesota about legal methods of inducing their own death\").)
