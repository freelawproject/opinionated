Shea, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this class action, Medicare beneficiaries seek to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to afford them a hearing to challenge a critical decision made by others when they are hospitalized-whether to admit them as inpatients or whether to place them on \"observation status.\" That decision does not always affect the types of medical services they receive at the hospital, but it can have an enormous impact on their pocketbooks. If they are discharged from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), Medicare will cover their stay only if they spent at least three consecutive days as a hospital inpatient. The named Plaintiffs in this class action spent multiple days in the hospital and were discharged to SNFs, but were designated as outpatients receiving observation services for some or all of their hospital stays. As a result, they were forced to pay for their SNF care out of pocket. The Plaintiffs brought this action against the Secretary on their own behalf and on behalf of all beneficiaries placed on observation status, claiming that his failure to afford any hearing or other administrative review of the decision to deny them inpatient status violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The history of this case is protracted, and I summarize some of it below. Now before me are the Secretary's (1) second motion for summary judgment; (2) motion for class decertification; and (3) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For reasons I will explain, the motions are\n   DENIED. After almost eight years of litigation, this case will finally proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I assume familiarity with the allegations in the complaints, (ECF Nos. 1, 53, 123), my ruling on the parties' earlier cross motions for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Conn. 2017), ECF No. 242, and reconsideration of that ruling, (ECF No. 250). I summarize some of the procedural history below to provide context for my analysis of the present motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Dismissal and Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 3, 2011, seven Medicare beneficiaries or their estates filed a complaint challenging the Secretary's use of observation status. (ECF Nos. 1, 2.) They alleged violations of the Medicare Act, Administrative Procedure Act, and Due Process Clause. The Secretary moved to dismiss the complaint. (ECF No. 23.) Seven intervenor plaintiffs joined the case on April 9, 2012. (ECF No. 53.) On September 23, 2013, I granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' original complaint and first intervenor complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. With respect to their Due Process claims, I concluded that the Plaintiffs had not alleged facts sufficient to show that they had a protected property interest in being admitted as inpatients rather than placed on observation status. In particular, I determined that the Secretary, acting through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), left the decision to admit a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient to the medical judgment of treating physicians.\n   <em>\n    Bagnall v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205346659\">\n    2013 WL 5346659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Conn. Sept. 23, 2013). Concluding that CMS's Medicare Policy Manual did not mandate that a physician order admission, but instead left the decision to the doctor's discretion, I held that the Plaintiffs had failed to allege a property interest in being admitted as inpatients.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205346659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *21-*22. The Plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Second Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals held that, notwithstanding the discretionary language in the Medicare Policy Manual, the Plaintiffs had alleged facts suggesting that the decision to admit a patient to the hospital was \"made through rote application of 'commercially available screening tools,' as directed by [CMS], which substitute[d] for the medical judgment of treating physicians.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrows\n   </em>\n   , 777 F.3d at 114. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If plaintiffs can prove their allegation that CMS \"meaningfully channels\" the discretion of doctors by providing fixed or objective criteria for when patients should be admitted, then they could arguably show that qualifying Medicare beneficiaries have a protected property interest in being treated as \"inpatients.\" However, if the Secretary is correct and, in fact, admission decisions are vested in the medical judgment of treating physicians,\n   then Medicare beneficiaries would lack any such property interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Proceedings on Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On remand, as directed by the Court of Appeals, I ordered a period of discovery \"focused on ... whether [the P]laintiffs possessed a property interest in being admitted to their hospitals as 'inpatients' ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116 ; (ECF No. 120 at 1). Shortly after discovery began, Dorothy Goodman filed a motion to intervene. (ECF No. 121.) Her motion stated that she had been placed on observation status in 2014 under policies the Secretary had adopted after the case had been dismissed and while the appeal was pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The Secretary did not object, and I granted the motion on May 8, 2015 (ECF No. 122). Ms. Goodman filed the Second Intervenor Complaint three days later. (Second Intervenor Compl., ECF No. 123.) The Second Intervenor Complaint alleged that the Secretary had promulgated new regulations governing inpatient admissions in October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-42.) The regulations established the Two Midnight Rule, which allegedly created a new standard by which the Secretary would evaluate the propriety of inpatient admission orders for reimbursement under Medicare Part A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) The Second Intervenor Complaint also alleged that the Secretary's evaluation under the Two Midnight Rule was, in practice, guided by commercial screening tools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the initial period of discovery closed, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment addressing whether the Plaintiffs had a protected property interest in being admitted as inpatients. (ECF Nos. 160, 164.) The Secretary also moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' complaints, arguing that the Plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to support an inference of state action or to show that they were entitled to additional procedural protections. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 160-1 at 27-33.) I held oral argument on the motions, at which I raised concerns about standing and mootness in light of the fact that several Plaintiffs had passed away or had been reimbursed for their hospitalizations under Medicare Part A after pursuing administrative appeals. I directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing those concerns. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 189, 190.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 8, 2017, I denied both parties' motions for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part the Secretary's motion to dismiss. First, I found that all named Plaintiffs had standing, and their claims were not moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Cochran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n    2017 WL 522944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. 8, 2017) Second, I found that neither party was entitled to summary judgment because there were material disputes of fact about (1) the extent to which inpatient admission decisions were dictated by the application of commercial screening tools and (2) the extent to which the Secretary directed hospitals to use those screening tools in making admission decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *10-*14. Third, I held that the Plaintiffs' complaints \"plausibly alleged that the inpatient admission decision is the result of 'significant encouragement' from the Secretary, through CMS,\" and denied the Secretary's motion to dismiss on state action grounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *15-*16. Fourth, I found that the NOTICE Act, which required hospitals to provide written and oral notice to patients receiving observation services for more than 24 hours, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc(a)(1)(Y), had rendered moot the Plaintiffs' claim seeking expedited notice about their observation status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *17-*18. Finally, I held that the Plaintiffs had adequately alleged a deprivation of Due Process by pleading that \"there are\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   administrative review procedures for Medicare beneficiaries\n   who seek to challenge their placement on observation status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 28, 2017, I held a telephonic status conference to discuss scheduling for the remainder of the case. On the call, both parties agreed that they were not seeking additional discovery in connection with class certification, and the record was sufficient to allow me to decide whether a class should be certified. (Transcript of Conf., ECF No. 251 at 12:23-13:10.) Three days later, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and appointment of class counsel. (ECF No. 203.) The Secretary opposed the motion. (ECF No. 213.) After oral argument and supplemental briefing, I granted the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418349\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/313/\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. 2017). After making two technical adjustments at the Plaintiffs' request, I certified the following class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   All Medicare beneficiaries who, on or after January 1, 2009: (1) have received or will have received \"observation services\" as an outpatient during a hospitalization; and (2) have received or will have received an initial determination or Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice (MOON) indicating that the observation services are covered (or subject to coverage) under Medicare Part B. Medicare beneficiaries who meet the requirements of the foregoing sentence but who pursued an administrative appeal and received a final decision of the Secretary before September 4, 2011, are excluded from this definition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (ECF No. 250.) Discovery then proceeded, as required by the Second Circuit, \"on the other two prongs of the due process analysis-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 'state action' and 'due process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barrows\n   </em>\n   , 777 F.3d at 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Pending Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Discovery closed on June 15, 2018. The Secretary filed a letter notifying the Court of his intention to file a second motion for summary judgment addressing (1) whether the Plaintiffs could establish the existence of a property interest for individuals hospitalized after 2015; and (2) whether the Plaintiffs could adduce evidence of a risk of erroneous deprivation under\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). (ECF No. 305 at 1-3.) The Secretary also provided notice of his intent to file a motion to decertify the class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I held a telephonic status conference to discuss the potential filings. On the call and in a subsequent order, I declined to allow the Secretary to file a motion for summary judgment on the existence of a property interest. I explained that the issue had been decided in my previous ruling and that the Secretary had not moved for reconsideration of that decision. (ECF No. 311.) I also discouraged the Secretary from filing a motion to decertify the class as I did not think that such a motion would further the interest of judicial economy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, I encouraged the Secretary to confine any motion for summary judgment \"to the second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, 'the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [the private interest] through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.' \" (ECF No. 311 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Secretary filed a second motion for summary judgment on July 30, 2018, and a motion for class decertification on August 24, 2018. (ECF Nos. 319, 323.) I held oral argument on the motions on November 26, 2018. At the argument, it became clear that the Plaintiffs intended to rely primarily on the Two Midnight Rule, rather than the use of commercial screening tools, as the basis of a property interest in inpatient admission for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized after October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Transcr., ECF No. 363 at 67:11-14 (Plaintiffs' counsel: \"I see the classes divided into 2009 up to the point where the Two Midnight Rule was introduced in 2013. So Two Midnight Rule [as the basis of a property interest] for 2013 forward, and commercial screening tools for the period before that.\").) Because neither this Court nor the Second Circuit had addressed whether the Two Midnight Rule provided the type of fixed or objective criteria that could create a property interest, I permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the Plaintiffs' theory based on the Two Midnight Rule. (ECF No. 361.) The Secretary also filed a motion to dismiss the complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (ECF No. 370.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To summarize, pending before me are (1) the Secretary's second motion for summary judgment, with supplemental briefing (ECF Nos. 319, 368); (2) the Secretary's motion for class decertification (ECF No. 323); and (3) the Secretary's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 370).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(56(a)1 Stmt. \u00b6 7; 56(a)2 Stmt. at 5-6.) The Plaintiffs assert that the 60-day period begins upon discharge from the hospital\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   from SNF care, whichever is later. (56(a)(2) Stmt. at 6 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(a) ).) In 2018, the Part A inpatient deductible was $ 1,340.

(56(a)(1) Stmt. \u00b6 8; 56(a)2 Stmt. at 6.) The Plaintiffs assert that beneficiaries also had to pay the cost of any self-administered drugs. (56(a)2 Stmt. at 6 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(c) ).) On January 1, 2016, CMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   established a new, pre-set bundled rate for all covered observation services provided during a hospitalization lasting at least 8 hours. (56(a)1 Stmt. \u00b6 11; 56(a)2 Stmt. at 7.) Thus, beneficiaries placed on observation status are now required to pay a co-pay equal to 20% of the bundled rate. (56(a)1 Stmt. \u00b6 12; 56(a)2 Stmt. at 7-8.) In 2018, the 20% co-payment for observation services under Part B ($ 469.93) was less than the deductible for inpatient hospitalizations under Part A ($ 1,340.00).

For example, beneficiaries may be responsible for the cost of self-administered drugs and any services that are not included in the pre-determined bundle of observation services. (56(a)2 Stmt. at 7-8 (citing Medicare Claims Processing Manual Ch. 4 \u00a7\u00a7 290.2.2, 290.5.3, ECF No. 334-12 at 3-4, 5-7).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   When a patient is discharged from the hospital, he or she may require additional care at a skilled nursing facility (\"SNF\").

Specifically, the Second Circuit stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [D]rawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, these allegations show that the Secretary-acting through CMS-has effectively established fixed and objective criteria for when to admit Medicare beneficiaries as \"inpatients,\" and that,\n   <em>\n    notwithstanding the Medicare Policy Manual's guidance\n   </em>\n   , hospitals apply these criteria when making admissions decisions, rather than relying on the judgment of their treating physicians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    However, if the Secretary is correct and, in fact, admission decisions are vested in the medical judgment of treating physicians, then Medicare beneficiaries would lack any such property interest.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   On remand, the District Court is directed to supervise a limited period of discovery ... focused on the sole issue of whether plaintiffs possessed a property interest in being admitted to their hospitals as \"inpatients,\" which, as stated above, turns on a factual determination-\n   <em>\n    namely, whether the decision to admit these patients to these hospitals was a \"complex medical judgment\" left to the treating physicians' discretion, or whether, in practice, the decision was made by applying fixed criteria set by the federal government.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Barrows\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985641\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/106/#p113\">\n    777 F.3d at 114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). Although the \"complex medical judgment\" language quoted in the ruling comes from the pre-Two Midnight Rule version of the Medicare Policy Manual in effect at the time, it remains in the current version of the Manual describing the Two Midnight Rule and is at least arguably implicit in the regulation embodying the Rule.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Medicare Policy Manual, Ch. 1, Sec. 10 (pre-Two Midnight Rule: \"Physicians should use a 24-hour period as a benchmark, i.e., they should order admission for patients who are expected to need hospital care for 24 hours or more ....

First, although the language of the Two Midnight Rule is similar to the then-effective language of the Medicare Policy Manual quoted by the Second Circuit, it is not identical, and the Second Circuit's opinion thus does not dictate my analysis of the Two Midnight Rule. Indeed, the Second Circuit's actual holding was simply that the facts alleged in the original and intervenor complaints concerning the use of commercial screening tools were sufficient to state a plausible claim for deprivation of a property interest. Second, and more importantly, the Second Circuit's opinion teaches that for purposes of deciding whether there is a property interest, the legal language surrounding a decision is not dispositive if there is evidence that\n   the decision is actually made in a different manner.\n   <em>\n    Barrows\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985641\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/106/#p113\">\n    777 F.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]hese allegations show that the Secretary-acting through CMS-has effectively established fixed and objective criteria for when to admit Medicare beneficiaries as 'inpatients,' and that, notwithstanding the Medicare Policy Manual's guidance, hospitals apply these criteria when making admissions decisions, rather than relying on the judgment of their treating physicians.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

The Rule does not use the word \"shall,\" it relies on a physician's \"expectation,\" it describes what that expectation \"should\" be based on, and it delineates circumstances in which inpatient admission is \"generally appropriate.\" But I need not resolve that debate-as I explain below, the Plaintiffs have submitted evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that,\n   <em>\n    in practice\n   </em>\n   , the Two Midnight Rule is less discretionary than its language might suggest and does in fact create a legitimate claim of entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Evidence in the Record Shows that CMS \"Meaningfully Channels\" Hospital and Physician Discretion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There is a genuine dispute of fact about the extent to which the Two Midnight Rule cabins physician discretion and dictates inpatient admission decisions. The Plaintiffs have adduced evidence that applying the Rule is \"a billing decision divorced from physician judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sheehy Decl., ECF No. 334-70 \u00b6 7; Sheehy Report, ECF No. 334-71 at 11-13.) The Plaintiffs have also submitted evidence of CMS guidance suggesting that the Two Midnight Rule is to be applied in a rigid, formulaic manner. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ctrs. for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Servs.,\n   <em>\n    Reviewing Short Stay Hospital Claims for Patient Status: Admission On or After January 1, 2016\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 31, 2015), ECF No. 334-1 at 4-7 (providing step-by-step guidance on when an inpatient admission is appropriate and therefore payable under Medicare Part A).) CMS has developed a \"2 Midnight Claim Review Guideline\" for QIOs reviewing hospitals' inpatient claims, which consists of an \"algorithm\" or decision tree based on the Two Midnight Rule. (HCQIS Memorandum: Task 13 Short Stay Reviews, ECF No. 331-2 at 5.) According to the algorithm, if a patient is hospitalized\n   for a period crossing two midnights following a \"valid inpatient order,\" then QIOs will approve the claim for reimbursement under Part A without further inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If the hospitalization does not cross two midnights, or if it does but there is no inpatient admission order, and there is no evidence of an \"unforeseen circumstance\" like death or transfer, QIOs will assess whether it was reasonable for the admitting physician to have expected that the patient would receive medically-necessary services for more than two midnights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The algorithm also directs QIOs to approve inpatient claims in special cases where the hospitalization did not cross two midnights but satisfied one of the exceptions to the rule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each step in the decision tree poses a \"yes\" or \"no\" question followed by an arrow pointing to one of two boxes depending on the answer: (1) \"claim is payable under Part A\" or (2) \"claim is not payable under Part A.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But there is no branch on that tree suggesting that a patient satisfying the criteria in the Two Midnight Rule should not have been treated as an inpatient. As in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213709\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/369/\">\n    482 U.S. 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213709\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/369/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , then, once the criteria included in the guidance prescribed by the Secretary for the review of inpatient claims are deemed satisfied, a determination of Part A coverage is required. The formulaic, step-by-step character of this decision tree suggests that the decision as to inpatient admission is not discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, in conducting the medical necessity review, QIOs rely on commercially available screening tools. (Ctrs. for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Servs., BFCC-NCC Questions and Answers Form, ECF No. 331-4 at 11-12 (\"The BFCC-QIO may use evidence-based commercial screening criteria for the medical necessity review of the selected claims. One example would be the use of InterQual\u00a9, a nationally recognized commercial screening tool, to determine medical necessity.\").) As indicated in my earlier summary judgment ruling, \"commercial screening tools ... analyze patient status using an algorithm that processes objective information from the medical record.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Cochran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n    2017 WL 522944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   All this evidence would allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude that a physician's decision to admit a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient (and therefore to submit a claim for payment under Medicare Part A) or to place the patient on observation status (and to submit a claim for payment under Medicare Part B) is meaningfully constrained by fixed criteria used by the Secretary and his agents to implement the Two Midnight Rule. Indeed, it would allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that meeting the two-midnight threshold guarantees that a Medicare beneficiary's hospitalization will be covered under Part A notwithstanding the ostensibly discretionary language in the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   CMS has also communicated that inpatient hospitalizations will\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   be covered under Part A where the hospitalization crossed two midnights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Short Stay Review Guidance\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 334-1 at 1 (\"[I]npatient hospital claims with lengths of stay greater than 2 midnights after the formal admission following the order are\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   to be appropriate for Medicare Part A payment.\") (emphasis added).) If a patient is initially placed on observation status, CMS has advised that physicians should enter an order admitting the patient once it becomes clear that he or she will remain in the hospital through a second midnight.\n   <em>\n    Medicare Program Fiscal Year 2014 Payment Policies Related to Patient Status\n   </em>\n   , 78 FR 50496, 50946 (Aug. 19, 2013) (\"[T]he decision to admit becomes easier as the time approaches the second midnight, and beneficiaries in medically\n   necessary hospitalizations should not pass a second midnight prior to the admission order being written.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, there is evidence in the record suggesting that (1) CMS has taken steps to ensure that hospitals implement the Two Midnight Rule in accordance with its instructions, and (2) hospitals consequently treat the Rule as non-discretionary. The Secretary requires hospitals participating in Medicare to develop a utilization review (\"UR\") plan to ensure compliance with Medicare regulations, and specifically requires hospitals to review inpatient admission orders.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20482.30\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 482.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(i) (2019). Hospitals that fail the apply the Two Midnight Rule consistently with CMS guidance have their claims for reimbursement denied and may be subject to referral for RAC audits. (Supp. 56(a)(1) \u00b6 11; Supp. 56(a)(2) at 5.) The Plaintiffs have pointed to evidence that hospitals have adopted standards for inpatient admission, at least for Medicare patients, that treat the two-midnight threshold as dispositive. For example, the Rule 30(b)(6) deponent for Mercy Hospital, where one named plaintiff was treated, testified that nurses reviewing patient records\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   end their analysis (and presumably approve the claim for submission to CMS for payment) for any patient with an inpatient order who has been hospitalized for a period spanning two midnights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 331-28 at 8:6-8:18, 18:22-19:6 (\"Q: So I'm trying to summarize based on your answer and the chart. If a patient covered by this flow chart has an inpatient order and two midnights have passed since arrival, is the review complete? A: Yes Q: And is that in accordance with a Medicare rule? ... A: Yes.\").) If the patient has not yet passed a second midnight, the file is flagged for further monitoring and the patient may be changed to observation status unless the patient reaches the threshold or other documentation supports the inpatient admission order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Similarly, the Plaintiffs have produced the \"Guidelines for Utilization Review of Medical Admissions\" at Abington-Jefferson Hospital. (ECF No. 373-9 at 2.) The Guidelines suggest that patients are admitted as inpatients if a physician expects their hospitalization to cross two midnights regardless of whether the patient satisfies the hospital's other \"nationally recognized\" criteria for admission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20482.30\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that the \"failure to meet inpatient level of care [based on nationally accepted criteria] can be offset by a physician's reasonable expectation that the patient will require two medically necessary inpatient midnights of care.\").) Thus, although the Two Midnight Rule itself states that inpatient admission is \"generally appropriate\" when the physician expects the patient to require a two-night stay in the hospital, Abington-Jefferson hospital apparently treats that circumstance as a guarantee of admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, based on the foregoing evidence, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the Two Midnight Rule, as applied by CMS and hospitals, effectively mandates inpatient admission for Medicare beneficiaries who meet the standards it establishes, and thus that he Plaintiffs have a protected property interest in being admitted as inpatients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B. How Much Process Is Due?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The next question is how much process is due before the Plaintiffs may be deprived of their property interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    424 U.S. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This Court consistently has held that some form of hearing is required before an individual is finally deprived of a property interest.\").

But I find that these issues cannot be resolved on summary judgment. There is evidence in the record that would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there is at least some risk that Medicare beneficiaries have been, and will be, erroneously designated as outpatients rather than inpatients and thus wrongly deprived of benefits under Medicare Part A. There is also evidence both that the private interest at stake is weighty and that the Government would incur significant costs if ordered to put in place a review mechanism; and I conclude that I cannot conduct the balancing of those conflicting interests without a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Systemic Evidence Regarding Decisionmaking Bias and the Value of Procedural Safeguards\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Plaintiffs have adduced evidence suggesting that CMS's review process pressures hospitals to place patients on observation status rather than admitting them as inpatients. Hospital claims for inpatient reimbursement under Medicare Part A are subject to review by QIOs, while claims for outpatient reimbursement are not.

[A:] Not that I'm aware of.\").) If a QIO identifies a hospital that consistently fails to apply the Two Midnight Rule appropriately, that hospital may be referred to a RAC for more intensive scrutiny. (Supp. 56(a)(1) \u00b6 11; Supp. 56(a)(2) at 5.) In fiscal year 2014, RACs \"recouped\" from hospitals $ 1.2 billion in improper inpatient claims.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Hospitals can avoid these additional layers of review, then, by classifying close cases as outpatients receiving observation services. The Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Ann Sheehy, opines that CMS thus exerts \"significant pressure\" on hospitals to classify patients as observation rather than inpatients.

However, as our earlier discussion of the government nexus indicated, there are serious factual questions about the effects of governmental regulations and directives on the medical judgments of URCs. If the appellants' allegations on these matters are borne out, then we think the case would be sufficiently different from\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   to require different, additional safeguards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Kraemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670137\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/214/#p222\">\n    737 F.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Plaintiffs have also adduced evidence that would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that additional procedural safeguards would help to identify and correct any errors that occur. If a RAC or QIO denies a hospital's claim for inpatient reimbursement because the claim does not meet CMS's standards under Part A, the hospital has a statutory right to appeal the denial through multiple layers of administrative and judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

The Plaintiffs' expert cites sources suggesting that hospitals are successful in up to 62% of appeals. (Sheehy Decl., ECF No. 334-70 \u00b6 16.) The core issue in a hospital's appeal is whether it was appropriate for the hospital to admit a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient-the same issue the Plaintiffs propose to litigate in the hearing they seek. The substantial rate of success in provider appeals suggests, at the very least, that the question is amenable to reconsideration upon further review. A reasonable factfinder could therefore conclude that additional procedures would be valuable in preventing or remedying erroneous deprivations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   b. Evidence of Potential Erroneous Deprivations under the Two Midnight Rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Although the Plaintiffs need only show a \"risk\" of an erroneous deprivation, here they have also produced evidence supporting an inference that Medicare beneficiaries have actually been erroneously designated as outpatients under the Two Midnight Rule. For example, one Medicare beneficiary testified that he was hospitalized with a shoulder injury after he fell on December 31, 2015. (Kanefsky Dep., ECF No. 334-54 at 7.) He was discharged to SNF on January 5, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Thus, his hospitalization crossed at least five midnights. Upon his discharge from SNF, he received a bill for the SNF services, indicating that Medicare would not cover his stay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) He contacted the hospital and was told that \"the powers that be\" had placed him on observation status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) He testified that his treating physician appeared \"aghast\" upon learning that his inpatient order had been overridden. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2070298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Plaintiffs have also produced the medical records of a Medicare beneficiary who was admitted to the hospital as an inpatient on April 13, 2017 at 6:48 PM. (Niemi Med. Record, ECF No. 334-57 at 14.) A physician entered an order the same day that stated \"ADMIT TO INPATIENT\" and indicated that her expected length of stay was \"Past Midnight tomorrow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At 3:30 PM the next day, a case manager entered the following note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The Utilization Review Committee Physician Advisor recommends changing\n   this patient from inpatient to observation based on the Committee's findings that this patient does not require an inpatient level of care. Refer to history and physical, progress notes, and discharge summary as appropriate to review care provided to the patient. Co-Signature of the attending physician indicates concurrence with this recommendation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) As a result, she was placed on observation status. A different physician later entered an order re-admitting her as an inpatient on April 24, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) That order was again reversed the next day, with an identical note describing the recommendation of the Utilization Review Committee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) The record suggests that the patient's treating physician believed she required SNF placement, but the patient could not afford SNF care out of pocket and Medicare would not cover SNF care because she had not \"met 3 midnight 'Inpatient status' criteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) She remained hospitalized on observation status until May 22, 2017-a total of 39 midnights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   If either of these individuals had a right to appeal, they likely could have met the requirements of the Two Midnight Rule unless the care they received was not medically necessary. In each case, there is evidence that a physician had entered an order indicating that the beneficiary should be admitted as an inpatient and noting an expectation that the beneficiary's hospital stay would cross two midnights. (ECF No. 334-54 at 15; ECF No. 334-57 at 14.) In each case, the beneficiary's stay actually did cross two midnights. (ECF No. 334-54 at 7, 14; ECF No. 334-57 at 14-15.) Yet in each case, the beneficiary was ultimately placed on observation status. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the record would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there is a non-trivial risk that some Medicare beneficiaries have been, and will be, deprived of coverage for hospital services and SNF care under Medicare Part A despite meeting the requirements of the Two Midnight Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   c. Evidence of Potential Erroneous Deprivation under Commercial Screening Tools\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Secretary next contends that he is entitled to summary judgment because the pre-October 2013 Plaintiffs cannot identify the criteria in the commercial screening tools on which their property interest is founded, and therefore cannot demonstrate that additional procedures would reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation. Even without knowing those criteria, however, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that there is some risk of an erroneous deprivation, and that some administrative review would reduce that risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs\n   have adduced evidence that commercial screening tools utilize information extracted from a patient's medical record. (Charlberg Dep., ECF No. 334-47 at 4 (Question: \"So how would you use Milliman to do the review?\" Answer: \"We would access the guidelines and look for the specific context of that presentation - that admission - that observation presentation.\" Question: \"So would you have to read the patient's medical record and then take information from it and put it into the software?\" Answer: \"Yes.\"); Mulcahy ALJ Hearing, ECF No. 334-64 at 14 (explaining that a patient diagnosed with a urinary tract infection would not qualify for inpatient treatment under InterQual criteria because \"InterQual only recognizes a systemic or an organ infection\"); Duvall Dep., ECF No. 334-16 at 7-8 (explaining factors included in InterQual guidelines).) There is also evidence suggesting that medical records may be incomplete or inaccurate, or that staff screening the records may overlook details that could alter the patient's status. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Vedere Dep., ECF No. 334-51 at 5 (Question: \"At Saint Raphael have you ever disagreed with recommendations from utilization review?\" Answer: \"I have called a couple of times.

(ECF No. 311.) Nevertheless, the Secretary addressed all three factors in his brief in support of his motion for summary judgment.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sheehy Decl., ECF No. 334-70 \u00b6 18 (noting that the \"estimated out-of-pocket cost for SNF care after a non-qualifying hospitalization is $ 10,503\") );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670137\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/214/#p222\">\n    737 F.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In applying the balancing test, the private interest at stake should be weighed more heavily than in\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   because of the astronomical nature of medical costs.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, although the Secretary has pointed to evidence that the Government would incur costs and additional claims-processing delays if required to afford the type of administrative hearing the Plaintiffs seek, his evidence on this point is somewhat general. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 56(a)(1) Stmt. \u00b6 30 (\"If any new workload is prioritized (because it involves appeals by beneficiaries), it would divert resources away from existing categories of pending appeals, many of which have been awaiting adjudication for years.\") In any event, these costs will ultimately have to be balanced against what appears to be a weighty private interest.

In light of the record now before me, it is apparent that not all members of the class have standing under Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Secretary has provided evidence that, on average, Medicare beneficiaries placed on observation status face lower out-of-pocket costs per hospitalization than those admitted as inpatients. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blaugh Decl., ECF No. 323-10 \u00b6 35.) Further, beginning in 2016, Medicare altered co-payments for beneficiaries receiving observation services under Medicare Part B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part I.B. Because of these regulatory changes, the baseline out-of-pocket cost for a Medicare beneficiary with both Part A and Part B coverage is lower if he is placed on observation status while in the hospital than if he is admitted as an inpatient. In 2018, for example, an individual admitted as an inpatient under Medicare Part A would be required to pay a deductible of $ 1,340.00 while a beneficiary treated as an outpatient receiving observation services would be subject to a co-pay of $ 469.93 plus the cost of self-administered medication expenses. (Baugh Decl., ECF No. 319-18 \u00b6 36.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The existing class therefore includes beneficiaries who not only lack any financial injury, but who would incur additional costs if they were instead admitted as inpatients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   These standing issues are better addressed by redefining the class than by decertifying it entirely.

The Plaintiffs have identified two groups of Medicare beneficiaries for whom placement on observation status\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   causes injury, and the class can be narrowed to encompass only those groups.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1939022\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/729/96/#p107\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Indeed, it is an extreme step to dismiss a suit simply by decertifying a class, where a potentially proper class exists and can easily be created.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). First, beneficiaries who are hospitalized for three or more consecutive days, but admitted as inpatients for fewer than three consecutive days, are not eligible for SNF care under Medicare Part A. When these beneficiaries require SNF care, they must cover the costs out of pocket. All of the named Plaintiffs fall within this group (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1, 53, 123; 56(a)(2) Stmt. at 36-37 (summarizing the experience of Martha Leyanna) ), as do two of the class members whose experiences the Plaintiffs summarized in their opposition to summary judgment. (56(a)(2) Stmt. at 33-36 (summarizing the experiences of Ervin Kanefsky, Nancy Niemi).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second, approximately 6% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in coverage under Part A but not Part B. (56(a)(2) Stmt. at 9 (citing AARP Public Pol'y Inst.,\n   <em>\n    Fact Sheet: The Medicare Population\n   </em>\n   at 1 (2009), https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/health/fs149_medicare.pdf).) These individuals are financially responsible for the full cost of their hospitalization if they are placed on observation status. For example, the Plaintiffs have identified one class member who chose not to enroll in Part B coverage because he could not afford the additional monthly payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roney Dep., ECF No. 334-66 at 13 (Question: \"Is there any reason why you have decided not to enroll in the past for Part B?\" Answer: \"I wasn't really sure that I could afford the monthly payments.....\").) He was hospitalized on September 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) During his hospitalization, he believed that he had been admitted as an inpatient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) At some point during his hospitalization, though, he was placed on observation status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). Because he was not covered under Part B, he was billed for the full cost of his hospitalization-$ 3,500. Such an individual plainly has suffered an injury in fact from his placement on observation status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   I acknowledge that narrowing the class to include only these two groups fails to cover some individuals who might suffer a financial injury because of their placement on observation status. For example, this definition does not include individuals\n   covered under both Part A and Part B who incur greater expenses while on observation status because the services they received were not included under the bundled observation rate. The definition also fails to include individuals who face additional costs because they are placed on observation status and re-hospitalized within 60 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   I nonetheless decline to expand the class to cover these two groups. According to a study cited by the Plaintiffs, only about 1 in 4 observation patients who are re-hospitalized face cumulative costs greater than the standard inpatient deductible, even across both stays. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   56(a)(2) Stmt. at 10-11 (citing Shreya Kangovi et al.,\n   <em>\n    Patient Financial Responsibility for Observation Care\n   </em>\n   , 10 J.

This is not a showing these individuals could make, at least unless and until they had stayed at the hospital for three nights. I am not aware of evidence about any class member who experienced either of these situations, and any such persons could only be identified retrospectively by reference to the amount they were ultimately billed after discharge. Because such persons would not have standing by virtue of their initial designation as \"observation status,\" they cannot be included in a class that seeks prospective relief in the form of a hearing to contest that designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Commonality, Typicality, and Appropriate Class-Wide Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Secretary next argues that the Plaintiffs cannot bear their burden of demonstrating commonality and typicality because the evidence in the record suggests that their claims are not susceptible to class-wide proof. He also argues that no single injunction could provide relief for the whole class. In support of these assertions, he points to testimony by physicians demonstrating heterogeneity in the way that hospitals approach inpatient admission versus observation status. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 323-1 at 6-15 (summarizing the views of Dr. Christopher Baugh, ECF No. 323-10; Dr. Christopher Steevens, ECF No. 323-3; Dr. Harvey Lee, ECF No. 323-4; Dr. Cheryl Laffer, ECF No. 323-5; Dr. Ann Sheehy, ECF No. 323-2; utilization review nurse Cathi Charlberg, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   No. 323-7; and Dr. Swarupa Reddy, ECF No. 323-8).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   This evidence of varying practices, however, pales next to the solid core of common factual and legal questions that cut across the class as a whole.

Conn. 2017). The same is true of the other legal questions considered in today's summary judgment ruling: If there is a property interest, does the absence of any review of the inpatient decision create a risk of erroneous deprivation? What is the private interest at stake for those who must pay for SNF care out of pocket and for those without Part B coverage? What is the burden to the Government of creating a hearing procedure? I have already held that there are material disputes of fact about all of these questions. The Secretary's evidence about the diversity of hospital and physician approaches will likely be relevant at trial on the question of whether there is state action, but it does not warrant decertification at this late stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Secretary's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores v.

Regardless of the circumstances surrounding the decision to place each class member on observation status, all class members described in the modified class definition below have a strong interest that is affected by the inpatient/observation decision and yet lack formal procedural recourse to challenge that decision.

Medicare beneficiaries who meet the requirements of the foregoing sentence but who pursued an administrative appeal and received a final decision of the Secretary before September 4, 2011, are excluded from this definition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   More modifications may be necessary. Specifically, in light of my ruling today on summary judgment, it appears that it may be necessary to subdivide the current class. As currently defined, the class comprises two arguably-distinct groups: (1) Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized before October 2013 who assert a property interest based on the use of commercial screening tools; and (2) Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized after October 2013 who assert a property interest under the Two Midnight Rule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Transcr., ECF No. 363 at 67:11-14 (Plaintiffs' counsel: \"I see the classes divided into 2009 up to the point where the Two Midnight Rule was introduced in 2013. So Two Midnight Rule [as the basis of a property interest] for 2013 forward, and commercial screening tools for the period before that.\").) Although there are undoubtedly common questions of law and fact for both groups, their interests do not universally align. The administrative burden of providing a hearing for beneficiaries hospitalized before 2013 would be significantly lower given that the group could only include beneficiaries hospitalized during a four-year period. In contrast, nearly six years have elapsed since the Two Midnight Rule was promulgated, and the post-October 2013 group is open-ended-it includes individuals who will be hospitalized under the Rule in the future. Although a single injunction could potentially redress the procedural deprivation and financial injuries suffered by both groups, each might have reason to seek a different form of hearing depending on the standard that applies. For example, I may determine that the nature of the property interest under commercial screening tools warrants only a brief review of the patient's record. In contrast, a hearing under the Two Midnight Rule could be more involved as the standard arguably requires more expert input. Further, the groups may rely on different facts to demonstrate that CMS implemented the relevant standards in a way that dictated hospitals' inpatient admission decisions, and the determination whether there is a property interest at all may be different for the two groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   If the differences noted above create \"a fundamental conflict among class members,\" I would be required to divide the class into subclasses and appoint separate counsel for each.\n   <em>\n    Charron v.

Action Fairly Traceable to the Secretary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Secretary first argues that the Plaintiffs' injures are not \"fairly traceable\" to him because inpatient admission decisions are made by hospitals and physicians. I disagree for two reasons. First, the complaints in this case \"plausibly alleged that the inpatient admission decision is the result of 'significant encouragement' from the Secretary, through CMS.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Cochran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n    2017 WL 522944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. In other words, the Plaintiffs alleged that hospitals and physicians making inpatient admission decisions for Medicare beneficiaries are state actors within the Secretary's control. Further, the summary judgment record shows that here are disputes of fact about the extent to which those allegations are true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20522944\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *12-*14 ; Summary Judgment Ruling,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part III.A.2. The Plaintiffs have therefore made a sufficient showing at this stage that the injuries of class members are fairly traceable to the Secretary. Second, the Secretary ignores the procedural component of the Plaintiffs' claims. The Plaintiffs do not assert that the Secretary is liable because he deprived them of their right to be admitted as inpatients; rather, he is liable because they face a risk that they will be erroneously deprived of that interest without due process. The lack of nation-wide administrative review is attributable to the Secretary through CMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Redressability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Secretary asserts that the Plaintiffs' injures are not redressable through an injunction in this case because beneficiaries may receive Part A benefits only if they are formally admitted as inpatients, and he lacks the authority to require hospitals to admit patients. Even if I accepted the premise that the Secretary lacks such authority and otherwise has no authority to reimburse beneficiaries under Part A who have mistakenly been denied hospital admission as inpatients, the Secretary's conclusion does not follow. The redressability prong of the standing analysis is relaxed in the case of a procedural deprivation. \"When a litigant is vested with a procedural right, that litigant has standing if there is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the injury-causing party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.\"\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

The Plaintiffs have raised a genuine dispute of fact about whether they meet that lower bar. Under current regulations, if CMS or its contractors determine that a hospital's claim for reimbursement is improper under Part A, the claim is denied; however, the hospital is permitted to resubmit the claim for reimbursement under Part B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Ruling No. CMS-1455-R (Mar. 13, 2013). One possible remedy, then, would be to require CMS to implement the opposite procedure: If a patient appealed his observation status and successfully established that he met the criteria for inpatient admission, CMS could inform the patient's hospital that any claim for outpatient reimbursement under Part B would be denied and an inpatient claim under Part A would be approved. Hospitals would have a choice between submitting a bill under Part A or foregoing reimbursement entirely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is at least \"some possibility\" that, under these circumstances,\n   hospitals and physicians would reconsider the decision to place a patient on observation status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In addition, recent regulatory developments have sapped the Secretary's redressability objection of some of its force. Until recently, the Two Midnight Rule required\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that the order of the physician admitting the beneficiary as an inpatient \"be furnished at or before the time of the inpatient admission,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.3\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2018),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that it be \"present in the medical record ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.3\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2017). And because it was \"longstanding Medicare policy to not permit retroactive [inpatient] orders,\"\n   <em>\n    Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Physician Certification and Recertification of Claims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041144\">\n    83 Fed.

Last year, however, the Secretary eliminated the requirement that the physician order be \"present in the medical record,\" thereby \"removing the requirement that written inpatient admission orders are a specific requirement for Medicare Part A payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   41507. As long as \"other available documentation, such as the physician certification statement when required, progress notes, or the medical record as a whole, supports that all the coverage criteria (including medical necessity) are met,\" payment under Medicare Part A will no longer be denied due to the absence of a physician order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41509 (\"It is our intention that this revised policy will properly adjust the focus of the medical review process towards determining whether an inpatient stay was medically reasonable and necessary and intended by the admitting physician rather than towards occasional inadvertent signature or documentation issues unrelated to the medical necessity of the inpatient stay or the intent of the physician.\") Thus, at least for those beneficiaries who can point to evidence in \"the medical record as a whole\" that a physician intended that they be admitted as inpatients-which, as discussed above, includes many of the named plaintiffs as well as class members Kanefsky and Niemi-there would be nothing preventing the Secretary from reinstating the physician's original intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   More broadly, however, the Secretary's redressability objection must yield to the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, assuming that they can prove that those rights have been violated. At trial, the Plaintiffs will have to establish that physicians and hospital URCs make inpatient admission decisions based on fixed criteria established by the Secretary. Thus, Plaintiffs will be required to prove that physicians and hospitals are effectively state actors for purposes of determining Medicare Part A benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kraemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670137\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/214/#p222\">\n    737 F.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the facts prove to be as appellant contends, the government's use of URC determinations may well provide the state action that was missing in\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   .\"). If the Plaintiffs carry that burden and prove the other elements of their Due Process claim, then the Secretary will not be able to avoid affording relief simply by pointing to regulatory limits on his own authority. More specifically, if the Secretary has effectively created a property interest and physicians/hospitals, as his agents, are depriving Medicare beneficiaries of that interest without a hearing, then he must not only afford a hearing, but also ensure that a beneficiary who prevails at such a hearing receives meaningful relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

As noted above, the baseline co-pay for a beneficiary placed on observation status is substantially lower than the Part A inpatient deductible. (Baugh Decl., ECF No. 319-18 \u00b6 36.) In other words, this group is currently likely to be smaller than 1 in 4 re-hospitalized observation patients.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    I will\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    consider further argument at this point on the merits of class certification in general or on the issues addressed in the summary judgment ruling, and the parties are not authorized to file further briefs on these issues. Nor will I consider argument that either of the two sub-groups I have identified should be excluded from the class definition or decertified. I have already considered lengthy briefs and oral arguments on these matters and have identified sufficient questions of material fact to warrant a trial for both of these groups.
