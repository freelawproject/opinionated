(Doc. 19). The facts of this case are not in dispute. Indeed, nearly the entire interaction was captured by a dashboard camera affixed to Trooper Johnson's patrol car and a microphone affixed to his uniform. The matter has been fully briefed, (Docs. 19, 20, 24, 35, 39), and is ripe for disposition. For the reasons that follow, the Motion shall be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Trooper Johnson has been a trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police since May 31, 2015 and at all relevant times was assigned to the Troop H Incident Reaction Team. Trooper Johnson describes the Incident Reaction Team as a \"proactive patrol unit focused on assisting local, state, or local task forces ... [with] crime patrol ... and local drug interdiction.\" (Doc. 30 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 10, 2018, Trooper Johnson was performing \"aggressive patrol functions\" in the Harrisburg area on Highway 81. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). At approximately 1:43 a.m., while parked in his unmarked patrol vehicle in the highway's median, Trooper Johnson noticed a silver Chevrolet sedan with Pennsylvania tags decrease its speed. This vehicle piqued Trooper Johnson's interest because, from his view, it seemed as if the driver was attempting to conceal his face as he drove by. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8). Trooper Johnson later identified the driver of that vehicle as Defendant Gary Bradley (\"Bradley\" or \"Defendant\"). Because Trooper Johnson was suspicious that Bradley may have been attempting to conceal his face because he was driving under the influence (\"DUI\"), he pulled out from his perch, and trailed behind Bradley's vehicle. Trooper Johnson observed the Chevrolet weave and bob within its lane and clocked the vehicle at 75 miles-per-hour in a 65 miles-per-hour zone using his own vehicle's speedometer. At that point, Trooper Johnson believed that he had probable cause to stop the vehicle because Bradley's \"driving behavior [was] potentially consistent with criminal activity.\" (Doc. 24-1). Accordingly, Trooper Johnson clicked on his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop. As soon\n   as Trooper Johnson did so, the dash camera affixed to his patrol vehicle began recording. The dash camera collected audio through a microphone affixed to Trooper Johnson's uniform and video through a front-facing camera affixed to his vehicle. This video was submitted by both the Government and the Defendant as exhibits at the suppression hearing held in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After pulling over to the side of the highway, Trooper Johnson approached the Chevrolet from the passenger side and observed Bradley sitting alone in the driver seat with several cell phones and cell-phone charging cords resting on the center console. Trooper Johnson noted that Bradley exhibited \"several apparent signs of overt nervousness.\" (Doc. 30 at 13). Specifically, Trooper Johnson noticed \"the tremoring of [Bradley's] voice\" and hands \"as he searched for his documents,\" that Bradley \"appeared to look around the cabin as if he didn't know exactly what to do,\" and that Bradley was exhibiting \"labored breathing that presented itself throughout the traffic stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). Trooper Johnson \"categorize[d] Mr. Bradley in the top five nervous people that [he had] ever dealt with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). At the suppression hearing, Bradley testified that his tremors are the result of a motorbike accident in 1988 and that Trooper Johnson neither asked him why his hands were shaking nor provided him with an opportunity to explain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On approach, Trooper Johnson introduced himself and asked Bradley for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. Bradley informed Trooper Johnson that his license was suspended and that the vehicle was a rental but nonetheless provided Trooper Johnson with a state-issued ID and a copy of the vehicle's rental agreement. Trooper Johnson explained to Bradley that he pulled him over because he was bouncing within his lane and was driving too fast. Bradley told Trooper Johnson that he did not realize that he was weaving within his lane because he had been arguing with someone on the phone. Trooper Johnson tried to calm Bradley down, telling him to \"take a deep breath.\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trooper Johnson then directed Bradley to accompany him to his patrol vehicle, stating \"[l]isten, I'm going to bring you back to my car, okay, we'll see if I can check how many times you've been cited and stuff like that and if I can cut you a break. Okay?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Trooper Johnson continued, \"just come on back to my car and we'll work it all out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Bradley acquiesced and exited his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Trooper Johnson, although the practice of requesting that a driver leave their own vehicle is uncommon, he believed that speaking to Bradley in his patrol car, rather than on the side of the road, furthered his goal of \"community[-]oriented policing\" and provided an \"opportunity to really explain to [Bradley] what we do and why we do it.\" (Doc. 30 at 15). Trooper Johnson averred that he learned this technique through interdiction classes offered by \"Dessert Snow, Triple I Solutions\" and \"the Shield Initiative through the Pennsylvania State Police.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Trooper Johnson explained at the suppression hearing that \"obtaining or having a driver step out of his comfort zone and in his vehicle and moving them to\n   [the patrol] vehicle allows [the officer] to establish a better baseline in differentiating between the innocent motoring public and individuals engaged in criminal activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Nonetheless, Trooper Johnson specified that he does not request the driver to exit the vehicle because he suspects contraband in the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). Trooper Johnson estimated that he makes such a request in approximately 75 to 80 percent of traffic stops. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). At Bradley's state-court preliminary hearing held on February 22, 2018, however, Trooper Johnson offered an alternative explanation for his request; Trooper Johnson testified that he invited Bradley to sit in his vehicle \"due to the temperature\" and that it was not \"appropriate to have him stand out in the cold.\" (Def. Exh. 104 at 9:00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Bradley exited his vehicle to accompany Trooper Johnson to his patrol car, Trooper Johnson asked Bradley for consent to pat him down for weapons. (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:46). Bradley agreed. Trooper Johnson conducted a frisk, which did not reveal anything of note. Bradley then entered the front passenger door of Trooper Johnson's patrol vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon entering, Trooper Johnson began a query of Bradley's driver's license, criminal history, and driver's history using his patrol car's mobile computer. Almost instantly, Trooper Johnson proceeded to ask Bradley a barrage of additional questions. Trooper Johnson inquired as to whom Bradley was arguing with on the phone, about his travel plans, about the address listed on the vehicle's rental agreement, and about details concerning his family's whereabouts. Trooper Johnson also asked Bradley about his criminal history, including whether he had ever been in trouble with the law for anything besides his license suspension. Bradley informed Trooper Johnson that he had been in trouble for guns in 1998 and that he was under federal supervision as he awaited the start of an incarceration term after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess heroin. Throughout the questioning-which spanned nearly ten minutes-Trooper Johnson pressed Bradley for details about his crimes and his sentence, for details about his mother and her whereabouts, his travel route, the renter of the vehicle, and the duration of the rental. Trooper Johnson also requested that Bradley provide him with contact information for the person listed on the rental agreement, which, according to Bradley, was his wife. (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:46-1:54). Bradley answered all of Trooper Johnson's often-repetitive questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At one point, Trooper Johnson noted that the last time Bradley had been cited for a driving-related offense was in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Trooper Johnson informed Bradley that he would \"cut him a break\" by issuing him \"a warning for the speed\" and that he would not cite him for \"bouncing over the line.\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:54). Nonetheless, Trooper Johnson testified at the suppression hearing that, \"[b]eing that I believed that criminal activity was afoot ... I wanted to confirm or dispel my suspicions at that point in time.\" (Doc. 30 at 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After explaining to Bradley that he would issue him only a warning, Trooper Johnson informed Bradley that his partner, Corporal Brian Hoye, had arrived. Corporal Hoye remained stationed directly outside of the front passenger side door-directly outside of where Bradley was sitting-and can be heard in the video announcing\n   himself by saying \"how you doing, sir?\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:55). Trooper Johnson explained to Bradley that he called Corporal Hoye to the scene because \"he does not like people up on his back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Trooper Johnson later testified at the suppression hearing that he requested backup because he intended to request Bradley's consent to search the vehicle and believed that a second unit was necessary to conduct that search. (Doc. 30 at 29). Trooper Johnson explained on cross-examination that \"I was going to see how we needed to proceed, whether it was going to be a consent search, probable cause, or requesting a K-9 to the scene.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54). Trooper Johnson also testified that, \"[a]t that point in time,\" Bradley was \"not free to leave,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Exh. 104 at 9:00), and that, in the event Bradley had not otherwise been arrested, Trooper Johnson would have impounded and inventory searched Bradley's vehicle as a result of Bradley's suspended license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Within moments of Corporal Hoye's arrival, Trooper Johnson leveled his tone of voice and asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Gary, no guns in the car today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   BRADLEY: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Any marijuana in the car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   BRADLEY: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Any large sums of U.S. currency?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   BRADLEY: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: You know what I mean?

(Doc. 30 at 30). According to Trooper Johnson, Bradley's voice dropped \"to nearly a whisper ... which was different from his prior responses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). As such, Trooper Johnson asked additional follow up questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Gary, do you have anything illegal in that car whatsoever?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   BRADLEY: Yeah, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: What do you have in there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   BRADLEY: I have some coke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Some coke?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   BRADLEY: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   TROOPER JOHNSON: Okay.

A subsequent search of Bradley's person revealed a black notebook and a bundle of Unites States currency. (Doc. 30 at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On July 11, 2018, the Government filed a single-count Indictment charging Bradley with possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (Doc. 1). On November 11, 2018, Bradley filed the instant Motion to Suppress and a brief in support thereof. (Docs. 19, 20). The Government filed a brief in opposition under seal on November 15, 2018. (Docs. 23, 24, 26). On December 18, 2018, the Court held a suppression hearing at which Trooper Johnson and Bradley testified. Following that hearing, the Court ordered supplemental briefing. (Doc. 29). Bradley filed a supplemental brief in support of the Motion on February 4, 2019. (Doc. 35). The Government filed a supplemental brief in opposition on February 21, 2019. (Doc. 39). The matter has been fully briefed and is ripe for disposition. For the reasons that follow, the Motion shall be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In his Motion and accompanying briefs, Bradley argues that, because Trooper Johnson subjected him to custodial interrogation without providing him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, his admission to having cocaine in the car prior to being\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   must be suppressed. Although Bradley acknowledges that he was not officially under arrest at the time he admitted to having the cocaine, he contends that his personal freedom was restrained to \"the degree associated with a formal arrest.\" (Doc. 20 at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    California v. Beheler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203910\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1121/#p1125\">\n    463 U.S. 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1121/#p1125\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203910\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1121/#p1125\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ) ). Bradley points out that he was confined to Trooper Johnson's patrol vehicle, that he was parked on the side of a busy highway, that it was the middle of the night, and that he was flanked by armed state troopers. (Doc. 35 at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Berkemer v. McCarty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    468 U.S. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (\"[T]he only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Likewise, Bradley contends, Trooper Johnson's questioning exceeded that which was necessary to effectuate the traffic stop\n   and issue a citation. Thus, Bradley reasons, Trooper Johnson's questions amounted to \"interrogation\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 35 at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island v. Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    446 U.S. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (defining \"interrogation\" for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes as \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\") ). Accordingly, Bradley concludes, Trooper Johnson subjected him to custodial interrogation and his admission to having cocaine in the vehicle prior to being\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   as well as any evidence derived therefrom must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, Bradley argues, his subsequent post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admissions were coerced and must be suppressed under\n   <em>\n    Oregon v.

Specifically, Bradley argues, his \"removal ... from his own vehicle to that of the vehicle of Trooper Johnson, the arrival of another trooper, the absence of any other persons at the scene on [his] behalf ..., the fact [that he] was not visible to the fast-moving highway traffic on the dark, early morning of the traffic stop, and the continual questioning about his criminal past and the failure to accept his responses, all brought [him] to the point where this Court could conclude that his 'will was overborne.' \" (Doc. 35 at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chavez v.

In support thereof, like Bradley, the Government relies upon\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   , a police officer pulled over Defendant Berkemer for weaving in and out of traffic. The officer ordered Berkemer out of the car, observed signs of intoxication, and told him that he would not be allowed to leave the scene. Upon further questioning by police, Berkemer admitted to having consumed drugs and alcohol. Berkemer moved to suppress the admission because the officer had not provided him with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. The Supreme Court rejected Berkemer's position, holding that: \"The roadside questioning of a motorist detained pursuant to a routine traffic stop does not constitute 'custodial interrogation' for the purposes of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    468 U.S. at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338811\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/420/#p442\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   Court acknowledged that this was so because: (1) \"[t]he vast majority of roadside detentions last only a few minutes;\" (2) \"circumstances associated with the typical traffic stop are not such that the motorist feels completely at the mercy of the police;\" and (3) \"the typical traffic stop is public, at least to some degree ...

Accordingly, the Government concludes, Bradley's pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission to having cocaine in the car need not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, the Government reasons, even if Bradley's pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admissions are inadmissible, Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admissions were voluntary and need not be suppressed. Specifically, the Government argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The failure of police to administer\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings does not mean that the statements received have actually been coerced, but only that courts will presume the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination has not been intelligently exercised. Absent deliberate coercion or improper tactics in obtaining an unwarned statement, a careful and thorough administration of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings cures the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible. The warnings convey the relevant information, and thereafter the suspect's choice whether to exercise his privilege to remain silent should ordinarily be viewed as an act of free will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    470 U.S. at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Here, the Government reasons, Trooper Johnson asked Bradley standard questions, he did not raise his voice, and he did not make physical contact with Bradley. Moreover, the Government points out, the entire traffic stop spanned only thirteen minutes. According to the Government, the fact that the interview was conducted in Trooper Johnson's vehicle-which Trooper Johnson identified as being his normal practice-was \"not a calculated attempt to circumvent the defendant's rights.\" (Doc. 39 at 10). Therefore, even if Bradley's pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission must be suppressed, his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission was not coerced, and both the post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission and the evidence derived therefrom need not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As a final argument, the Government proposes that, even if Bradley's statements are deemed inadmissible, the cocaine found in Bradley's car is admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. According to the Government, had Bradley not been arrested, and had he not otherwise consented to a search of his vehicle, Trooper Johnson had probable cause to bring in a canine unit to search the vehicle which would have inevitably resulted in Trooper Johnson finding the cocaine in Bradley's trunk. Moreover, the Government reasons, because Bradley was driving on a suspended license, Trooper Johnson was authorized to tow the vehicle and conduct an inventory search prior to impounding it, at which point the police would have inevitably discovered the cocaine. Thus, the Government concludes, even if Bradley's statements are inadmissible, the physical evidence discovered in the trunk of his car is admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. We disagree with all of the Government's positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is well-settled that, prior to being subjected to custodial interrogation, \"the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

Indeed, the record reveals that, according to Trooper Johnson, Bradley was, in fact, not free to leave. (Doc. 30 at 28, 56; Def. Exh. 104 at 9:00). Moreover, the totality of the circumstances reflects the same \"inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Howes\n   </em>\n   , 565 U.S. at 509, 514-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186663\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/499/#p509\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Bradley was confined to Trooper Johnson's patrol vehicle on Trooper Johnson's orders. Trooper Johnson admitted that he directed Bradley to join him in his patrol vehicle to probe whether Bradley was \"engaged in criminal activity.\" (Doc. 30 at 16). Although Bradley did not specifically object, he only consented to the confinement inasmuch as he was following Trooper Johnson's authoritative directions. Indeed, at no point did Trooper Johnson advise Bradley that he could decline his invitation or that he was free to go back to his own vehicle-a consideration that the\n   <em>\n    Howes\n   </em>\n   Court noted was suggestive of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howes\n   </em>\n   , 565 U.S. at 509, 514-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186663\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/499/#p509\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Bradley was bookended by armed state troopers. To Bradley's left sat Trooper Johnson. To his right-directly outside the door which Bradley could have theoretically used to exit-stood Corporal Hoye. It is hard to imagine a situation where Trooper Johnson and Corporal Hoye would have allowed Bradley to simply open the door and walk away. Third, the characteristics of the holding area suggest that Bradley was in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . The whole interaction occurred in the middle of the night, on the side of a bustling highway with cars passing at 65 miles-per-hour. Trooper Johnson had confined Bradley to the front seat of his vehicle and positioned a second armed trooper directly\n   outside. The emergency lights of Trooper Johnson's vehicle remained flashing throughout the interaction. Together, these characteristics manifestly created a highly stressful and unhospitable environment. Accordingly, we find that, at least from the time Corporal Hoye arrived on the scene, Bradley was subject to \"the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\" that a reasonable person in Bradley's situation would not have felt free to leave, and that Bradley was thus \"in custody\" for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Although we acknowledge that Trooper Johnson and Corporal Hoye did not physically threaten Bradley or use a sharp tone of voice, we are unconvinced by the Government's position that the absence of such behavior merits a finding that Bradley was not \"in custody.\" Indeed, had the troopers physically threatened Bradley or used a sharp tone, Trooper Johnson's more subtle psychological strategy may have been compromised. \"We cannot reach a conclusion simply by scrutinizing each circumstance separately, for the concept underlying the phrase 'totality of the circumstances' is that the whole is somehow distinct from the sum of the parts.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Accordingly, the troopers' choice not to use physical violence or a harsh tone does not undercut our finding that Bradley was \"in custody\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We also find that Trooper Johnson was \"interrogating\" Bradley for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda.\n   </em>\n   It is clear to us that Trooper Johnson used \"words or actions ...

First, even though the instant seizure was a simple traffic stop, Trooper Johnson asked Bradley a litany of questions about his travel plans, his family, and his criminal history. After each answer, Trooper Johnson repeated questions and dug deeper with pointed follow up. Then, after Corporal Hoye arrived, Trooper Johnson rattled off a sequence of probing questions, each designed to elicit a damning response. In fact, Trooper Johnson testified at the suppression hearing that he leveled the tone of his voice to help him identify whether the tone of Bradley's voice would betray him. (Doc. 30 at 29-30 (\"They're what we refer to as clarifying questions. We attempt to ask them in a level tone in order to assess if there's any deviation based upon response from the individual, in this case Mr. Bradley, whether it's looking for specific substances that we may be dealing with, either the mentioned substances here, fentanyl, for officer safety concerns or if it's firearms that we're potentially looking at, I'm trying to narrow down what type of criminal activity that I'm dealing with and how I need to proceed.\"). In our view, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   reason Trooper Johnson questioned Bradley in the way he did was to \"elicit an incriminating response.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   , 446 U.S. at 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/#p301\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because Trooper Johnson failed to do so until later in the interaction, we find that all statements Bradley made prior to being\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   must be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    470 U.S. at 306-307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]nwarned statements that are otherwise voluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must nevertheless be excluded\n   from evidence under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .

Because Trooper Johnson\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   Bradley, after which Bradley admitted the location and quantity of cocaine in his car, we next consider the critical issue of whether Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission must also be suppressed.

Thus, we conclude that the instant case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   . As such, and because Trooper Johnson neglected to cure his failure to administer\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and because Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission was inextricably intertwined with, and derived from, his pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission, Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission must also be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Trooper Johnson testified that he had been with the Pennsylvania State Police for almost three years at the time he pulled Bradley over. Thus, Trooper Johnson was neither a \"rookie\" nor did he testify that his failure to warn Bradley was accidental.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Naranjo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8914239\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/221/#p231\">\n    426 F.3d at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Trooper Johnson should have recognized that, confining Bradley to his patrol vehicle on the side of the road, in the middle of the night, flanking him with armed state troopers, and then subjecting him to a litany of questions designed to elicit an incriminating response was sufficient to trigger his obligation to provide Bradley with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.

Here, Trooper Johnson admitted at the suppression hearing that the only reason he asked Bradley the follow-up catch-all question of \"do you have anything illegal in that car whatsoever\" which resulted in Bradley's pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission that he had cocaine in the car was because Bradley's voice had dropped \"to nearly a whisper\" when Trooper Johnson asked him whether he had cocaine in the car. (Doc. 30 at 31-32). Furthermore, Bradley's incriminating post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission that he had \"a lot\" of cocaine stemmed from Trooper Johnson's suggestion to Bradley that he already knew that the cocaine was in the car vis-\u00e0-vis his leading question \"[h]ow much cocaine is in the car?\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:55-1:57). Likewise, Bradley's other incriminating post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission that the cocaine was in the trunk was the result of Bradley's pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statement that Bradley had just been sentenced. (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:55-1:57) (\"You just got sentenced, alright? Now, understand\n   I'm here for you. Now help me out here. How much is in the car? A lot?\"). Therefore, it is clear that Trooper Johnson presented Bradley with his pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements in an effort to elicit incriminating responses post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .

That is, it would have been almost absurd for Bradley to deny that he had contraband in the vehicle after having admitted as much seconds earlier. Thus, \"the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation,\" \"the overlapping content of the two statements,\" and \"the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first\" all suggest that Trooper Johnson's failure to\n   <em>\n    Mirandize\n   </em>\n   Bradley was deliberate. Accordingly, and for the various other aforementioned reasons, we find that Trooper Johnson's failure to advise Bradley of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights was, in fact, deliberate and that this case is controlled by Justice Kennedy's narrowing concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Because we so find, we next evaluate whether Trooper Johnson provided appropriate \"curative measures ... designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect's situation would understand the import and effect of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning and of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring).

Moreover, Trooper Johnson raced through the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning in a fashion similar to the disclaimer at the end of a prescription drug commercial, thereby further obfuscating its effectiveness. Accordingly, because Trooper Johnson \"deliberately undermine[d] the effectiveness of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning by conducting an initial unwarned interrogation\" and then failed to provide any sort of \"curative measures,\" we find that \"the [post-warning] confession must be excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaird\n   </em>\n   , 463 Fed.App'x at 125 (citing\n   <em>\n    Naranjo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8914239\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/221/#p231\">\n    426 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   232 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Alternatively, even were we disinclined to conclude that Trooper Johnson's failure to\n   <em>\n    Mirandize\n   </em>\n   Bradley was deliberate, we find that Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission was coerced and must be suppressed under\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   notwithstanding Trooper Johnson's technical administration of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.

Because, however, \"it is generally recognized that the police may use some psychological tactics in eliciting a statement from a suspect\" and \"[f]ew criminals feel impelled to confess to the police purely of their own accord, without any questioning at all,\" the relevant question when determining voluntariness is \"not whether [Trooper Johnson's] statements were the cause of [Bradley's] confession-indeed, we assume that to be the case-but whether those statements were so manipulative or coercive that they deprived [Bradley] of his ability to make an unconstrained, autonomous decision to confess.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914273\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/723/1373/#p1377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because we find that Trooper Johnson's statements and actions were so coercive that they deprived Bradley of his ability to make an unconstrained decision to confess, we hold that Bradley's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admissions concerning the cocaine in his car must be suppressed as involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In the instant case, at the time of his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   admission, Bradley was confined to a police car and was flanked by armed state troopers. Bradley was driving a rental car, in the middle of the night, and was pulled over on the side of a busy highway. As aforestated, cars were whizzing by at 65 miles-per-hour. Trooper Johnson's emergency lights were flashing, it was cold outside, and Bradley was wearing only slippers. For Bradley, these factors could only have created an unhospitable,\n   highly stressful, and confusing emotional experience. Capitalizing on this, Trooper Johnson exhibited an overly-friendly demeanor designed to set Bradley at ease,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1620188\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/598/#p605\">\n    796 F.2d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, on more than one occasion, Trooper Johnson implied to Bradley that, if he cooperated, he would \"be[ ] good to him\" and \"cut him a break.\" Trooper Johnson also emphasized to Bradley \"I'm here for you brother ... understand I'm here for you. Now help me out here.\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:55-1:57). Nonetheless, as noted in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , \"the test for voluntariness is not a but-for test, but a question of whether the confession was a product of free choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1620188\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/598/#p605\">\n    796 F.2d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based upon the totality of the circumstances in this case, it is clear to us that Bradley's will was overborn by a host of factors including the conditions of his interrogation, Trooper Johnson's demeanor, Trooper Johnson's deliberate refusal to give him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and Trooper Johnson's reliance upon Bradley's unwarned admission to elicit his second admission.

Likewise, even if a canine had arrived on the scene, it is not certain that the canine would have inevitably alerted on the trunk and/or discovered the cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Government's contention that the inventory search would have inevitably revealed the cocaine suffers from the same defect. At the suppression hearing, Trooper Johnson noted only that, because Bradley was driving on a suspended license, he would not have let him drive away. (Doc. 30 at 28). Then, Trooper Johnson posited that Bradley's vehicle would have been towed and \"[d]ue to our policy we would have conducted an inventory of the vehicle as well as contacted the individual that was on the rental agreement.\" (Doc. 30 at 28). According to Trooper Johnson, that search \"would have involved a check of the vehicle to ensure that there were no valuables, to remove them and/or document them. If we had to remove some of them from the vehicle they would be logged into our evidence room, and that would be with our policy and our conversation with the operator of the vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Despite Trooper Johnson's assertions as to the policies underlying the inventory search, Trooper Johnson did not aver that protocol mandated that he tow and inventory Bradley's vehicle as a result of his suspended license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Humphries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202743432\">\n    2004 WL 2743432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 29, 2004) (\"The record before the Court establishes that the Philadelphia Police Department had a pre-existing policy that an inventory search can be conducted on all vehicles seized from persons driving with suspended licenses.\"). Trooper Johnson could have asked Bradley to contact someone to come drive the vehicle home or could have allowed Bradley to drive home on the condition that he avoid driving again until his license was reinstated. This would be consistent with Trooper Johnson's statements to Bradley that he would \"cut him a break.\" (Gov. Exh. 2 at 1:54). Thus, the Government has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that \"the police, following routine procedures, would inevitably have uncovered the evidence\" based \"upon the historical facts capable of ready verification,\n   and not speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202743432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/\">\n    467 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   444 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Aside from a general citation to\n   <em>\n    Nix\n   </em>\n   and citations to cases which do not discuss the inevitable discovery doctrine, the Government has failed to cite a single case in which the inevitable discovery doctrine served to admit otherwise-inadmissible evidence under facts similar to those before us. As our Court of Appeals noted in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez De Reyes\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]nevitable discovery is not an exception to be invoked casually, and if it is to be prevented from swallowing the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule, courts must take care to hold the government to its burden of proof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, Bradley contends that, because Trooper Johnson did not provide\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings prior to his admission that there was cocaine in the vehicle, that confession could not amount to probable cause to search the vehicle. Thus, because Trooper Johnson neither received Bradley's consent to search the vehicle nor obtained a search warrant to do so, Trooper Johnson's warrantless search was unconstitutional, and the evidence obtained therefrom must be suppressed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
