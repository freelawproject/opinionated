Defendant Mikelic married Plaintiff's daughter Olga Solmatina (\"Olga\") in 2005, but Mikelic and Olga separated in 2013 and began divorce proceedings in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 14-15. Plaintiff alleges that between 2005 and 2013, Plaintiff, pursuant to several oral agreements, loaned Defendant Mikelic approximately $ 2 million to purchase real estate and for investments, which was never paid back.

The purchase price of the Wheelock Property was $ 860,000, which was financed, in part, by a $ 688,000 mortgage loan from CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Defendants claim that Defendant Mikelic and Olga paid the remaining purchase price from checks remitted on a bank account held in Olga's name; Plaintiff disputes this characterization and instead claims that Plaintiff agreed to loan Defendant Mikelic money at the same interest rate as her Russian savings account to complete the purchase of the Wheelock Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34; Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 34, ECF No. 66. Repayment of said loan was allegedly due no later than 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff further claims that the money was transferred to Defendant via Olga's U.S. checking account and that in Defendant Mikelic's sworn Statement of Net Worth, Defendant stated that the source of funds to acquire the Wheelock Property was from \"Olga mother and husband.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35; Decl.

Storage Units\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, Defendant Mikelic allegedly informed Plaintiff that the purchase of Storage Units located on 120 Riverside Boulevard, New York, New York would be a profitable investment. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 48, ECF No. 66. Plaintiff allegedly loaned Defendant $ 505,728 for the purchase of twenty-four storage units and did so via checks in Plaintiff's name payable to Bryan Cave, LLP, who was the escrow agent for the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. Defendant allegedly sold the units for profit but did not provide any return to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Defendants dispute these allegations and claim that (1) Defendant Mikelic did not have any conversations with Plaintiff regarding the profitability of the storage units; (2) that Plaintiff did not loan any Defendants the funds for purchasing the units; (3) that Olga signed checks for a certain number of storage units; (4) the checks were drawn on a checking account maintained in name of Plaintiff in the care of Olga; and (5) that Defendants were not party to any agreement with Plaintiff to repay any money.

Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 53, ECF No. 66. King Penguin Properties, LLC is a New York limited liability corporation organized in 2006 of which Defendant Mikelic and Olga are each fifty percent members. Defs.' Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6 4. Plaintiff allegedly loaned Defendant $ 151,400 for his deposit for the purchase of the Trump Baja Property directly via checks in her name payable to \"Land of America.\" Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, ECF No. 66. Because of a court settlement, King Penguin Properties received a refund for its deposit on the property in the amount of $ 163,464.03 yet Plaintiff alleges none of the funds were returned to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Defendants disagree with Plaintiff's version of events and assert that Defendant Mikelic (1) had no conversations with Plaintiff regarding the Trump Baja Property; (2) was not a party to any loan agreement with Plaintiff which required repayment of the money; and (3) that the money for the deposit came from Olga who signed Plaintiff's name to checks drawn on an account in Plaintiff's name. Defs.' Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 53-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Fifth Avenue Apartment Funds &amp; Windham Property Purchase\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In January 2013, Plaintiff and her husband travelled to New York City to view potential apartments to purchase. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 35, ECF No. 66. Plaintiff allegedly identified an apartment located at 1280 Fifth Avenue that she wanted to buy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Mikelic allegedly claimed that he did not have the necessary funds to put a down payment on the apartment and so Plaintiff loaned Defendant $ 393,000, which Plaintiff asserts was transferred to Defendant via Olga's checking account in two separate installments of $ 133,000 and $ 260,000 on March 19, 2013 and May 6, 2013 respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant did not use the money for a down payment on the Fifth Avenue Apartment and instead used the money to purchase and improve a ski house located in Windham, New York and on other unrelated purchases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff notes that in an e-mail between Defendant Mikelic and Olga dated July 31, 2013, Defendant stated \"Tell [Plaintiff] we love her for the ski house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Like the other alleged loans, this loan was repayable no later than 2014 and Plaintiff never stated the money was a gift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants on the other hand claim that the $ 393,000 belonged to Olga and came from her back account of which she was the sole owner: at no time did Plaintiff loan or provide Defendant with the $ 393,000 to purchase an apartment located on Fifth Avenue. Defs.' Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6 40-41, ECF No. 62-1. Defendants claim that the $ 133,000 from Olga's account was paid to an attorney acting as an escrow agent as a deposit for an apartment located at 1595 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, which Defendant Mikelic and Olga sought to purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-42. Ultimately, the Lexington Avenue apartment was not purchased and the $ 133,000 was returned to Olga's account, at which point Olga wrote a check to Defendant Mikelic for $ 260,000 that Defendant used to purchase and improve a home in Windham, New York that was titled in both Defendant and Olga's names.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     King Penguin Properties Loan &amp; Penguin Opportunity Fund Investment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2008, Defendant Mikelic asked Plaintiff if she would serve as a Vice President of the King Penguin Opportunity Fund (\"Opportunity Fund\"), which is a Delaware limited liability corporation formed in 2009 to invest in properties located in the New York metropolitan area. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 58, ECF No. 66; Defs.' Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6 5, ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   62-1. Plaintiff declined Defendant's offer, but Plaintiff alleges that Defendant asked Plaintiff to invest in the Opportunity Fund and informed her that Plaintiff would receive 10% interest on her investment. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 58-61, ECF No. 66. Plaintiff claims she loaned approximately $ 648,845 to King Penguin Properties and invested approximately $ 100,000 with the Opportunity Fund in 2009, which was never repaid at 10% interest as allegedly promised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62; 66. Plaintiff supports her claims with bank statements showing transfers made to King Penguin Properties over several years, as well as $ 100,000 transferred in four installments in November 2009 allegedly for the purpose of investing in the Opportunity Fund. Decl. of Valentina Solomatina \u00b6 10, Ex. 4, ECF Nos. 64, 64-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that Defendant (1) did not provide Plaintiff with the subscription or operating agreement that all investors in the Opportunity Fund were required to sign, which disclosed material risks associated with an investment in the Fund; and (2) did not orally or otherwise inform her of any materials risks associated with her investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-65. According to Plaintiff, Defendant Mikelic had a fiduciary duty to investors to provide this information because he was a co-owner of King Penguin Properties and KPP Managing Member, LLC (\"KPP\"). SAC \u00b6 249, ECF No. 43. KPP is a Delaware limited liability corporation organized in 2009 that Mikelic has a seventy-five percent membership interest in and which is a managing member of the Opportunity Fund. Defs. Br. Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, ECF No. 62-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Conversely, Defendant claims that he asked Olga if Olga and her parents would invest in the Opportunity Fund, and that they all declined after Olga spoke to her parents via telephone-a conversation for which Defendant was not present. Defs.' Resp. \u00b6 60, ECF No. 74. Defendant asserts that he never spoke to Plaintiff directly about investing in the fund and did not inform her that he would return 10% interest on any investment in the Opportunity Fund or loan to King Penguin Properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. As Plaintiff was allegedly never an investor in the Opportunity Fund,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant had no reason to provide her with the subscription agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Schedules\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff lastly asserts that Defendant Mikelic prepared three schedules that outlined Plaintiff's loans and investments to Defendant. Pl. Resp. \u00b6 68, ECF No. 66. The schedules were entitled \"Gift Money for Mama Vala,\" (hereinafter \"Mama Vala Schedule\") \"Storage Unit Schedule,\" and \"King Penguin Properties Usage of Open Credit Line from Valentina Solomatina\" (hereinafter \"King Penguin Schedule\"). Defs.' Resp. \u00b6 68, ECF No. 74. Plaintiff claims that Olga added handwritten notes to each schedule after they were prepared by Mikelic so that Plaintiff would understand the contents. Pl. Resp. \u00b6 69, ECF No. 69. Defendant disputes these claims and instead asserts that (1) Defendant prepared the schedules with and at the insistence of Olga; (2) the schedules do not contain language indicating any money was a loan from or investment by Plaintiff; (3) Defendant did not transmit any of the\n   schedules to Plaintiff; and (4) the handwritten notes were made by Olga outside the presence of Defendant-Defendant does not read or write Russian and did not assent to or authorize the notations. Defs.' Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, ECF No. 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to each individual schedule, Plaintiff notes that the Mama Vala Schedule, which was prepared in 2013, includes the dates, amounts, and descriptions of the loans for the Wheelock Property, the Trump Baja Property, and the Storage Units. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 70-71, ECF No.\n   <em>\n    66.\n   </em>\n   Mama Vala was a nickname for Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. The schedule was titled \"Gift Money from Mama Vala\" because Olga told Defendant to title it as such.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75. Defendant takes issue with Plaintiff's characterization of the money reflected in this schedule as loans because the schedule does not denominate the money in such terms and because he was not privy to any loan agreements with Plaintiff for the purchase of the Wheelock Property, the Trump Baja Property, or the Storage Units. Defs.' Resp. \u00b6 70, ECF No. 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Storage Unit Schedules, which were created in 2010, list the unit numbers, size of the units, the purchase prices of the units, the dates of purchase, and the sale prices. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 78-79, ECF No. 66. On one of these schedules Defendant Mikelic included a handwritten note indicating that eight storage units were paid for by him an Olga, but Mikelic did not include any note for the remaining twenty-four units.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. Plaintiff alleges that Olga included a handwritten note to indicate the remaining twenty-four units were paid for by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81. Defendant, again, asserts that the notes in Russian were not prepared by him nor did he authorize or consent to the notations. Defs. Resp. \u00b6 82, ECF No. 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the King Penguin Schedules list the date, amount, annual interest rate, interest due, maximum note value, days outstanding, total due for a substantial number of Plaintiff's loans, and has Olga's handwritten notes to Plaintiff. Pl.'s Resp. \u00b6 84, ECF No. 66. Like the other schedules, Defendants assert that they were not party to any loan agreements, that Defendant Mikelic created the schedule with Olga at her insistence, and that Mikelic did not authorize or consent to Olga's Russian notes.
