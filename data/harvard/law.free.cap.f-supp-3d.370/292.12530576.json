INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2017, plaintiff Varsity Wireless Investors LLC (\"Varsity\") applied for a special permit for the installation of a wireless telecommunications facility (the \"Facility\") in the Town of Hamilton (the \"Town\"). The special permit was denied by the Town of Hamilton Planning Board (the \"Planning\n   Board\"). Varsity filed this suit, against the Town, the Planning Board, and its members in their official capacities. Varsity alleges two claims under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"TCA\"), based on the Planning Board's denial of the special permit. Varsity and the Town have negotiated an Agreement for Judgment (the \"Agreement\"), settling Varsity's claims and requiring the issuance of the special permit with certain conditions. Varsity and the Town have asked the court to approve the Agreement and enter the Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Two additional motions now before the court arise out of a feature of the special permit granting process under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts state zoning law requires that a permit be approved by two-thirds of the members of the special permit granting authority when that board has more than five members. Although four members of the seven-person Town of Hamilton Planning Board voted to give Varsity the requested permit, the permit was denied because three Planning Board members -- Peter Clark, Edwin Howard, and Claudia Woods (the \"Planning Board Defendants\") -- voted against the request. When Varsity sued the Town, the Planning Board, and the members of the Planning Board in their official capacities, the Town filed an answer. The Planning Board did not. However, the Planning Board Defendants, by privately retained counsel, filed an answer separate from the Town's answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Planning Board Defendants oppose approval of the Agreement for Judgment. The Town and Varsity contend that the Planning Board Defendants lack standing to participate in this litigation separately from the Town and to challenge the Agreement. Therefore, they have moved to strike the Planning Board Defendants' answer to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Planning Board Defendants have moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, to dismiss the Town as a party. This motion was filed after a hearing on the motion to strike, in another effort by the Planning Board Defendants to prevent entry of judgment pursuant to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons explained in this Memorandum and Order, the court is: (1) denying the Planning Board Defendants' Rule 21 Motion to Dismiss the Town for Misjoinder (the \" Rule 21 Motion\"); (2) allowing the Town's Motion to Strike the Planning Board Defendants' Answer; and after nevertheless considering the Planning Board Defendants' objections, (3) entering judgment in accordance with the Agreement for Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its Complaint, Varsity named as defendants, the Town, the Planning Board, and the seven members of the Planning Board in their official capacities. Varsity alleges that the defendants violated Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 because the denial of the requested special permit \"effectively prohibits provision of personal wireless services\" in a particular area and was not based on \"substantial evidence in a written record.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (7) (B) (iii) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (B)(i)(II). In addition, Varsity sought review of the Planning Board decision under M.G.L Chapter 40A, asserting that the Board exceeded its authority in denying Varsity's request for a special permit. Accordingly, Varsity sought an order directing the Board to grant Varsity all necessary permits for the construction and operations of the Facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (Docket No. 1) at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Town of Hamilton filed an answer to the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19. The Planning Board did not file an\n   answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Statement (Docket No. 34) at 2, 3. However, the Planning Board Defendants filed a separate answer, containing both denials and affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17. After this answer was filed, Woods moved out of Hamilton and resigned from the Planning Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Statement (Docket No. 34) at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Town subsequently filed a Motion to Strike the Answer of the Planning Board Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21. Varsity joined that motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 24, which the Planning Board Defendants opposed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Varsity and the Town later filed the Agreement for Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 28. The Agreement provides for judgment for Varsity on all counts of the Complaint and directs the issuance of the special permit, subject to certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    . at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The conditions consist largely of those that the Board indicated in its August, 2017 decision would have been necessary if the special permit had been granted.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Planning Board Findings and Decision (Docket No. 2) at 5-5\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Agreement for Judgment at 2-3. The Planning Board Defendants responded to the Agreement for Judgment, contending that the Motion to Strike, and a determination of the proper parties to the dispute, would have to be decided before the court decided whether to approve the proposed settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 29. Varsity filed a reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 30-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court ordered the parties to be prepared to discuss, at an October 17, 2018 hearing, the implications of\n   <em>\n    Indus. Commc'ns &amp; Elecs., Inc. v. Town of Alton, N.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417194\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/76/#p78\">\n    646 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78-81 (1st Cir. 2011), concerning whether the Planning Board Defendants had standing to submit an answer to the Complaint separate from that of the Town and/or to challenge the Agreement for Judgment. The court also directed the parties' attention to a pertinent section of the Town of Hamilton By-laws (the \"By-laws\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the October 17, 2018 hearing, the court ordered additional briefing concerning three issues: (1) whether the Planning Board Defendants have a protectable interest and, therefore, standing to participate in this case; (2) the applicable standards for court approval of a consent judgment; and (3) whether or not the Agreement for Judgment satisfies those requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 38. Varsity and the Town submitted memoranda on these issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 40, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to addressing the foregoing three issues, the Planning Board Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Town as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 42, 43. The Planning Board Defendants argue that the Town is not a necessary party in this case and, therefore, is dispensable. The Planning Board Defendants also assert that the Town has been \"fraudulently joined\" as a defendant to help Varsity obtain a consent decree, and that there is no relief Varsity can seek against the Town.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 43 at 4-9. The court ordered Varsity and the Town to respond to the Rule 21 Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 46. They have done so jointly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Planning Board is authorized by the Hamilton By-Laws to approve applications for special permits for the construction of communications towers and telecommunication antenna facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (Docket No. 1) at \u00b6 5. On May 19, 2017, Varsity applied to the Planning Board for a special permit to construct a 109 foot monopole tower at 557 Bay Road, in Hamilton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Varsity builds, owns, and operates communications infrastructure, and leases its infrastructure to personal wireless services providers, including Verizon Wireless (\"Verizon\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 12. By mid-2017, Verizon had determined that there was a gap in its services in the area surrounding Bay Road in Hamilton. In collaboration with Varsity, it investigated potential sites for the installation of a personal wireless facility.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. Determining that no existing structures were sufficient, Varsity identified the Bay Road site as the \"sole appropriate and available location for the installation of a wireless telecommunications facility to fill the substantial and significant gap in Verizon Wireless' wireless service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 23. The Bay Road site is property owned by the Town.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The authority to issue a special permit in the Town is vested in the Planning Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Town of Hamilton Zoning By-Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 3.1.3, 10.5, 7.2.2. Under Massachusetts law, M.G.L. Ch. 40A, \u00a7 9a, a two-thirds majority vote, sometimes called a \"supermajority,\" of a special permit granting authority is required to issue a special permit when the board is comprised of more than five members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. C.4 0A, \u00a7 9a. The Hamilton Planning Board has seven members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   By-Laws (Docket No. 21-2) at 15. Therefore, five votes are required to grant a special permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Planning Board voted on Varsity's application on August 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Planning Board Findings and Decision (Docket No. 2) at 5. The vote was four to three in favor of issuing the special permit with certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (Docket No. 1) at 523. However, because it did not command a supermajority, Varsity's request for a special permit was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In its decision, the Planning Board considered, among other things concerning the proposed Facility: the minimization of adverse visual impacts; the aesthetic effect on the neighborhood; whether the height was the minimum necessary to provide adequate service; and whether the Facility would \"close a significant gap in wireless coverage for multiple providers ... including Verizon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a result of the denial of its request for a special permit, Varsity filed this case. On June 5, 2018, Varsity and the Town entered into the Agreement for Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IV. THE PROPER PARTIES TO THIS CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Protectable Interest in the TCA Context\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The First Circuit considered standing requirements in the TCA context in\n   <em>\n    Indus.

In\n   <em>\n    Alton\n   </em>\n   , the owners of private property near a proposed cell tower construction site -- David and Marilyn Slade -- intervened in a TCA case between the telecommunications company and the Town of Alton, on the side of the Town, after the company's request for a zoning variance was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417194\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/76/#p78\">\n    646 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the company and Town subsequently entered into an agreement that would have resulted in the allowance of the variance and construction of a one-hundred foot tower, the Slades objected. The First Circuit held that the Slades had Article III standing to defend the denial because they could show \"injury in fact\" related to the substance of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417194\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/76/#p78\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 79-80 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

(Docket No. 48) at 7:17-20. This is incorrect. Section 17 only requires that board members be sued in their official capacities if the \"complaint is filed by someone\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   the original applicant, appellant or petitioner ...,\" such as an abutter. M.G.L. C.40A, \u00a7 17 (emphasis added). Therefore, it appears that Massachusetts law does not require that the\n   Planning Board Defendants be made parties to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nevertheless, the Planning Board may be a proper party and Varsity may have correctly sued all seven of its members in their official capacities. In denying the request for a special permit, the Planning Board caused the injury to Varsity that is the basis of this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    15A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Juris.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3902 (2d ed.). Also, it may be the Planning Board that must issue the special permit if judgment enters in this case for Varsity. However, the Planning Board has evidently decided to rely on the Board of Selectman to litigate or resolve this case as the Planning Board has not filed an answer or otherwise participated in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In any event, the Planning Board is required to allow the Board of Selectman and Town Counsel to act for the defendants in this case. Consistent with Massachusetts law, M.G.L. c.40, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Hamilton By-laws provide that \"the Board of Selectman shall have the authority to prosecute, defend, and compromise all litigation to which the Town is a Party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   By-laws, Chapter VII, Section 1 (Docket No. 21-2) at 21. This is such a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Hamilton By-laws also provide that \"Town Counsel .... shall appear at any court in the Commonwealth in defense of all actions or suits brought against the Town\n   <em>\n    or its officers in their official capacity\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20332\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this case, the Planning Board Defendants are named only in their official capacities. Therefore, it is Town Counsel that should be representing the Planning Board Defendants in this case, rather than their privately retained counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring that Town Counsel represent the Planning Board, as well as the Board of Selectman, will assure that the Town and its instrumentalities speak in court with one voice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As indicated earlier, the Planning Board implicitly recognized that the Board of Selectman controls all litigation concerning the Town, and that Town Counsel alone may represent the Town's interests, by not retaining counsel or filing an answer to the complaint of its own. In these circumstances, the Planning Board Defendants lack standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This case is materially different than\n   <em>\n    Alton\n   </em>\n   , in which state law gave the intervenors a protectable interest independent of the Town's. More specifically, as explained earlier, in\n   <em>\n    Alton\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit held that the intervenors could establish \"injury in\n   fact\" because they had a \"legal interest under state law,\" in particular under a New Hampshire statute allowing challenges to a zoning board's variance decision.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417194\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/76/#p78\">\n    646 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   80 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20677%3A4\">\n    N.H.

Varsity and the Town have submitted an Affidavit of Shawn Farrell, the Chairman of the Town's Board of Selectman, in which he explains the reasons the Town has chosen to enter into the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Farrell Affidavit (Docket No. 40-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   More specifically, the issuance of the permit will address a current wireless communications coverage gap in Hamilton and, therefore, lead to improved wireless service for the Town's citizens. The Town will also receive financial benefits -- lease payments, co-location fees, and utility payments -- as a result of issuance of the permit. In addition, the Agreement saves the Town future costs of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9. The citizens of the Town will benefit from the Town's ability to use those funds for other public purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the Agreement for Judgment includes multiple concessions by Varsity that will benefit the Town, including restrictions on site clearing, generator testing, and lighting and signage associated with the Facility.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8.

The Agreement benefits Varsity by allowing it to construct the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Agreement is also consistent with the intent of Congress, and the public interest weighs in favor of entering a judgment incorporating the terms set forth in the Agreement. As the Supreme Court has written, the \"primary purpose\" of the TCA is to \"reduce regulation and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    Reno v.

In this case, the Agreement for Judgment between Varsity and the Town fully resolves protracted and expensive litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the consent judgment furthers the objectives of Congress and protects the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court recognizes that entry of the agreed-upon judgment will result in the issuance of a special permit without the supermajority of the Planning Board usually required by Massachusetts law. However, as indicated earlier, Massachusetts law also authorizes a town to give its Board of Selectman the authority to compromise litigation. The Hamilton Board of Selectman have in this case reasonably concluded that settlement is in the Town's best interest, taking into account the Town's chances of success on the TCA claims, associated litigation costs, and the desirability of certain conditions on the permit to which Varsity has agreed, as well as other legitimate considerations, including improved wireless service in Hamilton. Therefore, it is not appropriate to permit a minority of the Planning Board to compel the continuation of expensive and potentially unmeritorious litigation by the Town.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VI.
