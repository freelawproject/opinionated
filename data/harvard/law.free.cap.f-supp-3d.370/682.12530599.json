Additionally, the Magistrate Judge recommended that this Court grant Defendant Gilbert's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's neglect claim in Count 10, as the failure to allege a conspiracy claim in Count 5 is fatal to the claim of neglecting to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   a conspiracy in Count 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201986\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201986\">\n    at 25-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff now objects to these findings by the Magistrate Judge.\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 2-9. The Court agrees with Plaintiff and finds that his conspiracy claim in Count 5 is not precluded by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The intracorporate conspiracy doctrine holds that \"acts of corporate agents are acts of the corporation itself, and corporate employees cannot conspire with each other or with the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    ePlus Tech., Inc. v. Aboud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313621\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/166/#p179\">\n    313 F.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (4th Cir. 2002). The doctrine applies to public entities, as well as private corporations and public government entities.\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v.

However, the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine has two exceptions. The exception relevant to this case states that \"a plaintiff may [nonetheless] state a conspiracy claim [against a corporate agent] where the agent's acts were not authorized by the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Painter's Mill Grille, LLC v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570064\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/342/#p353\">\n    716 F.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (4th Cir. 2013). Agents' acts are \"not authorized by the corporation\" when it can be inferred that the agents violated specific policies that the corporation follows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hodgin v. Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995068\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/447/804/#p807\">\n    447 F.Supp. 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (D. Md. 1978) (holding that the defendant's actions are unauthorized by the employer when, \"reading the complaint liberally, it appears [the] plaintiff has charged that [the defendant] ignored the stated policies\" of the employer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants Marshall University, Primerano and Shapiro prematurely terminated the plaintiff's employment and without offering a 1-year terminal contract,\" in violation of the West Virginia Higher Education\n   Policy Commission Rules, which the corporation follows.\n   <em>\n    See Compl.\n   </em>\n   , at 10, 45. As a result of this allegation, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Defendants Primerano's and Shapiro's acts were \"not authorized\" by his employer, as their alleged acts violated that West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission Rules, which Defendant MU follows. Therefore, it is improper to grant Defendants Shapiro's and Primerano's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's conspiracy claim in Count 5, or Defendant Gilbert's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's neglect claim in Count 10, based solely upon the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss Count 7\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Count 6 of his second amended complaint, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants MU, Primerano, and Shapiro violated various federal and/or state statutes by retaliating against him-via his termination-because he filed a grievance and charges of Title VII violations with the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , at 40-41. Additionally, in Count 7, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants MU, Primerano, and Shapiro violated various federal and state statutes by breaching the employment contract between Plaintiff and the School of Medicine when they prematurely terminated Plaintiff's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42. The Magistrate Judge recommended that this Court grant Defendants Shapiro's and Primerano's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's breach of contract claim set forth in Count 7, finding that it was an unnecessary duplication of the retaliation claim set against them in Count 6.\n   <em>\n    Proposed Findings and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   , at 45. Plaintiff now objects to this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 9. The Court denies Plaintiff's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff first objects to the Magistrate Judge's finding that Plaintiff's \"employment was cut eight months short,\" arguing that his employment was actually \"cut 12 or 19 months short.\"\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 9. This finding of fact is irrelevant, as it has no bearing on the legal issues presented before this Court. Therefore, the Court finds this objection moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff next objects to the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Counts 6 and 7 are duplicative.\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 12. In support, Plaintiff asserts that \"the legal grounds and factual evidence are different,\" and \"the breach of contract claim is simply based on the fact that\n   <em>\n    the defendants [Primerano and Shapiro] prematurely terminated the plaintiff's employment\n   </em>\n   regardless of whether or not the plaintiff opposed the tenure denial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (emphasis added). While this a proper explanation of the difference between the two counts, the issue with this argument is that, as the Magistrate Judge identified, Defendants Primerano and Shaprio \"could not have breached the contract ... because the contract was between MU and Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Proposed Findings and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   , at 45. In response, Plaintiff argues that \"the contractual relationship is irrelevant\" because \"the defendants were sued for violating the plaintiff's civil human right,\" and \"not for the plaintiff's contractual right under any contract law.\"\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 13. From these arguments, it appears Plaintiff is assuming that because he is not suing under common law breach of contract, but rather a federal statute, a contractual relationship need not be established. This is, of course, erroneous. For example, to establish that a defendant violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by\n   <em>\n    terminating\n   </em>\n   a contract, the\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   to terminate the contract-and thus a contractual relationship-must still be established. To the extent that Plaintiff\n   is arguing that Defendants merely\n   <em>\n    interfered\n   </em>\n   with a contractual relationship, the Court notes that no such claim is stated in Count 7 of the complaint, but nonetheless finds that Plaintiff's retaliation claim in Count 6 may encompass an allegation of interference. Therefore, this Court denies Plaintiff's objections, and grants Defendants Shapiro's and Primerano's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's breach of contract claim set forth in Count 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Due Process: Question of Liberty Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Count 11 of his second amended complaint, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants MU, Primerano, Shapiro, and Gilbert violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , at 45-46. While the Magistrate Judge found that Plaintiff sufficiently alleged a due process violation based upon a\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   interest, she found that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that a\n   <em>\n    liberty\n   </em>\n   interest was at stake.\n   <em>\n    See Proposed Findings and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   , at 34. Plaintiff now objects, and argues that he has stated sufficient facts which demonstrate that a liberty interest was implicated.\n   <em>\n    See Objections\n   </em>\n   , at 14.
