Cicero; a member of the HRB, Samuel L. Evans Jr.; and a hearing officer at the HRB, Roger J. Balla. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants subjected him to an unconstitutional drug test and used that test as a basis to terminate his employment with the City. He seeks reinstatement to his former position with the City, among other relief, pursuant to this Court's authority under the Illinois common law writ of certiorari (Count I), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court are Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on Count I [34] and the City's motion for summary judgment on Count II [31]. In this opinion, the Court addresses only the federal claims in Count II on the merits. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the City's motion for summary judgment [31] on Count II. As Count II represents the sole basis for this Court's federal jurisdiction, Plaintiff's petition for certiorari under Illinois law in Count I is dismissed without prejudice pursuant to the \"usual practice\" in the Seventh Circuit when \"all federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\" Consequently, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment [34] is denied without prejudice with leave to refile in state court. The Court shall enter judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on Count II. Finally, Plaintiff's motion for oral argument [52] is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court takes the relevant facts from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements of undisputed material facts and supporting exhibits: [33], [36], and [37]; and the underlying administrative record from the City of Chicago's Human Resources Board (the \"HRB\") [17]. The Court construes the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party-here, Plaintiff. The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. \"When we cite as undisputed a statement of fact that a party has attempted to dispute, it reflects our determination that the evidence cited in the response does not show that the fact is in genuine dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

[37-1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.] Venue is proper in this District because the alleged events giving rise to Plaintiff's claims occurred within the Northern District of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a 51-year-old man who was employed by the City of Chicago until he was discharged in the administrative proceedings before the HRB. [33, \u00b6 1]; [36, \u00b6 1]. The City is a municipal corporation located in Cook County, Illinois. [33, \u00b6 2.] From 1998 until the events at issue in this case, Plaintiff was employed as a Production Assistant with the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs &amp; Special Events (\"DCASE\"). [33, \u00b6 4.] His duties included (1) performing various manual labor and routine clerical tasks (such as loading/unloading and delivering heavy furniture and equipment); (2) assembling and setting up stage production sets, tables, chairs,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   for City events (such as festivals)-which required the operating of hand and power tools; (3) processing outgoing mail; and (4) sorting and distributing incoming mail. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Additionally, Plaintiff regularly drove DCASE Commissioner Mark Kelly and occasionally other DCASE employees. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.] Given these responsibilities, DCASE required Plaintiff to maintain a valid State of Illinois driver's license. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff reported to John Trick, his immediate supervisor, and Jose Chao (\"Chao\"), DCASE's Director of Facilities. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lisa Lorick (\"Lorick\") has been DCASE's Assistant Commissioner since July 2004. Lorick serves as DCASE's Director of Human Resources and is responsible for all personnel matters, including discipline, timekeeping, payroll, benefits, labor relations, and training and development. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.] Plaintiff, Chao, and Lorick all worked at the DCASE's main office-the Chicago Cultural Center, which is located at 55 E. Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. City Policies, Practices, and Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City has a city-wide Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy (the \"Policy\") that applies to all of its employees. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10] Under the Policy, the City may require an employee to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing under three circumstances: (1) when there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee has used drugs or alcohol or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at work, on City property, or on City business; (2) if the employee is involved in a fight while at work, on City property, or on City business; or (3) if an \"an employee [is] involved in an accident which results in significant injury requiring medical attention or significant property damage while\n   at work, on City property or on City business.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10; 17-2, at 72.] The City enacted the Policy in July 1993 and has not changed the Policy's language regarding post-accident testing since that time. [33, \u00b6 11.] An employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol or refuses to cooperate with testing procedures is terminated for a first offense. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.] A refusal of a drug test is treated as a positive test. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff acknowledged that he received a copy of the Personnel Rules sometime around 2000 and that he was generally aware that the City had a drug and alcohol policy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.] However, Plaintiff also stated that he had been unaware of the Policy's post-accident testing standard. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. March 10, 2017 Accident &amp; Drug Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Friday, March 10, 2017, Plaintiff was assigned to drive a van of nine DCASE employees from the Chicago Cultural Center to the Clarke House Museum, approximately two miles away. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.] One of those DCASE employees was approximately seven and a half months pregnant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Clarke House Museum trip marked the fourth time Plaintiff had driven that week. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Chao planned to drive a second City vehicle to the Clarke House Museum. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff left the Chicago Cultural Center at approximately 10:45 a.m. Moments later, the vehicle driven by Plaintiff was involved in an accident with another vehicle as he attempted to make a right turn onto Michigan Avenue from Washington Street. The other vehicle was driven by Keianna Stone (\"Stone\"), a non-City employee. The accident occurred sometime between 10:50 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. Plaintiff was in the outside lane when he was attempting to make a right turn onto Michigan Avenue, and Stone was in the inside lane. The inside lane was partially blocked by cones due to construction, and as a result, Stone made an extra wide turn to avoid the cones and made contact with the City vehicle. Plaintiff informed Chao that he had been involved in an accident, and Chao came to the scene of the accident. At that time, Chao observed damage to both the City vehicle and the other vehicle. Chao took most of the passengers who had been riding in Plaintiff's vehicle with him and drove them the rest of the way to the Clarke House Museum. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before he left, Chao instructed Plaintiff to report the accident to the Chicago Police Department and not to leave the scene of the accident until a police report was generated; Plaintiff did as instructed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.] By 11:10 a.m., Officer Mark Mirabelli arrived on scene and spoke to both Plaintiff and Stone in order to determine what had occurred. He examined both vehicles and completed an Illinois Motorist Report,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a police report. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.] Officer Mirabelli provided Plaintiff a copy of the police report at the scene of the accident. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Within approximately an hour (and no later than 12:30 p.m.), Lorick became aware of Plaintiff's accident and called him in for a meeting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.] Chao, and later Trick, were also present for the meeting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Chao attended the meeting as Plaintiff's supervisor, and not as a witness to the accident. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] During the meeting, Lorick brought up the Policy and drug testing under the post-accident prong of the Policy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.] While Lorick and Plaintiff disagree exactly where the following conversation took place, Plaintiff testified before the HRB that after Lorick explained that she was going to have to send him for testing Plaintiff admitted that he might have a hot drop and admitted\n   that he had previously consumed drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [17-4, at 76:17-77:16, 78:7-16.] However, Plaintiff did not provide all the specifics of the drug use until the following Monday, which was after he took the drug test. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:21-78:2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the conversation, Lorick informed Plaintiff that he had the option to undergo testing or to refuse testing, but that a refusal would be considered a positive drug test. [33, \u00b6 36.] Chao proceeded to read the Voluntary Consent and Notice of Physical and/or Drug or Alcohol Testing forms out loud to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.] Plaintiff then signed the forms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Immediately after the meeting, Chao and Trick accompanied Plaintiff to U.S. Healthworks' Downtown Clinic at 614 West Monroe, Chicago, Illinois to undergo drug testing. Upon their arrival, one of the men provided U.S. Healthworks' staff with a copy of the signed Notice of Physical and/or Drug or Alcohol Testing form and they completed the necessary registration forms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It took Plaintiff several hours to provide a urine sample. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.] Shavone McKinley-Jenkins, a patient registrar/medical assistant with U.S. Healthworks, collected Plaintiff's urine sample (\"specimen\") at around 3:20 p.m. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.] Plaintiff provided his urine sample in a controlled environment in the collection room, a private bathroom-like area with two separate stalls located in the back of the clinic. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.] The collection room was not accessible by the public, and no individuals other than Plaintiff entered and/or exited the collection room during the collection process. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Termination and HRB Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the City served Plaintiff with Statement of Charges and Explanation of Evidence (\"Charges\") charging him with violating the City of Chicago Personnel Rule XVIII, Section I, Subsections 14, 15, 24, 36, 50, and 51 because on or about March 10, 2017, the results of Plaintiff's drug and/or alcohol test(s) were positive for cocaine metabolites and marijuana metabolites, and thus, on or about March 10, 2017, Plaintiff was in possession of illegal drugs; and/or reported to work under the influence of illegal drugs; and/or used illegal drugs; and/or tested positive for illegal drugs. Plaintiff had an opportunity to respond to the Charges, and on April 13, 2017, he did so. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff continued to work until he was served with the Charges; however, he was no longer allowed to drive after March 10, 2017. On April 14, 2017, Plaintiff was discharged from the DCASE for his March 10, 2017 post-accident positive drug test. Plaintiff went on no-pay status as of that date. On April 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed his written request for a hearing with the HRB. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   HRB Hearing Officer Roger Balla presided over three days of hearing on June 8, 2017, July 13, 2017, and July 28, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.] On September 2, 2017, Balla issued his Hearing Officer's Report, in which he concluded that the City had proved by a preponderance of evidence that Plaintiff had violated Personnel Rule XVIII, Section I, Subsections 14, 15, 36, 50, and 51 and that the City did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Plaintiff had violated Personnel Rule XVIII, Section I, Subsection 24. Accordingly, he recommended the HRB uphold Plaintiff's discharge. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.] On October 17, 2017,\n   the HRB heard oral arguments by the parties, and on or about October 24, 2017, the HRB upheld Plaintiff's discharge. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a two-count complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, 2017 CH 17019, seeking reversal of the HRB's decision under a common law writ of certiorari (Count I) and asserting claims under the Illinois and federal constitutions (Count II). [1-1, 1-11.] On January 18, 2018, the City removed the suit to this court. [1.] On August 17, 2018, the City moved for summary judgment on Count II. [23.] The same day, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on Count I. [34.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is proper where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Rule 56 makes clear that whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the Court must construe all facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor (here, Plaintiff).\n   <em>\n    Majors v.

Rule 56(a)\"mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against any party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party would bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

For this reason, the Seventh Circuit has called summary judgment the \"put up or shut up\" moment in a lawsuit-\"when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of events.\" See\n   <em>\n    Steen v.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Wrightsell v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%20106608\">\n    1989 WL 106608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 7, 1989) (concluding the city had reasonable suspicion to test police officer for drugs after officer's girlfriend informed a police sergeant that he had snorted cocaine in her presence two days earlier, even though the testing did not occur until more than 10 days after the officer had allegedly taken the drugs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Whether or not Plaintiff made these statements after Lorick signed the paperwork sending him to be tested [see 17-4, at 78:7-16] would not change the analysis. The search of Plaintiff did not occur until (at the earliest) he was taken to U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Healthworks' Downtown Clinic for testing, if not until he actually provided the sample. Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff informed Lorick that any drug test might come back positive suggests that he believed no final decision had been made regarding the test and that Lorick could still change her mind. Indeed, common sense dictates that Plaintiff initiated the discussion about the prospect of a \"hot\" test in the hope that Lorick might give him a break by postponing (or waiving) the test. Of course, Plaintiff's admission placed Lorick in a difficult spot to say the least, for if she had looked the other way, she might have jeopardized her own job (and public safety) if Plaintiff had used drugs again and then gotten into a more serious accident. Furthermore, nothing would have stopped Lorick from discarding the initial testing form that she had just prepared and writing up a new order sending Plaintiff for testing based upon reasonable suspicion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The axiomatic rule that evidence gathered after a search cannot be used to justify the search post-hoc, see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Whitley v.

This incident is no different than if an individual, in response to an officer's statement that he needed to search the car, admitted that a search of the car might result in the discovery of an illegal firearm or drugs. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant volunteered probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found on the premises.\"). Even if Lorick could not have tested Plaintiff pursuant to Policy's post-accident provision, a question the Court does not reach, Plaintiff volunteered the reasonable suspicion necessary to test him by making the comments outlined above. Consequently, his urine test did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

But the more fundamental problem with this contention is the absence of any mention of such a claim in Plaintiff's complaint. The entire focus of Count II in Plaintiff's complaint was that the City's post-accident policy-and thus Plaintiff's compelled test pursuant to that policy- were unconstitutional. He has never placed the City on notice of a claim that the termination proceedings themselves deprived him of due process, and he cannot spring such a claim on the City in a brief in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Car Carriers, Inc. v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Patrick\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the fact that the Court has determined that the Plaintiff's drug test was constitutional does not dispose of Plaintiff's arguments regarding the HRB's consideration of allegedly inadmissible evidence, or whether the HRB made the necessary findings to support its conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that none of the exceptions to the \"usual practice\" applies in this case. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment without prejudice and dismisses Count I with leave to refile both in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, the City's motion for summary judgment on the sole federal claim in Count II [31] is granted. The state law claim raised in Count I of\n   Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on that count [34] is denied without prejudice to refiling in state court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Because the Court only addresses Plaintiff's claims in Count II, the Court has not included facts relevant to Count I alone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiff's objection to the inclusion of any facts suggesting that Plaintiff admitted to the drug use and the Court's reliance on these facts are addressed below in Section III(A)(1)\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    As Plaintiff concedes, the evidence before the Court on the \u00a7 1983 claim is not limited to the question of what was before the HRB, but rather includes all the evidence set forth by the parties. Thus, the Court must examine all the evidence before it to determine whether Plaintiff's constitutional rights were violated, and not simply the administrative record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Because \u00a7 1983 only provides a right of action for violations of federal law, see\n    <em>\n     Flynn v. Sandahl\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409494\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/283/#p290\">\n     58 F.3d 283\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 290 (7th Cir. 1995), the Court cannot consider any claims for violations of the Illinois Constitution under that count. And, in any event, it appears there is no private right of action under Article I, Section 2 or Section 6 of the Illinois Constitution. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Bonnstetter v. City of Chicago\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203687539\">\n     2014 WL 3687539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (N.D. Ill. July 24, 2014) (collecting cases), aff'd,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081332\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/969/\">\n     811 F.3d 969\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (7th Cir. 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that the Policy violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , it is unconstitutionally vague, and because it vests too much discretion to determine who to test in his supervisors. See [44, at 2-7.] However, the Court need not reach those arguments because it concludes that Plaintiff's supervisor, Lorick, had reasonable suspicion to justify the drug test under the Fourth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Plaintiff has not suggested the test itself was unreasonable, but rather asserts that the fact that he was required to submit for a urinalysis at all was unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Similarly, the Policy states, \"The city may require testing of an employee for whom there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee has used drugs or alcohol or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at work, on City property or on City business.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Lorick's failure to write up a new order-and her general unfamiliarity with the requirements and contours of the Fourth Amendment jurisdiction-is precisely why the Supreme Court has not required strict compliance with the Fourth Amendment's warrant procedures in government employer testing cases. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Skinner\n    </em>\n    , 489 U.S. at 623,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p617\">\n     109 S.Ct. 1402\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The Government's need to rely on private railroads to set the testing process in motion also indicates that insistence on a warrant requirement would impede the achievement of the Government's objective. * * * Railroad supervisors * * * are not in the business of investigating violations of the criminal laws or enforcing administrative codes, and otherwise have little occasion to become familiar with the intricacies of this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff's drug test was constitutional based on Lorick's reasonable suspicion, it need not, and does not, address the substantial and numerous questions regarding whether he could be tested under the City's \"post-accident policy.\" Nor does the Court address whether a challenge to his testing under that provision would be a facial or as as-applied challenge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
