(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss (Dkt. 62); Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Mem.\") (Dkt. 64).) For the reasons that follow, the City Defendants' motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff joined the Kings County District Attorney's Office (\"KCDA\") as an Assistant District Attorney (\"ADA\") in January 2006. (FAC \u00b6 20.) She worked with Lenich in KCDA's \"Red Zone Trial Bureau,\" a general practice bureau, from approximately 2007 until 2012, when Lenich transferred to the Special Investigations Bureau. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff was transferred to the KCDA School Advocacy Bureau in July 2016, where she remained until she left KCDA in May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From 2014 until his death on October 9, 2016, Thompson served as the District Attorney for Kings County, and Gonzalez served as the Deputy District Attorney. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Since October 9, 2016, Gonzalez has served as the District Attorney. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) At all relevant times, Schaeffer was an Executive Bureau Chief and Donohue was an Assistant Deputy Chief Investigator, both within KCDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) John/Jane Does 1-5 are alleged to have been employees of KCDA with responsibility for setting and implementing KCDA policy with respect to overseeing wiretap operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) John/Jane Does 6-10 are alleged to have been employees of\n   KCDA who used and/or disclosed Plaintiff's private communications knowing that they were unlawfully obtained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From May 2015 through November 28, 2016, Lenich was the Deputy Bureau Chief in charge of Special Investigations at KCDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff alleges the following upon information and belief: Lenich reported to Schaeffer, but had the authority to report and make requests directly to the District Attorney (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27); Schaeffer, Thompson, and later Gonzalez were responsible for supervising Lenich and overseeing the investigations she was conducting and overseeing (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28); Lenich supervised between two and six ADAs as well as the KCDA wire room staff, which included KCDA employees and members of the New York City Police Department (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30); Lenich had the authority to set KCDA policy with respect to the operation of a wiretap, the oversight of wiretaps, the documentation required when conducting wiretaps, and reporting requirements of individuals working in the wire room (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32); and Lenich had final decision-making authority within KCDA over whether to seek a wiretap, how a wiretap was set up, and the operation of a wiretap (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in order to conduct a wiretap, ADAs at KCDA were required to file a wiretap application with a court, along with an affidavit demonstrating the requisite probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Pursuant to KCDA policy, a supervisor, such as Lenich, was required to approve these wiretap applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that once an order authorizing a wiretap is signed and sealed by a court, it is given to Donohue, who is responsible for ensuring that the order has all necessary signatures and a raised judicial seal and for setting up the wiretap in the KCDA wire room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) She also alleges upon information and belief that all KCDA wiretaps must be conducted out of the KCDA wire room (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38), and that KCDA policy did not permit wiretaps to be conducted using personal laptops (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). Finally, she alleges upon information and belief that a wiretap order typically authorizes a minimum of two ADAs, as well as all supervisors above them, to review the intercepted communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Only the individuals named in an authorizing order are permitted to review the communications intercepted pursuant to that order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges upon information and belief that Lenich used KCDA equipment and facilities to intercept, record, and review the oral and electronic communications sent to and/or from Plaintiff's cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Specifically, between approximately June 2015 and December 2015, Lenich intercepted and recorded communications sent to and from Plaintiff's private cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) To do so, Lenich forged the signature of New York State Supreme Court Justices on documents purporting to be judicial wiretap orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that Lenich showed these forged orders, none of which had raised judicial seals, to Donohue, who reviewed and accepted them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Plaintiff also alleges upon information and belief that Lenich and/or Donohue sent seven forged orders (or caused them to be sent) to Plaintiff's cell phone provider to allow for the interception and recording of the communications transmitted to and from Plaintiff's private cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) Lenich recorded and reviewed Plaintiff's private conversations with friends and family, none of whom consented to having those communications intercepted or recorded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-50.) In or about and between May 2015 and November 2016, Lenich also forged multiple search warrants authorizing the seizure of text messages sent to\n   and from Plaintiff's cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that Lenich used the forged search warrants to obtain and review text messages sent to and from Plaintiff's cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges upon information and belief that Lenich used information contained in Plaintiff's communications to harass and/or direct others to harass Plaintiff and her family and \"alienate affections.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From August 2015 through November 2016, Lenich also used forged court orders and other documents to intercept and record oral and electronic communications from another cell phone not belonging to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) The communications intercepted from this other phone included communications sent to and/or from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Plaintiff did not authorize the interception of such communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Thompson, Gonzalez, Schaeffer, and John/Jane Does 1-5 knew or should have known that Lenich was conducting an unlawful wiretapping scheme because Lenich submitted forged judicial orders to Donohue, these forged orders were stored in KCDA, she used KCDA equipment and facilities to conduct her operation, she claimed she was conducting a confidential law enforcement investigation that did not exist, and she needed the assistance of other KCDA employees to conduct this wiretapping operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that Lenich told other KCDA employees that the wiretapping operation against Plaintiff was part of a confidential law enforcement investigation, which was not true. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.) Plaintiff alleges that Schaeffer, Thompson, and Gonzalez knew that Lenich was not conducting any law enforcement operation against Plaintiff and that they were responsible for knowing what investigations Lenich was conducting at all times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges upon information and belief that Lenich was the subject of multiple EEOC complaints concerning her allegedly erratic and aggressive behavior from fellow ADAs during this period, and that Lenich was ordered to undergo sensitivity training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff alleges that these complaints and training alerted or should have alerted the Supervisory Defendants to monitor Lenich more closely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Plaintiff further alleges that the Supervisory Defendants' \"deliberate indifference\" to Lenich's misconduct violated Section 3-1.3 of the National Prosecution Standards, Third Edition, issued by the National District Attorneys Organization, which requires prosecutors who become aware that \"evidence has been illegally obtained\" to \"take affirmative steps to investigate and remediate such problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Plaintiff also alleges that their behavior violated Section 2.12(f) of the American Bar Association's Standards on Prosecutorial Investigations, which states that prosecutors need to stay informed about the activities of personnel using electronic surveillance and ensure that required procedures are being followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or around November 28, 2016, KCDA filed a criminal complaint in Kings County Criminal Court charging Lenich with two counts of eavesdropping under Penal Law \u00a7 250.05 and two counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree under Penal Law \u00a7 170.25. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) The complaint alleged that Lenich forged court orders authorizing eavesdropping and \"requested and was provided computerized access to review\" and did review communications over Plaintiff's cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) Plaintiff\n   learned on November 28. 2016, that her communications had been unlawfully intercepted, but alleges upon information and belief that Donohue and Supervisory Defendants knew about the interceptions and the fact that they were stored on Lenich's laptop prior to November 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.) Despite this alleged knowledge, they permitted Lenich continued access to Plaintiff's private communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lenich's arrest was covered extensively in the media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Plaintiff's name and the fact that Lenich had wiretapped her phone was leaked to the media and her name appeared in stories for multiple days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reporters staked out Plaintiff's home and \"accosted\" her and her family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Neither Plaintiff nor any party to the intercepted communications consented to anyone from KCDA using or disclosing Plaintiff's private communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) Nonetheless, Plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that Schaeffer, Gonzalez, Donohue, and Does 1-10 received, used, reviewed, and disclosed to one another and to others copies of communications that they knew had been unlawfully intercepted from Plaintiff's phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 6, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to KCDA requesting that KCDA: (1) provide her with a copy of all intercepted communications; (2) provide her with copies of all documentation used by Lenich to obtain and record her private communications; (3) destroy copies of the intercepted communications in the possession of KCDA or maintain all other copies under seal; (4) identify all individuals to whom copies of Plaintiff's private communications had been provided; (5) reveal the results of KCDA's search of Lenich's home and the likelihood that Lenich maintained copies of Plaintiff's communications; and (6) provide Plaintiff's counsel with notice of any attempt to review or obtain Plaintiff's intercepted communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) In response, KCDA refused to identify the individuals who reviewed Plaintiff's communications, return her communications, or confirm that copies had been destroyed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) Plaintiff alleges, upon information and belief, that Gonzalez disclosed or directed the disclosure of Plaintiff's communications to the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Plaintiff also alleges that in or around January 2018, KCDA disclosed her communications to a Justice of the New York Supreme Court (Justice Chun) without Plaintiff's authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) She alleges upon information and belief that the Supervisory Defendants authorized this disclosure, knowing that they had been illegally obtained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) KCDA currently maintains copies of Plaintiff's communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about March 27, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Lenich on two counts of illegal interception of communications in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202511\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), 2511(4)(a), and 3551,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) The indictment, attached to the complaint, alleged that Lenich \"without lawful authorization, knowingly and intentionally intercepted, endeavored to intercept and procured another person to intercept and endeavor to intercept the wire, oral and electronic communications\" of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) Lenich pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment on April 3, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff was forced to leave her job at KCDA in May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87, 89.) She felt she could no longer remain at KCDA because KCDA employees were gossiping about her, her supervisors looked at her differently, and defense attorneys and judges treated her differently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Plaintiff has made significant efforts, but\n   has not been able to find new employment due to the extensive media coverage she received as a result of the unlawful wiretapping operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) Plaintiff has been accosted by reporters in front of her home, including while she was with her children, has become afraid to walk in her neighborhood for fear that she is being followed or surveilled, and has had recurring dreams about being watched and followed, including by Lenich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.) In December 2017, Plaintiff submitted a Victim Impact Statement in connection with Lenich's sentencing in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) In it, she described her anxiety and the effect of media attention on her personal life, family, and career. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff served a written and sworn Notice of Claim upon Defendants within ninety days of Plaintiff's discovery of the unlawful wiretapping scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on December 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. 1).) She filed an amended complaint on February 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC.) The amended complaint asserts six causes of action. Plaintiff alleges first that all Defendants violated the ECPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and 2701\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-104.) She also brings \u00a7 1983 claims against Lenich and the City alleging a deprivation of her rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-108, 109-114.) Finally, Plaintiff asserts three state tort causes of action: negligent retention and supervision against the City and Thompson, Gonzalez, Schaeffer, and Does 1-5; negligence against the City, Thompson, Gonzalez, Schaeffer, Does 1-5, and Donohue; and tortious interference with employment against the City and Lenich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lenich answered the amended complaint on February 15, 2018. (Answer (Dkt. 24).)

However, at this stage, the court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that Donohue owed a duty to Plaintiff to exercise reasonable care in reviewing wiretap orders to ensure that they bore the proper indicia of authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, contrary to City Defendants' argument, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged a breach by Donohue of that duty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 25.) In particular, Plaintiff alleges that Donohue reviewed and accepted her forged orders, despite the fact that they lacked a raised judicial seal. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Plaintiff also attaches to her complaint the Indictment, which alleges that Lenich accomplished her forgeries by cutting out the signatures of judges and taping them to the wiretap orders, (Indictment \u00b6 7.) It is thus plausible to infer that, in the exercise of reasonable care, Donohue should have realized that Lenich was forging wiretap orders. Defendant counters that the absence of a raised judicial seal would not have put Donohue on notice of the forgery because there is no requirement in New York that wiretap orders bear a raised seal. (Mem. at 25 (citing N.Y.C.P.L. \u00a7 700.30 ).) Regardless of the legal requirements for eavesdropping orders in New York (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.Y.C.P.L. \u00a7 700.30 ), Plaintiff alleged that Donohue was responsible for ensuring the presence of a raised judicial seal.

(FAC \u00b6\u00b6 11, 36.) This allegation at least raises the possibility that Donohue might have had the ability to access the contents of intercepted communications, including those of Plaintiff. It is nonetheless insufficient to state a claim under the ECPA because, as explained\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege the existence of a disclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Plaintiff cites paragraph 74 for her contention that the complaint contains allegations that \"characterizations about the content of her communications ended up in newspaper articles.\" (Pl.

Plaintiff also points to allegations in paragraph 95 to bolster her claim that the complaint alleged a leak of her private communications; however, the relevant portions of paragraph 95 largely speak to Plaintiff's subjective beliefs about what others were thinking after they learned she was Lenich's victim. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 95.)

She also states that \"defense attorneys and judges tr[ied] to talk to [her] about what happened,\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Neither of these paragraphs indicate that the contents of her communications leaked to the media or her colleagues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    For example, Plaintiff does not point to a single news article that discusses the contents of her communications, nor does she cite any comments by coworkers indicating awareness of the contents of her communications.

The court declines to consider the transcript because it \"is not integral to or otherwise incorporated in the complaint\" (which was filed before the sentencing hearing was held), and because consideration of it may raise a material issue of fact that is inappropriate on a motion to dismiss-namely, Lenich's motivation in intercepting Plaintiff's communications.\n    <em>\n     Nicosia v.
