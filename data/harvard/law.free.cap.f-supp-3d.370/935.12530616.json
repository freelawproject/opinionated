She claimed that she became disabled as of December 22, 2010 (R. 201), due to post traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal tendencies, diabetes, hypertension, and a stroke. (R. 266). Over the ensuing three years, plaintiff's application was denied at every level of administrative review: initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge (ALJ), and appeals council. It is the ALJ's decision that is before the court for review.

[Dkt. # 5]. The case was recently reassigned to me on January 10, 2019. [Dkt. # 27]. Plaintiff asks the court to reverse and remand the Commissioner's decision, while the Commissioner seeks an order affirming the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was 59 years old at the time of the ALJ's decision. (R. 33, 207). She has an excellent work history, working steadily from 1982 through 2011 (R. 231), most recently in custodial services with the Chicago public schools, but prior to that, for nearly 25 years as a fleet service clerk for American Airlines. (R. 254). The fleet service work was heavy work, and involved loading and unloading planes, cleaning cabins, de-icing, and driving trucks to transport cargo. (R. 51, 256). Plaintiff left that job following a sexual assault; she started forgetting what she was supposed to do and could no longer keep up with the pace of the job. 9R. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff has accumulated over 600 pages of medical evidence (R. 332-942) - covering treatment for a number of issues. As is generally the case, however, the parties indicate that only a small percentage of it is pertinent. Plaintiff cites to about three dozen pages of treatment records to support her argument for overturning the ALJ's decision. (Dkt. # 11, at 2-4, 8). The Commissioner cites to about twenty pages. (Dkt. # 21, at 5, 12-15). Accordingly, we will dispense with a tedious summary and discuss only those doctor visits and medical findings that the parties tell us matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After an administrative hearing - at which plaintiff, represented by counsel, and a vocational expert testified - the ALJ determined she was not disabled. The ALJ found that plaintiff had several severe impairments: \"hypertension ; diabetes mellitus ; obesity ; arthritis of the right knee; history of transient ischemia attack; posttraumatic stress disorder ; and depression.\" (R. 21). Plaintiff's psychological impairments caused mild limitations in the areas of understanding, remembering, and applying information; interacting with others; and adapting or managing oneself. (R. 22). She had a moderate limitation in concentrating, persisting and maintaining pace. (R. 22). None of plaintiff's impairments, singly or in combination, amounted to a condition that met or equaled an impairment assumed to be disabling in the Commissioner's listings. (R. 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The ALJ then determined that plaintiff could perform \"medium work ... except the claimant is able to lift, carry, push and pull 25 pounds frequently and 50 pounds occasionally; she is able to stand and walk for six hours and sit for six hours out of an eight hour day; she is able to frequently climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; she is able to occasionally climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; she is limited to no work around unprotected heights, open flames or dangerous and or moving machinery; and she is limited to work involving simple routine instructions and tasks.\" (R. 23). The ALJ summarized the medical evidence and found plaintiff's \"medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, [her] statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record for reasons explained in this decision.\" (R. 24). The ALJ said the medical evidence did not support her allegations, she was non-compliant with treatment, and uncooperative with the state agency in regard to completing daily activity forms. (R. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ALJ gave some weight to the opinions from the state agency medical consultants that reviewed the medical record, finding they were supported by the medical evidence. (R. 30). She parted company with those reviewing doctors in regard to plaintiff's obesity which she accommodated with further postural limitations. (R. 31). The ALJ gave no weight to a statement from a doctor who examined plaintiff on one occasion and found she was temporarily disabled. The doctor was not a treating source, the statement failed to indicate any specific limitations, and was on a topic reserved for the Commissioner. (R. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Next, the ALJ found that plaintiff unable to perform her past relevant work as a fleet service clerk, because of environmental restriction against working around moving machinery. (R. 31). The work also involved more than simple routine instructions and tasks. (R. 31). Additionally, the ALJ found that plaintiff was 53 years old when she claimed she became disabled, and that made her an individual \"closely approaching advanced age\" at that time under the Commissioner's regulations. (R. 31) ). She had since moved into the category of \"advanced age.\" (R. 31). Given a full capacity to perform medium work, transferability of job skills was not an issue, plaintiff would be found \"not disabled\" under the Medical Vocational Guidelines. (R. 31). As she did not, the ALJ relied on the testimony of the vocational expert who said that an individual with plaintiff's restrictions could perform work as a hand packager, cleaner, or laundry worker. (R. 31). As these jobs exist in significant numbers in the national economy, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not disabled and\n   was not entitled to benefits under the Act. (R. 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If the ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the court on judicial review must uphold that decision even if the court might have decided the case differently in the first instance.

In any event, though, a remand is required. As such, we won't go through the entire opinion or the entire, massive medical record, or address all of plaintiff's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin with the ALJ's RFC finding. Plaintiff, the ALJ found, has severe arthritis in her right knee and severe obesity. (R. 21). Her BMI has ranged from 37.4 to 44.6; she is either morbidly obese or nearly so, based on readings the ALJ cited from the record. (R. 21);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning v.

She was 59 when the ALJ denied her claim. Yet, despite the combination of morbid obesity and severe arthritis of the knee, the ALJ found that plaintiff could climb ramps and stairs and kneel and crawl between one-third and two-thirds of every day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 83-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2031251\">\n    1983 WL 31251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (1983). She could, the ALJ found, also climb ropes and scaffolds up to one-third of every day. The ALJ's finding brings to mind the Seventh Circuit's commentary in\n   <em>\n    Goins v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182366\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/677/#p682\">\n    764 F.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (7th Cir. 2014) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If we thought the Social Security Administration and its lawyers had a sense of humor, we would think it a joke for its lawyer to have said in its brief that the administrative law judge \"accommodated [the plaintiff's] obesity by providing that she could never [be required as part of her work duties to] climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and could only occasionally climb ramps or stairs, balance, kneel, crawl, stoop, and/or crouch.\" ... Does the SSA think that if only the plaintiff were thin, she could climb ropes?

Here, the ALJ said, with apparent seriousness, that she accommodated plaintiff's obesity and other impairments not by eliminating activities like climbing stairs or ropes or scaffolds,\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   merely by reducing them to perhaps a few hours a day or, in the case of rope-climbing, no more than about two hours a day. It is unfortunate but obvious that the ALJ failed to consider all of plaintiff's impairments in combination, as she was required to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goins v.

Along the way to arriving at her RFC finding, the ALJ determined that plaintiff had moderate limitations on her ability to concentrate, persist, or maintain pace. (R. 22). The ALJ attempted to account for this by limiting plaintiff to \"work involving simple, routine instructions and tasks.\" (R. 23, 31). The Commissioner thinks that did the trick, arguing that case law is such that a limitations to simple, routine work \"may adequately accommodate a moderate limitation in the areas of concentration, persistence, and pace where the medical evidence does not support a finding of 'significant problems' in that functional area.\" [Dkt. # 21, at 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We disagree with the Commissioner and follow the Seventh Circuit's thinking on this issue, recently voiced in\n   <em>\n    Moreno v.

Many unskilled, simple jobs are made up of precisely this type of tedium. Those of a certain age might recall the classic Lucille Ball-Vivian Vance sketch where the two were tasked with wrapping candies coming down a conveyor at a candy factory. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NPzLBSBzPI. The job is exceedingly simple. It is repetitive, routine, and unskilled. But for one whose concentration waxes and wanes, or cannot persist or maintain a pace throughout the day, it is a daunting if not impossible occupation. This is why a limitation to unskilled, simple work does not necessarily account for a limitation in concentration. It's also why this case has to be remanded to the Commissioner for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the hearing, the ALJ didn't include any restriction stemming from a moderate limitation in concentration, persistence, or maintaining pace in her hypothetical to the vocational expert, not even a faulty restriction to simple, routine work.

Indeed, based on the briefs filed here, it's not clear either side ever picked up on what the ALJ did. [Dkt. # 21, at 10-11 (referring to the ALJ's hypothetical but neither quoting it nor citing to the record); # 22, at 5 (arguing \"that the ALJ did not include any mental restrictions in the hypothetical to the VE\" and citing hearing record) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As it stands, the vocational expert's opinion that plaintiff could be a hand packager, a cleaner, or a laundry worker wasn't swayed by the addition of a restriction to work involving \"simple, routine instructions and tasks.\" (R. 74-74, 315). But, can she do that work? Let's look at hand packager. According to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, which the vocational expert and ALJ relied upon, hand packager involves working with a conveyor. https://occupationalinfo.org/92/920587018.html. It involves loading materials into \"processing machines\" and \"tending packing machines and equipment.\" The most important ability in the job is the ability to \"quickly make coordinated movements of\" the hand and arm.\n   <em>\n    https://occupationalinfo.org/onet/98902a.html.\n   </em>\n   As described in the DOT, this type of work is problematic for someone who has trouble maintaining concentration persistence and pace, as was pointed out earlier.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning v.

Moreover, the ALJ found - and told the vocational expert - that plaintiff could not work around moving machinery. Hand packager clearly involves working with moving machinery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As is often the case, the descriptions and boxcar numbers for the jobs the vocational expert and the ALJ cited are suspect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517679\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/962/#p968\">\n    895 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   963 ;\n   <em>\n    Allensworth v.

The hand packager and laundry worker entries were last updated in 1977, over 40 years ago. https://occupationalinfo.org/36/361685018.html As the Seventh Circuit said in another \"hand packager case,\" \"[i]f these job titles sound obscure, that is a fair reaction, as they come from 1977.\"\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517679\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/962/#p968\">\n    895 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
