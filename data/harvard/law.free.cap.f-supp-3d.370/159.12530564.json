The case is currently before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18; Dkt. 20. The issues raised by those motions have been narrowed over the course of briefing, and the only remaining question before the Court is whether the Department lawfully invoked FOIA Exemption 5-in particular, the deliberative process and attorney-client privileges-to withhold the disputed records or portions of records. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that it currently lacks sufficient information to decide this question with respect to the deliberative process privilege, and that, with one exception,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed material is premature. With respect to the Department's assertion of attorney-client privilege, however, the Court concludes that the Department has met its burden. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   in part both the Department's motion for summary judgment and Protect Democracy's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 15, 2017, Protect Democracy submitted a FOIA request to the Department seeking the following records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) Documents between and among employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and/or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") \"concerning the decision to discontinue advertising for healthcare.gov and/or enrollment in healthcare coverage;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (2) Documents between the HHS and/or CMS transition teams and the White House concerning the same;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (3) Documents between and among employees of HHS and/or CMS \"concerning the effect of the Trump Administration's decision to discontinue the advertising detailed above on enrollment numbers;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (4) Documents between and among employees of the HHS Office of Public Affairs and/or CMS Offices of Communications \"concerning the article published by\n   <em>\n    Politico\n   </em>\n   on January 26, 2017 entitled, 'Trump White House Abruptly Halts Obamacare Ads;' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (5) Documents between and among employees of HHS and/or CMS \"concerning the number of people who enrolled in healthcare coverage after President Trump took office;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (6) Documents between HHS and/or CMS employees and the White House concerning the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dkt. 1 at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6 5). When the Department did not timely respond to the request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i), Protect Democracy commenced this action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.). Subsequently, the Department\n   conducted a search for responsive records and released 274 pages of records to Protect Democracy, redacting certain portions pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5. Dkt. 18-1 at 7. This initial production consisted of 33 pages located in the files of the Office of the Secretary-which the Department refers to as the \"HHS production\"-and 241 pages of records located in the files of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\")-which the Department refers to as the \"CMS production.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20 at 11-12; Dkt. 25 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 15, 2017, the Department moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 18, and on January 23, 2018, Protect Democracy filed its cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 20. In its cross-motion, Protect Democracy argued both that (1) the Department did not conduct an adequate search, and (2) the Department unlawfully redacted numerous records pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5. Dkt. 20 at 21. With respect to the redacted material, Protect Democracy requested that the Court order the Department to re-produce the relevant records without the improper redactions and to produce a more detailed\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index (or, in the alternative, to submit the unredacted versions of the relevant records to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After reviewing Protect Democracy's opposition and cross-motion, the Department requested an extension of time to file its final brief so that it could conduct further searches for potentially responsive records, Dkt. 22, and the Court granted that request, Minute Order (Feb. 21, 2018). The Department then conducted supplemental searches and released an additional 256 pages of responsive records. Dkt. 27 at 12. At the same time, moreover, the Department reconsidered some of its prior withholdings and released unredacted copies of a handful of documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This effort had the desired effect of narrowing the scope of the dispute, and Protect Democracy withdrew its challenge to the adequacy of the Department's searches and its challenge with respect to the records that the Department re-released without redactions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Protect Democracy, however, continues to challenge the Department's invocation of Exemption 5, arguing that, with respect to some redactions, it is evident that the Department has misapplied Exemption 5 and that, as to others, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and supporting declarations offer insufficient detail to permit Protect Democracy or the Court to determine whether the redactions were lawful.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sole remaining issue before the Court is whether the Department lawfully redacted various records-in both its initial and supplemental productions-pursuant to Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Dkt. 25 at 21. That is correct, as far as it goes.

Because such boilerplate descriptions are unmoored from the specific rationale for, or the content of, the relevant redactions, they fail to provide the Court with \"a reasonable basis to evaluate the claim of privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallant v.

In other words, the problem is not that each\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   entry is identical; the problem is that the entries lack sufficient detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , and for much the same reason, the Department fails to make an adequate showing regarding the function and significance of the withheld material to any agency deliberations. As noted above, in both the initial and supplemental HHS productions, the Department \"invoked th[e] privilege to protect deliberative recommendations concerning the discontinuation of certain advertisements for healthcare.gov.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dkt. 18-2 at 7 (Marquis Decl. \u00b6 17); Dkt. 25-1 at 8 (Bell Decl. \u00b6 19). The\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices, with minor exception, simply repeat this conclusory assertion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-2 at 110-13 (Ex. 10); Dkt. 25-1 at 245-55 (Ex. 3). But that description says nothing of the role the documents played in the deliberative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In this respect, the Department's descriptions of the materials withheld from the CMS productions fare better, although they also lack important detail. Most of the entries in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index mirror the uninformative entries provided for the HHS productions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-3 at 11-23 (Ex. 1); Dkt. 25-2 at 41-42 (Ex. 3). The relevant declarations, however, offer additional detail, noting, for example, that some of the redactions were made because the relevant documents were drafts, subject to further review, edit, and modification, and others were made because the records were emails reflecting \"back and forth discussions between federal employees providing comment, opinion, and recommendations on various subject matter,\" Dkt. 18-3 at 8 (Gilmore Decl. \u00b6 19);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25-2 at 6 (Second Gilmore Decl. \u00b6 17). But even this detail is inadequate, because it is not tied to specific records or redactions and because it provides little insight regarding the nature of the withheld material. Knowing that the redactions include back and forth discussions providing recommendations on various topics or show the creation and review of drafts is helpful, but is not enough to permit the Court to determine whether each redaction at issue is consistent with FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , in order to show that redactions reflect recommendations, rather than agency decisions, the agency must provide information relating to \"the positions in the chain of command of the parties to the documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Arthur Andersen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631219,553070\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/254/\">\n    679 F.2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, although the redacted records do disclose the names and offices of the senders and recipients, the Department never explains who these individuals are, nor, more importantly, what role they played in the relevant discussions.

The accompanying declaration provides no additional information with respect to this redaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Protect Democracy is, understandably, perplexed by the Department's invocation of the deliberative process privilege here. It argues that \"[t]he context is clear that for both sets of talking points\"-the on the record talking points, and the \"background\" talking points-\"the decision had already been made as to what to provide to the press.\" Dkt. 27 at 10. The fact\n   that the second set of talking points were provided on \"background,\" Protect Democracy further argues, has no bearing on whether that material was deliberative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The deliberative process privilege, after all, applies only to \"communications that are pre-decisional[,] deliberative,\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

The Court cannot make that determination, however, on the present record, and Protect Democracy has made at least a prima facie showing that the redacted material was in final form. The Court will, accordingly, direct that the Department submit an unredacted version of the email to the Court for ex parte,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Cir. 1984) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Department withheld or redacted only a handful of records based on an assertion of attorney-client privilege. Protect Democracy, nonetheless, argues that the Department \"may ... have over-applied\" the attorney-client privilege. Dkt. 20 at 24. In particular, Protect Democracy objects to the Department's invocation of the attorney-client privilege with respect to \"a communication from non-lawyer Mark Weber to four other non-lawyers ... and three block redactions of text that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index describes as attorney-client communications without reference to the communication containing legal advice.\" Dkt. 27 at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The redacted versions of the first two of these documents, Dkt. 18-2 at 77 (Ex. 9);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 79 (Ex. 9), merely show that Mark Weber, who was the Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the relevant time, Dkt. 18-2 at 6 (Marquis Decl. \u00b6 14), forwarded two emails to Michael Marquis, who is the FOIA officer for the Office of the Secretary,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (Marquis Decl. \u00b6 1), and who, presumably, received the emails for purposes of responding to Protect Democracy's FOIA request. The underlying emails, including address information, are redacted in their entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-2 at 77 (Ex. 9);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 79 (Ex. 9). The\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, moreover, does not identify who sent or received the redacted emails, and it merely asserts that the \"redacted material discloses communications between [the Office of General Counsel (\"OGC\") ] and CMS concerning the possibility of discontinuing certain advertisements for healthcare.gov.\" Dkt. 18-2 at 110-11 (Ex. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The accompanying declaration, in turn, merely repeats this description.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Marquis Decl. \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The second two documents, in contrast, reveal the underlying email header. The first of these is an email from Mark Weber to two Department employees, with two other employees listed on the cc line. Dkt. 18-2 at 99 (Ex. 9). None of these employees is identified as associated with the OGC, and the only substance that is revealed simply states: \"Jeff - when you get a chance give me a call.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ex. 9). The second is an email from Weber to Michael Goulding, whose email address is associated with the OGC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101 (Ex. 9). The only disclosed portion of this email says: \"Contact info ... Thanks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ex. 9). The redacted portion appears below the signature line, suggesting that it was copied or forwarded from another email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Ex. 9). The\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and supporting declaration, once again, merely assert that the redacted materials disclose \"communications between OGC and CMS concerning the possibility of discontinuing certain advertisements for healthcare.gov.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112 (Ex. 10);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Marquis Decl. \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Recognizing that this information was too limited to support an assertion of attorney-client privilege, the Department filed a supplemental declaration along with its reply brief and opposition to Protect Democracy's cross-motion. Dkt. 25-1 (Bell Decl.). That declaration attests as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   HHS invoked [the attorney-client] privilege to protect confidential communications between agency officials and counsel with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for purposes of obtaining legal advice, including where the contents of those communications with counsel were subsequently disseminated and discussed among agency officials, concerning any legal ramifications related to the possibility of discontinuing certain advertisements for healthcare.gov. In this declaration, I am clarifying that the attorney-client privileged information was withheld from the September 2017 release (previously described in the declaration of Michael S. Marquis submitted in this matter) on this basis: confidential communications between OGC and CMS relating to OGC's professional legal advice on the discontinuation of advertisements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dkt. 25-1 at 8-9 (Bell Decl. \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With this clarification, the Court is persuaded that the Department lawfully withheld redacted portions of the four documents based on Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege. Although the Department has not, with one exception, identified the specific lawyer who provided the relevant legal advice, it has attested that the Department's Office of General Counsel provided legal advice to CMS. It has attested that the redacted communications were \"confidential\" and that they were either for the purpose \"of obtaining legal advice\" or to disseminate and discuss that advice with other agency officials. Dkt. 25-1 at 8-9 (Bell Decl. \u00b6 20). And it has explained that the advice at issue related to \"any legal ramifications related to ... discontinuing [the] advertisements for healthcare.gov.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In short, the Department has carried its burden on showing that the communications were between a law office-the Office of the General Counsel-and a client-CMS (or was passed along to other agency officials); that those communications were \"confidential;\" and that they were either for the purpose of securing or disseminating legal advice. Nothing more is required to maintain the privilege.\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670102,3799711\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/94/\">\n    737 F.2d at 98-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Protect Democracy, moreover, does not seem to dispute that an attestation by a knowledgeable official that \"the withheld\n   communications contained 'confidential communications between OGC and CMS concerning legal advice related to the possibility of discontinuing certain advertisements for healthcare.gov' \" would suffice. Dkt. 27 at 9 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Dkt. 25-2 at 42 (Ex. 3) ). Protect Democracy merely contends that the Department failed to make such a showing with respect to its initial production. Dkt. 27 at 9-10. For the reasons explained above, the Court disagrees and, accordingly, concludes that the Department has carried its burden with respect to the attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Department's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 18, is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part. Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 20, is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Protect Democracy seems to concede that some of the Department's\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    index entries are sufficient, making it difficult to discern which documents remain at issue.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Dkt. 27 at 8. If the Department renews its motion and Protect Democracy files a second cross-motion, Protect Democracy should identify with specificity the discrete withholdings or redactions that it is contesting.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Protect Democracy objects, for example, to the Department's decision to withhold portions of \"a list of Open Enrollment activities planned for the next two weeks,\" which was apparently developed during the closing days of the Obama administration. Dkt. 25-1 at 192-93 (Ex. 1);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 27 at 10-11. According to Protect Democracy, \"[t]he Trump administration's decision to revisit this plan does not retroactively make it deliberative.\" Dkt. 27 at 10-11. At least on the present record, it is unclear whether that assertion is correct. The deliberative process privilege applies to \"agency\" deliberations, not to deliberations specific to a particular administration. The email at issue, moreover, was sent on January 23, 2017,\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the change in administrations occurred. It is entirely possible that, as of that date, no final decision had been made to go forward with the planned activities and that, even if others in the Department had previously decided to go forward, that decision was not final and remained subject to deliberations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
