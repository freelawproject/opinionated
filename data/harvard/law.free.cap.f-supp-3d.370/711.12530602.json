On March 2, 2018, the court conducted a hearing on the motions at which all parties were represented by counsel. Having reviewed and considered the motions, responsive and supplemental filings, arguments of counsel, and applicable law, the court renders the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The bone cave harvestman (\"harvestman\") is a tiny, pale, orange, eyeless, almost invisible, spider-like species that spends its entire life underground. It derives its nutrition from bugs, moisture, and other nutrients that filter down from the surface. It is an elusive spider known to inhabit only Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas and does not often reveal itself to even the most skilled observer. Because of the harvestman's limited population and\n   fragile nature, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"the Service\") listed the species as endangered in 1993. This case arises out of Plaintiffs (\"the Stewards\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Plaintiff-Intervenors' (\"Yearwood\") request to remove the harvestman from the endangered-species list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

THE HARVESTMAN'S EARLY LISTING HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 1988, the Service determined that five species of karst invertebrate should be protected by the Act, including the bee creek cave harvestman.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C029\">\n    53 Fed. Reg. 36,029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01 (Sept. 16, 1988). At that time, the bee creek cave harvestman was known to exist only in five or six caves in Travis and Williamson Counties. The Service found in its 1988 listing that the gravest threat to these karst invertebrates was habitat destruction and modification due to urbanization. The Service posited that residential, commercial, and industrial development affected the entire known range of the species. Potential threats to the species from development activities included cave collapse or filling; alteration of drainage patterns; alteration of surface plant and animal communities; contamination of the habitat, including groundwater, from nearby agricultural disturbance, pesticides, fertilizers, and other runoff; and increased human visitation and vandalism. The Service also found that the species was threatened because no laws protected the species or their habitats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It was not until 1993 that the Service determined that bee creek cave harvestman is actually two species, the bee creek harvestman and the bone cave harvestman. The Service formally extended the 1988 listing to include the bone cave harvestman in 1993.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043%2C818\">\n    58 Fed. Reg. 43,818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01 (Aug. 18, 1993). At that time, the Service found that both species continued to face the same threats identified in the original 1988 listing determination, including imperiled habitats due to urbanization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043%2C818\">\n    58 Fed. Reg. at 43,819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 1993, the Service received and denied the first petition to delist the harvestman. So began a 25-year\n   process to delist the harvestman as more locations of the spider were discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 1994, the Service completed a Karst Invertebrate Recovery Plan for Travis and Williamson Counties, which included recovery criteria for the harvestman. The Service examined the threats facing the species, including threats posed by urbanization to the harvestman's habitat. At that time, the Service noted the harvestman's potential for complete recovery and delisting of the species was uncertain. The plan identifies steps and benchmarks that must be met before the harvestman can be reclassified from endangered to threatened.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2009, the Service completed a five-year species-status review, as required by the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). The purpose of such review is to determine whether a species' status has changed since it was last evaluated, including whether it should be delisted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.21\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The Service determined that no change in listing status was warranted at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. 2014 PETITION AND 2017 FINDING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A petition to delist a species must provide available information about past and present population figures and distribution of an endangered species, threats faced by the species, and information about the status of the species over a significant portion of its range.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (2014). In 2014, the Stewards petitioned the Service to remove the harvestman from the endangered-species list. The petition presented evidence about the harvestman that corresponded to each of the statutory factors and contended that delisting was warranted for three primary reasons. First, the petition asserted that there were significant increases in the overall size of the harvestman's range and known of number of habitats. Second, new data indicates that the existence and magnitude of threats identified in the 1988 listing do not support the conclusion that the species is at risk of extinction now or in the foreseeable future. Third, significant local and state conservation efforts and laws have helped to achieve recovery of the harvestman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Service issued a 90-day finding, concluding that delisting was not warranted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C990\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 30,990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 1, 2015). On December 15, 2015, the Stewards filed this suit challenging the 2015 90-day finding. While the case was pending, the Service sought to voluntarily remand the case back to the Service to address an inadvertent clerical error in its decision, namely, in failing to examine certain reference materials in making its decision. This court granted the remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2017, the Service rendered a second 90-day finding, concluding that delisting was not warranted based on the evidence presented in the original 2014 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C861\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 20,861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -02 (May 4, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2017 finding supersedes the 2015 finding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C861\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 20,863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties now contest the 2017 finding. The evidence presented in the 2014 petition and the Service's response in the 2017 finding is summarized below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Factor 1: Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the harvestman's habitat or range\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The primary threat to the harvestman identified in 1988 was the potential loss of habitat because of threats posed by urbanization and development. Much of the evidence in the petition is intended to disprove this threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Stewards presents evidence of an increase in known locations of the harvestman from five or six at the time of the 1988 listing to 172 in 2014. This amounts to an increase at a rate of 7.59 new sites discovered per year and a total population increase of 3,340 percent. The Stewards also presents evidence of five caves that currently support the harvestman despite being located near developing areas, humans, and tourist attractions, which were all identified as threats to the survival of the species in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Inner Space Caverns\n   </em>\n   : This cave is located under a highway and train track, receives about 100,000 visitors per year, and includes paved walkways and electrical lighting. Surveys done on the cave show a continued presence of the harvestman despite heavy human traffic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Sun City Caves\n   </em>\n   : These caves are located near a residential subdivision and regularly monitored. One survey found an increase in fauna, and most surveys indicate that there has not been a substantial negative change in the population. Biologists continue to observe the harvestman during their surveys of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Weldon Cave\n   </em>\n   : The Service identified this cave in the 1988 listing as a concern because of a nearby road extension and residential development. In 1988, this cave was the only example given by the Service of the potentially adverse effects of development on the harvestman. The cave has since been identified by the Service as a sustainable habitat for the species.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Three-Mile and Four-Mile Caves\n   </em>\n   : The petition lists these caves as places where the harvestman persists despite being located underneath a highway. The interior of the walls are covered in historic graffiti, which indicates a steady stream of vandalism and human traffic throughout the years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The petition urges that, without affirmative evidence that development activities will lead to a significant reduction in the population size, the caves provide compelling evidence that the harvestman has continued to persist alongside development, contrary to the Service's conclusion at the time of listing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The petition also presents some evidence documenting the use of \"mesocaverns\" by the harvestman-a phenomenon that was not considered in the 1988 listing-as a potential habitat for the species. A mesocavern is a humanly impassable void that may or may not be connected to larger\n   cave passages. The discovery of mesocaverns as a habitat location is significant, the petition explains, because mesocaverns are geologically protected from development and other activities occurring on the surface that threaten the harvestman's habitat. The petition states that it is likely that there are at least 125 square miles of habitable mesocaverns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the petition argues that current available evidence demonstrates that the harvestman coexists with development and human traffic. The petition points out that no negative correlations have been found between development and a decline in the harvestman population. Since impacts of development are likely not as significant to the species as predicted by the Service in the 1988 listing, the petition argues that the harvestman should be delisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Service begins its discussion of\n   <em>\n    Factor 1\n   </em>\n   by restating that the primary threat to the harvestman is still the potential loss of its habitat due to development activities. The Service recognizes the five caves discussed in the petition. Nonetheless, the Service states that the observation of the harvestman in these locations is not proof that they are thriving or can withstand the long-term impacts of development activities. The Service acknowledges that it lacks adequate data to conduct a species-trend analysis, given that it may take decades to detect the harvestman's population trend because of small sample sizes, difficulty surveying the species, and its long life span. Nonetheless, the finding states that the petition does not provide the Service with adequate information to detect population trends. After concluding that there is not enough data to do a trend analysis, the Service addresses each of the caves presented in the petition.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Inner City Space Caverns\n   </em>\n   : The Service states that although the harvestman may be present at the caverns, their presence is not proof that the harvestman's population is robust and secure. The Service points out that, despite the harvestman's presence, the population may still be declining and at risk from threats arising from development. The Service also observes that the cavern has an overgrowth of algae that may out-compete the harvestman for food. The Service further states that the petition failed to provide enough data for the Service to assess trends in the harvestman in relation to the time that they have been exposed to artificial lighting in the cavern. The Service further observes that part of the cavern is located under a highway and train tracks, which both present a threat of contaminant spill that could impact the species in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Sun City Cave\n   </em>\n   : The Service states that the petition failed to provide enough data for the Service to assess the cumulative effect of the development on the harvestman's population trend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Weldon, Three-Mile, and Four-Mile Caves\n   </em>\n   : The Service points out that the Weldon cave is surrounded by undeveloped space, not developed space, as the petition asserts. The Service further states that detailed survey data was not provided by the petitioners for three or four-mile caves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Mesocaverns\n   </em>\n   : The Service states that it is unclear why the Stewards believes that mesocaverns are geologically protected from surface activities. It points to a study that mesocaverns are subject to rapid permeation of surface water. As a result, the harvestman would be as susceptible to groundwater contami\n   nation because water penetrates rapidly through the rock in mesocaverns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The finding additionally discusses a study conducted in 2007 that compares caves in urbanized areas with caves in natural areas to bolster the finding's conclusion about the effect of urbanization on the harvestman. The study found that, even though a small area within a largely urbanized ecosystem may support a cave community with karst invertebrates, karst populations are significantly lower than those found in caves in more natural, less-developed ecosystems. The study suggests that this is most likely a result of reduced nutrient input. The finding does not note whether the harvestman was specifically considered in the study. The finding also points to a study conducted at Lakeline Cave in Travis County, that documents a significant decline in another karst-invertebrate species over a 20-year time frame. During this same time frame, no more than three examples of the harvestman were observed in any one survey, and the harvestman was not seen at all over six years and 12 surveys. The finding concludes that urbanization and human population growth and development continue to represent a threat to the species, especially in light of the exploding population in the Austin area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Factor 2: Disease or predation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the 1988 finding, fire ants were identified by one study as being a potential competitor with the harvestman. The study predicted that threats posed by fire ants would be exacerbated as the human population increased. The petition presents evidence that fire ants have not been shown to have a lasting negative impact on the harvestman populations nor on the ability of the harvestman to persist in areas that contain fire ants. Specifically, the petition includes a discussion of studies conducted since the 1988 listing, which suggest that the impact to the harvestman by fire ants is greatest during and shortly after an initial fire-ant invasion, and long-term impacts are likely not as significant as once believed. The petition asserts this represents new scientific information that refutes previous conclusions drawn by the Service about the susceptibility of the harvestman to fire-ant infestations. The petition also presents evidence of specific locations in Texas where there was not a decline in the harvestman despite the presence of fire ants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Service recognizes the study, but notes that the study also states that red fire ants likely did contribute directly or indirectly to the disappearance or reduction in numbers of the harvestman and that the study should not be interpreted as an indication that detrimental effects of invasive ants will simply disappear with time. The Service states that fire ants have been observed within and near many caves in central Texas. The Service finally notes that it previously considered the study cited by the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Factor 3: Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In 1988, there were no laws in place to protect the harvestman or its habitats. The petition identifies 94 caves that are now protected from development by state and local regulations. The petition also details extensive state, county, and city regulations that represent significant conservation efforts, including regulations by the City of Austin, City of Georgetown, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Service recognizes the new regulations but nonetheless concludes that there is not enough information in the petition to indicate whether or not the state and local regulations provide enough protection against all threats faced by the harvestman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For example, the Service states that the City of Austin ordinances do not meet karst-preserve design criteria\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , do not protect crickets (a food source for the harvestman), do not include surface and subsurface drainage basins, and do not protect the entire range of the harvestman's habitat. As for the City of Georgetown Water Quality Management Plan, the Service points out that, because the purpose of the plan is designed to protect salamanders, the plan offers only limited benefit to the harvestman. The Service also observes that participation in the Georgetown Plan is voluntary and that the petition does not provide enough detail to evaluate all the benefits the plan would provide to the harvestman. As for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules, the Service explains that it previously concluded that the rules have limited benefit because they do not regulate all caves inhabited by the harvestman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Factor 4: Other natural or manmade factors affecting continued existence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Though not originally identified in 1988, the Service has since identified climate change as a potential threat to the harvestman. The Service acknowledges a lack of evidence showing a direct correlation between climate change and impact on the harvestman. The petition argues that studies indicate that the harvestman habitats in smaller and deeper mesocaverns may mitigate the potential threat of climate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Service addresses the likelihood that climate change will affect the harvestman, and specifically, the petition's contention that the use of mesocaverns may mitigate the threat of climate change. The Service acknowledges that mesocaverns may provide protection from climate change, but states that mesocaverns will likely not be enough to ameliorate the effect of climate change on the harvestman. The Service identifies specific dangers from climate change including increased storms, higher temperatures, and modifying habitat or nutrient availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Service's regulations require a petition to present only \"available information,\" and the Service committed a clear error in judgment and acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and not in accordance with law when it called for more evidence than the law requires.

To support this contention, the petition includes evidence that the population of the harvestman has steadily increased since the time of the listing-from five in 1988 to 172 as of 2014-despite an explosion in the human population. It also offers examples of five different caves in which the harvestman co-exist with human visitors, highway disruptions, tourist attractions, and industrial development, all of which the 1988 finding predicted would endanger or eradicate the species. It presents evidence that the fire ant, identified by some studies as a competitor with the harvestman, may not threaten the harvestman's food source to the extent believed by the Service in 1988. Finally, it presents evidence of overlapping regulatory regimes that now provide protection for the harvestman, as compared to no regulatory protections in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In considering the Stewards' petition, the Service correctly articulates the standard required by its regulations, \"[w]e evaluated this petition under the 50 C.F.R. 424.14 requirements that were in effect prior to October 27, 2016, as those requirements applied when the petition and supplemental information were received.\" The Service analyzed the five \"listing factors,\" as the Act requires. The Service determined that the evidence presented in the petition is not enough for the Service to conclude that delisting may be warranted. The Service came to this decision after conducting an overall assessment of the viability of the harvestman and threats to its continued existence. However, the finding recognizes that there is currently no available data on the overall population trend of the harvestman. The finding also recognizes that, although population-trend information is likely impossible to attain, it\n   is nonetheless essential to proving that the harvestman's population is not declining or threatened because of urbanization. For example, the finding stated that \"[i]t may be infeasible to assess karst invertebrate population trends in any statistically significant manner given their association with humanly inaccessible cave habitat such as mesocaverns.\" Indeed, the harvestman is so elusive that the Service requires 14 different surveys of a cave to determine to its satisfaction whether the harvestman is present. And yet, when presented with actually available evidence that the harvestman exists and continues to populate near developing areas, the Service discounts this evidence, stating at least four times that the petition \"failed to provide data adequate to assess trends.\" The Service stated that the harvestman \"may be declining or threatened even though they are observed at a ... site. The petition did not provide adequate information to detect population trends ... and it is not available from other sources .... [w]e indicated in the [1994 90-day [f]inding] that more time was needed to detect if the species is declining; however ... we are still lacking adequate data to conduct a trend analysis.\" The Service also makes that \"the petition failed to provide data adequate to assess trends in the karst invertebrate populations since the development occurred,\" and also that \"the petition failed to provide any data adequate to assess trends in the karst invertebrate population in relation to the time (duration and frequency) that [the harvestman has] been exposed to the artificial lighting.\" As for climate change, the Service states that \"the petition provided no trend analysis to indicate that this species can withstand the threats associated with development or climate change over the long term.\" This lack of conclusive population data led the Service to conclude that the petition did not present enough information to demonstrate that delisting may be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   By requiring evidence that the Service admits is either infeasible to collect or totally unavailable, the Service makes it all but impossible for the Stewards to disprove the essential assumption of the 1988 listing-that the harvestman would decline as the population increases because of dangers to its habitat-and thus, makes the case for delisting the harvestman impossible. Rather than considering whether the information presented in the petition may indicate that delisting is warranted, the Service requires conclusive evidence that the overall population of the harvestman did not decline as human population and development increased. The Service disputes this point and argues that the petition was not denied because of a lack of population-trend data, but that the Service denied the petition after the Service conducted an overall assessment of the viability of the harvestman and threats to the harvestman's continued existence. Nonetheless, after review of the finding, this court concludes that the bulk of the evidence presented in the petition was discounted because it was not accompanied by overall-population-trend data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court concludes that denying the petition because the petition lacks admittedly\n   <em>\n    unavailable\n   </em>\n   evidence, the Service did not make its decision based on the best\n   <em>\n    available\n   </em>\n   data, in violation of the Act and implementing regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (\"Listing determinations\" must be made \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (2014) (petition must describe \"based on available information, past and present numbers and distribution of the species involved and any threats faced by the species\"). In reaching this conclusion, the court recognizes that the evidence presented in the petition is\n   not conclusive proof that the species is actually increasing or that an increase in human population will not detrimentally affect the harvestman's habitat. The court concludes only that that the evidence presented in the petition meets the low evidentiary threshold set forth in the Act and implementing regulations for a 90-day finding-that delisting of the harvestman\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be warranted.

The Stewards' petition states that the discovery of many previously unknown populations of the harvestman arguably demonstrates that the 1988 listing was in error because more species have been discovered as development increases. The Stewards argues that the record is devoid of any evidence that the Service evaluated whether the original listing was in error. This argument is not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The finding expressly considers whether the original listing was erroneous. The finding states that a review of the petition does not indicate that the original classification was made in error. The Service concludes \"[b]ased on our review and evaluation ... the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the delisting of the harvestman may be warranted due to ... error in the original scientific data at the time the species was classified or in our interpretation of that data.\" For example the Service indicates that \"species may be delisted when subsequent investigations 'show that the best scientific and commercial data available when the species was listed, or the interpretation of such data, were in error.' \" The Service also considered the petition's assertion \"that threats to the species are not as severe as originally thought ... [w]e evaluate that information, below, with respect to the five listing factors.\" In light of the record, the court concludes that the Service did consider whether the original listing was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Stewards also disagrees with the substance of the Service's determination that the original listing was not in error. Very little was known about the harvestman at the time of the 1988 listing. The 1988 listing is based on a handful of studies on similar species, their food sources, and the potential effects of human development on the species. At the time of\n   listing, neither the Service nor scientists were aware that the harvestman was a distinct species, and the listing is not specific to the harvestman. Nonetheless, the primary threat identified is the potential loss of habitat due to ongoing human development. The petition posits that the discovery of previously unknown populations of the harvestman arguably demonstrates that the 1988 listing was in error. The court is not persuaded. The regulations governing whether a listing was in error are backward looking, and the court looks to whether subsequent information reveals that \"data available when the species was listed ... were in error\" at the time of listing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.11\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) (2014). The discovery of previously unknown populations of the harvestman does not demonstrate that the data on which the original listing is based was erroneous at the time of the 1988 listing. Limited information available about the species at the time indicated that the habitats of the harvestman would be threatened by changes arising from human population increases and development. Information now available indicates that threat may not be as grave as initially predicted and that delisting may be warranted. The Service will consider this on remand. The court rejects the Stewards argument of error in the 1988 listing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Under the recovery plan, reclassification would be possible if three karst-fauna-area preserves within each karst fauna-region in a species' range are protected in perpetuity. If fewer than three karst-fauna-area preserves exist within a given karst-fauna region, then all karst-fauna-area preserves within that region should be protected. Before the Service will reclassify a species, the necessary protections must be in place for at least five consecutive years, with assurances that the area preserves will remain protected in perpetuity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The delisting determination consists of several parts: (1) the Service-published summary notice of its finding; (2) a more detailed, signed notice of the same finding; and (3) the Petition Review Form for Delisting a Listed Entity.
