It argues that as a proposed rule, CMS's 2012 pronouncement could not and did not prohibit BMS from treating price appreciation credits as bona fide services fees. However, the proposed rule did not stand alone. When it issued the proposed rule, CMS declared that price appreciation credits do \"not meet the definition of a bona fide service fee as they do not reflect any service or offset of a bona fide service performed on behalf of the manufacturer.\" Medicaid Program; Covered Outpatient Drugs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%205318\">\n    77 Fed.

It reminded the drug industry that to determine what constituted a bona fide service fee, it had to look to the definition in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-8(k)(1) (2010), and its implementing regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.502\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, although the proposed rule was not final, CMS declared that price appreciation credits were not bona fide service fees as defined by the ACA and its regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the ACA and its implementing regulations do not specifically address price appreciation credits, they convey that price appreciation credits are not bona fide service fees.

But, as Streck observes, \"statutory and regulatory definitions need not address every artifice industry can imagine; instead, it is the manufacturer's obligation to apply the principles of the applicable statutory and regulatory language to its own factual, in-the-field operations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Medicaid Program; Covered Outpatient Drugs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%205318\">\n    77 Fed.

Because the framework did not specifically reference \"price appreciation credits,\" CMS offered the proposed rule as additional guidance or clarification.

The Third Circuit concluded that because the proposed rule had been issued after the complaint had been filed and the regulatory landscape remained too confusing notwithstanding the other administrative guidance, it could not find that the defendants had been warned away from their exclusion of price appreciation credits from AMP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20F.%20App%27x%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, it did not find any of this guidance insufficiently \"authoritative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, BMS also had the benefit of, but ignored, \"judicial guidance\" which had not been available to the defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Streck Appeal.\n   </em>\n   In 2012, before the service fee scheme began, Judge Robreno had warned in\n   <em>\n    Streck I\n   </em>\n   that the treatment of price appreciation credits as bona fide service fees was \"contrary\" to the proposed rule.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280103\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/894/584/#p593\">\n    894 F.Supp.2d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
