In February 2017, Noble House began adding a 3.5% surcharge to all bills at the four restaurants. DSOF at 2; PSOF at 2; PRDSOF at 2. Noble House displays a surcharge disclosure on signs, on menus for Acqua, Olive Bar, and Fresco's, and bills. DSOF at 2-3; PSOF at 3, 5; PRDSOF at 3. Aroma does not use a menu. DSOF at 3; PSOF at 3.

Signs with this disclosure are placed at the entry host stand, in lounge and bar areas, and around dining areas. DSOF at 2-3; PRDSOF at 6. On the menus, the disclosure is the same size font as the menu items and appears in red text on the Acqua and Olive Bar menus and in black text on the Fresco's menus. DSOF at 3; PSOF at 5. The same surcharge disclosure is also included on the restaurant bills. DSOF at 3-4; PSOF at 4; PRDSOF at 7. The bills contain a line item showing the exact amount of the surcharge, indicating that the surcharge is added after the subtotal is calculated but before taxes are applied. DSOF at 3-4; PRDSOF at 7-8. The surcharge disclosure appears in offset text and in the same size font as is used to list the other items on the bills. DSOF at 3-4; PRDSOF at 7-8.

Recall Secure Destruction Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. A123666,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20168183\">\n    2010 WL 168183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, *4 (Cal. Ct. App. Jan. 19, 2010), the plaintiff argued that the defendant's practice of adding a $ 15 security administration fee to its document destruction bills was \"merely a means of increasing the price for the same services and inflating its profits.\" The First District Court of Appeal found the practice lawful, noting that because \"the total amount of the security administration fee was clearly delineated on [the defendant's] invoices\" the public was not likely to be misled by the inclusion of the fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The court further held that \"[i]t is not ... a fraudulent business practice to impose an ancillary fee in a commercial transaction for the sole purpose of raising revenue without increasing baseline costs....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that Noble House displays the surcharge disclosure on signs, menus, and bills. PRDSOF at 3. With respect to the menus, it is undisputed that the disclosure is at the bottom of some, but not all, of the pages of the menus in the same size font as menu pricing and in red text, and black text on Fresco's menu.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6. It is also undisputed that signs containing nothing but the surcharge disclosure are located at entry host stands, in lounge and bar areas, and around dining areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Finally, it is undisputed that every bill contains the surcharge disclosure, with a line item showing the exact amount of the surcharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Noble House's surcharge practice does not violate the CLRA, FAL, or UCL. As in\n   <em>\n    Shvarts\n   </em>\n   , the surcharge disclosure is not buried, but is instead displayed on menus, on signs throughout the property, and on each patron's bill. Analogous to\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   , while the menu price of an item on its own may be \"limited\" in that it does not include the cost of the surcharge, a patron may not avoid the multiple disclosures on menus, signs, and the bill regarding the surcharge. Finally, as noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , even if the surcharge is merely a method to raise revenue without raising baseline menu prices, as Plaintiff alleges, the surcharge would not be unfair or deceptive because of the numerous disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes as a matter of law that a reasonable consumer would not be misled by Noble House's practice of listing menu prices exclusive of the surcharge where several signs throughout the property, the menus, and each patron's bill indicated that \"[a] 3.5% surcharge will be added to all guest checks to help cover increasing labor costs and in our support of the recent increases in minimum wage and benefits for our dedicated team members.\" Accordingly, Noble House is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's claims that Noble House's surcharge practice is unfair or deceptive under the CLRA, FAL, and UCL, and the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Noble House's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that Noble House is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all of Plaintiff's claims. As such, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment [Doc. No. 69] and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Noble House's motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 75]. This order disposes of all claims. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   the Clerk of Court to enter judgment in favor of Noble House and to terminate the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The FAL claim is raised by Plaintiff in her individual capacity only.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 63 at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    These material facts are taken from the parties' separate statements of undisputed facts and pertinent cited exhibits. Disputed material facts are discussed in further detail where relevant to the Court's analysis. Facts that are immaterial for purposes of resolving the current motion are not included in this recitation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Noble House and Plaintiff each request the Court judicially notice several documents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. Nos. 75-24; 69-30. However, judicial notice of these documents is unnecessary for the instant purposes, as the Court finds the disposition of the instant motions are proper without reference to those documents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ruiz v. City of Santa Maria\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11673635\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/543/\">\n     160 F.3d 543\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 548 n.13 (9th Cir. 1998) (denying to judicially notice facts which were not relevant to the disposition of the issues before the court). Accordingly, the Court\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n    both parties' requests for judicial notice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. Nos. 75-24; 69-30; 84-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
