(\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Feb. 6, 2019 Counterclaim Order [Doc.

Safeguard adamantly rejects this narrative, and, in turn, accuses Homestar of failing to abide by the companies' contract regarding mechanics' liens, which it alleges caused it to incur damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After years of on-and-off again discovery, punctuated by a final settlement and judgment that was later vacated (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Doc Nos. 127-54), Safeguard moved for summary judgment on the following claims:\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   Homestar's breach of contract claim;\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   Homestar's unjust enrichment claim;\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n   </strong>\n   Homestar's promissory estoppel claim;\n   <strong>\n    (4)\n   </strong>\n   Homestar's account stated claim; and\n   <strong>\n    (5)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard's breach of contract counterclaim against Homestar.

In addition, Bank of America, also represented by Safeguard's counsel, per an indemnification agreement between the two companies, moved for summary judgment on\n   <strong>\n    (6)\n   </strong>\n   Homestar's solo unjust enrichment claim against it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bank of America's Summ. J. Br. [Doc. No. 173] (\"BANA Br.\");\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at n.7 (noting this indemnification agreement).)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 20, 2018 Minute Entry [Doc. No. 223].) The Court then took Safeguard's counterclaim summary judgment motion and Bank of America's unjust enrichment summary judgment motion under advisement (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , counts 5-6 listed above), to be decided on the papers.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim Order.) The Court will now render its written decision as to Safeguard's primary summary judgment motion. Although the Court orally denied this motion from the bench with limited explanation, the Court will now take this opportunity to clarify that it is granting Safeguard's motion in part and denying it in part. The Court hopes this ruling clarifies, for both parties, what issues remain in play for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case centers around arguably hundreds of disputed work orders, fees, and account statements, and to what extent those disputes cumulatively led Homestar to incur lost profits and other consequential damages. Although both sides agree that the Safeguard-Homestar relationship was governed by a series of written contracts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1] \u00b6 81; Am. Answer [Doc. No. 17] \u00b6 81), they do not agree if Safeguard properly paid Homestar for all the work Homestar did on Safeguard's behalf between 2012 and 2014 pursuant to those written contracts. Specifically, Homestar produced an \"Accounts Receivable\" spreadsheet during discovery (the \"AR Spreadsheet\") that detailed 578 allegedly unpaid and/or underpaid work orders, totaling $ 1,752,435.40 in direct damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Ex. A-1 [Doc. No. 164-2] (\"AR Spreadsheet\").) The work orders detailed in this spreadsheet lie at the heart of this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of its summary judgment motion, Safeguard, by way of its Assistant Vice President of High Risk and Investor Compliance, Steve Meyer, reviewed the AR Spreadsheet alongside Safeguard's relevant internal records and produced a countervailing, detailed spreadsheet. Safeguard's spreadsheet alleges that, in fact, Safeguard only owes Homestar $ 129,123.86, arising out of 89 work orders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Ex. A-2 [Doc. Nos. 164-4 to 164-9] (\"Safeguard AR Analysis\").) Safeguard does not contractually owe Homestar money for the other 489 work orders, Safeguard argues, because either\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   it paid Homestar's invoice in full (145 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard properly applied \"chargebacks\" to Homestar's invoices \"based on Homestar's failure to comply with Safeguard's policies, procedures, and guidelines, including failing to provide photographs showing work was completed, failing to complete the approved scope of work, and/or Safeguard application of a bill penalty due to Homestar's failure to timely complete the repairs\" (85 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Safeguard adjusted Homestar's invoices to reflect \"reasonable pricing standards,\" in accordance with the contract (22 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (d)\n   </strong>\n   the invoice listed on the AR Spreadsheet was duplicative of another invoice on the Spreadsheet (74 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (e)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard approved payment of certain work orders but ultimately did not pay those work orders because of \"uncollected and outstanding chargebacks applied to Homestar's account\" (11 work orders); or\n   <strong>\n    (f)\n   </strong>\n   \"other\" reasons justified Safeguard not paying the invoice (152 work orders). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Primary Br. at 13-14 (describing categories detailed in Safeguard AR Analysis).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Homestar, in turn, agrees that Safeguard owes it money for the aforementioned 89 work orders, and also concedes that it cannot contest either the 145 work orders that Safeguard contended it had \"paid in full\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $ 349,120.07 in claimed direct contract damages, per Mr. Meyer's analysis), or 19 of the 74 work orders Safeguard listed as \"duplicative\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , approximately $ 17,365 in claimed direct contract damages, per the Court's analysis of Mr. Meyer's \"duplicates spreadsheet\" [Doc. No. 164-10] ). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Homestar Primary Opp. Br. at 19.) However, Homestar does contest Safeguard's accounting for a substantial number of the remaining 325 work orders. As such, with respect to direct contract damages, Homestar appears to allege approximately $ 1,256,826.47 in payments owing, in comparison to Safeguard's proposed $ 129,123.86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In particular, Homestar argues that\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard's penalties for lack of photographic documentation are factually wrong, either because Homestar did in fact upload the photo documentation actually required by the contract, or, if it did not, that was because \"Safeguard's own website often malfunctioned\" (69 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard had no right to assess penalties for alleged untimeliness, either because the overarching contract (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Ex. E [Doc. No. 164-15] (\"Safeguard Policy Manuals\") ) did not describe such penalties, or because a Safeguard employee, Paul Dinehart, allegedly agreed with Homestar's co-owner, Michael Breese, to withhold those penalties (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Breese Aff. [Doc. No. 208] \u00b6 12) (28 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard inappropriately reduced Homestar's invoices for being \"in excess of industry standards\" without any support for that determination, and in contradiction to Mr. Dinehart's alleged 2014 representation to Mr. Breese that Homestar was Safeguard's \"least expensive contractor\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13) (70 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (d)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard incorrectly asserted that Homestar's work was \"not authorized, not actually performed, or not documented,\" when, in fact, \"all work billed by Homestar was directed by Safeguard, or, in a few instances, performed in the interest of safety and [making] homes [HUD-complaint]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14) (102 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (e)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard failed to establish a basis for the \"chargebacks\" it assessed on the eleven work orders listed in category \"e\" of Safeguard's analysis above, and, indeed, contradicted Mr. Dinehart's alleged representation to Mr. Breese that \"Safeguard would refrain from taking chargebacks, and that Safeguard would repay Homestar for any chargebacks it had taken in the past\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22) (11 work orders);\n   <strong>\n    (f)\n   </strong>\n   Safeguard inaccurately reduced certain \"special projects\" payments based on an \"reconciliation meeting\" in summer 2014 that, according to Homestar employee Keegan Wallace, did not result in the reductions Safeguard listed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wallace Aff. [Doc. No. 205] \u00b6 3) (90 work orders); and\n   <strong>\n    (g)\n   </strong>\n   55 of the work orders Safeguard claims are \"duplicates,\" are not, in fact, duplicates because \"they have different work order numbers, invoice numbers, and/or billed amounts\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Homestar Primary Opp. Br. at 19) (55 work orders).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Importantly, though, Homestar also asserts two other forms of \"contractual\" damages. First, Homestar argues that Safeguard owes it consequential and/or \"reputational\" damages because, Homestar alleges, Safeguard's \"slow paying\" caused Homestar to default on its credit obligations, which in turn \"ruined Homestar's reputation in the industry,\" \"fractured [Homestar's] relationships with its subcontractors,\" and \"took Homestar from being a company worth more than $ 16,000,000 (based on an offer to purchase Homestar received in 2013) to being an insolvent entity.\" (Breese Aff. \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Compl. Prayer for Relief (requesting damages for harm done to Homestar's \"business reputation\").) However, in contrast to the specific work orders it cited in support of its direct damages claim, Homestar does not introduce any specific evidence of Safeguard's \"slow paying,\" nor does it point to a contractual provision Safeguard breached by \"slow paying.\" (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Reply Br. at 4 n.3 (noting that Homestar's invoices \"did not contain a payment due date or payment deadline,\" and citing examples).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, Homestar argues that, regardless of whether it can prove its direct contractual damages of $ 1,256,826.47, Safeguard owes it $ 1,700,000 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , approximately the amount listed on the AR Spreadsheet), under a \"promissory estoppel\" theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Homestar Primary Opp. Br. at 22-23.) This is so because, in summer of 2014, Safeguard, through Mr. Dinehart, allegedly promised to pay Homestar that amount \"in satisfaction of\" Safeguard's contractual obligations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Breese Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19;\n   <em>\n    but cf.\n   </em>\n   Safeguard Reply Br. at 24-26 (noting that Mr. Breese's deposition testimony directly contradicts his affidavit); Safeguard Primary Br. at 22 (noting that, in his affidavit, Mr. Dinehart flatly denied that such a promise was ever made).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 81; Am. Answer \u00b6 81.) As such, there is no need to keep a freestanding promissory estoppel claim available as an alternative argument in case the jury rules that a contract does not, in fact, exist.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krutchen v. Zayo Bandwidth NE, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5885996\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/591/1002/#p1018\">\n    591 F.Supp.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (D. Minn. 2008) (denying motion to dismiss promissory estoppel claim \"pled in the alternative,\" because, although it appeared that the existence of a written contract barred the claim as a matter of law, the defendant had \"not yet answered\" and it was \"unclear\" whether the existence of a contract would be \"challenged\"). In tacit acknowledgement of this fact, Homestar instead argues that Safeguard's alleged \"$ 1.7 million oral promise\" to resolve the disputed work orders (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to pay the entire amount listed on the AR Spreadsheet) constituted a \"separate and distinct\" obligation on Safeguard's party, and that \"the presence of a binding contract\" therefore \"has no effect on, and certainly does not bar, Homestar's claim for promissory estoppel.\" (Homestar Primary Opp. Br. at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court disagrees. Homestar's promissory estoppel claim is inseparable from its breach of contract claim; they are simply two different ways of arguing to the jury that Safeguard owes it money for the allegedly unpaid and/or underpaid work orders listed on the AR Spreadsheet. Indeed, to allow Homestar to argue to the jury that Safeguard owes it $ 1.7 million in promissory estoppel damages based on the word of Mr. Breese alone would be to allow Homestar to evade its obligation of proving its breach of contract case. This is especially concerning given Homestar's concession in its opposition brief that it cannot even prove breach and damages on almost $ 370,000 of the $ 1.7 million it claims Safeguard owes it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1025.) As Judge Frank of this Court noted when addressing an analogous set of facts, \"[p]romissory estoppel does not provide a means to evade the fact that the claimant failed to establish breach of the contract; rather, it provides an equitable basis for recovery of a promised benefit where the requirements for the formation of an enforceable contract cannot be met.\"\n   <em>\n    Reisdorf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120609\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/751/#p763\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting promissory estoppel claim as a matter of law).
