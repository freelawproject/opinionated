However, the parties only address the finality of the denial letters, and not the finality of the Department's decision to adopt the purportedly-new standards on which the letters were based. While Defendants argue that the denial letters, and other letters in response to ECF submissions, should not be considered final, they contend that the three contested standards reflect the Department's \"consistent and unchanged\" interpretation of the PSLF regulation. Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 30. And although Defendants suggested at oral argument, for the first time, that these standards may not reflect final agency action, that suggestion was made only in furtherance of their argument that the denial letters were not final. <em>See</em> Oral Arg.

Therefore, for the same reasons that the denial letters are final-and in light of Defendants' position that the Department applied the standards at issue to determine that the Individual Plaintiffs' employment did not qualify under the PSLF Program, Dfs.'

Ass'n</em> , 758 F.3d at 251 (\"The APA divides agency action ... into three boxes: legislative rules, interpretive rules, and general statements of policy.\").

Defendants, by contrast, skirt the issue by taking the position that the Department applied the standards consistently since the promulgation of the PSLF regulation and therefore did not engage in any agency action subject to the APA. Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 30. Given the Court's conclusion that the Department engaged in arbitrary and capricious action by departing from its past practices without meeting the basic procedural requirements of the APA-and ruling in favor of Quintero-Millan, Burkhart, and Voigt on that basis-it need not determine the specific type of agency action the Department undertook in adopting the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"p-164\">Even if the Department had not yet settled on an interpretation of the term \"public education services\" before it adopted the School-like Setting standard in 2014, its application of that standard from that point forward would still be arbitrary and capricious for lack of any reasoned explanation. <em>See</em> <em>Kirwa v.

Upon receipt of that form, the Department of Education (the \"Department\") determines whether the borrower's loan payments were made while employed at a qualifying \"public service organization,\" such that they count towards the PSLF Program's requirements. This case concerns whether the Department's reversals of certain of those determinations, made before the borrower's completion of all 120 monthly loan payments, were lawful.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Plaintiffs American Bar Association (ABA) and Michelle Quintero-Millan, Geoffrey Burkhart, Kate Voigt, and Jamie Rudert (collectively, the \"Individual Plaintiffs\") filed this action against the Department and Betsy DeVos, in her official capacity as Secretary of Education (collectively, \"Defendants\"), challenging the Department's allegedly unlawful reversal of certain determinations under the PSLF Program. They bring five claims against Defendants. Counts I, II, III, and IV are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500</extracted-citation> <em>et seq.</em> In Count I, Plaintiffs allege that the Department changed its interpretation of its regulations in an arbitrary and capricious manner by adopting new standards governing whether non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations, such as the ABA and the Individual Plaintiffs' employers, qualify as \"public service organizations\" under the PSLF Program. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 183-92. In Count II, Plaintiffs allege that the Department failed to follow the APA's notice requirements when it introduced those standards. <em><extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\"> \u00b6\u00b6 193-200</extracted-citation>. In Count III, the ABA and Plaintiffs Burkhart, Rudert, and Voigt allege that the Department's retroactive application of the standards was arbitrary and capricious. <em><extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\"> \u00b6\u00b6 201-08</extracted-citation>. And in Count IV, Plaintiffs allege that the Department's new standards were themselves inconsistent with the PSLF statute and regulation. <em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\"> \u00b6\u00b6 209-16</extracted-citation>. In Count V, Plaintiffs allege that the Department's retroactive application of the standards violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\"> \u00b6\u00b6 217-20</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-10\">Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously when the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation in two ways without displaying awareness of its changed position, providing a reasoned explanation for that decision, and taking into account the serious reliance interests affected. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on behalf of Quintero-Millan, Burkhart, and Voigt, on Count I, and the new standards on which the Department relied when it sent denial letters to them must be vacated. As a result, the Court need not reach their additional causes of action.</p><p id=\"p-11\">In contrast, summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Defendants on all causes of action brought by Rudert and the ABA. The record does not support Rudert's assertion that the Department <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"11\" href=\"#p11\" id=\"p11\">*11</a>impermissibly changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation, and then relied on that interpretation in determining that his employment failed to qualify for the PSLF Program. For this and other reasons explained below, Rudert has failed to demonstrate that the APA was violated in his case. And further, for the reasons explained below, the Department's representations to the ABA concerning whether it qualified as a public service organization for purposes of the PSLF Program were not final agency actions subject to challenge by the ABA through the APA. Finally, both the ABA's and Rudert's claims under the Due Process Clause fail because both lack the protected property interests required to succeed on their claims.</p><p id=\"p-12\">Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 17, and grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 22. For the reasons explained below, the Court will also grant Plaintiffs' Supplemental Motions to Allow for Extra-Record Review. ECF Nos. 24, 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-13\"><strong>I. Background</strong></p><p id=\"p-15\"><strong>1. The PSLF Statute</strong></p><p id=\"p-16\">In 2007, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, Pub. L. No. 110-84, <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Stat.%20784\">121 Stat. 784</extracted-citation>, established the PSLF Program, under which the Department is required to forgive eligible loans of borrowers who make monthly loan payments for ten years while employed in public service. Under the statute, the Department must \"cancel the balance of interest and principal\" of qualifying student loans belonging to an individual who (1) is not in default on the loans, (2) makes 120 monthly payments after October 1, 2007, on the loans, and (3) is \"employed in a public service job\" at the time each payment is made and at the time of forgiveness. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087e(m)(1). For a payment to qualify, the borrower must also be enrolled in an approved repayment plan, such as an \"income-based repayment plan\" (\"IBR plan\"), <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Stat.%20784\">id.</extracted-citation></em> , which permits a borrower facing financial hardship to make lower monthly payments capped at a percentage of her gross income, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098e(a). A \"public service job\" is defined to cover \"a full-time job in ... government ..., public education ..., public interest law services (including prosecution or public defense or legal advocacy on behalf of low-income communities at a nonprofit organization) ..., [and] public service for individuals with disabilities.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087e(m)(3)(B).</p><p id=\"p-19\">During the negotiated rulemaking process leading to the promulgation of the regulation, the Department agreed to develop a form with \"an employer certification section and instructions regarding supporting documentation that the Department [needs] to determine the borrower's eligibility for the forgiveness benefit.\" Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">73 Fed. Reg. 63,232</extracted-citation>, 63,241 -42 (Oct. 23, 2008); AR 45-46. The Department affirmed that the form would permit a borrower \"to collect a certification from his or her employer either annually or at the close of the 120-payment qualifying period.\" <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">73 Fed. Reg. at 63</extracted-citation>,242 ; AR 46. Based on these commitments undertaken during the negotiated rulemaking, the Department developed a process through which a borrower may certify the eligibility of payments made during a particular period of employment at any time, long before she submits a loan forgiveness application upon completion of all 120 qualifying payments (the \"ECF Process\"). Oral Arg. Tr. at 25:1-11.</p><p id=\"p-20\"><strong>3. The ECF Process</strong></p><p id=\"p-21\">According to the Department, the ECF Process allows borrowers to certify that their \"employment and payments qualify for [the PSLF Program].\" AR 178. Through the submission of an ECF, borrowers and their employers certify that the borrower was employed full-time for a qualifying public service organization when making monthly loan payments. <em>See</em> AR 152-53. In order to receive loan forgiveness under the program, borrowers must submit valid ECFs covering their \"full-time public service employment while making the required 120 separate, qualifying monthly payments.\" AR 154. But, as noted above, borrowers may also submit ECFs before they are eligible to apply for loan forgiveness in order to \"receive feedback on the eligibility of [a borrower's] employment and payments,\" AR 178, and to \"verify that [a borrower's] employer qualifies as a public service organization,\" AR 152. The Department recommends that borrowers submit ECFs either annually or whenever the borrower changes employers. AR 154. A single ECF may cover loan payments made over any length of time, but the Department requires borrowers to submit separate ECFs for each employer. <em>See</em> AR 152-53. The ECF application must be signed by an authorized official from the relevant organization to verify that the borrower was a full-time employee during the relevant time period. <em><extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-22\">The Department relies on PSLF servicers, primarily \"FedLoan Servicing,\" to process ECFs prior to a borrower submitting a loan forgiveness application at the conclusion of making 120 qualifying monthly payments. AR 178. ECFs are processed in several steps. First, FedLoan Servicing conducts an \"initial review\" in which it \"check[s] that the borrower provided all required information\" and followed the form instructions. AR 143. Once the check is complete, Fedloan Servicing \"determine[s] whether an employer is a qualifying <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"13\" href=\"#p13\" id=\"p13\">*13</a>public service organization\" by confirming that the organization is listed in one of the Department's \"searchable databases, based on the type of public service organization.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> If FedLoan Servicing cannot determine whether an employer qualifies as a public service organization-and in all cases where a borrower submits an ECF based on her employment at a private, non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization-it is required to escalate the decision to the Department. AR 143, 160-61.</p><p id=\"p-23\">After determining that the borrower's employer is a qualifying public service organization, FedLoan Servicing will \"determine whether the borrower has met the full-time requirement ... while employed [there].\" AR 143. If FedLoan Servicing confirms that the borrower made loan payments while employed full-time at a qualifying employer, then, after approving the first ECF received by the borrower, it will \"request the transfer of all federally-held loans\" to FedLoan Servicing from the borrower's original loan servicer. AR 144. Once the transfer is made, FedLoan Servicing will \"track the number of PSLF qualifying payments made after the loans [were] transferred from the original servicer.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-24\">After completing 120 eligible monthly payments, borrowers may apply for loan forgiveness through a separate application. AR 179. If a borrower submitted ECFs covering the entire period during which she made 120 qualifying payments, then she must submit \"one additional\" ECF to verify that she is employed full-time with a qualifying public service organization at the time she submits the application. <em><extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> If a borrower did not submit ECFs prior to completing her loan forgiveness application, or only submitted a portion of them, then she must provide all the remaining ECFs upon her application for loan forgiveness. <em><extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-26\">The ABA is an organization for legal professionals that asserts that the Department unlawfully stripped it of its status as a qualifying public service organization for purposes of the PSLF Program.

The Individual Plaintiffs are law school graduates who contend that they made qualifying loan payments under the PSLF Program while employed by public service organizations, including the ABA, over varying periods since 2011-but have since been informed that, to the contrary, because their employers are not public service organizations, their payments do not qualify. <em>See <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C232\"> \u00b6\u00b6 107-77</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-28\">The ABA is a private, not-for-profit 501(c)(6) organization that, among other activities, conducts legal education initiatives, administers the accreditation of law schools and other projects for the legal profession, and provides public interest law services.

First, they assert that the ABA does not have a cause of action because its interests do not fall within the \"zone of interests\" protected by the PSLF statute. The Court concludes that the zone-of-interests test does not bar the ABA's claims. Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs do not have a cause of action because the Department's actions at issue are not final agency actions subject to judicial review. The Court concludes that the letters sent to the Individual Plaintiffs determining that their employment did not qualify for the PSLF Program-and thus that their loan payments made while working for those employers did not count toward the total needed for loan forgiveness-are final agency actions. Therefore, the Individual Plaintiffs may assert causes of action challenging them under the APA. On the other hand, the Department's letters to the ABA concerning its status as a qualifying \"public service organization\" under the PSLF regulation are not final agency actions. Therefore, the ABA may not assert APA claims directed at those letters.</p><p id=\"p-48\">Turning to the merits of the Individual Plaintiffs' APA claims, the Court concludes that the Department changed the standards by which it assessed whether non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations qualified as public service organizations under the PSLF Program. Moreover, these changes were arbitrary and capricious because, in adopting the new standards, the Department failed to display awareness of its changed position, provide a reasoned analysis for that decision, and take into account the serious reliance interests affected. Because summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Quintero-Millan, Burkhart, and Voigt on Count I on that basis, the Court need not reach their other challenges under the APA, or their argument that the Department violated their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p><p id=\"p-49\">On the other hand, the Court concludes that summary judgment is appropriate in Defendants' favor on Rudert's APA claims. It does so because it cannot conclude that the Department based its determination that his employment failed to qualify for the PSLF Program on a new interpretation of the PSLF regulation, and for other reasons explained below. Finally, the Court concludes that the ABA and Rudert's due process claims under the Fifth Amendment fail, as well.

Likewise, the Department's letter to Voigt flatly asserted that it had \"determined that AILA is not a qualifying employer for PSLF purposes.\" AR 336. In the letter to Quintero-Millan, the Department stated that, based on its review of her ECFs, her employment \"[d]oes [n]ot [q]ualify\" and that she \"may not participate in employment and payment tracking for PSLF.\" AR 237-38. This definitive language supports the conclusion that, upon sending the denial letters to the Individual Plaintiffs, the Department had completed its determination that their employment and the loan payments at issue did not qualify.</p><p id=\"p-65\">In arguing that the denial letters were not final, Defendants point to the allegedly less-than-definitive language in Quintero-Millan's letter, which stated that her \"employer does not appear to qualify for PSLF\" and invited her to \"reapply if <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"21\" href=\"#p21\" id=\"p21\">*21</a>[she could] provide additional information to show that [her] employment qualifies.\" AR 237. But this language does not undermine the conclusion that her denial letter was a final agency action. First, other language in the letter was far more categorical about the Department's determination. The Department identified her \"eligibility status\" to be, simply, \"Organization Does Not Qualify.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768072,3861204\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/940/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The letter suggested other possible eligibility statuses-for example, \"Under Review\" or \"Missing Information\"-each of which would have suggested a lack of finality. AR 237-38 (edits to capitalization). But according to Quintero-Millan's letter, neither of those applied to her. Second, even to the extent that the language cited by Defendants suggested that the Department might reconsider its decision, \"[t]he mere possibility that an agency might reconsider in light of 'informal discussion' and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.\" <em>Sackett v.

MSJ Br. at 15-16. But this argument conflates separate determinations that the Department undertakes in connection with the PSLF Program. Certainly, the Department considers an application to determine a borrower's ultimate eligibility for debt relief only after she has submitted 120 qualifying loan payments. AR 153. But along the way, according to the Department, upon receiving an ECF it \"verif[ies] that [the borrower's] employer qualifies as a public service organization\" and \"notif[ies] [the borrower] in writing of the number of qualifying payments ... made while employed in qualifying public service.\" AR 155. Through this process, the Department \"determine[s]\" the eligibility of loan payments made during a borrower's employment with a particular organization. <em>See</em> AR 143-44.

AR 144. That the Individual Plaintiffs have not submitted applications for loan forgiveness does not undercut the conclusion that, at the very least, the denial letters reflect the end of the Department's decisionmaking process concerning whether a borrower's employer qualifies as a public service organization, and whether the loan payments at issue count toward the 120 monthly payments required.</p><p id=\"p-68\">Courts have also looked to other agency materials to evaluate whether an action marked the consummation of an agency's decisionmaking. <em>See</em> <em>Holistic Candlers</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768072,3861204\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/940/\">664 F.3d at 944</extracted-citation> (consulting an FDA manual). In this case, language describing the ECF Process in the Department's guidance documents further underscores, in important ways, the conclusion that the denial letters marked the end of an agency process for the Individual Plaintiffs. For example, the Department's \"Dear Borrower\" letter-which was sent to all borrowers interested in the PSLF Program, such as the Individual Plaintiffs, <em>see</em> AR 142-instructed borrowers that, when submitting their final application for loan forgiveness, they \"do not have to re-submit [ECFs]\" that have \"already been validated by the Department,\" AR 153.

In December 2016, the Department confirmed that determination. AR 192-93. Though these letters appear similar to those sent to the Individual Plaintiffs, they cannot satisfy the second prong of the <em>Bennett</em> test.</p><p id=\"p-83\">Under the PSLF statute, the Department has an obligation to provide loan forgiveness only to eligible <em>borrowers.

Accordingly, the Department's letters to the ABA-which do not constitute a determination on the eligibility of payments made by a particular <em>borrower</em> -cannot be said to determine rights or obligations under the statute. As an employer, the ABA has no such rights or obligations, since it has no possible claim to loan forgiveness.

Although the letters to the ABA describe separate eligibility determinations rendered by the Department, as well as the basis for those decisions, the letters themselves do not carry the same legal consequences for any particular borrower, like the letters sent to the Individual Plaintiffs. Nor do the letters carry legal consequences for the ABA. Because the ABA has no legal obligations or rights under the PSLF statute, the Department's letters cannot have changed them. And the ABA's extensive account of \"serious recruiting and retention problems due to the revocation of its status as a PSLF-eligible employer\" does not alter this conclusion. Pls.' Reply at 9.

In doing so, the Court will also consider-for reasons explained in Section III-extra-record evidence submitted by Plaintiffs.</p><p id=\"p-92\">The Individual Plaintiffs allege that the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation by adopting new, heightened standards governing whether non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations qualify as public service organizations for purposes of the PSLF Program.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They identify three newly-adopted standards the Court will refer to as the \"Primary Purpose\" standard, the \"School-like Setting\" standard, and the \"Outright Provision of Services\" standard. <em>See</em> Pls.' MSJ Br. at 31-33. The Court considers whether the evidence supports their claim that each reflects a change to how the Department interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation below.</p><p id=\"p-93\"><em>The \"Primary Purpose\" Standard</em></p><p id=\"p-94\">The Individual Plaintiffs allege that, sometime between 2015 and 2016, the Department adopted the Primary Purpose standard as part of its determination as to whether non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations that provide \"public interest law services\" qualify as \"public service organizations\" under the PSLF regulation. <em>Id.</em> at 31-32; <em>id.</em> , Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 24, 31-36. Under this standard, for her loan payments to qualify, a borrower must demonstrate that the \"primary purpose\" of her non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit employer is to provide qualifying public services. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> , Ex. A \u00b6 31; AR 190-91. As Defendants' concede, the Department relied on this reasoning when it sent denial letters to ABA employees in 2016, Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 27, which includes the denial letters challenged by Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, <em>see</em> AR 214-15, 237-39. The Individual Plaintiffs contend that, by adopting the standard, the Department \"reversed [its] past practice without notice or explanation.\" Pls.' MSJ Br. at 29. Defendants, by contrast, contend that the Department had <em>always</em> applied this reasoning in evaluating whether employment at particular organizations qualified for the PSLF Program, and that the letters approving ECFs submitted by Burkhart prior to his 2016 denial letter resulted from a \"mistake\" or \"contractor's error.\" Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 9; Dfs.' Reply at 17-18.</p><p id=\"p-95\">The evidence supports the Individual Plaintiffs' claim that the Department changed how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation by adopting the Primary Purpose standard at some point before it <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"28\" href=\"#p28\" id=\"p28\">*28</a>began issuing denial letters to ABA employees like Quintero-Millan and Burkhart. The Department's handling of Burkhart's case is, at a minimum, consistent with such a change. As discussed above, despite the ABA's apparent failure to meet this standard, the Department approved his employment there on at least four occasions before reversing course. Pls.' MSJ Br., Ex. D \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. In addition, according to the ABA, several of its other employees received letters confirming that their employment there had qualified as well. <em>Id.</em> , Ex. A \u00b6 22. But the record is also notable for what it lacks: any evidence as to whether the Department applied the Primary Purpose standard-or even sought information about any employer's primary purpose-prior to sending letters to the ABA's employees denying their eligibility in 2015.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em> , Ex. A \u00b6 24. The earliest specific reference to the Primary Purpose standard in the record appears to be in the Department's June 2016 letter to the ABA. <em>See</em> AR 190-91 (describing how the Department had not received documentation demonstrating \"that the primary purpose of the ABA is to provide 'public interest law services' \").</p><p id=\"p-96\">The extra-record evidence-which consists of internal Department and FedLoan Servicing email traffic-addresses this point directly. And it demonstrates that the Department changed how it interpreted the PSLF regulation by adopting the Primary Purpose standard and applying it to borrowers generally. In February 2017, a FedLoan Servicing employee emailed Foss to express \"concern[ ]\" as to whether his recent instruction that an \"organization's 'primary purpose' [had] to be to provide one of the qualifying services\" was \"directly conflicting with how we have been evaluating certain [public health] organizations\" based on guidance Foss had offered several years earlier.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. The employee referenced a prior case in which FedLoan Servicing and the Department, in applying that guidance, had jointly agreed to approve an employer even though its primary purpose did <em>not</em> involve a qualifying service. <em>Id.</em> In response, Foss instructed the employee to \"do a retraction\" of the employer's eligibility status. <em>Id.</em> Foss then requested that the employee \"comb through those organizations that [they had] approved\" and \"provide [the Department] a list, like [the employee had] done for public education and <em>public interest legal services.</em> \" <em>Id.</em> (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-97\">Not long afterward, in June 2017, that same FedLoan Servicing employee described to a co-worker how, a \"few months ago,\" the Department \"introduced a new concept in the review, 'primary purpose.' \" Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Ex. E. As a result, the Department was reevaluating ECFs that FedLoan Servicing had previously approved based on earlier Department guidance. <em>Id.</em> In fact, the employee recounted, FedLoan Servicing had provided the Department a spreadsheet of organizations that it had approved pursuant to the prior guidance, but the Department \"still ha[d] not provided follow-up\" on it. <em>Id.</em> The next month, FedLoan Servicing updated its \"Employment Certification Form Manual\" to reflect that \"[a]s of February 23, 2017, [the Department] advised [that] a private <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"29\" href=\"#p29\" id=\"p29\">*29</a>not-for-profit (non-501(c)(3) ) organization should be evaluated based on [its] 'primary purpose.' \" <em>Id.</em> , Ex. C.</p><p id=\"p-98\">This extra-record evidence shows that the Department's adoption of the Primary Purpose standard represented a change to how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. To be sure, this evidence postdates the denial letters sent to Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, and some of it appears to concern the standard's application to public health organizations specifically. Nonetheless, it shows a Department employee referencing an <em>earlier</em> implementation of the Primary Purpose standard with regard to \"public interest legal services\" employers. Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. That implementation apparently required the Department to request a list of such employers that had been approved beforehand so that they could be reconsidered. <em>Id.</em> And it does not appear that the manual used by FedLoan Servicing to apply the PSLF regulation included the Primary Purpose standard until as late as 2017. Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Ex. E. Indeed, following the commencement of this action, the Department added the Primary Purpose standard to its on-line description of the PSLF Program's qualifications. <em>See</em> Pls.' Reply at 18 n.6; <em>Federal Student Aid: Public Service Loan Forgiveness</em> , https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualify (last visited Feb. 21, 2019). This evidence simply does not comport with Defendants' contention that the prior letters sent to Burkhart and other ABA employees confirming that their employment qualified for the PSLF Program were the result of individualized mistakes or errors in applying a standard that had always been in place.</p><p id=\"p-99\">In total, this evidence makes abundantly clear that, at some point before sending the denial letters to Quintero-Millan and Burkhart in 2016, the Department changed its practices by adopting the Primary Purpose standard. Through this change, the Department modified the requirements by which a non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization may qualify as a public service organization by adding the condition that organizations that serve multiple purposes must show that their <em>primary</em> one is to provide a qualifying public service. Regardless of whether adding such a requirement was \"a reasonable decision\" and \"consistent with the intent of the statute,\" as Defendants contend, Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 27, the Department's adoption of the Primary Purpose standard constituted a change to how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. And as explained in more detail below, that change, at the least, required it to meet the minimum requirements for reasoned decisionmaking under the APA. <em>See</em> <em>Ark Initiative v. Tidwell</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176698,12310293\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/119/\">816 F.3d 119</extracted-citation>, 128 (D.C.

Pls.' MSJ Br. at 32; AR 335-36. Under the School-like Setting standard, a public education organization under consideration for PSLF eligibility is required to demonstrate that it provides qualifying services \"in a school or a school-like setting.\" AR 336. Over two years beforehand, when the Department determined that Voigt's employer, AILA, qualified as \"an eligible public service organization\"</p><p id=\"p-102\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"30\" href=\"#p30\" id=\"p30\">*30</a>under <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b), AR 337, the Individual Plaintiffs contend this standard \"did not exist,\"<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pls.' MSJ Br. at 32. As with the Primary Purpose standard, the Department does not contest that the School-like Setting standard provided the underlying rationale for its ultimate determination that Voigt's employment at AILA did not qualify as an organization that provides public education services. Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 27. But the Department submits that it has \"consistently applied\" its interpretation of \"public education\" services since the initial promulgation of the PSLF regulation. Dfs.' Reply at 15-16.</p><p id=\"p-103\">The evidence, however, shows that the Department changed how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation by adopting this new standard. Once again, there is evidence in the record consistent with such a change-for example, at first, the Department told Voigt that her employment at AILA \"[met] the definition of public service organization\" under the regulation, only to then reverse course, AR 337-but it does not directly address the point. And, as it did with the Primary Purpose standard, the Department added the School-like Setting standard to an updated version of its ECF instruction sheet following the commencement of this suit. Pls.' MSJ Br. at 10-11 n.4; <em>see</em> Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF): Employment Certification Form at 3, https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf (last visited Feb. 21, 2019). However, the record does not contain any evidence, one way or the other, as to whether the Department applied the School-like Setting standard to any particular borrower's employment, or even inquired into the setting in which an organization provided education services, before its December 2014 denial letter to Voigt. <em>See supra</em> note 8.</p><p id=\"p-104\">The extra-record evidence, however, decimates Defendants' position in Voigt's case. In August 2014, Foss emailed a FedLoan Servicing employee, excitedly announcing that Department had finally \"settled ... on a definition of public education!\" Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. C. Foss then went on to describe how the new definition would require a qualifying organization to \"provide educational enrichment or support directly to students or their families in a school or a school-like setting.\" <em>Id.</em> This email, unrebutted by the Department, is all-but-conclusive evidence that it introduced the School-like Setting standard over two years <em>after</em> it informed Voigt in June 2012 that her employment at AILA qualified, and a few months <em>before</em> it reversed itself in her case. And even accepting Defendants' contention-for which there is no contemporaneous evidence-that the Department did not assess Voigt's employment as potentially providing public education services (as opposed to public interest law services) prior to issuing its June 2012 letter, the extra-record evidence shows that the Department adopted this new standard years after its promulgation of the PSLF regulation. <em>See id.</em> Moreover, as noted above, the extra-record evidence indicates that, after it adopted this new standard, the Department was forced to retract letters that had previously confirmed borrowers' eligibility based on their <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"31\" href=\"#p31\" id=\"p31\">*31</a>employment with organizations that provided \"<em>public education</em> and public interest legal services.\" <em>Id.</em> , Ex. B (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-105\">Based on this evidence, the Court concludes that the Department changed how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation by adopting the School-like Setting standard, and then applied that new standard to Voigt's case. Through this change, the Department added the condition that qualifying organizations must provide public education services directly to students or their families in a school or a school-like setting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That requirement appears nowhere in the text of the regulation itself, which does not define the term \"public education.\" <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b). And while such a reading of the regulation may be reasonable, as explained in more detail below, the Department was obligated, at a minimum, to meet the APA's requirements for reasoned decisionmaking when it changed its practices to adopt the standard.</p><p id=\"p-106\"><em>The \"Outright Provision of Services\" Standard</em></p><p id=\"p-107\">Finally, the Individual Plaintiffs argue that the Department changed its practices by adopting the Outright Provision of Services standard when considering whether an organization provides a \"public service for individuals with disabilities and the elderly\" under <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b). Pls.' MSJ Br. at 32-33. Under this purported standard, an organization that \"[p]rovides ... public services,\" <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b), must \"provide the services <em>outright</em> ,\" Pls.' MSJ Br. at 33 (emphasis added) (quoting AR 331). The Department relied on this new rationale, according to the Individual Plaintiffs, when it issued the April 2016 denial letter to Rudert on the basis that VVA only \"facilitate[d] the provision of disability-related services\" and did not \"provide the services outright.\"<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em><extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\"> at 32-33</extracted-citation> (quoting AR 331).</p><p id=\"p-108\">Unlike the Individual Plaintiffs' claims about the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards, however, their claim that the Outright Provision of Services standard represented a change to the Department's interpretation of the PSLF regulation is unsupported by the evidence. The only reference to this alleged standard in the record is in an August 2016 letter from the Department to a congresswoman who had inquired about Rudert's denial. AR 330-31. And unlike with the other standards, there is no extra-record evidence that shows a discrete shift how the Department's interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. Indeed, the purported Outright Provision of Services standard appears only to reflect a straightforward application of the regulation to Rudert's case, rather than a new interpretation, given that its plain language mandates that a qualifying organization \"[p]rovide[ ]\" particular public services. <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b). Without additional supporting evidence, the Individual Plaintiffs' argument that Rudert's denial represents a change in the Department's practices following the promulgation of the PSLF regulation <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"32\" href=\"#p32\" id=\"p32\">*32</a>is unpersuasive. At bottom, the Court cannot conclude, \"as a factual matter,\" that the Department \"changed its past position....\" <em>United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

The Individual Plaintiffs' Procedural APA Claim (Count I)</strong></p><p id=\"p-110\">In Count I, the Individual Plaintiffs assert, among other things, that because the Department changed its interpretations of the PSLF regulation by adopting the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards, it must-but did not-adhere to certain minimal procedural requirements under the APA. The Court agrees. The Department argues, for various reasons, that the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards are \"reasonable\" and \"consistent with the intent of the statute.\" Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 25-28. Maybe so. But its refusal to concede that it changed its practices when it adopted the standards effectively precluded it from satisfying the APA's basic procedural requirements when it did so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-111\">The APA requires that a court \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706</extracted-citation>(2).

Nor did the Department meet these minimum requirements in the denial letters themselves.

MSJ Br. at 27. And to this day, the Department has not acknowledged that it changed its practices in this regard. Therefore, Quintero-Millan and Burkhart were provided none of the process required by the APA, and the Department concedes as much. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 30 (arguing that no process was required because the Department's interpretation of the PSLF regulation remained unchanged). Accordingly, the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it adopted the Primary Purpose standard without the minimum requirements of reasoned decisionmaking and determined that Quintero-Millan and Burkhart's employment did not qualify on that basis.

But the Department failed to acknowledge that it had adopted this standard just a few months beforehand, failed to explain its reasoning for the change to its practices, and failed to show that it had considered the relevant <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"34\" href=\"#p34\" id=\"p34\">*34</a>reliance interests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And there is no indication in the record that it met these minimum procedural requirements through any other means, such as a public notice to borrowers, prior to issuing the denial letter to Voigt. Therefore, the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it adopted the School-like Setting standard without meeting the requirements of reasoned decisionmaking and, on that basis, determined that Voigt's employment did not qualify. For this reason, summary judgment is warranted in Voigt's favor, and against Defendants, on Count I as well.</p><p id=\"p-115\">In contrast, because the record does not support the conclusion that the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation by adopting the purported Outright Provision of Services standard, the Court cannot conclude that it violated the APA's procedural requirements when it determined that Rudert's employment at the VVA did not qualify. <em>See</em> <em>Select Specialty Hosp.-Bloomington, Inc. v.

Although the Individual Plaintiffs contend that the Department \"articulate[d] a new standard\" when it issued its denial letter to Rudert, Pls.' MSJ Br. at 33, they fail to provide clear evidence that any such change occurred. Accordingly, Rudert has not carried his burden of persuading the Court that the Department's application of the Outright Provision of Services standard required it to satisfy any procedural requirements at all. Therefore, summary judgment must be granted for Defendants, and against Rudert, on Count I.</p><p id=\"p-116\">Quintero-Millan, Burkhart, and Voigt also allege that the Department's new standards violated the APA because the Department failed to satisfy the APA's notice requirements, \"failed to comport with the PSLF program's authorizing statute ...

Rudert's Remaining APA Claims (Counts II-IV)</strong></p><p id=\"p-118\">Having determined that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Rudert's procedural APA claim, the Court turns to his remaining APA claims-namely, that the Department failed to follow APA notice requirements when it adopted the purported Outright Provision of Services standard, that it unlawfully <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"35\" href=\"#p35\" id=\"p35\">*35</a>imposed retroactive consequences in applying the standard to Rudert, and that the standard is contrary to the PSLF statute and regulation. The Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on each of these claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-119\">First, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Rudert's claim in Count II that the Department failed to follow APA notice requirements. The statute requires that agencies publish in the federal register all \"substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency.\" <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(a)(1)(D).

Because the Court cannot conclude on this record that Rudert's denial letter was based on any sort of newly-adopted rule or policy change-much less a new substantive rule-Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</p><p id=\"p-120\">Second, Defendants are also entitled to summary judgment on Rudert's claim in Count III that the Department imposed retroactive consequences on him by relying on a new standard to revoke the eligibility status of his employment and past loan payments. \"[A] retroactive rule forbidden by the APA is one which 'alter[s] the <em>past</em> legal consequences of past actions.' \" <em>Celtronix Telemetry, Inc. v.

And again, as set forth in Section II(B)(3)(a), the record does not support Rudert's claim that the Department applied or relied upon a new rule or interpretation when it determined that his employment at VVA did not qualify under the PSLF Program. Moreover, although the Department previously confirmed to Rudert that his employment was eligible, an agency's attempt to correct a \"mistake in interpreting and applying its own recently promulgated regulations\" does not necessarily trigger the APA's prohibition on retroactive rules. <em>Alvarado Parkway Inst., Inc. v. Mendez</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412478\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/789/1190/#p1201\">789 F.Supp. 1190</extracted-citation>, 1201 (D.D.C. 1992). Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that the Department took impermissible retroactive action.</p><p id=\"p-121\">Third, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Rudert's claim in Count IV that the purported Outright Provision of Services standard is substantively inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and the PSLF regulation. Even assuming for the sake of argument that this standard reflected an interpretation of the regulation, it is not plainly inconsistent with it. Indeed, \"as a general rule, [the Court] defers to the [an agency's interpretation] 'unless [its] interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.' \"</p><p id=\"p-122\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"36\" href=\"#p36\" id=\"p36\">*36</a><em>Decker v.

Here, the PSLF regulation requires that a qualifying organization \"provide[ ] ... public services.\" <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b). Although, as Rudert points out, the regulation does not contain the term \"outright,\" Pls.' MSJ Br. at 33, the inclusion of that qualifier does not suggest that the Department's purported interpretation is \"plainly erroneous\" or that the Department acted outside the scope of the regulation. And even without applying a deferential standard, such an interpretation would be reasonable on its face. Further, Plaintiffs concede that they do not challenge the regulation as inconsistent with the statute, <em>see</em> Pls.' Reply at 18 n.5, and so the alleged interpretation would be consistent with the statute for the same reasons. And in any event, to repeat, Rudert has not demonstrated that the Department's determination of his employment eligibility reflected a new interpretation of the PSLF regulation at all, rather than simply an application of the regulation to his individual case. Therefore, the Court must enter summary judgment for Defendants on Rudert's substantive APA claim.</p><p id=\"p-123\"><strong>4. The ABA's and Rudert's Fifth Amendment Due Process Claims (Count V)</strong></p><p id=\"p-124\">In Count V, the ABA and Rudert assert that the Department violated their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment when it \"retroactively revoked [the ABA's] status as a PSLF-eligible employer, thus compromising its ability to attract and retain employees\" and \"purged [Rudert's] prior years of certified PSLF-work and loan payments without notice.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 219-20. To bring a claim under the Due Process Clause, a plaintiff must show (1) \"deprivation of a protected liberty or property interest,\" (2) \"by the government,\" (3) \"without the process that is 'due' under the Fifth Amendment.\" <em>NB ex rel. Peacock v. District of Columbia</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286408,6785861\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/31/\">794 F.3d 31</extracted-citation>, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2015).</p><p id=\"p-126\">The Court agrees with Defendants that the ABA has no protected property interest in its status as a qualifying organization that provides public interest law services. The ABA's qualification under the PSLF regulation is understandably important to the ABA because of the second-order effects of that determination on its employees and recruitment. But as explained in Section II(B)(2)(b), the PSLF statute does not create any property rights <em>for the ABA.</em> The PSLF statute grants an entitlement to debt relief for borrowers <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"37\" href=\"#p37\" id=\"p37\">*37</a>determined to be eligible, but it creates no legitimate claim of entitlement to a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment on the ABA's part. <em>See</em> 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087e(m). Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the ABA's claim under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</p><p id=\"p-127\">In addition, the statute only creates rights for those borrowers who are entitled to benefits under the PSLF Program. As discussed above, the Department determined that Rudert's employment with VVA did not qualify because VVA does not provide public services for individuals with disabilities outright, in light of the PSLF regulation's requirement that the organization \"provide[ ] ... public services.\" <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219</extracted-citation>(b). Therefore, Rudert has not demonstrated that he is entitled to a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. For this reason, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim as well.</p><p id=\"p-128\"><strong>III. Plaintiffs' Motions for Extra-Record Review</strong></p><p id=\"p-129\">Plaintiffs have also filed two motions for extra-record review. Pls.' Supp. Br.; Pls.' 2d Supp. Br. For the reasons explained below, and as reflected in the analysis in Section II(B)(3)(a), the Court will grant both motions.</p><p id=\"p-130\"><strong>A. Legal Standard</strong></p><p id=\"p-131\">It is \"black-letter administrative law that in an APA case, a reviewing court 'should have before it neither more nor less information than did the agency when it made its decision.' \" <em>Hill Dermaceuticals</em> , 709 F.3d at 47 (quoting <em>Walter O.

Cir. 1984) ). And the agency enjoys a \"presumption\" that it has properly compiled the entire record of materials that it considered, either directly or indirectly, in making its decision. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Maritel, Inc. v. Collins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5320666\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/422/188/#p196\">422 F.Supp.2d 188</extracted-citation>, 196 (D.D.C. 2006). The D.C. Circuit has observed that this rule against extra-record evidence \"exerts its maximum force when the substantive soundness of the agency's decision is under scrutiny.\" <em>Esch v. Yeutter</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">876 F.2d 976</extracted-citation>, 991 (D.C. Cir. 1989). On the other hand, when \"the procedural validity of the [agency's] action also remains in serious question[,] ... it may sometimes be appropriate to resort to extra-record information to enable judicial review to become effective.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-132\">Although the exceptions to this rule \"are quite narrow and rarely invoked,\" <em>CTS Corp. v. EPA</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341845,4156006\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/52/\">759 F.3d 52</extracted-citation>, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2014), in <em>Esch</em> the D.C. Circuit set forth eight circumstances in which a court might consider extra-record evidence. Since then, it has appeared to substantially narrow the circumstances under which extra record review is appropriate, as Judge Mehta explained in detail in <em>United Student Aid Funds v. DeVos</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">237 F.Supp.3d 1</extracted-citation>, 4 (D.D.C. 2017) (collecting cases). The Court need not review all those cases here. It suffices to say that \"although the number of situations in which extra-record evidence may be considered has dwindled over time, the D.C. Circuit has consistently stated that where the district court cannot determine from the administrative record whether the agency complied with its procedural obligations, the district court may consider extra-record evidence.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-134\">During and after briefing on the parties' motions for summary judgment, Plaintiffs twice moved the Court to allow for extra-record review of documents that they allege \"provide irrefutable evidence of the Department's changed interpretations of the relevant statutory and regulatory <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"38\" href=\"#p38\" id=\"p38\">*38</a>terms at issue in this case.\"<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Mot. Plaintiffs urge the Court to make an exception to the \"default rule\" in APA cases here, because they \"challenge gross procedural deficiencies\" in that the current record precludes judicial review as to whether the Department adopted the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards as new interpretations of the PSLF regulation following its promulgation. Pls.' Supp. Br. at 3-4.</p><p id=\"p-135\">The Court agrees that this is the rare APA case in which consideration of Plaintiffs' proffered extra-record evidence is permissible. First, it is the procedural-as opposed to substantive-validity of the Department's actions that are primarily at issue, so the usual rule prohibiting extra-record evidence applies with less potency. As the D.C. Circuit recently reaffirmed, \"district courts may consult extra-record evidence when 'the procedural validity of the [agency's] action ... remains in serious question.' \" <em>Hill Dermaceuticals</em> , 709 F.3d at 47 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Esch</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">876 F.2d at </extracted-citation>991 ).</p><p id=\"p-136\">Second, the \"administrative record itself is so deficient as to preclude effective review\" as to whether the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation when it adopted the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Defendants argue that this lack of evidence in the record supports their contention that no such change occurred. <em>See, e.g.</em> , Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 24. But there is also no evidence supporting their own assertion that the Department's practices have \"been consistent and unchanged\" all along, <em>id.</em> at 30, even after the Court requested Defendants to direct it to any such evidence. <em>See supra</em> note 8. Certainly, the Department's reversals of its decisions relating to the Individual Plaintiffs and the ABA's other employees are consistent with such a change. But these handful of individual cases hardly provide an adequate record for the Court to evaluate Plaintiffs' claims. The extra-record evidence offered by Plaintiffs is the only direct evidence relevant to the question of whether the Department changed its interpretations of the PSLF regulation in the ways claimed by Plaintiffs. For all the reasons explained in Section II(B)(3)(a), the extra-record evidence at issue here \"shed[s] light on an issue not addressed by the administrative record itself,\" and may therefore be considered. <em>Nat'l Min. Ass'n v. Jackson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3568608\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/856/150/#p158\">856 F.Supp.2d 150</extracted-citation>, 158 (D.D.C. 2012).</p><p id=\"p-137\">In <em>United Student Aid Funds</em> , Judge Mehta recently reached the same conclusion in a highly similar circumstance. In that case, the administrative record was \"silent\" on \"two factual issues central to resolving whether [a] Dear Colleague Letter announced a 'new rule' in a manner that satisfie[d] the APA.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">237 F.Supp.3d 1</extracted-citation>, 5 (D.D.C. 2017). Like here, the question in that case was whether an agency action \"constituted [a] type of change in position\" that triggered procedural obligations under the APA. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> In that case, the court held that the relevant lack of evidence in the record on the agency's alleged change was a \" 'gross procedural deficiency' that preclude[d] effective review of [the plaintiff's] APA claims and thus warrant[ed] admission of extra-record evidence.\"</p><p id=\"p-138\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"39\" href=\"#p39\" id=\"p39\">*39</a><em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\"> at 6</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Hill Dermaceuticals</em> , 709 F.3d at 47 ). Such is the case here.</p><p id=\"p-139\">Defendants advance several arguments urging the Court not to consider the extra-record evidence, but none of them are persuasive.</p><p id=\"p-140\">First, Defendants argue that the extra-record evidence should not be considered because the documents at issue were not \"before the agency\" at the time of the decisions at issue. Defs.' Opp. to Supp. at 4. But extra-record review of documents not before the agency is precisely what the exceptions to the general rule in APA cases permit. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Univ. of Colo. Health at Mem'l Hosp. v. Burwell</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917521\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/151/1/#p13\">151 F.Supp.3d 1</extracted-citation>, 13 (D.D.C. 2015) (\"[A] party may seek to supplement the record with 'extra-judicial evidence that was not initially before the agency' but [which] the party 'believes should nonetheless be included in the administrative record.' \" (alteration in original) (quoting <em>WildEarth Guardians v.

Defs.' Opp. to 2d Supp. at 4. None of these arguments withstand scrutiny. The extra-record evidence is highly probative as to whether the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation by introducing the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards. The evidence concerning Voigt's claim makes the point the most clearly. As described in Section II(B)(3)(a), one email depicts a Department employee announcing in August 2014 that the Department had \"settled\" on a \"definition of public education\" that required such services to be provided \"in a school or school-like setting.\" <em>See</em> Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. C. He did so only after the Department told Voigt in June 2012 that her employment at AILA qualified, but well before the Department sent her a denial letter in December 2014. And although the email does not concern Voigt's case specifically, that is part of the point-it demonstrates that the Department adopted a new standard for \"public education services\" and then applied that standard across the board, to the borrower reflected in the email as well as others, like Voigt.</p><p id=\"p-142\">As for Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, the extra-record evidence does indeed postdate their denial letters. And to be sure, in some cases the evidence reflects communications from FedLoan Servicing employees, as opposed to the Department's-a distinction that in this context hardly makes a difference given the integrated way in which ECFs are processed. <em>See</em> AR 143, 160-61 (guidance instructing that all ECF submissions for non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations be escalated to the Department). But in any event, the most important of these emails reflects a <em>Department employee</em> discussing an <em>earlier</em> effort to implement the Primary Purpose standard to \"public interest legal services\" organizations. Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. And at that time, the Department apparently tasked FedLoan Servicing employees with compiling a list of ECFs that had to be reevaluated based on its introduction of this new standard. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820214\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> This is highly relevant evidence-notwithstanding the date of the communication itself, and that it concerned processing of another borrower's ECF-that the Department had previously introduced the Primary Purpose standard as a general, broadly-applicable interpretation of the PSLF regulation that required a reevaluation of prior determinations, contrary to its position here.</p><p id=\"p-143\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"40\" href=\"#p40\" id=\"p40\">*40</a>Accordingly, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review and Supplemental Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review, and, as reflected above, has considered the extra-record evidence submitted by Plaintiffs in its evaluation of their claims.</p><p id=\"p-144\"><strong>IV.

For their part, Defendants do not provide any particular reason why the Court should not vacate these standards until the procedural deficiencies identified above are corrected. Therefore, the Court will vacate the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards, as well as remand the denial letters sent to Quintero-Millan, AR 237-39, Burkhart, AR 214-15, and Voigt, AR 335-36, to the Department for further consideration consistent with this Opinion.</p><p id=\"p-148\">For all of the above reasons, the Court will, in a separate Order, grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 17 ; grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 22 ; and grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review, ECF No. 24, and Supplemental Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review, ECF No. 35.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
