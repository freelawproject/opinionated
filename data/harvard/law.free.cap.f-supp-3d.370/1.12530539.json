At any time, federal student loan borrowers employed in public service may check their ongoing eligibility to participate in the program by submitting an Employment Certification Form (ECF). Upon receipt of that form, the Department of Education (the \"Department\") determines whether the borrower's loan payments were made while employed at a qualifying \"public service organization,\" such that they count towards the PSLF Program's requirements.

For this and other reasons explained below, Rudert has failed to demonstrate that the APA was violated in his case. And further, for the reasons explained below, the Department's representations to the ABA concerning whether it qualified as a public service organization for purposes of the PSLF Program were not final agency actions subject to challenge by the ABA through the APA. Finally, both the ABA's and Rudert's claims under the Due Process Clause fail because both lack the protected property interests required to succeed on their claims.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-12\">\n       Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 17, and grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 22.

On the other hand, the Department's letters to the ABA concerning its status as a qualifying \"public service organization\" under the PSLF regulation are not final agency actions. Therefore, the ABA may not assert APA claims directed at those letters.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-48\">\n       Turning to the merits of the Individual Plaintiffs' APA claims, the Court concludes that the Department changed the standards by which it assessed whether non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations qualified as public service organizations under the PSLF Program. Moreover, these changes were arbitrary and capricious because, in adopting the new standards, the Department failed to display awareness of its changed position, provide a reasoned analysis for that decision, and take into account the serious reliance interests affected. Because summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Quintero-Millan, Burkhart, and Voigt on Count I on that basis, the Court need not reach their other challenges under the APA, or their argument that the Department violated their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-49\">\n       On the other hand, the Court concludes that summary judgment is appropriate in Defendants' favor on Rudert's APA claims. It does so because it cannot conclude that the Department based its determination that his employment failed to qualify for the PSLF Program on a new interpretation of the PSLF regulation, and for other reasons explained below. Finally, the Court concludes that the ABA and Rudert's due process claims under the Fifth Amendment fail, as well.

The language of the denial letters demonstrates that they marked the Department's final determination that the Individual Plaintiffs' respective employment, and their payments made during that employment, did not qualify for the PSLF Program.\n       <footnotemark>\n        4\n       </footnotemark>\n       The letters sent to Burkhart and Rudert unambiguously stated that the Department \"reversed [their] previously approved employment period[s] under the PSLF program because [their employers] do[ ] not provide a qualifying service.\" AR 214, 282. Likewise, the Department's letter to Voigt flatly asserted that it had \"determined that AILA is not a qualifying employer for PSLF purposes.\" AR 336. In the letter to Quintero-Millan, the Department stated that, based on its review of her ECFs, her employment \"[d]oes [n]ot [q]ualify\" and that she \"may not participate in employment and payment tracking for PSLF.\" AR 237-38. This definitive language supports the conclusion that, upon sending the denial letters to the Individual Plaintiffs, the Department had completed its determination that their employment and the loan payments at issue did not qualify.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-65\">\n       In arguing that the denial letters were not final, Defendants point to the allegedly less-than-definitive language in Quintero-Millan's letter, which stated that her \"employer does not appear to qualify for PSLF\" and invited her to \"reapply if\n      [she could] provide additional information to show that [her] employment qualifies.\" AR 237. But this language does not undermine the conclusion that her denial letter was a final agency action. First, other language in the letter was far more categorical about the Department's determination. The Department identified her \"eligibility status\" to be, simply, \"Organization Does Not Qualify.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768072,3861204\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/940/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       The letter suggested other possible eligibility statuses-for example, \"Under Review\" or \"Missing Information\"-each of which would have suggested a lack of finality.

Second, even to the extent that the language cited by Defendants suggested that the Department might reconsider its decision, \"[t]he mere possibility that an agency might reconsider in light of 'informal discussion' and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.\"\n       <em>\n        Sackett v.

After the Department issued the denial letters, the Individual Plaintiffs did not receive any additional communication from the Department suggesting that the letters were tentative or interlocutory. Moreover, the ABA challenged the Department's basis for the denial letters issued to Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, but the Department reaffirmed its conclusion. AR 192-93. And when Rudert followed up with FedLoan Servicing after receiving his letter, a representative there simply informed him that \"the Department of Education made the determination\" and that \"there was no appeal process put in place.\" AR 285. To date, and even after the filing of this lawsuit, the ineligibility determinations reflected in the Individual Plaintiffs' denial letters have apparently remained unchanged for periods ranging from 27 to 50 months.

MSJ Br. at 15-16. But this argument conflates separate determinations that the Department undertakes in connection with the PSLF Program. Certainly, the Department considers an application to determine a borrower's ultimate eligibility for debt relief only after she has submitted 120 qualifying loan payments. AR 153. But along the way, according to the Department, upon receiving an ECF it \"verif[ies] that [the borrower's] employer qualifies as a public service organization\" and \"notif[ies] [the borrower] in writing of the number of qualifying payments ... made while employed in qualifying public service.\" AR 155. Through this process, the Department \"determine[s]\" the eligibility of loan payments made during a borrower's employment with a particular organization.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       AR 143-44. And, if the loan payments are approved as eligible, the Department will \"request the transfer of all federally-held loans\" to FedLoan Servicing\n      from the borrower's original loan servicer and \"track the number of PSLF qualifying payments\" going forward. AR 144. That the Individual Plaintiffs have not submitted applications for loan forgiveness does not undercut the conclusion that, at the very least, the denial letters reflect the end of the Department's decisionmaking process concerning whether a borrower's employer qualifies as a public service organization, and whether the loan payments at issue count toward the 120 monthly payments required.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-68\">\n       Courts have also looked to other agency materials to evaluate whether an action marked the consummation of an agency's decisionmaking.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Holistic Candlers\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768072,3861204\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/940/\">\n        664 F.3d at 944\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (consulting an FDA manual). In this case, language describing the ECF Process in the Department's guidance documents further underscores, in important ways, the conclusion that the denial letters marked the end of an agency process for the Individual Plaintiffs. For example, the Department's \"Dear Borrower\" letter-which was sent to all borrowers interested in the PSLF Program, such as the Individual Plaintiffs,\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       AR 142-instructed borrowers that, when submitting their final application for loan forgiveness, they \"do not have to re-submit [ECFs]\" that have \"already been validated by the Department,\" AR 153. In the same letter, the Department informed them that it \"will review\" an application for loan forgiveness along with any ECFs \"\n       <em>\n        not previously validated\n       </em>\n       by the Department\" in order to \"determine if [a borrower] fulfilled all of the requirements to be eligible for PSLF.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768072,3861204\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/940/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       (emphasis added). Therefore, the Department's own language confirms that when it \"validates\" a borrower's employment and loan payments made during her time there, its determination marks the consummation of a process that is not revisited. At that point, \"for all practical purposes [the Department] 'has ruled definitively' \" on whether the payments count toward the 120 required by the PSLF statute.\n       <em>\n        U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs v.

But for all the reasons already explained, the denial letters were not provisional. At a minimum, the letters determined the rights of the Individual Plaintiffs to have the payments at issue count toward the 120 such payments needed. Additionally, in the cases of Burkhart and Voigt, who as of May 2017 continued to work for employers that the Department concluded did not qualify as \"public service organizations,\" the letters effectively determined their eligibility to participate\n      in the PSLF Program unless they changed jobs.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-81\">\n       Unlike the Individual Plaintiffs' denial letters, however, the Department's letters to the ABA are not actions by which a party's \"rights or obligations have been determined\" or from which \"legal consequences will flow.\"\n       <em>\n        Bennett\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p163\">\n        520 U.S. at 178\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p163\">\n        117 S.Ct. 1154\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-82\">\n       In its June 2016 letter, the Department informed the ABA that it had \"determined that the ABA does not qualify as a public service organization for [...] PSLF purposes\" because it failed to demonstrate that its \"primary purpose\" was to provide \"public interest law services.\" AR 190-91. In December 2016, the Department confirmed that determination. AR 192-93. Though these letters appear similar to those sent to the Individual Plaintiffs, they cannot satisfy the second prong of the\n       <em>\n        Bennett\n       </em>\n       test.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-83\">\n       Under the PSLF statute, the Department has an obligation to provide loan forgiveness only to eligible\n       <em>\n        borrowers.

The system by which it does so requires that borrowers collect and submit ECFs covering 120 valid loan payments, which the Department approves or denies as they are received. Accordingly, the Department's letters to the ABA-which do not constitute a determination on the eligibility of payments made by a particular\n       <em>\n        borrower\n       </em>\n       -cannot be said to determine rights or obligations under the statute. As an employer, the ABA has no such rights or obligations, since it has no possible claim to loan forgiveness.

When considering the issue of legal consequences, the D.C.

Although the letters to the ABA describe separate eligibility determinations rendered by the Department, as well as the basis for those decisions, the letters themselves do not carry the same legal consequences for any particular borrower, like the letters sent to the Individual Plaintiffs. Nor do the letters carry legal consequences for the ABA. Because the ABA has no legal obligations or rights under the PSLF statute, the Department's letters cannot have changed them. And the ABA's extensive account of \"serious recruiting and retention problems due to the revocation of its status as a PSLF-eligible employer\" does not alter this conclusion. Pls.' Reply at 9.

The Department's handling of Burkhart's case is, at a minimum, consistent with such a change. As discussed above, despite the ABA's apparent failure to meet this standard, the Department approved his employment there on at least four occasions before reversing course. Pls.' MSJ Br., Ex.

In February 2017, a FedLoan Servicing employee emailed Foss to express \"concern[ ]\" as to whether his recent instruction that an \"organization's 'primary purpose' [had] to be to provide one of the qualifying services\" was \"directly conflicting with how we have been evaluating certain [public health] organizations\" based on guidance Foss had offered several years earlier.\n       <footnotemark>\n        9\n       </footnotemark>\n       Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. The employee referenced a prior case in which FedLoan Servicing and the Department, in applying that guidance, had jointly agreed to approve an employer even though its primary purpose did\n       <em>\n        not\n       </em>\n       involve a qualifying service.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       In response, Foss instructed the employee to \"do a retraction\" of the employer's eligibility status.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       Foss then requested that the employee \"comb through those organizations that [they had] approved\" and \"provide [the Department] a list, like [the employee had] done for public education and\n       <em>\n        public interest legal services.\n       </em>\n       \"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       (emphasis added).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-97\">\n       Not long afterward, in June 2017, that same FedLoan Servicing employee described to a co-worker how, a \"few months ago,\" the Department \"introduced a new concept in the review, 'primary purpose.' \" Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Ex. E. As a result, the Department was reevaluating ECFs that FedLoan Servicing had previously approved based on earlier Department guidance.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       In fact, the employee recounted, FedLoan Servicing had provided the Department a spreadsheet of organizations that it had approved pursuant to the prior guidance, but the Department \"still ha[d] not provided follow-up\" on it.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       The next month, FedLoan Servicing updated its \"Employment Certification Form Manual\" to reflect that \"[a]s of February 23, 2017, [the Department] advised [that] a private\n      not-for-profit (non-501(c)(3) ) organization should be evaluated based on [its] 'primary purpose.' \"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       , Ex. C.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-98\">\n       This extra-record evidence shows that the Department's adoption of the Primary Purpose standard represented a change to how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. To be sure, this evidence postdates the denial letters sent to Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, and some of it appears to concern the standard's application to public health organizations specifically. Nonetheless, it shows a Department employee referencing an\n       <em>\n        earlier\n       </em>\n       implementation of the Primary Purpose standard with regard to \"public interest legal services\" employers. Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. That implementation apparently required the Department to request a list of such employers that had been approved beforehand so that they could be reconsidered.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       And it does not appear that the manual used by FedLoan Servicing to apply the PSLF regulation included the Primary Purpose standard until as late as 2017. Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Ex. E. Indeed, following the commencement of this action, the Department added the Primary Purpose standard to its on-line description of the PSLF Program's qualifications.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Pls.' Reply at 18 n.6;\n       <em>\n        Federal Student Aid: Public Service Loan Forgiveness\n       </em>\n       , https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualify (last visited Feb. 21, 2019). This evidence simply does not comport with Defendants' contention that the prior letters sent to Burkhart and other ABA employees confirming that their employment qualified for the PSLF Program were the result of individualized mistakes or errors in applying a standard that had always been in place.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-99\">\n       In total, this evidence makes abundantly clear that, at some point before sending the denial letters to Quintero-Millan and Burkhart in 2016, the Department changed its practices by adopting the Primary Purpose standard. Through this change, the Department modified the requirements by which a non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization may qualify as a public service organization by adding the condition that organizations that serve multiple purposes must show that their\n       <em>\n        primary\n       </em>\n       one is to provide a qualifying public service. Regardless of whether adding such a requirement was \"a reasonable decision\" and \"consistent with the intent of the statute,\" as Defendants contend, Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 27, the Department's adoption of the Primary Purpose standard constituted a change to how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. And as explained in more detail below, that change, at the least, required it to meet the minimum requirements for reasoned decisionmaking under the APA.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Ark Initiative v.

Pls.' MSJ Br. at 32; AR 335-36. Under the School-like Setting standard, a public education organization under consideration for PSLF eligibility is required to demonstrate that it provides qualifying services \"in a school or a school-like setting.\" AR 336.

MSJ Br. at 32. As with the Primary Purpose standard, the Department does not contest that the School-like Setting standard provided the underlying rationale for its ultimate determination that Voigt's employment at AILA did not qualify as an organization that provides public education services. Dfs.' MSJ Br. at 27. But the Department submits that it has \"consistently applied\" its interpretation of \"public education\" services since the initial promulgation of the PSLF regulation. Dfs.' Reply at 15-16.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-103\">\n       The evidence, however, shows that the Department changed how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation by adopting this new standard. Once again, there is evidence in the record consistent with such a change-for example, at first, the Department told Voigt that her employment at AILA \"[met] the definition of public service organization\" under the regulation, only to then reverse course, AR 337-but it does not directly address the point. And, as it did with the Primary Purpose standard, the Department added the School-like Setting standard to an updated version of its ECF instruction sheet following the commencement of this suit. Pls.' MSJ Br. at 10-11 n.4;\n       <em>\n        see\n       </em>\n       Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF): Employment Certification Form at 3, https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf (last visited Feb. 21, 2019). However, the record does not contain any evidence, one way or the other, as to whether the Department applied the School-like Setting standard to any particular borrower's employment, or even inquired into the setting in which an organization provided education services, before its December 2014 denial letter to Voigt.\n       <em>\n        See supra\n       </em>\n       note 8.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-104\">\n       The extra-record evidence, however, decimates Defendants' position in Voigt's case. In August 2014, Foss emailed a FedLoan Servicing employee, excitedly announcing that Department had finally \"settled ... on a definition of public education!\" Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. C. Foss then went on to describe how the new definition would require a qualifying organization to \"provide educational enrichment or support directly to students or their families in a school or a school-like setting.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       This email, unrebutted by the Department, is all-but-conclusive evidence that it introduced the School-like Setting standard over two years\n       <em>\n        after\n       </em>\n       it informed Voigt in June 2012 that her employment at AILA qualified, and a few months\n       <em>\n        before\n       </em>\n       it reversed itself in her case. And even accepting Defendants' contention-for which there is no contemporaneous evidence-that the Department did not assess Voigt's employment as potentially providing public education services (as opposed to public interest law services) prior to issuing its June 2012 letter, the extra-record evidence shows that the Department adopted this new standard years after its promulgation of the PSLF regulation.\n       <em>\n        See id.\n       </em>\n       Moreover, as noted above, the extra-record evidence indicates that, after it adopted this new standard, the Department was forced to retract letters that had previously confirmed borrowers' eligibility based on their\n      employment with organizations that provided \"\n       <em>\n        public education\n       </em>\n       and public interest legal services.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       , Ex. B (emphasis added).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-105\">\n       Based on this evidence, the Court concludes that the Department changed how it interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation by adopting the School-like Setting standard, and then applied that new standard to Voigt's case. Through this change, the Department added the condition that qualifying organizations must provide public education services directly to students or their families in a school or a school-like setting.\n       <footnotemark>\n        11\n       </footnotemark>\n       That requirement appears nowhere in the text of the regulation itself, which does not define the term \"public education.\"\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (b). And while such a reading of the regulation may be reasonable, as explained in more detail below, the Department was obligated, at a minimum, to meet the APA's requirements for reasoned decisionmaking when it changed its practices to adopt the standard.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-106\">\n       <em>\n        The \"Outright Provision of Services\" Standard\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-107\">\n       Finally, the Individual Plaintiffs argue that the Department changed its practices by adopting the Outright Provision of Services standard when considering whether an organization provides a \"public service for individuals with disabilities and the elderly\" under\n       <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (b).

Under this purported standard, an organization that \"[p]rovides ... public services,\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (b), must \"provide the services\n       <em>\n        outright\n       </em>\n       ,\" Pls.' MSJ Br. at 33 (emphasis added) (quoting AR 331). The Department relied on this new rationale, according to the Individual Plaintiffs, when it issued the April 2016 denial letter to Rudert on the basis that VVA only \"facilitate[d] the provision of disability-related services\" and did not \"provide the services outright.\"\n       <footnotemark>\n        12\n       </footnotemark>\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        at 32-33\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (quoting AR 331).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-108\">\n       Unlike the Individual Plaintiffs' claims about the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards, however, their claim that the Outright Provision of Services standard represented a change to the Department's interpretation of the PSLF regulation is unsupported by the evidence. The only reference to this alleged standard in the record is in an August 2016 letter from the Department to a congresswoman who had inquired about Rudert's denial. AR 330-31. And unlike with the other standards, there is no extra-record evidence that shows a discrete shift how the Department's interpreted and applied the PSLF regulation. Indeed, the purported Outright Provision of Services standard appears only to reflect a straightforward application of the regulation to Rudert's case, rather than a new interpretation, given that its plain language mandates that a qualifying organization \"[p]rovide[ ]\" particular public services.\n       <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (b). Without additional supporting evidence, the Individual Plaintiffs' argument that Rudert's denial represents a change in the Department's practices following the promulgation of the PSLF regulation\n      is unpersuasive. At bottom, the Court cannot conclude, \"as a factual matter,\" that the Department \"changed its past position....\"\n       <em>\n        United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

MSJ Br. at 25-28. Maybe so.

As discussed above, the Department determined that Rudert's employment with VVA did not qualify because VVA does not provide public services for individuals with disabilities outright, in light of the PSLF regulation's requirement that the organization \"provide[ ] ... public services.\"\n       <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.219\">\n        34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.219\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (b). Therefore, Rudert has not demonstrated that he is entitled to a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.

And the agency enjoys a \"presumption\" that it has properly compiled the entire record of materials that it considered, either directly or indirectly, in making its decision.\n       <em>\n        See, e.g.,\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Maritel, Inc. v.

The D.C. Circuit has observed that this rule against extra-record evidence \"exerts its maximum force when the substantive soundness of the agency's decision is under scrutiny.\"\n       <em>\n        Esch v.

On the other hand, when \"the procedural validity of the [agency's] action also remains in serious question[,] ... it may sometimes be appropriate to resort to extra-record information to enable judicial review to become effective.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-132\">\n       Although the exceptions to this rule \"are quite narrow and rarely invoked,\"\n       <em>\n        CTS Corp. v.

Cir. 2014), in\n       <em>\n        Esch\n       </em>\n       the D.C. Circuit set forth eight circumstances in which a court might consider extra-record evidence. Since then, it has appeared to substantially narrow the circumstances under which extra record review is appropriate, as Judge Mehta explained in detail in\n       <em>\n        United Student Aid Funds v. DeVos\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">\n        237 F.Supp.3d 1\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , 4 (D.D.C. 2017) (collecting cases). The Court need not review all those cases here. It suffices to say that \"although the number of situations in which extra-record evidence may be considered has dwindled over time, the D.C. Circuit has consistently stated that where the district court cannot determine from the administrative record whether the agency complied with its procedural obligations, the district court may consider extra-record evidence.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267955\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/1/#p4\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-134\">\n       During and after briefing on the parties' motions for summary judgment, Plaintiffs twice moved the Court to allow for extra-record review of documents that they allege \"provide irrefutable evidence of the Department's changed interpretations of the relevant statutory and regulatory\n      terms at issue in this case.\"\n       <footnotemark>\n        16\n       </footnotemark>\n       Pls.' 2d Supp. Br., Mot. Plaintiffs urge the Court to make an exception to the \"default rule\" in APA cases here, because they \"challenge gross procedural deficiencies\" in that the current record precludes judicial review as to whether the Department adopted the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards as new interpretations of the PSLF regulation following its promulgation. Pls.' Supp. Br. at 3-4.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-135\">\n       The Court agrees that this is the rare APA case in which consideration of Plaintiffs' proffered extra-record evidence is permissible. First, it is the procedural-as opposed to substantive-validity of the Department's actions that are primarily at issue, so the usual rule prohibiting extra-record evidence applies with less potency. As the D.C. Circuit recently reaffirmed, \"district courts may consult extra-record evidence when 'the procedural validity of the [agency's] action ... remains in serious question.' \"\n       <em>\n        Hill Dermaceuticals\n       </em>\n       , 709 F.3d at 47 (alterations in original) (quoting\n       <em>\n        Esch\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">\n        876 F.2d at\n       </extracted-citation>\n       991 ).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-136\">\n       Second, the \"administrative record itself is so deficient as to preclude effective review\" as to whether the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation when it adopted the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537981,3469078\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/976/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       Defendants argue that this lack of evidence in the record supports their contention that no such change occurred.\n       <em>\n        See, e.g.\n       </em>\n       , Dfs.'

Certainly, the Department's reversals of its decisions relating to the Individual Plaintiffs and the ABA's other employees are consistent with such a change. But these handful of individual cases hardly provide an adequate record for the Court to evaluate Plaintiffs' claims. The extra-record evidence offered by Plaintiffs is the only direct evidence relevant to the question of whether the Department changed its interpretations of the PSLF regulation in the ways claimed by Plaintiffs. For all the reasons explained in Section II(B)(3)(a), the extra-record evidence at issue here \"shed[s] light on an issue not addressed by the administrative record itself,\" and may therefore be considered.\n       <em>\n        Nat'l Min.

Defs.' Opp. to Supp. at 4. But extra-record review of documents not before the agency is precisely what the exceptions to the general rule in APA cases permit.\n       <em>\n        See, e.g.,\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Univ. of Colo.

Defs.' Opp. to 2d Supp. at 4. None of these arguments withstand scrutiny. The extra-record evidence is highly probative as to whether the Department changed its interpretation of the PSLF regulation by introducing the Primary Purpose and School-like Setting standards. The evidence concerning Voigt's claim makes the point the most clearly. As described in Section II(B)(3)(a), one email depicts a Department employee announcing in August 2014 that the Department had \"settled\" on a \"definition of public education\" that required such services to be provided \"in a school or school-like setting.\"\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. C. He did so only after the Department told Voigt in June 2012 that her employment at AILA qualified, but well before the Department sent her a denial letter in December 2014. And although the email does not concern Voigt's case specifically, that is part of the point-it demonstrates that the Department adopted a new standard for \"public education services\" and then applied that standard across the board, to the borrower reflected in the email as well as others, like Voigt.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-142\">\n       As for Quintero-Millan and Burkhart, the extra-record evidence does indeed postdate their denial letters. And to be sure, in some cases the evidence reflects communications from FedLoan Servicing employees, as opposed to the Department's-a distinction that in this context hardly makes a difference given the integrated way in which ECFs are processed.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       AR 143, 160-61 (guidance instructing that all ECF submissions for non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations be escalated to the Department). But in any event, the most important of these emails reflects a\n       <em>\n        Department employee\n       </em>\n       discussing an\n       <em>\n        earlier\n       </em>\n       effort to implement the Primary Purpose standard to \"public interest legal services\" organizations. Pls.' Supp. Br., Ex. B. And at that time, the Department apparently tasked FedLoan Servicing employees with compiling a list of ECFs that had to be reevaluated based on its introduction of this new standard.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820214\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/670/1/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       This is highly relevant evidence-notwithstanding the date of the communication itself, and that it concerned processing of another borrower's ECF-that the Department had previously introduced the Primary Purpose standard as a general, broadly-applicable interpretation of the PSLF regulation that required a reevaluation of prior determinations, contrary to its position here.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-143\">\n       Accordingly, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review and Supplemental Motion to Allow for Extra-Record Review, and, as reflected above, has considered the extra-record evidence submitted by Plaintiffs in its evaluation of their claims.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-144\">\n       <strong>\n        IV.
