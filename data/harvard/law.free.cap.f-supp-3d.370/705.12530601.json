ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court concludes that the issues raised in this case are not the types of exceptional issues appropriate for interlocutory appeal. As discussed below, the questions raised regarding the Fraternal Organization's immunity, though novel, are insufficient to demonstrate a substantial ground for difference of opinion. Further, an interlocutory appeal will delay-rather than advance-the termination of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Substantial Ground for Difference of Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Tribe is not immune from this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Order Denying Defs.' Mot. To Dismiss and Granting in Part and Denying in Part Pl.'s Mot. To Dismiss 10-15, Aug. 27, 2018, ECF No. 115. The Court is of the opinion that, because the Tribe is not immune from suit, the Fraternal Organization is not shielded from discovery. Thus, the Court has allowed Plaintiff to take discovery of the Fraternal Organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By the express terms of the Fraternal Organization's charter, its immunity runs with the Tribe's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Second Mot. To Dismiss Pl.'s First Am. Compl. Ex. 1 (Federal Charter of Incorporation ... [for the] Fraternal Organization), art. IV(C) &amp; XVI(A). The charter provides that the Fraternal Organization has \"the same immunities under federal law as the Tribe\" and \"is an instrumentality of the Yselta del sur Pueblo and is entitled to all of the privileges and immunities of the Tribe ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633160,633138\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/281/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the Fraternal Organization is entitled to the \"same\" immunities under federal law as the Tribe, then to the extent that the Restoration Act-which is federal law-waives immunity as to the Tribe, it also waives immunity as to the Fraternal Organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Further, the Court expresses serious doubts regarding whether a tribal corporation that is chartered pursuant to \u00a7 17 of the IRA could ever have greater immunity than that enjoyed by the tribe. The history and purpose of \u00a7 17 corporations suggest that, while a tribal corporation may choose to waive immunity when the tribe did not, the corporation cannot retain immunity when its parent tribe has waived it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When it enacted the IRA, Congress authorized Indian tribes to, among other things, organize a governing body pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the IRA as well as a corporate entity pursuant to \u00a7 17 of the IRA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Indian Reorganization Act, Pub. L. No. 73-383,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20984\">\n    48 Stat. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1934). Because Congress recognized that \"the protection of sovereign immunity would put the Indian tribe at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining credit and entering\n   into business transactions,\" the ability for the tribal corporate entity to waive its immunity makes it a more attractive partner for business transactions.\n   <em>\n    Parker Drilling Co. v. Metlakatla Indian Cmty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012862\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/451/1127/#p1131\">\n    451 F.Supp. 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1131 (D. Alaska 1978). Thus, in order to remain commercially competitive, the corporation may expose itself to contract or tort claims without exposing the tribe or the assets of the governing body to suit.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Vantage Companies, Inc. v. Table Mountain Rancheria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7350045,9419414\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/1091/\">\n    292 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1097 (9th Cir. 2002),\n   <em>\n    as amended on denial of reh'g\n   </em>\n   (July 29, 2002) (stating that when Congress enacted \u00a7 17, \"it did so in part to enable tribes to waive sovereign immunity, thereby facilitating business transactions and fostering tribal economic development and independence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While a \u00a7 17 corporation is entitled to waive its immunity without waiving the tribe's, the Court is unable to find authority suggesting that the opposite can occur. Importantly, Defendants fail to cite any authority suggesting that a \u00a7 17 corporation can retain sovereign immunity when its parent tribe has waived it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, Defendants aver that the Restoration Act fails to waive the Fraternal Organization's immunity because the Act \"speaks to offenses 'committed by the\n   <em>\n    tribe\n   </em>\n   , or by\n   <em>\n    any member\n   </em>\n   of the tribe ...,' \" but does not expressly name the Fraternal Organization. Reply 3. However, Defendants mischaracterize the Restoration Act's text. The text in \u00a7 107(c) that refers to the Tribe and its members is a provision that limits jurisdiction over gaming violations to federal courts: \"the courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any offense in violation of subsection (a) that is committed by the tribe, or by any member of the tribe, on the reservation or on lands of the tribe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Restoration Act \u00a7 107(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the key provision, which waives sovereign immunity, is the sentence that follows: \"nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding the State of Texas from bringing an action in the courts of the United States to enjoin violations of the provisions of this section.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7350045,9419414\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/1091/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Restoration Act's provision that waives sovereign immunity contains no limiting principle that might exclude the Fraternal Organization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, even if it were possible for a \u00a7 17 corporation to retain greater immunity than its parent\n   tribe (and the Court believes it is not), Defendants have not shown that the Restoration Act fails to waive the Fraternal Organization's immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fifth Circuit has not spoken on whether the Restoration Act waives the Fraternal Organization's sovereign immunity, as this appears to be a matter of first impression. The novelty of this issue does not necessarily make it suitable for an interlocutory appeal, as \"the mere presence of a disputed issue that is a question of first impression, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate a substantial ground for difference of opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Flor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6464762,9047058\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/281/\">\n    79 F.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (2d Cir. 1996). Further,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Courts traditionally will find that a substantial ground for difference of opinion exists where \"the circuits are in dispute on the question and the court of appeals of the circuit has not spoken on the point, if complicated questions arise under foreign law, or if novel and difficult questions of first impression are presented.\" However, \"just because a court is the first to rule on a particular question ... does not mean there is such a substantial difference of opinion as will support an interlocutory appeal.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Couch v. Telescope Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697589\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/629/#p633\">\n    611 F.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting 3 FEDERAL PROCEDURE, LAWYERS EDITION \u00a7 3:212 (2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Defendants aver that, \"as the parties' briefing demonstrates, there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion.\" Mot. 3. However, disagreement between the parties is insufficient to satisfy this condition. If fervent disagreement was sufficient to satisfy this requirement, then the majority of orders issued by district courts would be ripe for interlocutory appeal. However, \u00a7 1292(b) contemplates a more rigorous demonstration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Nat'l Energy Policy Dev. Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11373370\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/233/16/#p20\">\n    233 F.Supp.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (D.D.C. 2002) (\"Mere disagreement, even if vehement, with a court's ruling does not establish a substantial ground for difference of opinion sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements for an interlocutory appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, even though the issue presented here is novel and the parties disagree about how it should be decided, there is no substantial ground for difference of opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Material Advancement of the Ultimate Termination of the Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, the Court believes that an interlocutory appeal would unnecessarily delay litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Struthers Sci. &amp; Int'l Corp. v. Gen. Foods Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2866422\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/290/122/#p130\">\n    290 F.Supp. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (S.D. Tex. 1968) (\"The court's opinion is that such an appeal would more likely tend to delay rather than advance termination of the litigation. The parties would be better advised to expend their energies completing discovery rather than taking appeals.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that an interlocutory appeal is appropriate because the Fraternal Organization may be exposed to unnecessary discovery and because improper materials may be used during the course of litigation. Mot. 5. However, as discussed above, the Court (i) believes that the Fraternal Organization's charter expressly states that it and the Tribe have the \"same\" immunities under federal law, (ii) seriously doubts that any \u00a7 17 corporation can have greater immunity than its tribe, and (iii) believes that, even if the Fraternal Organization could retain immunity when the Tribe had waived it, the text of the Restoration Act would permit this suit against the Fraternal Organization. Thus, the Court finds it improbable that allowing\n   the State to take discovery against the Fraternal Organization is improper. Accordingly, an interlocutory appeal would likely delay the progress of discovery and the ultimate termination of litigation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
