As a result, her doctor prescribed a continuous glucose monitor (\"CGM\"). In March, 2013, Lewis submitted five CGM device claims to the National Health Insurance Corporation (\"the NHIC\") for a total of $ 2,482. Those claims were denied and plaintiff appealed to the Medicare Appeals Council (\"MAC\") in March, 2014. The MAC also denied her claims, finding that because the CGM was \"precautionary\" and did not \"serve a medical purpose\", it was not covered under the Durable Medical Equipment (\"DME\") Medicare benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the MAC denial, plaintiff filed parallel appeals relating to her CGM claim for Medicare coverage. In October, 2015, she brought suit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\"the Secretary\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   or \"defendant\") in federal court and this Court dismissed her claim as moot in August, 2017. Upon reconsideration, however, this Court allowed plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in April, 2018, on the grounds that the Secretary's denial of CGM coverage constituted legal error and was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the same time, plaintiff appealed the MAC decision to the Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division (\"CRD\"), in December, 2015. In April, 2016, the CRD reversed the MAC decision on the grounds that NHIC's reliance on two informal determinations, the Local Coverage Determination (\"LCD\") and the Local Coverage Article (\"LCA\"), was unreasonable (\"the LCD challenge\"). That decision was then vacated by the Departmental Appeals Board, Appellate Division, one year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pending before the Court is plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs incurred during this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lewis has filed three motions: a motion for costs, a motion for fees and a motion to strike. The motion to strike relates to the Secretary's sur-reply. The Court will address the motion to strike before moving on to the underlying analysis of the fees and costs claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's motion to strike defendant's sur-reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff moves to strike the Secretary's sur-reply on the grounds that counsel 1) did not meet and confer in good faith to the narrow issues in this litigation and 2) failed to identify new arguments by plaintiff in his sur-reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Secretary responds that 1) Local Rule 7.1 does not require a conference with respect to the substance of every memorandum and 2) plaintiff has provided no authority for her motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court agrees with plaintiff that the Secretary had ample opportunity to contest fees because they were disclosed in great detail, including the fees related to the LCD challenge. In fact, it does not appear that any of the Secretary's sur-reply responses arises out of \"new\" information discovered since plaintiff's reply. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the tenuous grounds on which defendant submits her sur-reply, motions to strike pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) are limited to pleadings identified in Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a). Because this sur-reply does not qualify as a pleading under Rule 12(f), plaintiff's motion to strike will be denied and the Court will consider it with respect to the underlying motion for fees. Plaintiff will not be entitled to fees relating to the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

He further points to the administrative record in this case wherein plaintiff's own physician noted that she must consult with her traditional fingerstick testing before adjusting\n   her insulin pump dosage. Finally, he contends that dismissal for lack of standing was justified because plaintiff's complaint sought declaratory relief and it was not clear that she was seeking payment for past claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To the extent that the Secretary continues to argue that the fingerstick method precludes a finding that CGMs serve a medical purpose, the Court reiterates its order at summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The fact that fingersticks may be used to confirm the results of a CGM does not deprive a CGM of its \"primarily medical\" character. First, Medicare frequently covers confirmatory testing. Second, the FDA recognizes that a CGM may be a diabetic's sole means of monitoring glucose levels. The Secretary's assertion that a device loses its medical nature if it is used in conjunction with another medical device is contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The fact that the Secretary was ultimately the losing party, does not, in itself, warrant the award of fees because it is possible that the government can \"take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose\".\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p565\">\n    487 U.S. at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p565\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since 2015, however, three district courts and more than 40 ALJs have disagreed with the Secretary's position that CGMs do not qualify as DME. Thus, the Court concludes that the breadth of decisions contrary to the Secretary's position demonstrates a \"string of losses\" that connotes a lack of substantial justification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p565\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, in citing the exceptional ALJ decisions that support the Secretary's position, his claim that ALJ decisions are not precedential is disingenuous. The Court further notes that the ALJ decisions that have affirmed the Secretary's position predate 2015, while more recent decisions have recognized the trend that CGMs are DME.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Azar\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:16-CV-121,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20583111\">\n    2018 WL 583111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D.

Reasonableness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Secretary argues that plaintiff's request for fees is significantly higher than the fees requested in similar cases and that she is seeking fees for an unrelated LCD challenge. Lewis replies that, putting aside the fees incurred in connection with the motion to alter and the LCD challenge, the remaining fees are less than those fees requested in similar cases. Furthermore, while the LCD challenge occurred in an administrative proceeding not before this Court, plaintiff argues that the issues of the LCD challenge and the DME determination are intertwined and had she not been successful in the administrative proceeding, the LCD challenge would have been an issue before this Court. The Secretary rejoins that plaintiff is only entitled to approximately $ 32,000 in fees which is a reduction in the award requested because counsel allegedly overbilled for fees incurred with respect to 1) unrelated administrative proceedings and 2) filings that were substantially similar to those made in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court will reduce the \u00a7 2421(d) award by $ 52,245 (258 hours at $ 202.50 per hour) because, while the Civil Remedies Division found for plaintiff with respect to her LCD challenge, that decision was vacated by the appellate court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, plaintiff was not the prevailing party with respect to the LCD challenge and she did not appeal that decision to this Court.

Finally, the Court will not credit the Secretary's challenge for\n   fees allegedly incurred for substantially similar filings because the Court finds such time spent (approximately 70 hours) to be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff's counsel will be awarded $ 49,477 in costs and fees pursuant to \u00a7 2412(d), based on the COLA award ($ 101,096) less the reduction calculated by the Court ($ 52,245) plus the bill of costs ($ 626).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Section 2412(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Lewis also moves for fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). To prevail under that section, she must prove that the losing party's claim was 1) meritless and 2) brought for improper purposes such as harassment or delay.\n   <em>\n    Kerin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Postal Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192883\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/185/#p190\">\n    218 F.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The latter inquiry requires a showing that the losing party acted in \"bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192883\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/185/#p190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Both parties reiterate their arguments on substantial justification to defend (or attack) the merits of the Secretary's position. The Court declines to address whether the \"substantial justification\" and \"meritless\" standards converge but instead finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the second inquiry of \"improper purposes\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court is disconcerted by 1) allegations that counsel on behalf of the Secretary refused to meet and confer with plaintiff's counsel to narrow issues throughout the litigation and 2) the inference that the Secretary raised the issue of mootness (which was later overruled by this Court on a motion to reconsider) when plaintiff clearly sought reimbursement for prior denials of coverage. Nevertheless, the standard of bad faith is a high burden and plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Secretary's actions were so exceptional as to warrant an award of fees under \u00a7 2412(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordeco Dev.

In that case, the district court found bad faith because, contrary to a mandatory congressional directive, the Secretary failed to mail plan information to eligible Medicare beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279651\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/304/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279651\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/304/36/\">\n    at 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Secretary is required to cover devices that are \"primarily and customarily used for a medical purpose\", that action requires the Secretary to make a determination as to coverage eligibility. The decision-making process is one step removed from the actions in\n   <em>\n    Gray Panthers\n   </em>\n   where there was clear and convincing evidence that the Secretary violated an unambiguous congressional mandate by failing to mail out required information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279651\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/304/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279651\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/304/36/\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the government acted with \"improper purpose\", the Court declines to award attorneys' fees pursuant to \u00a7 2412(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This finding does not absolve counsel of their obstructive conduct throughout this protracted and unnecessarily expensive litigation.
