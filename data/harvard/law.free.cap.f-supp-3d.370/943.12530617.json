Am. Compl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 10; Plan, Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Ex. A, ECF No. 12-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   UMR determines whether\n   the Plan covers the health-related claims Plan participants submit and also provides \"information and advice concerning [Plan] coverage to interested parties that inquire about coverage via telephone and other communication mediums.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June and July of 2015, Plaintiff Marchele Mahnesmith, Weeks's daughter and healthcare power of attorney, repeatedly contacted UMR to determine whether the Plan covered in-home healthcare services for Weeks, who suffers from dementia, delirium, and arthritis. UMR's automated message advised her that she could not rely on information given during the phone call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Once Mahnesmith reached a UMR employee, she asked whether in-home healthcare services would be covered under Weeks's Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. The UMR employee, who knew about the recorded message but who also knew that Mahnesmith would rely on the information provided anyway in order to plan for Weeks's medical needs, informed her that Weeks's Plan would cover in-home healthcare services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 35. UMR also told Preferred Home Health Care (\"Preferred\"), Mahnesmith's chosen provider, that Weeks's Plan covered one hundred percent of the cost of the in-home healthcare services Preferred contemplated providing for Weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. In reliance on UMR's continued verbal approvals and assurances to herself and Preferred, Mahnesmith contracted with Preferred to provide in-home healthcare services to Weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Ultimately, UMR refused to provide full payment for Weeks's in-home healthcare services under the Plan, so Mahnesmith \"was forced to hastily find alternative, more reasonably price[d] care for [Weeks] outside [Mahnesmith's] home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Weeks was moved to an assisted living facility and, as a result, suffered from additional health issues and severe emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Mahnesmith suffered severe emotional distress due to the rushed treatment change, Preferred's unpaid invoices, and seeing the decline in Weeks's health and mental wellbeing after she was moved to the assisted living facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. UMR intended Mahnesmith to rely on its erroneous statements, did not intend to be bound by them, and was aware of Weeks and Mahnesmith's vulnerability to financial injury and emotional distress in this context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in state court.
