MOON, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Brennan Gilmore was among hundreds of individuals who gathered in\n   Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017 to protest various white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups participating in the \"Unite the Right\" rally. As Gilmore recorded footage of protestors that afternoon, he captured James Alex Fields, Jr. driving into a crowd, killing Heather Heyer and injuring approximately thirty-six others. Gilmore posted this footage on Twitter, and the video quickly went viral. Gilmore alleges that, in the days after August 12, Defendants published articles and videos falsely portraying him as a \"deep state\" operative who conspired to orchestrate violence in Charlottesville for political purposes. Gilmore brought suit in this Court against Defendants for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss on multiple grounds. Various defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. All defendants move to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), asserting that this Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over any defendant. All defendants contend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) that Gilmore fails to state claims against them for either defamation or IIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court holds that it can exercise diversity jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that it can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over all defendants except Defendant Allen B. West, who will be dismissed. The Court further holds that Gilmore has adequately pled defamation against Defendants but has not adequately pled IIED. Thus, Gilmore's defamation claims will survive, but his IIED claims will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gilmore brings claims for defamation and IIED against eleven defendants.

Comp. \u00b6 17; dkt. 29-6). A former employee of\n   <em>\n    Breitbart News\n   </em>\n   , Stranahan currently operates\n   <em>\n    The Populist\n   </em>\n   , a \"political journalism\" website. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 17). Stranahan is also allegedly an employee of\n   <em>\n    RT\n   </em>\n   , a Russian television network that recently registered with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Gilmore alleges that Stranahan is domiciled in Dallas, Texas but temporarily lives and works in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, \"conduct[ing] business\" from a \"shared workspace in Arlington, Virginia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Stranahan is the only defendant who disputes that he is domiciled outside of Virginia. (Dkt. 47 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Defendant Lee Ann Fleissner, a.k.a.

On August 15, 2017, McAdoo authored an article posted on the\n   <em>\n    InfoWars\n   </em>\n   website entitled \"\n   <em>\n    Bombshell Connection Between Charlottesville, Soros, CIA.\n   </em>\n   \" (Am.

Defendants Alex Jones (\"Jones\"), InfoWars, LLC (\"InfoWars\"), and Free Speech Systems, LLC (\"Free Speech Systems\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Domiciled in Austin, Texas, Jones is the owner and publisher of the\n   <em>\n    InfoWars\n   </em>\n   website, as well as the host of associated radio and web-based shows. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 14; dkt. 57-1 at 1). InfoWars is a Texas limited liability company (LLC) operating as the website InfoWars.com. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 15). InfoWars \"presents itself as a news media outlet\" and \"funds its work by the sale of various dietary supplements on its online store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-24).

Infowars.com is labeled a \"Free Speech Systems, LLC website,\" and purchases of InfoWars dietary supplements \"may result in a billing entry on the purchaser's credit card as Free Speech Systems, LLC or Magnolia Management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Gilmore alleges that these defendants published defamatory statements about him in the August 15, 2017 article authored by McAdoo and the accompanying video featuring McAdoo and Stranahan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 83). Jones allegedly posted the article text and video on his YouTube channel and Twitter account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88). Gilmore asserts that these defendants also\n   published defamatory statements in a video Jones produced entitled \"\n   <em>\n    Breaking: State Department/CIA Orchestrated Charlottesville Tragedy.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102; dkt. 57-1).

(Am. Comp. \u00b6 21; dkt. 59-1 at 1). Gilmore alleges that West owns the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which published an allegedly defamatory article entitled \"\n   <em>\n    BOMBSHELL: New evidence suggests Charlottesville was a complete SET-UP.\n   </em>\n   \" (Am. Comp. \u00b6 21). Wilburn, domiciled in Colorado Springs, Colorado, authored that article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; dkt. 47-5). Words-N-Ideas, an allegedly inactive Florida LLC, is identified by Gilmore as the \"purported owner\" of the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 24). Hickford, also domiciled in Florida, is the managing member, registered agent, and self-described \"President\" of Words-N-Ideas, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; dkt. 47-4 at 2), as well as the alleged \"editor-in-chief\" of the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 23). West contends that Hickford and Words-N-Ideas owned and operated the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website when Wilburn's article was published, and that he had \"no involvement with operating the website\" or publishing the article. (Dkt. 59-1 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AS ALLEGED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Gilmore, in \"his personal capacity,\" was among the many \"peaceful counter-protestors\" who gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017 \"in opposition\" to the Unite the Right rally. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 27). The rally was organized by various white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups as a response to the Charlottesville City Council's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park and change that park's name from \"Lee Park\" to \"Emancipation Park.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). Gilmore captured footage of James Alex Fields, Jr. driving into a crowd of protestors, and shared this video on Twitter to show that the attack was \"deliberate\" and \"to help convince the public to stay off the streets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Soon after sharing this footage, Gilmore received interview requests from local, national, and international media outlets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). Between August 12 and 13, 2017, Gilmore spoke with multiple outlets \"to provide an eyewitness account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). Gilmore did not solicit these interview requests \"or ask media outlets to share his video.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). Defendants published articles and videos containing statements about Gilmore between August 13, 2017 (the publication date of Creighton's article and video) and August 21, 2017 (the publication date of Jones's video). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-144). Gilmore alleges that these publications falsely portray him as \"a 'Deep State operative' who helped orchestrate the violence in Charlottesville.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After Defendants' publications appeared online, Gilmore allegedly \"became the subject of a barrage of harassing and threatening messages that made him fear for his personal safety as well as the safety of his family members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Gilmore describes disturbances such as attempted hacks into his online accounts, the posting of his parents' address online, a confrontation with a\n   disgruntled stranger on the street, and the mailing of an unknown chemical substance to his parents' home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154, 157-63). As a result of stress related to these disturbances, Gilmore has been diagnosed with a medical condition causing a loss of vision in his right eye, and has experienced \"exacerbated\" symptoms of depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants' publications have also allegedly harmed Gilmore professionally. Gilmore claims that his company has lost potential clients and partners, and that he \"may need to remove himself altogether from the company's client-facing work\" to prevent harm to the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187). Gilmore asserts that it will be \"difficult\" for him to serve as a diplomat if he returns to the State Department due to the reputational harm inflicted by Defendants' publications, and claims that \"government officials who have endorsed Defendants' lies\" would \"likely\" seek to \"oust him from government service entirely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188-89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss on three grounds. First, some defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing this Court cannot exercise diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkts. 46; 58). Second, all defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), arguing that the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over any defendant. (Dkts. 46; 56; 58). Third, all defendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that Gilmore fails to state claims for either defamation or IIED. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants Creighton, Hoft, Stranahan, Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), arguing that (1) the parties are not completely diverse because Stranahan, like Gilmore, is a citizen of Virginia; and (2) Gilmore fails to adequately allege that the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 47 at 7-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) tests a district court's subject matter jurisdiction.

Indeed, Stranahan concedes this point, stating only that it \"never occurred\" to him to remove himself from Texas's voter rolls because he has \"not been an active voter\" since 2012. (Dkt. 47-1 at 3).

Stranahan's voter registration records indicate that he remained actively registered in Texas following a \"change/audit date\" of December 5, 2017. (Dkt. 70-1 at 2). Under Texas law, Stranahan was almost certainly capable of receiving mail at a Texas address in December 2017. Otherwise, the renewal certificate mailed to the address he previously listed on his voter registration application would have been returned to the registrar as undeliverable, and the registrar would have placed Stranahan on the suspense list. The evidence Stranahan offers of Virginia domicile-including statements that he intends to reside in Virginia for the \"foreseeable future,\" (dkt. 47-1 at 1), and a W-2 form indicating that his employer withheld Virginia income taxes in 2017, (dkt. 91-2)-is insufficient to rebut the presumption of Texas domicile created by his active voter registration in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Four additional factors weigh in favor of finding that Stranahan was domiciled in Texas at the time Gilmore filed this action. First, although Stranahan presents W-2 forms indicating his employer withheld Virginia income taxes in 2017, (dkt. 91-2), his statement that he had not actually \"filed a Virginia Income Tax Return\" but rather \"filed for an extension\" diminishes the significance of this evidence. (Dkt. 47-1 at 1). Second, Stranahan does not dispute Gilmore's allegation that he solicited payments \"via a Pay-Pal account belonging to Stranahan Strategies,\" which Texas Comptroller records indicate is an inactive Texas LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkts. 70 at 20; 70-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, Stranahan currently rents an apartment in a \"We Live/We Work complex\" in Arlington, Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gilmore alleges that this complex is a \"temporary shared housing community where patrons are able to utilize living and office space without a long-term commitment.\" (Dkt. 70 at 20-21). Although Stranahan's residence in such a housing complex does not necessarily preclude him from establishing domicile in Virginia, it suggests he has not made a permanent home in Virginia. Fourth, Stranahan has been evasive about where his family, specifically his wife, resided at the time this action was filed. Gilmore alleges that Stranahan's wife is actively registered to vote in Texas and that she voted there as recently as 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Although Stranahan avers in his declarations that he had \"no immediate family\" in Texas in 2017, (dkt. 47-1), and that \"to the best of [his] knowledge, no one related to [him] by blood or marriage has lived in Texas since November 2016,\" (dkt. 91-1), Stranahan does not assert that his wife or any other family member lived in Virginia when this action was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Stranahan has never revealed where his wife resided when this action was filed,\n   and his counsel could not answer questions on this subject at oral argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Gilmore has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Stranahan was domiciled in Texas at the time this action was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, \u00a7 1332(a)'s requirement of complete diversity is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Hoft wrote that the \"random Charlottesville observer\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Gilmore) is a \"deep state shill with links to George Soros,\" and that \"[i]t looks like the State Department was involved in Charlottesville rioting and is trying to cover it up.\" (Dkt. 29-5 at 2, 4). After noting that Gilmore was \"Chief of Staff for liberal Rep.

Hoft concluded by writing in his own words: \"This weekend Brennan Gilmore happened to be in Charlottesville with the rioters.

Although\n   <em>\n    The Gateway Pundit\n   </em>\n   does not have a Virginia-specific focus, Hoft's article was exclusively about a particular Virginia citizen's participation in a Virginia event. Indeed, the title makes clear that the article's focus is a \"Random Man\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Gilmore) \"at Protests.\" (Dkt. 29-5 at 1). The Virginia-specific focus of the article is further emphasized by Hoft's discussion of Perriello, a Virginia political figure, and by Hoft's use of articles by local Virginia newspapers as sources for his assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p788\">\n    465 U.S. at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p788\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the article at issue, although written in Florida, \"was drawn from California sources\").

Comp. \u00b6 83; dkt. 29-6). The three-sentence article authored by McAdoo reads as follows: \"As demonstrated this weekend, a civil war is brewing in this country, laying the foundation for a violent coup to take out Trump. Soros-funded NGO's have been able to achieve regime change in other countries\n   by quite literally teaming up with Neo-nazis and 'moderate' terrorists. Now, investigative reporter Lee Stranahan reveals the same players involved in the Ukraine overthrow are working behind the scenes to oust President Trump.\" (Dkt. 29-6 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In the accompanying video, McAdoo interviewed Stranahan about a \"deep state coup underway to oust Trump.\" (Dkt. 122 at 3). Stranahan asserted that \"the US sponsored a coup\" in the Ukraine \"that was funded by [George] Soros\" and \"set up by the Obama administration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Stranahan made several comparisons between this alleged Ukrainian coup and the Unite the Right rally, describing the rally as \"an agitation situation like we saw in Ukraine in 2013 and 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 8, 10). McAdoo made similar comparisons, stating that \"these white nationalists in Charlottesville were chanting\" the \"exact same slogan, the blood and soil\" and \"had the same tiki torches\" as \"paid protestors\" in the Ukraine, asserting that \"we are also seeing those same protestors\" in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). McAdoo later stated that \"the media\" is \"using what's going on in Charlottesville\" to \"label[ ]\" \"everyone on the right that doesn't disavow\" white nationalists as a \"Nazi or a Russian agent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Stranahan also discussed Gilmore, describing him as \"with the U.S. State Department\" and having \"worked for a Democratic representative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Stranahan and McAdoo then displayed screenshots of Gilmore's Twitter page where Gilmore had posted \"a picture of the young woman who was murdered\" with the caption \"martyr.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22). Stranahan noted that protestors in Ukraine's Maidan Square also \"needed martyrs\" or \"someone dead,\" and later stated that \"someone really needs to investigate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Gilmore alleges that Jones posted this video and the text of McAdoo's article on\n   <em>\n    The Alex Jones Channel\n   </em>\n   on YouTube on August 15, 2017, and shared a link to both on Twitter the same day. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although this article and video present a closer question than Creighton or Hoft's publications, the Court finds that Gilmore has satisfied his burden of \"making a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing in support of [his] assertion of jurisdiction\" over McAdoo, Stranahan, InfoWars, Free Speech Systems, and Jones on the basis of these publications.\n   <em>\n    Universal Leather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316399\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/553/#p558\">\n    773 F.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, the video contains a lengthy discussion of a supposed Ukrainian coup. But the clear purpose of the article and video is to connect this \"coup\" to the Unite the Right rally, and to frame the rally as part of an ongoing \"deep state coup\" designed to undermine and \"oust\" President Trump. Indeed, the title of the article and video make clear that the purpose of these publications is to reveal a \"[b]ombshell [c]onnection\" between \"Charlottesville, Soros, [and the] CIA.\" (Dkt. 29-6 at 3). Similarly, the article's text suggests that the video will reveal that the \"same players involved in the Ukraine overthrow\" were working \"behind the scenes\" at the rally and elsewhere to \"oust President Trump.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, the video transcript is littered with discussion of the rally, (dkt. 122 at 7-12, 18, 24-25, 29, 48), and Gilmore, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22). That Stranahan and McAdoo did not discuss the rally or Gilmore\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   is unremarkable, since the \"general thrust and content\" of the video was a discussion of \"deep state\" forces supposedly underlying a Virginia event.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , 315, F.3d at 263.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that these defendants \"manifested an intent\" to target a Virginia audience by publishing an article and video focused on the political forces supposedly underlying a Virginia event and a Virginia citizen's role in\n   that event.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316399\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/553/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike the ISP-defendant in\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   , none of the defendants allegedly involved with these publications played a passive role: McAdoo wrote the article containing the video and allegedly defamed Gilmore during her interview with Stranahan; Stranahan uttered much of the allegedly tortious content in the video; InfoWars published the article on InfoWars.com, a website operated by Free Speech Systems; and Jones republished the article and video on his YouTube channel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am.

Comp. \u00b6 102; dkt. 29-7). On InfoWars.com, the video was posted alongside text reading: \"The deep state is working overtime trying to divide America.... Alex Jones breaks down shocking revelations into the Charlottesville riots including who was behind the attack and why they did it!!\". (Dkt. 29-7 at 3). In the video, Jones allegedly asserted that the violence in Charlottesville was part of an orchestrated plot involving \"known CIA and State Department officials in Charlottesville\" and \"[t]he mayor\" of Charlottesville, all of whom Jones described as \"cut-out[s],\" a term Gilmore asserts denotes individuals \"involved in espionage who act[ ] as an intermediary or channel of communication between a spymaster and other subagents of a covert operation.\" (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 104, n. 62; 109). The video allegedly featured a \"narration of the alleged testimony\" of a Charlottesville police officer stating that the violence in Charlottesville was \"set up to further the agenda of the elites.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Jones's video allegedly included commentary about Gilmore, spoken by a narrator while various images of Gilmore were successively displayed, including side-by-side photographs of Gilmore and George Soros. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After noting Gilmore's experience with the State Department and Perriello, the narrator framed as \"fishy\" that \"the first man on the scene whose tweet went viral and who was later interviewed on mainstream news as a witness just happened to be a State Department insider with a long history of involvement in psy-ops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The narrator then asserted that Gilmore's \"information was suddenly removed from the State Department websites\" following his tweet and media appearances, citing this as evidence that the \"elites know we're on to them and are trying to cover their tracks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here again, the Court finds that this video was sufficiently aimed at a Virginia audience to warrant the exercise of\n   specific personal jurisdiction over Jones, InfoWars, and Free Speech Systems. Although neither InfoWars.com nor\n   <em>\n    The Alex Jones Channel\n   </em>\n   has a Virginia-specific focus, Jones's video was exclusively focused on a Virginia event, and a significant portion of the video discussed particular Virginia citizens' alleged roles in that event. The video's title makes clear that the \"Charlottesville [t]ragedy\" is the focal point of the video. (Dkt. 29-7). As with Hoft and Creighton's publications, Jones's discussion of Perriello further reinforces the video's Virginia-specific focus. And, here again, there are significant distinctions between this video and the facts of\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Young.\n   </em>\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , Jones's video is exclusively, not tangentially, focused on Virginia residents and a Virginia event. And, unlike the ISP-defendant in\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' involvement with the video here was not passive: Jones produced the video, (dkt. 57-1), and posted it on his YouTube channel and InfoWars.com, which is operated by Free Speech Systems, a company Jones allegedly owns. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 16; dkt. 57-2). Accordingly, because Jones, InfoWars, and Free Speech Systems \"manifested an intent to direct\" this video at a Virginia audience, the Court finds that it can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over these defendants.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374626\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/256/#p263\">\n    315 F.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

The article stated that a Charlottesville police officer had \"come forward\" to \"reveal the truth\" that \"what went down in the city was not only condoned by city governance but was intentional, orchestrated and may have been\n   <em>\n    planned\n   </em>\n   as long ago as May.\" (Dkt. 29-8 at 2). Wilburn's article quoted material from a YourNewsWire.com article where this officer allegedly said that police \"were specifically instructed to bring the radical left and right wing groups together to instigate violence and then told to 'stand down' once violence ensued in a deliberate effort to ignite a race riot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilburn wrote that, \"if true,\" this \"revelation ... may implicate Mayor Signer [of Charlottesville] and possibly other city officials in the death of a citizen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Wilburn also quoted material from the YourNewsWire.com article about Gilmore, the substance of which appears identical to the commentary about Gilmore in Jones's video, including statements suggesting that Gilmore was one of the \"actors in this enormous set-up event,\" that Gilmore's presence in Charlottesville during the rally was \"fishy,\" that Gilmore is a \"State Department insider with a long history of involvement in psy-ops,\" and that Gilmore was \"presented as an accidental witness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court finds that Wilburn's article was sufficiently targeted at a Virginia audience to permit the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas. As with the previously discussed publications, the \"general thrust and content\" of Wilburn's article is focused on a Virginia event and, in part, on a Virginia citizen's role in that event.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374626\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/256/#p263\">\n    315 F.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here again, the article's Virginia-specific focus is also highlighted by the title, which promises \"[n]ew evidence\" about \"Charlottesville.\" (Dkt. 29-8 at 2). In addition to discussing Gilmore, the article also contains repeated references to Virginia political figures like Perriello and Signer. (Dkt. 29-8 at 2-3, 5-6). Here again, there are crucial distinctions between this article and the facts of\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Young.\n   </em>\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , Wilburn's article is focused only on Virginia events, a Virginia citizen, and Virginia political figures. And, unlike in\n   <em>\n    ALS Scan\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' involvement with this article was not passive: Wilburn wrote the article, and Hickford allegedly published it on the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website as the site's editor-in-chief and as the \"managing member and registered agent\" of Words-N-Ideas, which allegedly owned AllenBWest.com. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 125). Accordingly, the Court finds that it can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court finds, however, that it cannot exercise specific personal jurisdiction over West. Gilmore does not allege that West authored the article or played any direct role in developing the article's content. Setting aside conclusory allegations that West \"published\" and \"ratified\" Wilburn's article, (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 271, 280), Gilmore simply alleges that West owned AllenBWest.com, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21), and \"shared a link to the article\" on Twitter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133). West disputes these assertions, stating in a declaration that he \"was not involved with any decision to publish or republish\" the article, that he \"did not author or contribute to the article in any way,\" that Words-N-Ideas and Hickford \"purchased and operated\" the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website and exclusively operated his Facebook and Twitter accounts. (Dkt. 59-1). In response, Gilmore presents only a letter sent to West's counsel declining to drop his claims against West because the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website contained West's picture, biography, and contact information, creating the appearance that West \"owned, controlled, and endorsed\" all content published on the website. (Dkts. 70 at 45, n.15; 70-10 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Gilmore fails to make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that this Court can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over West. Unlike with the other defendants and publications discussed above, Gilmore makes no concrete factual allegation that West played any direct role in writing, editing, or developing Wilburn's article, or that West generally exerted editorial control over AllenBWest.com. Moreover, Gilmore's allegation that West owned the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website, (Am. Comp. \u00b6 21), is not plausibly pled because the amended complaint includes conflicting and overlapping allegations that Words-N-Ideas was the \"purported owner\" of the\n   <em>\n    Allen B. West\n   </em>\n   website, and that Hickford was the \"managing member and registered agent\" of Words-N-Ideas and served as the \"editor-in-chief\" of the website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; dkt. 70 at 61). Because Gilmore's allegation that West owned AllenBWest.com is not plausibly pled, neither are his allegations that Wilburn acted as West's agent or employee in writing the allegedly tortious article. (Am.

First, the underlying rationale for Virginia's traditional interpretation of\n   <em>\n    lex loci delicti\n   </em>\n   as the place of the tortious action is that approach's \"uniformity, predictability, and ease of application.\"\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=253%20S.E.2d%20662\">\n    253 S.E.2d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a multi-defendant, multi-state Internet tort case, those values are effectuated only by defining the \"place of the wrong\" as the place where the plaintiff's injuries are concentrated and thereby applying only one state's law. Defining the \"place of the wrong\" as the place of publication in a case like this would inevitably require the cumbersome application of a patchwork of state law. Indeed, in a case involving defamatory statements made on a nationally syndicated radio show \"published simultaneously in multiple state jurisdictions,\" the Fourth Circuit noted that \"application of the traditional\n   <em>\n    lex loci delicti\n   </em>\n   rule becomes cumbersome, if not completely impractical\" when applied in such a case.\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

The traditional\n   <em>\n    lex loci delicti\n   </em>\n   rule \"presumes that the defamatory statement is published (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , communicated to third parties) in one geographic location,\" but publication via the Internet results in instantaneous \"multistate (if not[ ] worldwide) publication.\"\n   <em>\n    Ascend Health Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201010589\">\n    2013 WL 1010589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Here, Gilmore alleges that the brunt of the personal and professional injury he suffered as a result of Defendants' publications occurred in Virginia, where he lives and works. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 1-6).

In her brief article introducing the video, McAdoo wrote: \"As demonstrated this weekend, a civil war is brewing in this country, laying the foundation for a violent coup to take out Trump.

Now, investigative reporter Lee Stranahan reveals the same players involved in the Ukraine overthrow are working behind the scenes to oust President Trump.\" (Dkt. 29-6). In the video, McAdoo stated that there is a \"deep state coup underway to oust Trump,\" and Stranahan asserted that George Soros and the Obama administration \"sponsored a coup\" in Ukraine. (Dkt. 122 at 3, 6). McAdoo and Stranahan connected this supposed Ukrainian coup to the Unite the Right rally, stating that the \"white nationalists in Charlottesville\" chanted the \"exact same slogan\" as \"paid protestors\" in the Ukraine and used \"the same tiki torches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   After describing Gilmore as a State Department employee and \"the guy who happened to catch that shot\" of Fields's attack, Stranahan spoke about Gilmore while \"scenes of violent riots ... from Oliver Stone's '\n   <em>\n    Ukraine On Fire\n   </em>\n   ' film play[ed]\" and McAdoo \"scrolled through Gilmore's Twitter page.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19; Am.

Stranahan and McAdoo's statements in the article and video are \"reasonably capable of conveying the defamatory innuendo\" that Gilmore was one of the \"players\" involved in a Ukrainian coup now using the Unite the Right rally to frame Heather Heyer as a \"martyr\" and \"oust President Trump.\"\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20S.E.2d%20759\">\n    772 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   765 ; dkts. 29-6 at 3; 122 at 3, 6, 12, 19-22. A reasonable viewer could understand Stranahan and McAdoo to be implying that Gilmore's \"tribute\" to Heyer as a \"martyr\" indicates that he was part of a secret effort to orchestrate violence and thereby create a martyr. Similarly, by stating that \"the facts\" he mentions about Gilmore are \"enough,\" that \"someone really needs to investigate,\" and that he would \"like to ask some questions about who this kid was,\" Stranahan implies that Gilmore's presence in Charlottesville was nefarious and worthy of serious investigation. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 84). Moreover, given McAdoo's description of Stranahan as an \"investigative reporter\" of \"real news,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83), and Stranahan's description of himself as a \"fact-based journalist,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84), a reasonable viewer could have understood the video \"as stating or implying actual facts\" about Gilmore.\n   <em>\n    Schaecher v.

Moreover, Gilmore plausibly alleges that Defendants attempted to \"fit [him] into [a] preexisting narrative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99). Citing specific examples, Gilmore alleges that Jones, InfoWars, and Free Speech Systems have published similar content \"claiming that previous national tragedies were 'false flags' and 'inside jobs' created by the government to push a leftist agenda.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98, n.56; 164-167).

Va. Feb. 6, 2001). Having considered the context and tenor of Wilburn's article, assumed \"the truth of all the facts properly pleaded,\" and given Gilmore \"the benefit of all facts implied and fairly and justly inferred from them,\" the Court finds that Wilburn's article is \"reasonably capable of conveying the defamatory innuendo of which [Gilmore] complains.\"\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   , 772 S.E.2d at 765.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The article's title implies that it contains \"evidence suggest[ing]\" that the events in Charlottesville were a \"complete set-up,\" priming readers to expect truthful reporting on nefarious dynamics underlying the rally. (Dkt. 29-8 at 2; Am. Comp. \u00b6 125). Additionally, Wilburn introduced the alleged officer's statements about Gilmore by stating that \"the depth of this conspiracy runs deeper,\" implying that Gilmore was part of a \"conspiracy\" surrounding the rally and that the officer had some factual basis for referring to Gilmore as an \"actor\" in a \"set-up event.\" (Dkt. 29-8 at 5-6). Considered in their full context, these statements are \"reasonably capable of conveying the defamatory innuendo\" Gilmore alleges.\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   , 772 S.E.2d at 765.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   For several reasons, the Court's conclusion is not altered by Wilburn's statements that the alleged officer's comments were \"his version\" of \"the truth,\" that the officer's \"account[ ]\" was \"as yet unverified,\" and that it would be \"serious stuff\" \"if true.\" (Dkt. 29-8 at 2, 6). First, Wilburn contradicted these disclaimers by introducing the officer's statements about Gilmore as evidence of a \"conspiracy\" of considerable \"depth,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5), and by stating that the officer's account \"points directly to the reality of the 'deep state' \" and the lengths \"the Soros/Clinton/Obama one-world government cabal\" will go to achieve \"fundamental transformation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Second, Wilburn's \"careful choice of words\" does not immunize him from defamation claims stemming from an article otherwise containing \"defamatory innuendo.\"\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   , 772 S.E.2d at 764-65. Virginia law imposes no requirement that a \"defendant's words must, by themselves, suggest that the author\n   intends or endorses the allegedly defamatory inference.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court of Virginia has rejected such a requirement because to embrace it would \"immunize one who intentionally defames another by a careful choice of words to ensure that they state no falsehoods if read out of context but convey a defamatory innuendo in the circumstances in which they were uttered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.

Accordingly, considering the article in its full context, the Court concludes that Wilburn's article conveys a \"provably false factual connotation\" about Gilmore.\n   <em>\n    Eramo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272465\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/862/#p871\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   For the same reasons discussed above with respect to Defendants' other publications, Gilmore also adequately alleges that this false innuendo \"is reasonably capable of the defamatory meaning [he] ascribes to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20S.E.2d%20808\">\n    752 S.E.2d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Gilmore asserts that these defendants never \"reach[ed] out to\" him for comment or confirmation, and never \"verified\" the \"veracity\" of the alleged police officer's account. (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 128, 131, 137). These factual allegations are concrete: Gilmore can speak directly to whether these defendants ever contacted him, and the article states that the officer is \"as-yet unidentified\" and that the officer's remarks were \"unverified.\" (Dkt. 28-9 at 2, 6). These statements support a plausible inference that Defendants failed to follow \"journalistic standards\" and repeated \"another's words\" they knew to be either \"false or inherently improbable.\"\n   <em>\n    Eramo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272465\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/862/#p871\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d at 871-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although such allegations may not ultimately be enough to establish actual malice, they are sufficient at this stage to create a \"plausible inference\" of actual malice.\n   <em>\n    Spirito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528743\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/350/471/#p481\">\n    350 F.Supp.3d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   In sum, Gilmore states claims for defamation against Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas. Defendants' motion to dismiss Gilmore's defamation claims will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Gilmore's IIED Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Defendants next argue under Rule 12(b)(6) that Gilmore fails to state claims for IIED against them. (Dkts. 46; 56). To state a claim for IIED under Virginia law, a plaintiff must allege that (1) \"the wrongdoer's conduct is intentional or reckless\"; (2) \"the conduct is outrageous and intolerable\"; (3) \"the alleged wrongful conduct and emotional distress are causally connected\"; and (4) \"the distress is severe.\"\n   <em>\n    Russo v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20160\">\n    400 S.E.2d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 162 (Va. 1991). Here, there can be no serious dispute that Gilmore sufficiently alleges that Defendants' conduct was \"intentional or reckless.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 285-88). Defendants contend that Gilmore fails to adequately allege \"outrageous and intolerable\" conduct, a causal connection between Defendants' conduct and Gilmore's distress, and emotional distress of sufficient severity under Virginia law. (Dkts. 47 at 97-102; 57 at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   To satisfy the second prong, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's \"conduct has been so outrageous, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20160\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting the veracity of Gilmore's allegations, Defendants falsely\n   portray him as a member of a \"deep state\" conspiracy who helped orchestrate violence in Charlottesville and filmed Fields's attack with foreknowledge that it would occur, all for the purpose of undermining a sitting president and the \"alt-right.\" (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 214, 284). This portrayal of Gilmore mirrors conduct the Fourth Circuit found extreme and outrageous under Virginia law in\n   <em>\n    Hatfill v. New York Times Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938193\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/320/\">\n    416 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2005). In that case, a newspaper \"intentionally published false charges accusing [the plaintiff] of being responsible for anthrax mailings that resulted in five deaths, without regard for the truth of those charges and without giving [the plaintiff] an opportunity to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938193\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938193\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/320/\">\n    at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, at this stage, the Court finds that Gilmore plausibly alleges that Defendants engaged in \"outrageous and intolerable\" conduct.\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20160\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Similarly, Gilmore sufficiently alleges that Defendants' conduct \"proximately caused\" his emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Almy v. Grisham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637491\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/182/#p188\">\n    639 S.E.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188 (Va. 2007). Although some of the harm Gilmore alleges stems from harassment by third parties who read or watched Defendants' publications, (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 146-163), Gilmore alleges that this harassment is fairly traceable to Defendants, whose past publications have allegedly resulted in similar harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 164-177). Moreover, setting aside the harassment allegedly visited upon Gilmore by third parties, Gilmore plausibly claims that Defendants' publications themselves directly harmed his health and professional reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 180-84, 187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that Gilmore has not alleged distress of sufficient severity to sustain IIED claims against Defendants. Under Virginia law, liability for IIED \"arises only when the emotional distress is extreme, and only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20160\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Gilmore alleges emotional distress of a serious nature, the harm he claims does not meet Virginia law's high standard for IIED claims for three reasons. First, much of the distress Gilmore alleges-such as stress, anxiety, sleeplessness, depression, and seeking counseling-has been deemed insufficiently severe by the Supreme Court of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Kreutzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634816\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/624/24/#p34\">\n    624 S.E.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (Va. 2006) (finding symptoms including \"nightmares, difficulty sleeping, extreme loss of self-esteem and depression,\" \"psychological treatment and counseling,\" \"mortification, humiliation, shame, disgrace, and injury to reputation\" insufficient);\n   <em>\n    Russo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20160\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding plaintiff's allegations of emotional distress insufficiently severe where plaintiff alleged \"she was nervous, could not sleep, experienced stress and 'its physical symptoms,' withdrew from activities, and was unable to concentrate at work\"). Second, although Gilmore alleges that he has reduced his social activities and may have to reduce his client-facing work, Gilmore has not alleged that he is \"functionally incapable of carrying out any of [his] work or family responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Almy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637491\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/182/#p188\">\n    639 S.E.2d at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the amended complaint makes clear that Gilmore, although inhibited personally and professionally, continues to maintain employment and occasionally \"go[ ] out\" socially. (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 184, 187).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Third, a significant portion of the distress Gilmore alleges is of a speculative nature. For instance, Gilmore alleges that he \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   need to remove himself altogether\" from his company's client-facing work but does not allege that he has actually been forced to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187 (emphasis added) ). Likewise, Gilmore claims that if he returns to the State Department, it will be \"exceedingly difficult\" for him to work as a diplomat abroad, but Gilmore does not allege that he has actually attempted to\n   return to the State Department as a diplomat and been denied a role serving in this capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). Additionally, Gilmore alleges that \"\n   <em>\n    [i]f\n   </em>\n   [he] is able to return to the State Department, it is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   that government officials\" who have \"suggested that the government needs to be purged of so-called 'Deep State' actors\" will \"work to harm [his] career or oust him from government service entirely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188-189 (emphasis added) ). But, here again, Gilmore alleges speculative future harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Gilmore fails to allege distress of sufficient severity to support IIED claims against Defendants under Virginia law. These claims will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Defendants' Motions for Immunity &amp; Attorneys' Fees under \u00a7 8.01-223.2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Defendants move for immunity and attorneys' fees under Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-223.2. (Dkts. 46; 56; 58). Section 8.01-223.2 provides that \"[a] person shall be immune from civil liability\" for a \"claim of defamation based solely on statements ... regarding matters of public concern that would be protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution made by that person that are communicated to a third party.\" However, immunity does not apply \"to any statements made with actual or constructive knowledge that they are false or with reckless disregard for whether they are false.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-223.2(A). Since Gilmore has plausibly alleged defamation with actual malice against all defendants except West-who will be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction-Defendants' motions for immunity under \u00a7 8.01-223.2 will be denied. Moreover, Defendants' motions for attorneys fees and costs under \u00a7 8.01-223.2 will similarly be denied, as the Court \"may\" award attorneys fees under \u00a7 8.01-223.2 only when an individual \"has a suit against him dismissed pursuant to\" \u00a7 8.01-223.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over all defendants except West, who will be dismissed from this action without prejudice. Gilmore adequately pleads defamation under Virginia law against all remaining defendants, and his defamation claims will therefore survive. Gilmore does not, however, adequately plead IIED under Virginia law, and his IIED claims will thus be dismissed without prejudice. Defendants' motions for immunity and attorneys fees under Va.

Similarly, in the\n    <em>\n     Politico\n    </em>\n    editorial, Gilmore wrote that the violence in Charlottesville was a \"logical outcome of our escalating, toxic politics of hate,\" that \"we now have a president who has emboldened white supremacists,\" and that \"the president's refusal to specifically denounce the groups responsible for the violence ... is the kind of enabling that I have seen turn other countries into bloody war zones.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19, n.15 (linking to editorial) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-250\">\n    Gilmore's media contacts are analogous to the activities of other individuals courts have deemed limited-purpose public figures.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carr v.

But it is unremarkable that an event that received extensive national news coverage could spawn a public controversy, and thus public figures, within hours. The ubiquity of social media and a twenty-four hour news cycle increasingly fosters an environment where public controversies develop at lightning speed. Indeed, Gilmore acknowledges this reality, noting that a public controversy about the meaning of Fields's attack had already taken shape prior to his August 12, 2017 tweet. (Am. Comp. \u00b6 31).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"44\">\n   <p id=\"p-251\">\n    Gilmore alleges that his media appearances began as early as August 12, 2017. (Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35). Questions remain at this stage about the exact timing of these initial media appearances. However, as discussed below, Gilmore has plausibly alleged actual malice-a more stringent pleading standard than he would have to meet as a private figure-against Creighton. Thus, even were he not a limited public figure at the time of Creighton's publication, Gilmore has satisfactorily stated a claim for defamation against Creighton.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"45\">\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Defendants cite the transcripts of Gilmore's appearances on\n    <em>\n     PBS Newshour\n    </em>\n    on August 23, 2017, and NPR's\n    <em>\n     All Things Considered\n    </em>\n    on August 24, 2017. (Dkt. 90 at 20, n.17). In both appearances, Gilmore commented on the rally's underlying meaning and broader political significance. For the purpose of evaluating the temporal span of Gilmore's media appearances, the Court takes judicial notice of these transcripts, the authenticity and accuracy of which Gilmore has not disputed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Zak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072535\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/597/#p607\">\n     780 F.3d at 606-07\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"46\">\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    Gilmore makes similar allegations with respect to all of Defendants' publications.
