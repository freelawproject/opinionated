(\"HDBA\") (Doc. 96) and the second filed by the City of Natchitoches, Mayor Lee Posey, Police Chief Micky Dove, and Samantha Bonnette (Doc. 102). For the reasons set forth herein, we find the motions should and will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This lawsuit arises out of the denial of an application submitted by the Louisiana Division Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) to march in the Christmas Festival of Lights Parade (Christmas Parade) in Natchitoches, Louisiana in December 2015. The Christmas Parade is one of many events held during the Christmas Festival of Lights (Christmas Festival), an annual event held in Natchitoches along the bank of the Cane River to celebrate the Christmas season. The Christmas Festival, which has been held for nearly a century has evolved over time and seen various organizers. The most recent organization to host the Christmas Festival and Christmas Parade is the HDBA; a not for profit organization whose mission is to generate tourism and commerce for the businesses in Natchitoches historical district. The HDBA volunteered in 2014 to take over the coordination and presentation of the Christmas Festival and all its events to further to further this mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To ensure that the Christmas Festival ran smoothly, the City of Natchitoches passed Ordinance No. 035 of 2014, which created a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement that documented the division of responsibilities between the City and the HDBA with respect to the Christmas Festival. The City agreed to provide for the general welfare by affording police and fire protection, and electrical and sanitation services, as well as to erect barricades and ticket booths and provide music equipment. The HDBA coordinated all details of the Christmas Festival and its events, including the Christmas Parade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, SCV applied to march in the 89\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Christmas Festival of Lights Parade. SCV participated in the Christmas Parade\n   in years prior and anticipated it would continue to do so. However, in a letter dated November 4, 2015, Fred Terasa, the Director of the HDBA Christmas Parade Committee, notified Paul Grambling that SCV's application was denied. Though no explanation for the decision was set forth in the letter, SCV was told by HDBA Christmas Festival Director Lee Waskom that the decision was based upon Mayor Posey's November 2, 2015, letter to the HDBA Christmas Festival Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The November 2, 2015, letter provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In the past several months there has been considerable discussion regarding the Confederate Flag and what it represents. For many, the flag represents a symbol of patriotism, faith, and family. However, public comments have shown that many members of the general public find the Confederate Flag to be offensive, and the City believes these comments to be reasonable. The City has determined that a significant portion of the public associate the Confederate Flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate, racism, and intolerance directed toward people or groups that is demanding to those people or groups. The City is also concerned that the display of the Confederate Flag in the Natchitoches Christmas Festival Parade could be taken by the public as an endorsement of a symbol that is viewed as racially inflammatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The City believes that a visible display of the Confederate Flag could cause substantial disruption or interference with the parade. Therefore, we respectfully request that your committee not allow the Confederate Flag and all its variations to be displayed in the Christmas Festival Parade.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 110-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The City's belief that \"substantial disruption or interference with the parade\" was likely resulted from the receipt of complaints regarding the Confederate Flag by Mayor Posey in mid to late 2015. The first complaint received was from the Natchitoches Parish Voters and Civil League, Inc. The League attended the Natchitoches City Council Meeting on August 10, 2015, and presented the Mayor and members of the City Council with a Resolution the League adopted on July 14, 2015. The Resolution provided that they had been the \"recipient of numerous contacts regarding the offensive nature of the Civil War battle enactments and prominent display of the Confederate Flag featured consistently for a number of consecutive years in the Annual Christmas Festival Parade.\" The League resolved to request that the \"Natchitoches Christmas Festival Committee ... delete the Civil War re-enactments and display of the Confederate Flag from the Christmas Festival Parade from this time forward.\" The second was received from a group of African Americans in the community to voice their objection to the display of the Confederate Flag in the Christmas Parade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mayor Posey and Chief Dove also heard rumblings that the Black Panthers might protest the Christmas Parade and that sit-ins were likely. Sensing a real possibility of protests and potential violence, Mayor Posey held meetings on October 26 and 28, 2015, to discuss security concerns. Chief\n   Dove attended both meetings and the Director of the Christmas Festival of Lights, Lee Waskom, attended the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Armed with the verbal concerns expressed by the Mayor and his letter to the HDBA Christmas Festival Committee dated November 2, 2015, Mr. Waskom advised members of the committee that he planned to honor Mayor Posey's request unless there was considerable objection. No opposition was voiced, so the request was deemed accepted. Mr. Waskom issued a letter to Mayor Posey dated November 3, 2015, acknowledging receipt of the letter and advising the Festival Committee would comply and Mr. Terasa, issued his November 4, 2015, letter advising SCV that its application for participation was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 4, 2016, SCV filed this lawsuit alleging the defendants, \"CITY OF NATCHITOCHES, LOUISIANA, LEE POSEY Mayor, City of Natchitoches, JOHN DOES ONE THRU THREE, Members of the Christmas Festival Committee Who are Officially Affiliated With the City of Natchitoches\" (Doc. 1) infringed upon the organization's rights under the First and Fourth Amendments to free speech and due process, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   of the Civil Rights Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 13, 2017, SCV amended its complaint. Part of that amendment included a paragraph referencing the HDBA but not adding it as a party. (Doc. 30). A few days later, a \"Second-Amended Complaint\" (Doc. 32) was filed adding City Chief of Police Mickey Dove and City employee, Samantha Bonnette, as defendants. It was not until September 29, 2017, that SCV officially named HDBA as a defendant via SCV's \"Third-Amended Complaint.\" (Doc. 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A single decision by a policy maker may also, under certain circumstances, constitute a policy for which a municipality may be liable. However, this single incident exception is extremely narrow and gives rise to municipal liability only if the municipal actor is a final policymaker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20Fed.%20Appx.%20459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   i. Mayor Posey\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SCV contends Mayor Posey established a policy when he issued the November 2, 2015, letter to the HDBA, an organization it worked closely with to host the Christmas Festival, as set forth in the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement. Though SCV is correct that the City and HDBA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   entered into the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement pursuant to City of Natchitoches Ordinance No. 035 of 2014, neither the Ordinance nor the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement provided any authority for the mayor to establish policies on behalf of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The City Ordinance allows the City and the HDBA to enter into the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement which establishes a division of labor for the Christmas Festival. The HDBA is responsible for \"arranging and coordinating\" the Christmas Festival and all of its events, while the City is tasked with providing services which \"promote, protect, and preserve the general welfare, safety, health, peace, and good order of the City.\" The agreement to provide services, most of which are provided any time an organization hosts an event on the riverbank or on Front Street, ends with the provision of those services. The City has no input as to how the Christmas Festival is organized. It provides the services pursuant to information it receives from the HDBA regarding its needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the City of Natchitoches is governed by a Home Rule Charter with a mayor and a five-person council comprising the executive and legislative branches respectively, an official policy would require the consent of the city council. There are no allegations nor any evidence that the mayor and city council worked together to ban SCV from marching in the Christmas Parade. Likewise, the record is devoid of facts which establish any policy or widespread practice establishing a custom. Failing to establish either an official policy or custom, the only other possible way a policy exists is if Mayor Posey is a final policymaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Mayor Posey is a policymaker for the City of Natchitoches, he must be a final policymaker for the \"single decision\" policy to apply. \"[W]hether a particular official has final policymaking authority is a question of\n   <em>\n    state law.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Jett v.

The Home Rule Charter establishes the legislative branch of the city is the five-person council, not the mayor. Accordingly, Mayor Posey cannot establish policy for the City on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Mayor's November 2, 2015, letter does not constitute an official policy of the City of Natchitoches, and without an official policy, these claims warrant dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ii. Chief Dove\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The SCV also attempts to classify Chief Dove as a policymaker for the City. However, the only policy articulated by SCV is Mayor Posey's letter. There are no facts nor any allegations connecting Chief Dove to that letter. The only involvement Chief Dove had with respect to the Christmas Parade was granting HDBA a permit. No other action and no input were provided by Chief Dove.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   iii. Ms. Bonnette\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Attempts by SCV to establish liability for actions undertaken by Ms. Bonnette also fail as she was not a policymaker for the City.

Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   HDBA argues that the third amended complaint, which named it as a defendant to this action, was filed beyond the one-year statute of limitations and cannot relate back to the original filing because the purpose of relation back under F.R.C.P. 15(c) (to address a mistake as to the proper party) is not present in this case. Rather, it is an instance where SCV identified a new defendant. In support, HBDA cites the seminal case in the Fifth Circuit regarding relation back,\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen v.

SCV argues in response, though vaguely, that the statute of limitations was tolled under Louisiana law as the two defendants are joint tortfeasors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Federal courts look to Louisiana law for its tolling provisions,\n   <em>\n    Burge v.

Civ. Code art. 2324(C). In SCV's second amended complaint, it asserts at paragraph 6 that the City and HDBA were partners who were responsible for planning, organizing, and supervising the Festival Parade.\" (Doc. 32, p.3). However, SCV fails to allege that HDBA was liable for the acts complained of. Rather, it states in the second amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"Defendant City is directly liable for acts complained of herein due to the policies, practices, procedures and customs of its Office of the Mayor and its employees. Defendant City is further directly liable for acts complained of herein due to its enactment of the policy stated in a letter (dated November 2, 205) from the Office of the Mayor that violates Plaintiff's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution to march with Confederate Battle flags (to include its corporate logo) in the Defendant City's 89\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Annual Natchitoches Christmas \"Festival of Lights\" Parade held on or about December 5, 2015. In any of his complaints, much less the third amended complaint, that HDBA is a joint tortfeasor. Not a single complaint asserts the defendants are jointly liable for the damages plaintiff allegedly sustained. Additionally, there was no mistake as to the identity of HDBA as a defendant. Plaintiff named John Does as individuals who participated on the parade committee but at no time sought to name an entity such as the HDBA. As such, relation back under Rule 15(c) is inapplicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Id.) We do not find that SCV asserted in the original or first two amended complaints\n   that HDBA was a supposed joint tortfeasor nor that it did anything wrong. It was only once it was named a defendant in amendment number three, that SCV alleged HDBA engaged in wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Even if the joint tortfeasor argument could be said to have legs, it would not work here. For interruption of prescription to have taken place as to HDBA, there would have to be in existence viable claims against the City and/or its employees.

That is, did the private actor have a choice to refrain from engaging in the conduct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mayor Posey's letter was nothing more than a request to the HDBA to consider banning the Confederate Flag from the Christmas Parade. Mayor Posey testified in his deposition that he knew the decision to ban the Confederate Flag was that of the HDBA and that it could deny his request. Mr. Waskom and Ms. Bonnette stated during their depositions that they understood the letter was a request of the\n   HDBA and that it could vote to deny it. Instead, the Christmas Festival Parade Committee considered the request in light of the security concerns the City faced and decided it would honor the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SCV fails to show that there was coercion by any state actor to ensure the Confederate Flag was banned and there is certainly no evidence that the ban was intended to infringe upon the First Amendment rights of the SCV.

Nexus/joint action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, under the nexus/joint action test, a private party is found to be a state actor where the government has \"so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the [private actor] that it was a joint participant in the enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505608\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/288/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SCV attempts to establish an interdependence of the HDBA and the City by pointing to the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement, the City's membership in the HDBA, Ms. Bonnette's role on the Christmas Festival Committee, and fiscal arrangements between the HDBA and the City. However, none of these examples, alone nor in combination, evidence the interdependence needed to satisfy the nexus/joint action test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Cooperative Endeavor Agreement was established to ensure the Christmas Festival ran smoothly. The Agreement was desired by the City after it had a breakdown in communication with the prior, private, entity responsible for the Christmas Festival. The Agreement did not alter the fact a private entity (in this case the HDBA) organized and implemented plans for the Christmas Festival and its events. The Agreement simply set forth the specific function the City played.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   SCV also argues the interdependence of the two entities is evidenced by the City's membership in the HDBA and Ms. Bonnette's role as a member of both the Christmas Festival and Christmas Parade committees. Though the City was a member of the HDBA, Mayor Posey had little involvement with the organization. Of any purported state actor, the most involved was Ms. Bonnette; yet, her role was limited. While she was a member of the HDBA and served on the Christmas Festival Committee and Parade Committee, she had no vote in Parade Committee matters. Her sole function on that committee was to act as a liaison to coordinate the provision of public works by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The argument that there are financial ties between the two organizations, further substantiating interdependence, is equally unfounded. Deposition testimony consistently provided the HDBA was fiscally responsible for the Christmas Festival and the City did not pay any money from its budget to the HDBA for the event. HDBA raised funds throughout the year to host the Christmas Festival. Per the Cooperative Endeavor Agreement, it paid the City a sum from the profits which the City placed into its general fund to cover public works expenditures such as clean up. Though the City provided services for opening weekend, those expenses were covered by a grant obtained from the State of Louisiana to promote tourism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   There is simply no evidence before the court that HDBA was a state actor. Accordingly, as it is a private entity which did not engage in state action, the claims against it lack merit and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, though SCV's claims lack merit and warrant dismissal, we believe it is worth noting that SCV's claims for punitive damages would fail in any event.

Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    461 U.S. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298143\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/30/\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   SCV failed to produce evidence that the City, HDBA, or any of their employees/members engaged in any malicious conduct or acts of reckless or callous indifference to SCV's rights under the First Amendment. Even if they had, the City would also be immune as municipalities have been found incapable of forming the requisite intent to support such an award under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    City of Newport v. Fact Concerts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722428\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/247/#p267\">\n    453 U.S. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722428\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/247/#p267\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722428\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/247/#p267\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the defendants' motions for summary judgment (Docs. 96 and 102) will be GRANTED and SCV's claims will be dismissed with prejudice. The court will issue a judgment in conformity with these findings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Several references are made in the motions for summary judgment that the application was also denied because the SCV failed to acknowledge that it would adhere to the HDBA's Parade Standards of Excellence. The Court finds this reasoning to be an afterthought and not the actual basis for the denial. Accordingly, it will not be addressed in detail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    SCV also argues that Chief Dove is liable in some way because he\n    <em>\n     might\n    </em>\n    have harassed, threatened, arrested or intimidated SCV had they shown up to march with their Confederate Flags. This speculation is insufficient to constitute actionable conduct. Accordingly, it will not be addressed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    HDBA argues\n    <em>\n     City of Newport\n    </em>\n    would apply by extension to it because it is a private entity unable to form intent. While we found several cases outside of this Circuit discussing the application of punitive damages to private entities that engaged in state action, we did not find any case law supporting HDBA's position. As the dismissal of claims against HDBA renders the question moot, we reserve judgment on the issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
