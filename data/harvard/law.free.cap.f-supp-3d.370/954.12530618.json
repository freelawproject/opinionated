R. Civ. P. 56(a). As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant's factual assertion can result in the movant's fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court need only consider disputed facts that are material to the decision.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 68\n   </em>\n   .] On July 13, 2017, in lieu of a response to the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Cochran informed the Court that he \"desired\" to settle the matter with the Commission. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79\n   </em>\n   .] On August 18, 2017, the Court ruled on the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment, but only as it related to the Commission's claims against Mr. Durham. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 86\n   </em>\n   .] With regard to Mr. Cochran, the Court stated that \"the Magistrate Judge assigned to this case has been asked to convene a conference to attempt to resolve the claims against Mr. Cochran\" and that the Court's Order \"only relates to the Commission's claims against Mr. Durham.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 86 at n.2\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 14, 2017, the Commission advised that it had not yet reached a settlement agreement with Mr. Cochran. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 97\n   </em>\n   .] Five days later, Mr. Cochran filed a document with the Court in which he argued that the Commission had relied upon inadmissible hearsay in pursuing its claims against him and that, in attempting to settle the matter, the Commission was \"trying to get one over on\" him. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 99 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] Following additional settlement efforts before the Magistrate Judge, on February 26, 2018, Mr. Cochran filed a document with the Court in which he questioned the $ 183 million disgorgement amount sought by the Commission in its previous Motion for Summary Judgment and proposed a new disgorgement amount of approximately $ 24.5 million. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 108\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 13, 2018, the Commission filed a Motion to Determine Disgorgement with regard to Mr. Durham, in which it advised the Court that it expected an imminent settlement with Mr. Cochran. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 111 at 2\n   </em>\n   n.1.] Despite the fact that this Motion did not pertain to him, Mr. Cochran filed a response to the Commission's Motion, in which he again proposed a disgorgement amount of $ 24.5 million. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 113 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] On June 29, 2018, the Court ruled on the Commission's Motion as it related to Mr. Durham, and specifically stated that the Order did not apply to Mr. Cochran. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 118 at 1 n.2\n   </em>\n   .] Days later, the Court noted that Mr. Cochran and the Commission were still in settlement negotiations, and denied Mr. Cochran's motion concerning disgorgement\n   as premature, but without prejudice should settlement not be achieved. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 119 at 1\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   What followed were numerous updates from the Commission regarding the status of settlement efforts with Mr. Cochran. On August 9, 2018, the Commission advised the Court that it \"anticipates an agreement with Cochran on disgorgement within two weeks.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 120 at 1\n   </em>\n   .] On August 23, 2018, the Commission advised that it \"anticipates an agreement with Cochran but recognizes that receipt, execution, and return of the consent has proven challenging in the past due to his incarceration.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 124 at 1-2\n   </em>\n   .] On September 28, 2018, however, the Commission advised that \"[u]nfortunately, the parties are unable to agree on disgorgement, and therefore the Commission is asking that the Court proceed with ruling on its summary judgment motion.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 126 at 1\n   </em>\n   .] The Court then ordered the Commission to file one consolidated motion as to Mr. Cochran's liability and disgorgement. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 127\n   </em>\n   .] On October 15, 2018, Mr. Cochran filed a document with this Court in which he stated that he requested that the Commission provide him with a breakdown of its proposed settlement amount but that he had not received one. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 128\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 1, 2018, the Commission filed a Motion for Summary Judgment against Mr. Cochran. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 131\n   </em>\n   .] The Commission notified Mr. Cochran of his right to file a response to its Motion, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 134\n   </em>\n   ], however, Mr. Cochran did not file any response. As such, the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment is now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Violation of Securities Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Motion, the Commission first argues that the jury's verdict in the criminal trial should be given collateral effect in this matter to establish the Commission's claims against Mr. Cochran. With regard to the Commission's claim based on Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), the Commission argues that \"when the jury found Defendant guilty, they necessarily found the existence of all the elements that make up a civil Section 10(b) claim,\" including the scienter requirement. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 31\n   </em>\n   .] With regard to Section 17(a), the Commission argues that the elements thereof are substantially similar to Section 10(b), with the addition that the former prohibits fraud in \"connection with the offer or sale of securities\" and \"under the facts here there is no doubt that the jury necessarily concluded this element was present too.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 31-32\n   </em>\n   .] In further support of its arguments, the Commission points to this Court's order regarding the same civil allegations against Mr. Durham in which this Court held that Mr. Durham was collaterally estopped from litigating violations of Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a). [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 32\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Cochran did not file any response to the Commission's Motion, nor do any of the various documents Mr. Cochran filed in this Court over the past year address the issue of whether he committed civil violations of Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a). [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 113\n   </em>\n   (Mr. Cochran's \"Motion of ...

To predict such a likelihood, the court \"must assess the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant and his violation,\" including consideration of \"the gravity of harm caused by the offense; the extent of the defendant's participation and his degree of scienter; the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction and the likelihood that the defendant's customary business activities might again involve him in such transactions; the defendant's recognition of his own culpability; and the sincerity of his assurances against future violations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487248\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/130/#p144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that the Commission has set forth sufficient evidence to show that there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations. In particular, the document Mr. Cochran filed on May 3, 2018 is replete with statements showing that Mr. Cochran does not show recognition of his own culpability. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 113\n   </em>\n   .] Moreover, by failing to respond to the Commission's Motion, Mr. Cochran has given no assurances against future violations, let alone sincere assurances. In addition, the size and scope of the scheme for which Mr. Cochran was found guilty weighs in favor of enjoinment. As such, the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to enjoinment and Mr. Cochran is permanently\n   <strong>\n    ENJOINED\n   </strong>\n   from future violations of the Securities Acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Disgorgement of Ill-Gotten Gains\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In support of its arguments for disgorgement, the Commission contends that Mr. Durham and Mr. Cochran \"were the 100% owners of DC Investments,\" (\"\n   <em>\n    DCI\n   </em>\n   \"), and argues that the Court should consider Mr. Cochran's \"direct cash payments from DCI\" as his ill-gotten gains. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 36-37\n   </em>\n   .] Specifically, the Commission argues that Mr. Cochran \"directly received approximately $ 2,507,410.03 from DCI\" and then made \"one payment of $ 157,500 to the bankruptcy trustee in relation to certain ongoing litigation,\" leaving a total of $ 2,349,910.03. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 37\n   </em>\n   .] In support of the amounts set forth in its brief, the Commission included the declaration of Daniel Koster, a Data Analytics Specialist employed by the Commission, who states that the amount that went from DCI to Mr. Cochran does not include his salary. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 131-1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 3\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Cochran did not file a response to the Commission's Motion, but he did file two documents over the past year concerning disgorgement, which the Court will consider. First, in May 2018, in response to the Commission's argument that Mr. Durham owed $ 183 million, Mr. Cochran proposed a \"new disgorgement figure of $ 24,500,000.00,\" based on his calculation of subtracting the money that was already \"in\" Fair when it was purchased from the amount that the Commission set forth as subordinated debt. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 113 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] Given that the amount the Commission now seeks is well below Mr. Cochran's then-proposed disgorgement amount, the Court will disregard his May 2018 arguments. Second, and more recently, Mr. Cochran filed a document in which he stated that he would settle this case if the Commission would provide a breakdown of the disgorgement amount it seeks. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 128\n   </em>\n   .] In this document, Mr. Cochran states that he had sent the \"Trustee (of Fair Finance)\" a check in the amount of $ 157,500.00. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 128 at 1\n   </em>\n   .] In support of its subsequent Motion, the Commission deducted the amount of the check Mr. Cochran discusses from its proposed disgorgement amount. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 132 at 37\n   </em>\n   .] As such, the Court considers Mr. Cochran's arguments resolved as they relate to the payment to the Trustee. Mr. Cochran also questions whether the Commission's\n   proposed amount includes his salary, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 128 at 1\n   </em>\n   ], a contention that Mr. Koster addresses in his declaration by clarifying that the Commission's proposed amount does not include Mr. Cochran's salary payments, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 131-1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 3\n   </em>\n   ]. The only remaining argument Mr. Cochran proffers is that he is entitled to a breakdown of the proposed disgorgement amount. A precise breakdown has been provided by the Commission in a chart contained in its Motion and in Mr. Koster's sworn Declaration. As such, none of the arguments set forth by Mr. Cochran in his various filings over the past year have are addressed inn the amount the Commission now seeks in disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2017, Justice Sotomayor, writing for a unanimous Court in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh v.

But [Mr. Cochran] didn't do much better, and [was] living well beyond [his] means.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156.

However, this still leaves open a determination of how many violations Mr. Cochran committed. It would be within the Court's discretion to impose penalties by looking behind each of Mr. Cochran's eight convictions for separate violations, see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Church of God\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2968408\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/429/1045/#p1050\">\n    429 F.Supp.2d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that\n   the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of at least one violation for each Offering Circular), but at some point the futility of collection must be acknowledged.
