BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants Diageo-Guinness, USA, Inc. and Diageo North America, Inc. make and market Guinness Extra Stout (\"Extra Stout\"), a form of beer, for distribution in the United States. Plaintiff Kieran O'Hara filed a putative class action complaint alleging that he bought Extra Stout in part because defendants deceptively advertised that it was brewed at St. James's Gate brewery, Dublin, Ireland. Plaintiff alleges that Extra Stout was actually brewed in New Brunswick, Canada. Plaintiff also asserts that he paid more for the Extra Stout than he would have if defendants had disclosed its origin. Plaintiff subsequently filed an Amended Complaint with seven claims, including common law misrepresentation (Count I), unjust enrichment (Count II), unfair and deceptive practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Chapter 93A (Counts III-VI), and a request for injunctive declaratory relief (Count VII).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss all counts of the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17. On March 29, 2018, the court issued a Memorandum and Order denying the motion to dismiss in part and allowing it in part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35. More specifically, the court denied the motion as to Count I, and Counts III and IV to the extent that they alleged that the statements on defendants' website violated Chapter 93A. The court allowed the motion as to Counts III and IV to the extent that they alleged that the statements on Extra Stout bottle labels and cartons violated Chapter 93A. The court reasoned that dismissal of Counts III and IV as related to the bottle labels and cartons was justified because the Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the \"TTB\") had issued a Certificate of Label Approval (\"COLA\") concerning the allegedly deceptive statements on the bottles and on the cartons, providing the bottle labels and cartons safe harbor protection under Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 35-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court then understood that the TTB's approval applied both to the challenged labels on Extra Stout's bottles and on its outer packaging, the cartons.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 41-43. The court allowed the motion to dismiss as to all the remaining counts, and the requests for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Motion for Reconsideration, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), of the decision dismissing Counts III and IV relating to the statements on the Extra Stout cartons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 44, 45. Plaintiff also filed a Motion to Amend the First Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 46, 47. In the Motion to Amend, plaintiff seeks to update the case caption, amend the class definition, and add a claim for alleged violations of Chapter 93A based on the Tariff Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201304\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and certain regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20134.46\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 134.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.18\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.18\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.18\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Plaintiff included a proposed Second Amended Complaint as an exhibit to his memorandum in support of the Motion to Amend, with Count IV of the proposed second amended complaint constituting the new claim plaintiff proposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 47-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons explained in this Memorandum and Order, the Motion for Reconsideration is being allowed because newly discovered evidence has prompted the court to recognize that it erred in finding that the TTB had approved the statements on the Extra Stout cartons. Therefore, Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3 does not protect the statements on the cartons from potentially being found to be deceptive and/or to causing the labels on the Extra Stout bottles to be deceptive. The Motion to Amend is being allowed with regard to the case caption and the definition of the putative class, and denied without prejudice concerning the proposed new Chapter 93A claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.

Plaintiff argues that this is newly discovered evidence that the TTB did not consider or approve the statements on the Extra Stout cartons and, accordingly, defendant is not entitled to Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3 safe harbor protection concerning the cartons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff's newly discovered evidence indicating that the TTB did not consider the statements on the Extra Stout cartons has prompted the court to consider carefully the effect of the COLA\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The court now finds that plaintiff is correct that the statements on the labels on the Extra Stout bottles and the statements on the Extra Stout cartons are not identical in all material respects. As indicated earlier, the labels on the bottles state in small print that the beer was brewed in Canada. There is no comparable statement on the cartons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court also concludes that it was not correct to the extent that it reasoned in the March 29, 2018 Memorandum and Order that a COLA would always \"represent[ ] the approval of not only the statements [o]n the label, but also the statements on the 'carton, case, or other covering of the container.' \" Docket No. 35 at 41 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.21\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.21\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is written in the disjunctive. The court now realizes that a statement on a bottle's label, or on the carton covering the bottle, could be deceptive if a COLA had been issued for the bottle's label alone in circumstances in which the statements on the carton are deceptive and the carton obscures the accurate information on the labels on the bottles inside it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   More specifically, the regulation states that a beer is unlawfully misbranded and, therefore, deceptive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) If the container, cap, or any label on the container,\n   <em>\n    or any carton\n   </em>\n   , case, or other covering of the container used for sale at retail, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying the container to the consumer buyer contains any statement, design, device, or graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation that is prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7 7.20 through 7.29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.21\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Therefore, if as plaintiff alleges, the TTB approved only the label on the container, statements on the carton would not be entitled to the safe harbor protection of Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Viewing the allegations and illustrations in the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court now finds that he has stated a plausible claim that: the statements on the Extra Stout cartons are deceptive as to where the beer was brewed; those statements were not approved by the TTB; and therefore, they are not immune from being held deceptive by virtue of Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More specifically, Exhibits 1 and 2 to the Amended Complaint, which are together Exhibit 1 to this Memorandum, depict the statements on the Extra Stout cartons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Comp. \u00b6 21. Exhibit 1 to the Motion to Dismiss, which is Exhibit 2 to this Memorandum, is defendant's application for a COLA and the COLA certification issued pursuant to it. The application for the COLA includes only two forms of the label on the Extra Stout bottles, which as indicated earlier each state in small print: \"Brewed and bottled by Guinness Brewery Company, New Brunswick Canada. Product of Canada.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. To Dismiss (Docket No. 19-1) Ex. 1, which is Ex. 2 hereto. The application does not include a depiction of the Extra Stout carton which, like the label, states \"Traditionally Brewed ... St. James Gate Dublin,\" but, unlike the label, does not indicate in any way that it was brewed in Canada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The form which defendant submitted to the TTB is captioned \"Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label Bottle Approval.\" The Application also refers only to the \"label,\" and to \"any wording (a) appearing on materials firmly affixed to the container (e.g., caps, celoseals, corks, etc.) ....\" This is added evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendants submitted only the labels on the Extra Stout bottle for approval, and that the TTB did not consider or approve the statements on the carton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, plaintiff alleges that the small print \"Product of Canada\" statement on the back of the bottle is hidden by the carton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. A reasonable factfinder could also conclude that the TTB did not have the opportunity to decide whether this was true and, if so, caused the \"label ... in association with other printed or graphic matter\" -- the carton -- to provide an \"erroneous impression[ ] as to the ... origin\" of Extra Stout in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%207.23\">\n    27 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Therefore, the court now concludes that it erred in its March 29, 2018 decision to the extent that it understood that the statements on the Extra Stout carton had been submitted to the TTB for approval and by reasoning that, in any event, approval of a bottle's label necessarily constitutes approval of statements on the carton in which the bottle is contained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marty v.

Fla. 2014). Therefore, the court is reinstating plaintiff's Chapter 93A claims that the statements on the carton are deceptive and, if the carton obscures the statements of origin on the labels on the bottles inside at the point of purchase, the labels viewed in that context are deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III.
