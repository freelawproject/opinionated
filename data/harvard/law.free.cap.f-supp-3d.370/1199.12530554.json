Interpreting \u00a7 227(a)(1), the circuit court found that the language of the statute was ambiguous, citing as support the D.C.

Ultimately, the court concluded that, \"in its context and with a view to its place in the overall statutory scheme[,]... the statutory definition of ATDS is not limited to devices with the capacity to call numbers produced by a 'random or sequential number generator,' but also includes devices with the capacity to dial stored numbers automatically.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1045\">\n    at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

First, Defendant contends that prior to ruling on summary\n   judgment, \"the Court will ... need clear guidance regarding what capabilities and characteristics are required for equipment to meet the statutory definition of ATDS,\" a definition which is currently in flux and being actively considered by the FCC. Def. Mot. 12-13.

In\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit provided binding precedent on the issue presented by this case. Specifically, the court determined that an ATDS is: \"equipment which has the capacity-(1) to store numbers to be called or (2) to produce numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator-and to dial such numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/#p1045\">\n    904 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As one other district court has observed, \"[t]he Ninth Circuit's willingness to decide the meaning of an ATDS in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   ... indicates that defining that term as used in the applicable statute is within the conventional experience of judges and does not involve technical or policy considerations that would place it particularly within the FCC's field of expertise or discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206459964\">\n    2018 WL 6459964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

Given that a stay in this case could significantly delay a ruling that, in light of\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , this Court is competent to make, the Court declines to grant a stay under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
