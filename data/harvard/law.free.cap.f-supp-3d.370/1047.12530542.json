The corporate defendants are United States companies, who through their Peruvian subsidiary, owned and operated the lead smelting and refining complex. The individual defendants in this matter are the directors and/or officers of the defendant companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs filed thirty-three cases in Missouri state court asserting their personal injury claims against Defendants. Each case contained approximately ninety plaintiffs. Defendants removed these cases to this Court where seventeen cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were consolidated in the present case and sixteen cases await consolidation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Three of the defendants, The Renco Group, Renco Holdings, Inc., and Ira Rennert, have filed a motion to dismiss in all these cases for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because the Court has personal jurisdiction over these defendants, I will deny their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relationship between these three defendants and the other defendants in this case is as follows. The Renco Group, Inc. is the parent company of Renco Holdings, Inc. They are both New York corporations with their principal places of business in New York. (Hereinafter these entities shall be referred to collectively, as the parties have done, as \"Renco.\") Ira Rennert is a resident of New York City. Rennert owns Renco and serves as Renco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rennert is also the Chairman of Defendant The Doe Run Resources Corp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Renco Group, Inc. owns Defendant DR Acquisition Corp., a Missouri corporation\n   with its principal place of business in Missouri. DR Acquisition, in turn, owns Defendant The Doe Run Resources Corp., a New York corporation with its principal place of business in St. Louis, Missouri. The Doe Run Resources Corp. wholly owns Doe Run Cayman, Ltd., a Cayman Island corporation which, in turn, owns Doe Run Peru.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining individual defendants in this matter, Marvin K. Kaiser, Theodore P. Fox, III, Jerry Pyatt, Jeffery L. Zelms are current or former officers of The Doe Run Resources Corp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that Renco and Rennert exerted \"complete control, not merely stock control, but complete domination of the finances, policies, and business practices of Doe Run Peru. The control is so complete that the subsidiary has never had a separate mind, will, or existence of its own.\" [Compl. at \u00b6 29 and \u00b6 65] Plaintiffs allege that the corporate defendants made decisions in Missouri and New York regarding all facets of the operation of the La Oroya Complex. [Compl. at \u00b6 34] Plaintiffs' allege that those decisions led the La Oroya Complex to operate in a way that \"negligently, carelessly, and recklessly generated, handled, stored, released, disposed of, and failed to control and contain ... the release of toxic metals, gases, and other toxic substances\" into the environment around the Complex. [Compl. at \u00b6 35] The result was a toxic contamination of the area which led to Plaintiffs' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that Defendant Rennert is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Renco. Plaintiffs allege that Rennert is also the Chairman and an officer of Defendant The Doe Run Resources Corp. Plaintiffs allege that Rennert is the controlling owner of all the corporate defendants in this matter. [Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 59] Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, including Rennert, during the course of their ownership, operation, management, or control of operations of the La Oroya Complex, made decisions in Missouri and New York regarding the operations of the Complex. Plaintiffs allege that those decisions were \"negligent, careless or reckless and resulted in the release of metals and other toxic and harmful substances, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and sulfur dioxide, into the air and water and onto the properties on which the minor plaintiffs reside, use or visit\" which led to their injuries. [Compl. at \u00b6 24] Plaintiffs allege that Rennert, as an officer of Renco and The Doe Run Resources Corp., is individually liable to Plaintiffs because he had actual knowledge of The Doe Run Resources Corp.'s \"tortious wrongful conduct and participated in it.\" [Compl. at \u00b6 59] Plaintiffs allege that Rennert's \"responsibilities, actions and omissions included but were not limited to approval of expenditures for pollution control measures and expenditures for the remediation of properties.\" Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Rennert had knowledge of the toxic emissions, had knowledge of technologies owned by The Doe Run Resources Company that were available to remediate the contaminated soil that were not used, and \"participated and approved budgets which delayed implementation of proper pollution control measures and delayed remediation\" efforts. [Compl. at \u00b6 61] Renco and Rennert have moved to dismiss the claims against them based on a lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When ruling on a motion to dismiss, I must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view them in light most favorable to the Plaintiff.

It was removed from Missouri state court to this Court on November 13, 2015. An additional sixteen cases were removed to this Court through March 31, 2017. These cases were consolidated with this lead case. Counsel for Defendants Renco and Rennert entered their appearance in all these cases. The Renco Group removed all of the cases and Renco Holdings and Rennert joined in the removal. Renco and Rennert filed answers in almost all of these cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Renco and Rennert subsequently removed an additional sixteen cases to this Court in which they did not file an answer. Instead of filing an answer, they filed a motion to dismiss based on a lack of personal jurisdiction in fourteen of these cases. These sixteen cases will be consolidated with this lead case after the entry of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite litigating this matter since November 15, 2015, Renco and Rennert waited until August 17, 2017, to file a motion to dismiss in the initial seventeen removed cases based on a lack of personal jurisdiction.

In their answers to the multiple complaints consolidated in this matter, Rennert and Renco admitted that subject-matter jurisdiction and venue were proper in this Court, and never raised the issue of personal jurisdiction. They participated in motion practice and numerous hearings. As a result, they waived any personal jurisdiction grounds to dismiss the claims against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Renco and Rennert argue that they have not waived their current jurisdictional challenge because the\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   decision changed the law of personal jurisdiction and provided them with a new basis to object to personal jurisdiction that was previously unavailable. In\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   , more than 600 plaintiffs from 34 states brought suit in a California state court against a pharmaceutical company, alleging damage to their health from the drug Plavix. 137 S.Ct. at 1777. The California Supreme Court held that Bristol-Meyers was subject to personal jurisdiction in California for the claims of the non-California plaintiffs. The United States Supreme Court reversed. Although personal jurisdiction existed over Bristol-Meyers for the claims of the California plaintiffs, the Court held that there were insufficient California contacts between Bristol-Meyers and the non-California plaintiffs related to the claims of those plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1782-1783. The Court described this as a \"straightforward application ... of settled principles of personal jurisdiction ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1783. In other words, the Court's decision did not announce a new rule regarding personal jurisdiction. It simply reiterated that specific jurisdiction over a defendant may be invoked when the lawsuit arises out of or relates to defendant's contacts in the forum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780. As a result, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   did not excuse Renco and Rennert's waiver of a personal jurisdiction challenge or reset the clock to bring that challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   does not undermine the fact that Rennert and Renco are subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Missouri based on the allegations in all of the complaints removed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff is only required to make a prima facie\n   showing of personal jurisdiction, that is, plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to support a \"reasonable inference that the defendants can be subjected to jurisdiction within the state.\"\n   <em>\n    K-V Pharm.

Renco and Rennert had extensive contacts with Missouri. Plaintiffs allege that they negotiated contracts, filtered through Missouri, which related to the activities that caused Plaintiffs' damages. Rennert used Renco to structure the acquisition and financing of the La Oroya operation, he attended numerous meetings in Missouri to discuss the environmental cleanup in Peru, and he approved (and failed to approve) the funding and scheduling of that cleanup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rennert's and Renco's alleged conduct constitutes transacting business in Missouri within the meaning of Missouri's long-arm statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20506.500.3\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 506.500.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rennert's and Renco's activities and contacts with the state are sufficient to meet the state long-arm requirements and the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Renco and Rennert were the alter-ego of Doe Run Peru and controlled the decision making of that company through the Missouri corporate defendants. When a corporate parent acts as the alter-ego of its Missouri subsidiary it is subject to jurisdiction in Missouri.\n   <em>\n    Epps v. Stewart Info. Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139279\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/642/#p649\">\n    327 F.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649 (8th Cir. 2003). Because this lawsuit arises out of and relates to Renco and Rennert's contacts in Missouri, Plaintiffs have stated a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over these defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1780.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' allege claims against Rennert in his individual capacity. While simply holding a corporate office does not expose an officer to individual liability for corporate misdeeds, it also does not necessarily shield the officer from individual liability. An individual is not protected from liability simply because the acts constituting the tort \"were done in the scope and course, and pertained to, the duties of his employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Curlee v. Donaldson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20S.W.2d%20746\">\n    233 S.W.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (Mo.App.1950).

Under Missouri law, corporate officers may be held individually liable for tortious corporate conduct if they have actual or constructive knowledge of, and participated in, an actionable wrong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756372\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/664/596/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' allege that Rennert, as an officer of Renco and The Doe Run Resources Corp., had actual\n   knowledge of The Doe Run Resources Corp.'s tortious wrongful conduct in Missouri and that he participated in it.
