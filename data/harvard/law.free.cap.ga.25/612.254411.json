They had no children. Sneed was about or over fifty years of age, and his wife about forty-nine. The child\u2019s mother died when he was an infant, and Mrs. Rives nursed him. Mrs. Rives was kind and affectionate to him, but thought more of her own children. While Rives\u2019 family was sick, Mrs. Sneed took the child home, and it remained there until last August, when Mjs. Rives again took it home from Smithville. Massey died at witness\u2019 house in Lee county; deceased\u2019s plantation was in Dougherty, and he claimed his home there. Witness is trustee under the marriage contract between Mr. and Mrs. Massey, and holds the property in trust for the two children. Witness heard Massey, a day or two before he died, say he wished Mr. and Mrs. Rives to raise his children. Said it was the wish of his wife before her death, and he had no reason to change it. That Mrs. Rives was <em>willing </em>for Mr. Sneed to take John, but that he did <em>not </em>wish him to raise him; had no objection to Mr. Sneed having the child until he was old enough to go to school, but then he must go to Mrs. Rives and go to school, and both be raised together.

This child is named for both grandfathers, and Needham Massey Senior, is deeply mortified and bitterly opposed to his being adopted by Dudley Sneed, and to his name being changed. He corroborated the other witnesses about Mr. Massey\u2019s expressions concerning his children, just before he died \u2014 Rives was present. His brother was speaking of and contemplating the prospect of death. He then said he wanted his children raised properly; and to Mr. Rives he said : \u201cI want you to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; give them a good substantial education; I had rather have them raised with a good substantial education, and start in the world without a cent, than raised by Sneed and inherit his whole fortune.\u201d That Mrs. Rives was anxious to let Sneed have John, but he did not desire it. He might stay there until he got large enough to go to school, but then he must go home and go to school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>with his sister; and if Rives was notable to raise them, witness must take them. Witness desired Rives to raise them in preference to Sneed, on account of his brothers\u2019 wish. Needham Massey said his wife was very anxious for Mrs. Rives to raise her children, and he had no desire to alter if.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">After argument, the Court refused to vacate the judgment, and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">Ihe plaintiff then moved to have the grandfather of said child, Needham Massey Senior, appointed guardian <em>ad-litem </em>of said minor for the purpose of having the rights of said minor, growiug out of this transaction, properly represented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\">Which the Court refused to do, and plaintiff excepted and assigns error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-8\">Vason &amp; Davis; Warren &amp; Warren, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-9\">West; Kimbrough ; McCov &amp; Hawkins, <em>for defendant </em>in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-10\">So nearly allied to the foregoing case is the following, that they are reported and decided together.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-11\">Dtouev Sneed, plaintiff in error, vs. Robert Rives, guardian, &amp;c., defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-12\"><em>Habeas corpas, </em>from Randolph, before Judge Kiddoo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-13\">Dudley Sneed sued out a <em>habeas corpus to </em>obtain the possession of JohnN.

Rives\u2019 an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>swer in the matter was also read, which sets out substantially the facts as stated in the testimony of the witnesses in the preceding case, and that at the time he took the child from Sneed, it was time for him to be put to school, and that Sneed surrendered it quietly. He always considered his home the child\u2019s home after the earnest and solemn request of the children\u2019s parents that they should raise them. The child went to Sneed\u2019s because his wife was in feeble health, and had her own sick children to attend to, and because he, the said minor, was then weaned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-6\">Defendant closed, and plaintiff, in rebuttal, read the affidavits of Jesse and Isaac T. Cock, which are in substance the same as their testimony before reported. They are the brothers of the whole blood of Mrs. Massey, the mother of the child, and of Mrs. Robert Rives, and of the half blood of Mr. Dudley Sneed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-7\">Defendant also introduced letters of guardianship of said minor, dated 3d October, 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-8\">To which plaintiff objected on the ground that they were void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-9\">The Court overruled the objection, and plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-10\">The Court awarded the custody of the child to the defendant, and plaintiff excepted, and on these exceptions assigns error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-11\">West ; Kimbrough ; McCoy &amp; Hawkins, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-12\">Douglass &amp; Douglass, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABSy\">McDonald, J.</p>\n<p id=\"AN3\">delivering the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">The Constitution of this State has been amended by adding a section to the first Article, declaring that the Legislature shall have no power to change names, nor to legitimate persons, &amp;c., but shall, by law, prescribe the manner in which such power shall be exercised by the Superior and Inferior Courts, and the privileges'to be enjoyed. <em>Acts of </em>1855 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>and </em>1856, <em>page </em>106. The Legislature, at the same session, passed a statute prescribing the manner in which the Courts should exercise the power. <em>Page </em>260. Under this Act, Dudley Sneed applied to the Superior Court of Lee county, making known his desire to adopt John Needham Massey, an infant son of Needham Massey, deceased, and to change his-name to John Needham Sneed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The child\u2019s mother was dead. The child having neither father nor mother, no notice of the application was given to any one. The Court passed an order to the effect prayed for, and further establishing the relation of parent and child <em>between </em>the said Dudley Sneed and the said John Needham Massey, by the name of John Needham Sneed, the same as if he had been the natural legitimate child of the said Dudley Sneed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><bracketnum>[1.]</bracketnum> The first of the above cases is an application to the Court to rescind the above order. The Court below refused to rescind it, and on that refusal, the case is brought to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The majority of this Court are of opinion that the Superior Court had the power, under the Constitution and law, to pass the original order, and that it was passed in conformity with both. If the same Court has the power to rescind the order when passed, it is a matter entirely within its discrecretion, and this Court will not attempt to control that discretion, and therefore it affirms the judgment of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> I am of opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction of the cause. Conceding the power of the Court below was unquestionable, there was no error in law or equity for this Court to correct, and under the Constitution this Court has no jurisdiction beyond that. The section added to the Constitution prohibits the Legislature from enacting certain laws, or laws on certain subjects, but does not give authority to the Courts to exercise any power over the same subjects, but declares that the Legislature shall prescribe the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>which the power to do these things shall be exercised by the Courts. I will not stop to enquire whether this kind of implied power can repeal an express prohibition in the Constitution, to the Courts to exercise Legislative power. If the Courts have power under the Constitution and the law, it is only a branch of Legislative power transferred from the General Assembly to the Courts. If a question should arise in respect to the right of the child to inherit Sneed\u2019s estate under the order, a question may be made, whether it be legal or constitutional, in the same manner as a question might be raised as to the constitutionality of a statute passed for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As the opinion which I entertain would leave the action of the Superior Court without affirmance or reversal here, it would stand, as a matter of Course, for whatever it may be worth. The opinion of the majority of the Court must be \u25a0certified to the Court below, which is a judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\"><bracketnum>[3.]</bracketnum> The other case was brought to this Court on thejudgment of the Court below on a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>sued out by Dudley Sneed against Robert Rives, for the purpose of obtaining the custody'of the same child, then in possession of the said Rives. Sneed claimed the child under the order of the Court making him the adopted child of the said Sneed. Rives claimed to be his legal guardian under the appointment of the Ordinary of Randolph county, and as such entitled to his custody. His return to the writ, set forth that appointment as his warrant for holding the child. It was insisted, on the other side, that the letters of guardianship were invalid for the want of jurisdiction in the ordinary who made the appointment. At the time of the appointment, the child had beeen for several years and then was, residing in the county of Lee, but jurisdiction was claimed for the ordinary of' Randolph county on the ground that it was the request of the deceased father of the child, that at a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ticular age, which he had attained, he should go to and live with Robert Rives and his wife. The Court remanded the child to the custody of Rives, and that is the decision which is excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The residence of the child, however occasioned, was, at the time of the appointment ol the guardian, in the county of Lee; and the Ordinary of Randolph had uo jurisdiction of the case. <em>Cobb\u2019s </em>Digest, 286. The letters of guardianship, therefore, conferred no authority on Rives. A majority of this Court is of opinion that Dudley Sneed, in consequence of his established relation of parent to the child, had a right to the custody of his person; even if the letters of guardianship had been good and valid. It is the opinion of this Court thatthe presiding Judge in the Court below ought to have ordered the child into the custody of Dudley Sneed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
