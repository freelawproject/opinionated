Voorhees <em>vs. </em>James A. Reford and Wife and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-10\">When a bill is filed by a judgment creditor against Ms debtor, not for the sole purpose of having a conveyance alleged to be fraudulent set aside as against creditors, but also prays that in case the conveyance should not be decreed fraudulent, that the complainant\u2019s judgment should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>declared an encumbrance on the property in the hands of the alienee, should this relief be granted the suit will enure to the benefit of the complainant alone, and not to the benefit of other creditors of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b168-5\">Where the design of a creditor\u2019s bill is to declare the property of a defendant subject to the lien of any of the attaching or judgment creditors, all the creditors having liens upon the property are entitled to be heard and have their liens protected.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b168-6\">A party who has obtained a judgment before the filing of a bill by one creditor to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent should be made a party to that suit, and cannot be deprived of his equitable rights by the wilful or negligent omission of the complainant in that suit to make him a party.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">The original bill in this cause was filed December 13th, 1860, by George Cramer and Edwin Pierson against Reford and wife, as judgment creditors of Reford, to set aside a post-nuptial settlement, made by Reford prior to the contracting of the debt to complainant. Afterwards, on the 19th of March, 1861, George S. Corwin, another judgment creditor of Reford, filed a bill to avoid the same settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">After the filing of the original bill of Cramer and Pierson, and before the filing of Corwin\u2019s bill, John F. Voorhees recovered a judgment against Reford, and not having been made a party to Corwin\u2019s bill, he afterwards, on the 21th of April, 1861, filed a supplemental bill, in the nature of a cross-bill, against the complainants and defendants in the two preceding suits, the object of which was to consolidate those suits, and to permit Voorhees to participate in them and enforce the lien of his judgment against the property in controversy in those suits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-9\">To this bill of Voorhees, the defendant Reford filed a general demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-10\"><em>Mr. </em>McDonald, in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">The execution creditors of Reford all became his creditors after the title passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-12\">The bill must allege such badges of fraud as would set aside the deed in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-13\">The charges are not properly made. It is not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to refer to the charges in the former bills, and affirm their truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">There are too many parties; Reford and wife are the only proper defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Mr. Pitney, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">This is a supplemental bill in the nature of a cross-bill. The object of the bill is to enable complainant to participate in suits now pending, and to consolidate those suits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">If the former bills do not disclose an equitable case we have no standing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">Cramer and Pierson\u2019s bill is specific, sets out good ground of equity, and has been answered and not demurred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-9\">When a deed is found fraudulent as against any creditor, it is so as against all creditors who may come before the court. <em>Story's Eq. Jur., </em>\u00a7 355, 365; <em>Ede </em>v. <em>Knowles, 2 Young &amp; Coll's Ch. </em>172-8; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Westacott, 2 Beav. </em>345; <em>Scarff </em>v. <em>Soulby, </em>16 <em>Simons </em>481; <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>6 <em>Simons </em>493; <em>Reade </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>3 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>500; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 <em>Beasley </em>51; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>8 <em>Paige </em>160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-10\">How is Voorhees to get in \u2014 not by petition nor by independent bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-11\">Two decrees to sell the same property are not to be favored in equity. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>3 <em>Stock. </em>31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-12\">Yoorhees is clearly entitled to have his rights protected. His remedy is by supplemental bill in the nature of a cross-bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-13\">A defendant cannot demur for the misjoinder of other persons as codefendants. <em>Whitbeck </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>4 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>427, 433; affirmed in 2 <em>Barb. Ch. R. </em>106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-14\">A new defendant cannot be added to a suit by a petition; it must be by supplemental bill. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Deacon, </em>6 <em>Madd. </em>59; <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Keen, </em>3 <em>Paige </em>164; <em>Sedgwick </em>v. <em>Cleaveland, 7 Paige </em>200; <em>Watt </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>11 <em>Paige </em>470; Dacres <em>v. Williams, </em>1 <em>Simons </em>5. This case shows that if a party sould be got in by petition he is not deprived of his remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>by bill. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., </em>\u00a7 365, 342, 390-8; 1 <em>Daniels\u2019 Ch. Pr. </em>328; 2 <em>Ibid. </em>1348; 3 <em>Ibid. </em>1410, 1663-5, 1673, 1681-3; <em>2, Ibid </em>1745-7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-5\">When a bill is filed to set aside a conveyance of land as fraudulent, complainant must make all judgment creditors of the fraudulent debtor parties, because he goes on the ground that the title is still in the debtor. <em>Williams and Riley </em>v. <em>Mitchenor, </em>3 <em>Stock. </em>520; H<em>arrison </em>v. <em>Stewartson, </em>2 <em>Hare </em>284; 1 <em>Daniels\u2019 Ch.

It is enough to refer to them, and affirm that they are true. Repeating the whole is mere supererogation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">If the bill is defective in that particular it is amendable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-8\"><em>Mr. McDonald, </em>in reply, cited 1 <em>Am. Lead. Cas. </em>1.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-9\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A1i\">The original bill filed by Cramer and Pierson-is not a creditor\u2019s bill, which enures to the benefit of all the creditors of Reford, nor is the bill for the sole purpose of having the conveyance from Reford and wife declared fraudulent as against creditors. Such bill may enure for the benefit not only of all subsequent encumbrancers but of all other creditors. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 <em>Beasley </em>51.</p>\n<p id=\"ABqu\">But the bill also prays, in case the conveyance should not be deemed fraudulent, that the complainant\u2019s judgment be declared an encumbrance on the property in the hands of the alienee. Should this relief be granted, the suit will enure to the benefit of Cramer and Pierson alone. The residue of the property would remain under the control of the alienee.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">All the creditors having liens upon the property are entitled to be heard and to have their liens protected, where the design of the bill is to declare the property subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the lien of any of the attaching or judgment creditors. <em>Williams </em>v. Mitchenor, 3 <em>Stock. </em>520.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The complainant\u2019s judgment was recovered after the hill of Cramer and Pierson was filed. His claim must be brought before the court either by original bill or by supplemental bill. He is clearly entitled in equity, in one form or the other, to have his rights protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The bill of Corwin was filed after Voorhees had obtained his judgment. Voorhees should properly have been made a party to that bill, but he cannot be deprived of his equitable rights by the wilful or negligent omission of the complainant in that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Ho exception is taken to the form of the proceeding. The demurrer is solely for want of equity. The defendant consents, and desires that the suits should be united, or that the rights of the parties be settled by one controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\"><em>Vide Cramer </em>v. <em>Reford, </em>2 <em>C. E. </em>Gr., 367.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
