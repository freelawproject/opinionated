It so appears upon the face of the bill. He removed from the state to Connecticut, in November, 1861. The answer was filed on the nineteenth of November. On the fourth of February, 1862, the defendant obtained an order extending the rule for closing testimony. Whether the answer was filed before or after the complainant left the state is not clear, nor is it material. One step, at least, has been taken in the cause by the defendant since the complainant ceased to be a resident of the state. There are circumstances tending to show that the defendant had notice of the change of residence by the complainant before the making of the order on the fourth of February. The fact of notice is not denied by the defendant in his affidavit. He states that he supposed that the complainant was a resident of this state <em>\u2018 \u2018 until a short time since. </em>\u2019 \u2019 He also states that, on the twenty-first day of March, he visited Connecticut, and found the complainant residing there upon a farm, and then learned that the complainant moved out of this state into the state of Connecticut, and upon the said farm, in the month of November, A.D. 1861. All this may be true, and yet the defendant may have had notice before the fourth day of February that the complainant had removed from this state to reside elsewhere. Under the circumstances, there should have been a full and explicit denial, by the defendant, of notice of the complainant\u2019s change of residence at the time of taking the last order in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The affidavit on the part of the complainant, not having been taken pursuant to the rule of court, is excluded as incompetent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The motion is denied, costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Cited <em>in Binns </em>v. <em>Mount, </em>1 <em>Stew. </em>25.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
