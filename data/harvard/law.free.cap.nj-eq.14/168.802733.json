Woodruff <em>vs. </em>Elisha Depue, Jacob Morris, and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-9\">On a bill filed to foreclose a mortgage, given by the defendant, E. D., to one R., to secure the payment of part of the purchase money of land conveyed to E. D. by R. by deed with covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances, it appeared that there was a subsisting mortgage on the premises at the time of the conveyance which the vendor had failed to discharge, although there was a distinct understanding that the amount of the encumbrance should be paid by the vendor out of the \u2022 first payment made by the mortgagor or deducted from the mortgage debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-10\">The complainant holds the mortgage by assignment from R., made while the defendant, E. D., continued to own the mortgaged premises, which have been since conveyed by deed, with covenants of warranty, to M\u201e one of the defendants, who claims that the amount of the subsisting encumbrance, which is still unpaid, should be deducted from'complainant\u2019s mortgage, it was held\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-11\">That M., the owner of the equity of redemption, is entitled to the protection claimed by him, and that the decree of the court will be for the balance due on the complainant\u2019s mortgage, after deducting the amount of the subsisting encumbrance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-12\">The general rule is, that the assignee of a mortgage takes it subject to all defences which exist against it in the hands of the mortgagee, but not to a latent equity residing in a third person against the mortgagee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-13\">The case of <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Marselis (Saxton </em>413) cited, and its authority recognized.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-14\">The original mortgagee, R., is not a necessary party to this suit, because although the assignment from him to the complainant shows that the mortgage was originally assigned as a collateral security for certain purposes, and the balance, if any, was to be paid to R., yet it does not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>pear that there was any surplus after the immediate object of the assignment had been accomplished. It cannot be assumed, on the pleadings and evidence in the case, that E. has any interest in the mortgage debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A3v\">If there appears to be such a surplus, and the complainant desires that E. should be concluded by the decree, he should be made a party. On a bill for foreclosure, all the persons interested in the mortgage money should be before the court. All the beneficiaries should be made parties as well as the trustee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-5\">It is not competent for the complainant, who has omitted to make E. a party to present that fact as an objection to the equitable protection asked for by the defendant, M.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-6\">Complainant is entitled to interest on his debt and to his costs of foreclosure, although it appears that before the bill was filed the defendant, M., offered to pay him the amount to which, by tire decree of the court, he is entitled, such offer not amounting to a <em>legal tender ; </em>and it also appearing that the complaiant, in declining to receive the amount offered, acted in good faith under the advice of counsel. He had no right, to adjust the equities between the parties in interest, nor was he bound to take the hazard of so doing, but was entitled to ask a decree of the court to settle the conflicting claims and protect his own rights. Unless there be a legal tender of the sum due interest does not stop.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">The pleadings and evidence in this case establish the following facts: On the 15th of January, 1819, Joshua Depue executed to Richard A. Ryerson a bond and mortgage to secure $1000, a part of the purchase money for the mortgaged premises, which were conveyed on the same day by Ryerson to Depue, by a deed with full covenants of warranty and against encumbrances. At the time of the conveyance the premises were encumbered by a mortgage for $700, which had been previously given by Ryerson to Elizabeth (or Betty) Brooks and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">At the time of the conveyance it was verbally agreed between Ryerson and Depue that the mortgage to Mrs. Brooks should be paid by Ryerson, and that no part of it should come upon Depue or his land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-9\">Ryerson, being unprepared to pay the Brooks mortgage immediately, and asking further time, Depue insisted upon taking a written stipulation from Ryerson, with security, which would bind him to pay the mortgage and make Depue safe if he failed to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Depue was assured by the scrivener who drew the papers, who was also a counsellor at law, that no such writing was necessary ; that he held his security in his own hands,' and could protect himself from loss by withholding payment on his bond and mortgage, to which statement Eyerson assented ; and stated further, that he would apply the first money paid on Depue\u2019s mortgage to the satisfaction of the Brooks, mortgage \u2014 upon which Depue no longer insisted upon any further agreement or security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">Depue paid Eyerson $1000 on the mortgage, and Eyerson afterwards assigned the mortgage to the complainant. Subsequently Depue conveyed the mortgaged premises to \"William H. Bell, and he conveyed the same premises to Jacob Morris, one of the defendants ; and at each conveyance the arrangement was handed down, and the land was dealt with as if Byerson\u2019s agreement to pay the Brooks mortgage was to be carried out in good faith. Afier complainant became the holder of the mortgage he also agreed with Depue to-credit on it the amount of the Brooks mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">After Morris became the owner of the mortgaged premises he called on complainant, or communicated with him with a view to a settlement of the mortgage, and was referred by complainant to his counsel, E. W. Whelpley, Esq. Subsequently Morris called on Mr. Whelpley, and offered to pay him the amount remaining due on complainant\u2019s mortgage, if he would deduct the amount of the Brooks mortgage, which Mr. Whelpley refused to do, alleging, as a reason, that the bond and mortgage had been assigned to complainant by Eyerson, with other securities, as collateral security for advances made to him by complainant, and that the surplus, if any arose, had been further assigned to one William Space ; and that complainant could not consent to accept less than the amount appearing to be due on his bond and mortgage without involving himself in difficulty with Eyerson or Space. Morris refused to pay the whole amount, and thereupon Voodruff, the complainant, filed his bill to foreclose his mortgage, claiming the whole amount (except the $1000)\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>which had been paid, and admitting the priority of the Brooks mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">Mrs. Brooks filed an answer, setting up her mortgage and asserting her priority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">Jacob Morris answered the bill, setting up the facts above stated, and claiming\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\"><em>First. </em>That he was entitled to have the amount due on the Brooks mortgage deducted from the amount of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, and that a decree should pass against him only for the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\"><em>Second. </em>That having always been willing, and having offered to pay such balance before the bill was filed, he should not be charged with costs of the complainant, but should recover costs against the complainant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-9\"><em>Mr. </em>McCarter, for Morris\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-10\">On the first point, cited <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Marselis et al., Saxton, </em>413; <em>Van Riper </em>v. <em>Williams et al., </em>1 <em>Green's Ch. </em>407; <em>Administrator of Glenn </em>v. <em>Whipple et al., </em>1 <em>Beasley </em>51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-11\">It is no answer to defendant\u2019s claim for deduction that Everson has not been made a party to the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-12\">Complainant was fully advised of Morris\u2019 defence before he filed his bill. It is his neglect that Eyerson is not made a party, and he cannot on that account deprive Morris of his defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-13\">As to the question of costs \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-14\">If the court shall decide that defendant, Morris, is entitled to the deduction claimed by his answer, then it will be proper to refuse complainant his costs, and to allow costs in favor of the defendant against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-15\">By the statute, costs are in the discretion of the Chancellor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-16\">The cases which illustrate in what manner that discretion ought to be exercised are numerous. The following principles may be deduced from some of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-17\">Costs are not given against a defendant who has offered terms which would have rendered a suit unnecessary. If a plaintiff proceeds with a cause after he has received a complete offer of all that he is entitled to, the court will punish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the unnecessary litigation by refusing him the whole costs of the suit, as well those incurred after a tender as before. 3 <em>Daniels\u2019 </em>1532-3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">See, also, the same authority, pages 1530 and 1534, for cases in which a mortgagee has been decreed to pay costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">\"Where a mortgagee sets up an unconscientious defence to a bill to redeem, he is not only refused costs, but must pay costs to the other party. <em>Slee </em>v. <em>Manhattan, </em>Co., 1 <em>Paige </em>48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">So if he improperly resists the claim of plaintiff to redeem. <em>Vroom </em>v.

He did not come into court to settle any controversy in which they were interested, but claimed the whole amount of Morris without any regard to Ryerson or Space.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\"><em>Mr. Vanatta, </em>for complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">The defendant, Morris, claims to have the amount of the Brooks mortgage deducted from the amount of complainant\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">The evidence and Morris\u2019 answer on this point amount to this, that Depue agreed to rely upon the covenants in his deed from Ryerson to protect him from the payment of the Brooks mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">Neither Depue or his assigns have ever paid the Brooks mortgage, nor have they, or any of them, been evicted by it. The question then is, can Morris, as assignee of Depue, <em>recoup </em>the Brooks mortgage from the mortgage given by Depue to Ryerson for the purchase money ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">Depue or his assigns, not having paid off the Brooks mortgage, he or they, in an action at law for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, could only recover nominal damages, <em>Rawle on Covenants for Title </em>170, 171, 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">Here, as the encumbrance was known when the deed was taken, and the covenants in the deed were taken as the guard against the encumbrance, the defendant can only detain so much as he could now recover in damages in an action on this covenant. <em>Ibid. </em>725, 729.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-12\">There is no proof of Ryerson\u2019s insolvency \u2014 that is another objection to the recoupement. <em>Ibid. </em>685-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-13\">Another objection to the recoupement is, that Ryerson is not before the court. <em>Rawle </em>690; <em>Coster </em>v. <em>Monroe Manufacturing Co., </em>1 <em>Green's Ch. </em>475, 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-14\">The weight of authorities, as cited and commented upon in Mr. Rawle\u2019s chapter on right to detain purchase money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>pages 604 to 732, is less favorable to the defendant\u2019s claim of recoupement than some cases in this state. See <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Marselis, Saxton </em>413; <em>Van Riper v. Williams, 1 Green\u2019s Ch. </em>407; <em>Van Wagoner </em>v. <em>McEwen, Ibid. </em>412; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Esler, </em>3 <em>Ibid. </em>462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">The case of <em>Van Houten </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>3 <em>Green\u2019s Ch. </em>141, is not so strong as the preceding cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">Another point made for the defendant, Morris, is, that because he offered to pay the amount due before bill filed, the \u2022complainant ought not to recover costs nor interest since April, 1858.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">This offer to pay is not pleaded as a tender. It was only a conditional proposition to pay; he offered no money. As he made no tender, interest cannot stop. 2 <em>Greenl.

(3d </em>ed.) 106, \u00a7 75; 3 <em>Daniels\u2019 Ch. Pr. </em>1516 <em>(2d English edition).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">The general rule is, that the prevailing party is entitled to costs. 3 <em>Daniels </em>1520.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\">The defendant must show sufficient cause to take the case out of the general rule. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-11\">In case of mortgagees they are allowed their costs, and exempted from expense so long as they <em>act reasonably. Ibid. </em>1525; <em>Ibid. </em>1532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-12\">The complainant\u2019s refusal to accept the sum offex\u2019ed at the time was not only reasonable but necessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-13\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A80\">The mortgage which the complainant seeks to foreclose was given to secure the payment of part of the purchase money of the premises, conveyed at the date of the mortgage by the mortgagee to the mortgagor with covenants of general warranty of title and against encumbrances. There was a subsisting mortgage upon the premises at the time of the conveyance which the vendor has failed to discharge. The owner of the equity of redemption, who holds the premises by deed with covenants of warranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>from the mortgagor, asks that the amount of the prior encumbrance be deducted from the amount due the complainant upon his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The case falls directly within the principle of <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Marselis (Saxton </em>413), and must be controlled by it. This case, indeed, is much stronger in favor of the equity of the claim than the reported case. Here there was, at the time of the transaction, a distinct understanding between the parties that the amount of the subsisting encumbrance should be paid out of the first payments made by the mortgagor or deducted from the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In the case of <em>Shannon </em>v. Marselis, as in this case, the mortgage was in the hands of an assignee. The general rule is, that the assignee of a mortgage takes it subject to all the defences which exist against it in the hands of the mortgagee, but not to a latent equity residing in a third person against the mortgagee. <em>Clute </em>v. Robinson, 2 <em>Johns. R. </em>612; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lylburn, </em>2 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>441; <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Dean, Ibid. </em>479; Shannon <em>v. Marselis, Saxton </em>414; 1 <em>Hilliard on Mortgages </em>527 (50 <em>a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The assignment of the mortgage was made to the complainant while the mortgagor continued to own the equity of redemption. The premises were subsequently conveyed from him by deed with covenants of general warranty, and passed by like title to Morris, the defendant. Morris therefore is entitled to the same equitable relief to which Depue himself would have been entitled had he continued the owner of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">It is objected, on the part of the complainant, that the original mortgagee is not before the court. Upon the case made by the bill, there appears no reason why he should be made a party. He retains no interest in the mortgage debt, and none in the mortgaged premises. On recurring to the assignment of the mortgage to the complainant, which has been made an exhibit in the cause, it appears that the mortgage was assigned to the complainant as collateral security merely, and that the assignee was to account to Ryer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>son. for the residue, whenever collected. As to such surplus, if there be any, the complainant is the mere trustee of Ryersoh, for whose benefit the mortgage debt is to be recovered. In that event, Ryerson is a necessary party to the bill. On a bill for foreclosure all the persons entitled to the mortgage money should be before the court. All the beneficiaries should be made parties as well as the trustee. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., </em>\u00a7 201; <em>Mitford\u2019s Pl. (ed. </em>1821) 39, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">If in fact there be such surplus in the hands of the complainant, or if upon the recovery of the amount due upon the mortgage now sought to be foreclosed there will be such surplus, and the complainant desires that Ryerson should be concluded by the decree, it is proper that he should be made a party. But no such necessity appears upon the face of the bill nor of the answer ; and although the exhibit shows that the mortgage was originally assigned as a collateral security for certain purposes, and that the surplus, if any, was to be paid to Ryerson, it does not appear that there was any surplus after the immediate object of the assignment had been accomplished. It cannot be assumed, upon the pleadings and evidence in the cause, that Ryerson has any interest whatever in the mortgage debt. No reason is apparent why he should be made a party to enable the court to settle all the equities of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">It certainly does not lie in the mouth of the complainant, who has omitted to make Ryerson a party, to present that fact as an objection against the equitable protection asked for by the defendant. As the case stands before the court, there-is no reason why he should be made a party, nor why, because of the omission to make him a party, the relief asked by the defendant should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The complainant is entitled to his costs of foreclosure. It is apparent, from the evidence, that the complainant, in declining to receive the money proposed to be paid by the defendant, acted in good faith under the advice of his counsel. He was advised that holding the mortgage as collateral security, and bound by his agreement to account to Ryerson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for the surplus, he could not safely accept less than the face of the mortgage. It is clear that, standing in the position he did, the complainant had no right to adjust the conflicting claims of interested parties, much less was he bound to take the hazard of so doing. He was entitled to ask a decree of the court to have the conflicting claims adjusted and his own rights protected. The conduct of the complainant under the circumstances was neither unreasonable nor litigious.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Unless there be a legal tender of the sum due interest does not stop. It is admitted that there was no legal tender of the money proposed to be paid. The complainant is entitled to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Cited <em>in Andrews </em>v. <em>Torrey, </em>1 <em>McCar., </em>355; <em>Dewitt v.
