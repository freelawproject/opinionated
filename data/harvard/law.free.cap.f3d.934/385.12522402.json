After her debts were discharged and the bankruptcy proceedings closed, Martineau brought this case in federal district court, seeking to rescind her settlement agreement as fraudulently induced and to pursue a tort action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court rejected that effort and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. First, the district court held, Martineau lacked standing because her tort claims were the property of her bankruptcy estate when she filed this action. And in any event, the court found, judicial estoppel precluded Martineau's suit: Because Martineau had not disclosed her future legal claims when she filed for bankruptcy, the court reasoned, she had effectively disavowed them, and could not now take a contrary position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We come to a different conclusion. The district court's \"standing\" determination conflates Article III requirements with the distinct real-party-in-interest analysis; when the two are untangled, it becomes clear that Martineau has both Article III standing and the legal entitlement to pursue these tort claims on her own behalf. With respect to judicial estoppel, the district court relied on an improper presumption of bad faith, short-circuiting the necessary inquiry. Accordingly, we remand so that the district court may evaluate the appropriateness of judicial estoppel in light of all facts and circumstances without recourse to a presumption of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Martineau's underlying tort claims stem from a grisly attack on her by defendant Richard Guest on October 13, 2009. Martineau encountered Guest outside of Guest's apartment, while visiting her boyfriend in the same building. According to the police report, Guest stabbed Martineau repeatedly with an eight-to-ten-inch kitchen knife in an unprovoked assault. The police arrested Guest, who was charged with assault and battery with intent to kill and kidnapping. Guest was found incompetent to stand trial, however, and civilly committed to a mental health facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the years that followed, Martineau retained counsel to investigate potential claims against Guest and co-defendants Diane and Joel Wier, Guest's sister and brother-in-law and the owners of the apartment building in question. According to Martineau, the Wiers assured her that the only relationship they had with Guest was as landlords, and that they had no reason to know of his severe mental illness or potential dangerousness. Relying on those representations, Martineau alleges, she concluded that the Wiers could not be held liable for negligence in connection with Guest's attack on her. As a result, Martineau, still represented by counsel, agreed in October of 2012 to release all claims against the Wiers and Guest in exchange for $20,000 - a sum that she contends represents only a fraction of her damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Roughly a year later, in December of 2013, prosecutors in Guest's criminal case gave Martineau access to Guest's criminal\n   file for the first time. It was at that point, Martineau alleges, that she learned that the Wiers in fact had ample knowledge of Guest's long history of mental illness and propensity for violence. According to Martineau, Diane had attempted to have Guest involuntarily committed years earlier; she was the trustee of a long-standing mental health trust established because Guest was incompetent to manage funds; and the Wiers had discovered poems by Guest describing bloody stabbings. Despite these revelations, Martineau took no legal action, believing that her settlement agreement barred her from proceeding against the Wiers or Guest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June of 2015, eighteen months after reviewing Guest's criminal file, Martineau, now proceeding without counsel, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. When a debtor files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, her assets immediately are transferred to the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

And indeed, Martineau's disclosures listed a pending suit she had against her then-landlord. Those disclosures did not, however, mention any potential future claims against Guest and the Wiers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The bankruptcy court appointed a trustee to oversee the distribution of assets within Martineau's estate. In carrying out that responsibility, a trustee need not pursue all claims, and instead may \"abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Here, the trustee abandoned any interest in Martineau's assets, including her lawsuit against her landlord. In October of 2015, the bankruptcy court discharged Martineau's debt and closed her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Martineau filed this suit in federal district court in July of 2016, almost a year after her bankruptcy proceedings concluded. In her complaint, Martineau sought to rescind her 2009 settlement agreement as fraudulently induced. She also asserted a series of tort-based claims against Guest and the Wiers, arising from Guest's assault on her and the Wiers' alleged negligence in allowing Guest to live unsupervised in their apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss Martineau's case on numerous grounds. As relevant here, they contended that Martineau lacked \"standing\" to pursue the tort claims against them because those claims belonged to her bankruptcy estate and could be asserted only by the bankruptcy trustee. In response, Martineau petitioned the\n   bankruptcy court to reopen her proceedings and filed amended bankruptcy schedules that listed her claims against Guest and the Wiers. The bankruptcy court granted Martineau's motion and appointed a trustee to administer the newly disclosed claims. In February of 2017, that trustee abandoned any interest in Martineau's legal claims. The bankruptcy court closed Martineau's case for the second time without taking further action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Martineau was before the bankruptcy court, the defendants raised an additional defense related to the bankruptcy proceedings: Because Martineau had failed to disclose her tort claims against them in her initial bankruptcy filings, the defendants argued, judicial estoppel barred her from asserting them now. Judicial estoppel, the defendants explained, is an equitable principle that precludes a party from taking inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings. Martineau's original filings amounted to a declaration that she had no claims against them, the defendants contended, and that position necessarily was inconsistent with the pursuit of her claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The magistrate judge assigned to the case converted the defendants' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, and recommended finding for the defendants on both standing and judicial estoppel grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On standing, the magistrate judge agreed with the defendants that Martineau's claims against them became the property of the estate when Martineau filed for bankruptcy, giving the bankruptcy trustee \"exclusive standing\" to pursue them. J.A. 241. The magistrate judge acknowledged that Martineau regained the right to pursue her claims on her own behalf when the second bankruptcy trustee abandoned them in February of 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that did not matter, the magistrate judge reasoned, because \"standing is measured at the time the complaint is filed\" - here, in July of 2016, when Martineau filed this action and before the claims were abandoned. J.A. 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The magistrate judge also agreed with the defendants that the doctrine of judicial estoppel independently precluded Martineau's suit. Judicial estoppel, the magistrate judge explained, \"prevent[s] litigants from taking contrary positions in court filings\" and thus \"protect[s] the essential integrity of the judicial process.\" J.A. 242 (internal quotation marks omitted). The magistrate judge recognized that judicial estoppel does not apply when inconsistent positions are the result of inadvertence or a \"good faith mistake.\" J.A. 243. And Martineau was arguing just that: According to Martineau, she inadvertently omitted her as-yet-unfiled legal claims against the defendants from her June 2015 bankruptcy disclosures because she believed at the time that her settlement agreement would bar any legal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To resolve this issue, the magistrate judge applied a bankruptcy-specific presumption first suggested by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Coastal Plains, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n    179 F.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1999). Under that presumption, as the magistrate judge explained, \"a debtor's failure to satisfy her statutory disclosure duty is inadvertent 'only when, in general, the debtor either lacks knowledge\n   of the undisclosed claims or has no motive for their concealment.' \" J.A. 243 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Coastal Plains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n    179 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   210 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eastman v. Union Pac. R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1090980,3509814\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/1151/\">\n    493 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157-58 (10th Cir. 2007) (collecting cases applying this rule). A motive for concealment, in turn, may be \"inferred,\" because nondisclosure benefits a debtor by \"den[ying] creditors potential assets.\" J.A. 244;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726. That narrowed the magistrate judge's judicial estoppel analysis to just one question: Did Martineau have knowledge of her tort claims against the defendants at the time of her bankruptcy filing in June of 2015? The answer, the magistrate concluded, was yes, because \"all that is required is a showing that [Martineau] knew of the factual basis of the undisclosed claim,\" and Martineau was allowed access to Guest's criminal record - the documents giving rise to her action - in December of 2013. J.A. 243. And even on Martineau's account, the magistrate judge finished, she knew of her legal claims by no later than the summer of 2016, when she filed suit, and still failed to amend her bankruptcy filings until November of that year, after the defendants moved to dismiss her action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation over Martineau's objections, awarding summary judgment to the defendants. On standing, the district court summarized and incorporated the magistrate judge's reasoning, concluding that \"the bankruptcy trustee alone had exclusive standing to pursue this action at the time [Martineau] filed her complaint.\" J.A. 299. The court likewise endorsed the magistrate's reasoning with respect to judicial estoppel: To establish that Martineau's 2015 nondisclosure of her tort claims was not inadvertent, it was enough that Martineau at that time had \"knowledge of the undisclosed claims\" - in the form of access to the relevant documents in December of 2013 - and \"motive for concealment of the claims\" - consistent with the presumption identified by the magistrate judge. J.A. 302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Martineau filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, we review de novo the district court's determination that Martineau lacks standing to bring this action.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

The district court's reliance on judicial estoppel is reviewed for abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    Minnieland Private Day Sch., Inc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275289\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/449/#p457\">\n    867 F.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (4th Cir. 2017), which \"by definition\" includes an error of law,\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

We agree on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin with the district court's finding that Martineau lacked standing to bring the current action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted above,\n   the district court reached this conclusion by adopting the magistrate's recommendation that \"the bankruptcy trustee alone had exclusive standing to pursue this action at the time [Martineau] filed her complaint.\" J.A. 299. This was so, the magistrate judge reasoned, because when Martineau filed for bankruptcy in June of 2015, her potential claims against the Wiers and Guest became assets that belonged to the bankruptcy estate. Although those claims later were abandoned by the bankruptcy trustee and reverted to Martineau, that did not happen until 2017, well after Martineau filed this action, and courts \"have an obligation to assure [themselves] ... [of] Article III standing at the outset of the litigation.\" J.A. 241 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p180\">\n    528 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p180\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p180\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The problem with this analysis is that it conflates Article III standing with the distinct issue of whether Martineau or her bankruptcy trustee was the \"real party in interest,\" legally entitled to pursue these claims. There is no question in this case that Martineau's allegations satisfy the Article III requirements for standing: Martineau's complaint alleges a distinct injury at the hands of Guest and the Wiers, traceable to their conduct, and redressable by a favorable decision on her tort claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Indeed, neither the magistrate judge nor the district court applied that familiar three-part standard to Martineau's allegations and found them wanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Instead, the question in this case - on which the magistrate judge and district court did focus - is whether Martineau was legally entitled to pursue these tort claims on her own behalf, or whether the claims belonged solely to her estate. That question implicates not Article III standing doctrine, but rather the \"real-party-in-interest\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576070,4179535\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/337/\">\n    717 F.3d at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (treating question of whether debtor or bankruptcy trustee is entitled to maintain action for tax refund as one of real party in interest). Under Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"an action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a). And in the context of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, it is the bankruptcy trustee and not the debtor who is the real party in interest with respect to property of the estate, with the right to bring any legal claims that belong to the estate.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576070,4179535\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/337/\">\n    717 F.3d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Martineau concedes that when she filed this suit in July of 2016, her tort claims against the defendants belonged to the bankruptcy estate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   making the bankruptcy trustee the real party in interest. The district court and magistrate judge deemed that fact dispositive: Because courts must assure themselves of \"Article III standing at the outset of the litigation,\" J.A. 241 (internal quotation marks omitted), all that mattered was that on the date suit was filed, the bankruptcy trustee and not Martineau had the right to pursue these tort claims. But there is no analogous rule for the real-party-in-interest requirement. To the contrary, Rule 17 makes clear that circumstances on the date of filing do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   control, prohibiting courts from dismissing a complaint on real-party-in-interest grounds without first providing the real party in interest with the opportunity to \"ratify, join, or be substituted into the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(3). Because the district court miscategorized this question as one of constitutional standing, it improperly limited its focus to whether Martineau had the right to sue at the time of filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   And this was a critical error, because events that transpired after the date of Martineau's filing made Martineau, and not the bankruptcy trustee, the real party in interest under Rule 17, legally entitled to pursue her tort claims on her own behalf. In February of 2017 - after Martineau filed suit but before the rulings in this case - the bankruptcy trustee in Martineau's reopened bankruptcy proceedings abandoned Martineau's legal claims against the defendants, bringing them outside the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biesek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81749,90606\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/410/\">\n    440 F.3d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bankruptcy trustee \"may abandon worthless or low value assets, including legal claims\").

Martineau contends that she did not intentionally or deliberately change positions.

The district court found to the contrary, according to Martineau, only by relying on a presumption of bad faith that this court never has endorsed. We agree, and find that the district court improperly applied a presumption of bad faith that is at odds with our case law and with the very nature of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the presumption in question, as the magistrate judge explained, a debtor who fails to disclose a legal claim in bankruptcy proceedings (as Martineau concedes she did here) is presumed to have acted in bad faith unless she \"either lacks knowledge of the undisclosed claims or has no motive for their concealment.\" J.A. 243 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because debtors always have a motive to conceal - disclosure shifts assets from the debtor to her creditors - the inquiry effectively\n   reduces to the question of knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 297 (Martineau \"had motive to conceal the claims because disclosure would provide her creditors with a potential asset\"). As applied here, that means that so long as a debtor has knowledge of the facts that someday will underlie a future legal claim, it may be inferred that she failed to disclose that claim in a deliberate and bad-faith effort to mislead the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But the nature of the judicial estoppel inquiry does not lend itself to this kind of blanket presumption.

First, by focusing exclusively on whether Martineau knew of the factual basis for her legal claims when she filed for bankruptcy, the district court failed to give full effect to the principle that \"[w]ithout bad faith, there can be no judicial estoppel,\"\n   <em>\n    Zinkand v.

It is true, as the district court\n   emphasized, that Martineau gained access to Guest's criminal file - and with it, the information on which she bases her current suit - in 2013, before she filed for bankruptcy in 2015. But whether Martineau had access to the facts underlying her legal claims is a \"separate question\" from whether she \"actually intended to manipulate the judicial system to [her] advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266500,12270199\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1174/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Failure to disclose still might have been inadvertent, in that Martineau, as she alleges, may have had no plans ever to file suit at the time she declared bankruptcy. And even if she did plan to sue, or at least had not ruled out the possibility, she still may have failed to disclose not deliberately but \"because [she] did not understand the disclosure obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266500,12270199\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Eleventh Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is not difficult to imagine that some debtors, particularly those proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \" - as Martineau was here - \"may not realize that a pending lawsuit qualifies as a ... claim that must be disclosed on a schedule of assets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266500,12270199\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Indeed, presuming bad faith from failure to disclose a legal claim is particularly unwarranted in a case like this one, in which there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   no \"pending lawsuit\" to disclose when the debtor filed for bankruptcy. We have discussed already the authority that, at least arguably, might make Martineau's as-yet-unfiled lawsuit the property of her estate, requiring its disclosure. But we can see no reason to presume that Martineau was familiar with the relevant case law, and nothing about the bankruptcy forms themselves would have made clear to her the need to disclose a legal claim that she had neither filed nor taken any steps toward pursuing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The possibility of good-faith mistake, that is, is especially high with respect to a failure to disclose an as-yet purely hypothetical legal claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the district court's reliance on a presumption of bad faith meant that it never considered the course of subsequent bankruptcy proceedings - specifically, that when Martineau reopened her bankruptcy proceedings and amended her disclosures to include the legal claims in question, the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the claims and the bankruptcy court closed her case without further action. Bankruptcy courts have multiple ways of protecting their own integrity against fraudulent nondisclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ah Quin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659715,3715007\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/267/\">\n    733 F.3d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting presumption of bad faith in part because \"the bankruptcy system already provides plenty of protections\" to bankruptcy courts to guard against threats to their integrity).

Here, however, the bankruptcy court exercised none of these powers, a strong indication that it did not believe Martineau acted in bad faith.

The district court, adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation, applied precisely the same presumption, limiting its bad-faith inquiry to Martineau's \"knowledge of the undisclosed claims and ... motive for concealment of the claims.\" J.A. 302.

We recognize that there are two distinct nondisclosures at issue here. The first is Martineau's initial failure to list her not-yet-pending claims when she filed for bankruptcy in 2015, the primary focus of the district court and of our analysis above. But even after she filed this action in 2016, Martineau did not immediately move to reopen her bankruptcy proceedings and disclose her cause of action, notwithstanding her continuing disclosure obligations to the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Coastal Plains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n    179 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (debtor's duty of disclosure is a \"continuing one\"). Instead, as the district court noted, Martineau returned to the bankruptcy court and amended her filings only after the defendants called attention to her bankruptcy proceedings in their motion to dismiss, several months later. Whether that sequence of events is evidence of a deliberate effort to hide these claims from the bankruptcy court, as the defendants urge, or entirely consistent with Martineau's account - that the defendants' motion to dismiss apprised her that she mistakenly had omitted these claims from her bankruptcy schedules, at which point she promptly moved to correct her oversight - is for the district court to determine, after consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court also should consider on remand whether judicial estoppel is warranted under the other factors laid out by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   .

As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   , judicial estoppel typically would apply only if Martineau has taken \"clearly inconsistent\" positions, with the first - the implicit disavowal, through nondisclosure, of any legal claim against the defendants - accepted by the bankruptcy court as true, so that there is a \"risk of inconsistent court determinations\" if she is not estopped in the district court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    532 U.S. at 750-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But once Martineau reopened her bankruptcy proceedings and corrected her disclosures, it is at least arguable that she was taking the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   position - that she had valid legal claims against the defendants - before both courts, and that the bankruptcy court, by accepting the amended disclosures and granting a new discharge, was no longer crediting the initial position. At least one court has determined that under these circumstances, \"two of the three primary\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   factors are no longer met\": \"Although the plaintiff-debtor initially took inconsistent positions, the bankruptcy court ultimately\n   <em>\n    did not accept\n   </em>\n   the initial position,\" and there is \"no risk of inconsistent court determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Ah Quin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659715,3715007\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/267/\">\n    733 F.3d at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, under\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   's third factor, it is not clear that Martineau \"derive[d] an unfair advantage or impose[d] an unfair detriment,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    532 U.S. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on the defendants through her initial nondisclosure; at the end of the day, it was the second bankruptcy trustee's independent decision to abandon any interest in Martineau's legal claims rather than pursue them on behalf of Martineau's creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ah Quin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659715,3715007\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/267/\">\n    733 F.3d at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff-debtor who amended her bankruptcy filings to disclose a pending legal claim \"\n   <em>\n    did not obtain an unfair advantage\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We leave these questions to the district court in the first instance.

But in that context, the reference is not to Article III standing - the basis for the district court's jurisdictional holding - but to prudential standing, reflecting courts' tendency to use the terms prudential standing and real party in interest interchangeably when discussing a bankruptcy trustee's sole authority to take action on legal claims that belong to the estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576070,4179535\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/337/\">\n     717 F.3d at 342-43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (collecting cases).

And as we explain below, the bankruptcy trustee's abandonment of Martineau's claims against the defendants did just that, curing any defect in Martineau's right to bring this suit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    We note that the case law on this point is not as clear as the parties' litigating positions suggest. For its conclusion that Martineau's as-yet-unfiled legal claims against the defendants belonged to the estate (and thus were subject to disclosure), the district court relied principally on an unpublished district court decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    J.A. 301 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Vanderheyden v.

But that decision - like others relied on by the magistrate judge and district court - involved circumstances in which a debtor already had taken substantial steps toward legal action when he filed for bankruptcy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vanderheyden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2030065\">\n     2013 WL 30065\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 (debtor failed to disclose charges filed with EEOC);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Robertson v.

Sept. 11, 2006) (same). This case is different; at the time Martineau filed for bankruptcy, she had taken no steps preparatory to filing suit and, on her own account at least, believed that she was precluded by her settlement agreement from doing so. We have found no authority requiring a debtor to disclose, as an asset of the estate, a hypothetical legal claim that she does not believe exists. But the parties agree that Martineau's tort claims against the defendants belonged to the bankruptcy estate when she filed suit, so we need not resolve that issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Indeed, in a footnote to a recent unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit itself suggested a more limited role for the\n    <em>\n     In re Coastal Plains\n    </em>\n    presumption, contending that other courts applying or describing it have overstated its effects.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.
