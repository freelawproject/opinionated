The district court sentenced Merritt to 46 months. Merritt appeals his sentence, arguing that his prior drug conspiracy conviction is not a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When reviewing a sentence for procedural error, \"we review the district court's construction and application of the sentencing [G]uidelines\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and its factual findings for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because Merritt did not raise this argument before the district court, we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
