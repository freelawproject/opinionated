Prerequisites are having (1) so many class members that joinder is impractical, (2) questions of law or fact that are common to the class, (3) one or more representatives whose claims or defenses are typical of those in the class, and (4) representatives who will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Besides these prerequisites, a class action must satisfy one of the subsections (1) through (3) in Rule 23(b). As pertinent here, Rule 23(b)(2) provides that a class action may be maintained if the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met and \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the first time we review an order approving the settlement of a class action certified under Rule 23(b)(2) where the only benefit received by the class was the defendant's payment of a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award to organizations the defendant approved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant, Google Inc., created a web browser \"cookie\" that tracks an internet user's data (think following the trail of cookie crumbs). For some Safari or Internet Explorer browser users, the cookie may have operated even if the user configured privacy settings to prevent it from tracking data. The class plaintiffs claim Google invaded users' privacy under the California constitution and the state tort of intrusion upon seclusion (meaning the intrusion into a private place, conversation, or matter in a highly offensive manner). In a disputed Rule 23(b)(2) class settlement, Google has agreed to stop using the cookies for Safari browsers and to pay $ 5.5 million to cover class counsel's fees and costs, incentive awards for the named class representatives, and\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distributions, without directly compensating any class members. The six\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients are primarily data privacy organizations, and all must agree to use the funds to research and promote browser privacy. In addition, Google would obtain, among other things, a class-wide release of all class-member claims, including for money damages that did or could stem from the subject matter of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The lone objector, Theodore H. Frank, challenges the District Court's certification of a settlement class and the terms of the approved settlement. He argues that the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   money properly belongs to the class as compensation. He asks us to vacate the settlement as unfair and require direct distributions to class members before resorting to\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   awards. In the alternative, if direct distributions are truly infeasible, he asserts the class should not have been certified due to inadequate representation. Frank also challenges the parties' choice of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients because of their pre-existing relationships with Google and class counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We believe that, in some Rule 23(b)(2) class actions, a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   -only settlement may properly be approved. But here the District Court's cursory certification and fairness analysis were insufficient for us to review its order certifying the class and approving the settlement. The settlement agreement's broad release of claims for money damages and its designation of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients are particularly concerning. We thus vacate the order approving the settlement and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In brief, news broke in early 2012 that a Stanford graduate student had discovered Google's Doubleclick.net cookies were bypassing Safari and Internet Explorer privacy settings and tracking internet-user information. Google settled the resulting Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general lawsuits, agreeing to cease the practice and to pay a combined $ 39.5 million in fines, though admitting no past acts or wrongdoing. Plaintiff internet users also filed claims against Google that were later consolidated into a putative class action. The class complaint alleged violations of federal privacy and fraud statutes, California unfair competition and privacy statutes, the California constitution's right to privacy, and that state's privacy tort law. It sought injunctive and monetary relief. Google moved to dismiss, and the District Court granted the motion in full. On appeal we affirmed the dismissal of all but the California constitutional and tort claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357000\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/125/#p130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357000\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/125/#p130\">\n    at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proposed Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On remand, the parties began discovery. They then sought to avoid further litigation and began mediation before a former federal judge. With the help of the mediator, the parties agreed to a settlement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") and simultaneously moved for certification of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) class and approval of the settlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e). The latter states that \"claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class ... may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). It also lays out the procedures that apply to any such settlement, dismissal, or compromise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357000\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/125/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The proposed settlement defines the class as all persons in America who used Safari or Internet Explorer web browsers and \"who visited a website from which Doubleclick.net ... cookies were placed by the means alleged in the Complaint,\" excluding individuals who had already obtained relief from Google or submitted \"a valid and timely Request for Exclusion.\" Settlement Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.5 (defining \"Class\" and \"Class Member\"). In sweeping language, the settlement would release all class member claims, including for damages, that did or could stem from, or relate to, the subject matter of the litigation. Settlement Agreement \u00a7 2.25 (\"Released Claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In exchange, Google would be required to assure it had \"implemented systems configured to\" abate or delete all third-party Google cookies that exist in Safari browsers. Settlement Agreement \u00a7 5.1 (\"Assurance of Remediation\"). And as noted, it would also pay $ 5.5 million, to be divided among the settlement administrator, class counsel, the named class representatives, and\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients. Settlement Agreement \u00a7 5.2 (\"Settlement Fund\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Settlement Agreement requires both parties to agree to the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients. The class must propose up to ten options, and Google may strike any for a non-arbitrary reason and request a replacement. Settlement Agreement \u00a7 5.3 (\"\n   <em>\n    Cy Pres\n   </em>\n   Recipients\"). The chosen recipients must agree \"to devote the funds to promote public awareness and education, and/or to support research, development, and initiatives, related to the security and/or privacy of Internet browsers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357000\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/125/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties ultimately agreed on six recipients: (1) the Berkeley Center for Law &amp; Technology; (2) the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University; (3) the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (Privacy &amp; Data Project); (4) Public Counsel; (5) the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse; and (6) the Center for Internet &amp; Society at Stanford University.

Class Action Settlements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The settlement of a putative class action requires the approval of a district court, both for certifying the class and for determining whether the settlement is \"fair, reasonable and adequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Halley v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276173\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/481/#p488\">\n    861 F.3d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (3d Cir. 2017). We have provided guidance on the factors a court should consider in deciding whether to approve class action settlements, most notably the\n   <em>\n    Girsh\n   </em>\n   factors\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where, as here, the parties seek simultaneous class certification and settlement approval, courts should be \"even more scrupulous than usual when they examine the fairness of the proposed settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   , 148 F.3d at 317 (quotation omitted). This heightened standard is designed to protect the interests of all class members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Some class action settlements also require the sending of notice to members of the putative class. Before approving the settlement of a class action certified under Rule 23(b)(3), which is primarily used to pursue money-damages class actions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a court \"must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the\n   circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). For class actions certified under Rule 23(b)(1), which is often used to pursue class actions involving a common fund for injured stakeholders,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or Rule 23(b)(2), which is used to pursue injunctions in class actions, the Rules do not impose the same mandate of notice; rather, they state the court \"may direct appropriate notice to the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Of course, regardless what these rules say, the procedures for class action settlement-including the notice procedures-must also comply with due process requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Football League Players Concussion Injury Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257074\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/410/#p435\">\n    821 F.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (3d Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The District Court preliminarily certified the class for settlement under Rule 23(b)(2). Following a notice period, the Court received fifty exclusion requests and one timely objection. Frank, the sole objector, asserted that either the settlement was unfair because it improperly preferred\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   over direct compensation to class members, or, in the alternative, the class could not be certified if direct compensation was impossible. He further argued that the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients raised a conflict-of-interest concern because class counsel was on one recipient's board and Google was a regular donor to four others. Finally, Frank challenged the attorneys' fees\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   an issue he does not raise on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To determine whether the settlement class could be certified, the District Court conducted a hearing as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2) and heard arguments from the parties and Frank. Following the hearing, it issued a short opinion and final order approving class certification and the settlement. In its opinion the Court correctly noted it could certify a class only if the requirements of Rule 23(a) and one of the prongs of Rule 23(b) were satisfied. It stated that \"no objections had been filed\" challenging class certification, then in three sentences explained why all the requisite factors were met-without stating what type of Rule 23(b) class was certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court then reviewed the proposed settlement for fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy, as required by Rule 23(e)(2). That Rule provides that if a class action settlement \"would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and only on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). The Court here noted that a presumption of fairness applies to class settlements that meet certain criteria established in our case law, but it did not make factual findings relating to those factors or hold whether the presumption applied in this case. It then applied the\n   <em>\n    Girsh\n   </em>\n   factors in determining whether the settlement was\n   fair, reasonable, and adequate. Though it spent only four sentences analyzing the entirety of\n   <em>\n    Girsh\n   </em>\n   's nine factors, the Court concluded that \"the record adequately establishes\" they had been satisfied. It acknowledged additional factors to consider under\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   , 148 F.3d at 323, and\n   <em>\n    In re Baby Prods. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541216\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/163/\">\n    708 F.3d 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2013), but did not expressly apply them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ultimately, the Court rejected Frank's arguments and approved the settlement. It found that \"the nature of the likely compensation to the class members has always been complicated by the substantial problems of identifying the millions of potential class members\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then of translating their alleged loss of privacy into individual cash amounts.\" It further found that \"payments to absent class members would be logistically burdensome, impractical, and economically infeasible, resulting (at best) with direct compensation of a\n   <em>\n    de minim\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   amount.\" Because the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   money would be used by \"preeminent institutions for researching and advocating for online privacy\" to promote Internet browser privacy, it held that the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   awards \"bear a direct and substantial nexus to the interests of absent class members.\" In one sentence, the Court noted Frank's objections to the pre-existing relationships between Google, class counsel, and the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients, but held \"no conflict of interest\" had \"undermine[d] the selected\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Frank timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It also acknowledged the additional factors we suggested district courts consider in\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   , 148 F.3d at 323, and\n   <em>\n    Baby Products\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541216\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/163/\">\n    708 F.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but did not explicitly apply them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this context, we are not persuaded the Court sufficiently assessed the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement. In particular, two features of the settlement present concerns that were not adequately considered by it: the broad class-wide release of claims for money damages, and selection of the specific\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Class-wide Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Settlement Agreement purports to release all class member claims, including for damages, that did or could stem from, or relate to, the subject matter of the litigation. This raises a red flag. Before the District Court, class counsel acknowledged that the dismissal of all claims providing for statutory damages made class certification more difficult.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District Court Docket, ECF No. 163 (Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement) at 15. That premise, in turn, shaped the structure of both class certification and class notice: the parties sought to certify an injunction class under Rule 23(b)(2), not a damages class under Rule 23(b)(3),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   District Court Docket, ECF No. 163, and thus avoided the heightened certification and notice requirements that apply to the latter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring predominance and superiority); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) (requiring \"the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances\" for 23(b)(3) settlements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Yet having sidestepped these requirements, Google and class counsel nonetheless obtained-for themselves anyway-the precise benefits that a Rule 23(b)(3) class gives to the defendant and class counsel: namely, a broad class-wide release of claims for money damages for the defendant, and a percentage-of-fund calculation of attorneys' fees for class counsel. The District Court's failure to scrutinize this troubling aspect of the Settlement Agreement prevents us from reviewing its fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238909\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/190/#p196\">\n    223 F.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (district court's reasoning and application of the law must be clear enough to provide basis for review). We also question, and leave to the District Court on remand, whether a defendant can ever obtain a class-wide release of claims for money damages in a Rule 23(b)(2) settlement, and if so, whether a release of that kind requires a heightened form of notice either\n   under Rule 23(c)(2)(B) or due process tenets.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NFL Concussion Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257074\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/410/#p435\">\n    821 F.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that class action notice must comply with due process);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Payment Card Interchange Fee &amp; Merchant Discount Antitrust Litig\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922741\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/223/#p236\">\n    827 F.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (2d Cir. 2016) (reversing district court's approval of Rule 23(b)(2) settlement with broad release);\n   <em>\n    Koby v.

Because \"this case is about Google's alleged circumvention of Internet browser privacy settings,\" it concluded, the proposed\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distributions thus \"bear a direct and substantial nexus to the interests of absent class members.\" The Court made no finding that the class's nationwide nature was reflected in the geographical scope of\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients' work.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schwartz v.

However, the record shows they overlap; the promotion of better online privacy inherently has nationwide effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, on the District Court's review of the record, the proposed\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   awards would be used for a purpose directly and substantially related to the class's interests. The record also reflects that the geographic scope of the class corresponds to that of the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients. The Court held the proposed\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   awards were fair, reasonable, and adequate when viewed \"from the perspective of the Settlement Class as a whole.\" Although other aspects of its analysis were unusually brief, the Court did not abuse its discretion by approving this (b)(2) class settlement's\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Yet we are troubled here by the selection of the specific\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients. Frank challenges the selection of those recipients as unfair under Rule 23(e)(2) due to pre-existing associations between them and class counsel or Google. He asserts that Google has long ties to Stanford and is a regular donor and\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   payor to the Berkeley Center for Law &amp; Technology, the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, the Center for Internet &amp; Society at Stanford University, and the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology. One of the lawyers representing the class is also a board member of Public Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We have not previously addressed when a prior relationship between a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipient and one of the litigants in a class action undermines the proposed settlement's fairness. Regardless of the relevant standard, however, the District Court's treatment of the question warrants remand. It conducted no fact finding, either through additional filings or an evidentiary hearing, to determine the nature of the relationships between the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients and Google or class counsel. In its opinion, the Court misstated the nature of Frank's objections, stating he \"takes the position that any relationship between a party (and its counsel) and a proposed\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipient automatically disqualifies the proposed\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipient.\" It then dismissed the issue in a single sentence with no analysis, holding that \"no conflict of interest\" had \"undermine[d] the selected\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients.\" This is not the \"scrupulous\" examination required of a\n   court acting as a fiduciary for absent class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warfarin Sodium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140790\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/516/#p535\">\n    391 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   534 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238909\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/190/#p196\">\n    223 F.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We further hold that, if challenged by an objector, a district court must review the selected\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients to determine whether they have a significant prior affiliation with any party, counsel, or the court. A settlement should not be approved if such a prior affiliation \"would raise substantial questions ... whether the selection of the recipient was made on the merits.\" ALI, Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 3.07 cmt. b. The parties seeking settlement approval bear the burden of explaining to a court why the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   selection was fair, which may include describing the nature of any prior affiliations; what role, if any, each affiliation played in the\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   selection process; whether other recipients were sincerely considered; and why these recipients are the proper choice. As always, \"[w]here a court fears counsel is conflicted, it should subject the settlement to increased scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Baby Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541216\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/163/\">\n    708 F.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On remand, the District Court should consider whether these\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   recipients have significant prior affiliations with Google, class counsel, or the Court, and, if so, whether the selection process failed to satisfy Rule 23(e)(2) by raising substantial questions whether the recipients were chosen on the merits. Where, as here, the only benefit to class members is a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   award, parties may also want to involve class members or a neutral participant in the selection of recipients to ward off any appearance of impropriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Class Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Frank asserts that, even if his settlement fairness challenge fails, reversal is still appropriate on class-certification grounds. If a settlement will not confer a meaningful benefit to absent class members, he argues it must fail to satisfy Rule 23(a)(4) and (g)(4). Those Rules provide that a class's representative plaintiffs and counsel, respectively, must \"fairly and adequately\" represent the interests of the class. Frank contends that a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   -only settlement in these circumstances confers\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   benefit on the class, which inherently shows that the class representative and counsel failed to represent the class fairly and adequately. For this reason, he claims a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   -only settlement class cannot be certified due to inadequate representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Frank's class certification challenge is not really an alternative ground for reversal. It is predicated on his challenge to the settlement. In light of our decision to remand, we leave to the District Court whether to reconsider Frank's contentions concerning the propriety of class certification in light of its further consideration and potential factfinding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The vista view of this case is not pretty. According to the complaint, an internet behemoth with unprecedented tools for monitoring private conduct told millions of Americans it would not track their personal browser history, and then it did so anyway to profit from the data. Through the proposed class-action settlement, the purported wrongdoer promises to pay a couple million dollars to class counsel and make a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   contribution to organizations it was already donating to otherwise (at least one of which has an affiliation with class counsel). By seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(2), the defendant and class counsel avoid the additional safeguards that apply to Rule 23(b)(3) actions. One might think this would leave room for class members to pursue damages individually; yet that relief is foreclosed as well, as the settlement contains a nationwide release of claims for money damages that\n   arose or could arise were there unauthorized snooping, presumably covering tens if not hundreds of millions of Americans. In this context, we believe the District Court's factfinding and legal analysis were insufficient for us to review its order certifying the class and approving the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement. We thus vacate and remand for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \"The term 'cy pres' is derived from the Norman French expression\n    <em>\n     cy pres comme possible\n    </em>\n    , which means 'as near as possible.' \"\n    <em>\n     In re Baby Prods.
