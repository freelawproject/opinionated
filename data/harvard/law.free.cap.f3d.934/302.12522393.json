From April to August of 2015, Golden and Locke submitted three records requests to the New Jersey Institute of Technology (\"NJIT\") under New Jersey's Open Public Records Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047\">\n    N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :1A-1 - 47:1A-13 (\"OPRA\"). Many of NJIT's documents that were responsive to the OPRA requests originated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\" or \"the Bureau\") and were subject to prohibitions on public dissemination. NJIT's custodian of records, Clara Williams, therefore asked the FBI to advise NJIT as to whether it should allow access to the records. In no uncertain terms, the FBI directed NJIT to withhold most of the records. NJIT obliged, claiming that the documents were exempt from disclosure. This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After removal of this case to federal court, NJIT and the FBI agreed to reexamine the previously withheld records. As a result of that review, NJIT produced thousands of pages of documents it had formerly deemed exempt. Golden and\n   Locke then moved for attorneys' fees under OPRA, which mandates a fee award for prevailing plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047\">\n    N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :1A-6. The District Court denied the fee motion, holding that no nexus existed between the lawsuit filed by Golden and Locke and the eventual release of records. The Court was persuaded by NJIT's position that it had acted reasonably in following the FBI's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We disagree with both the District Court's conclusion and its misplaced focus on reasonableness. Under the catalyst theory, as adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees if there exists \"a factual causal nexus between [the] litigation and the relief ultimately achieved\" and if \"the relief ultimately secured by plaintiffs had a basis in law.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason v. City of Hoboken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3916374\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/196/51/\">\n    196 N.J. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3916374\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/196/51/\">\n    951 A.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032 (2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Singer v.

Before Golden and Locke filed suit, NJIT had asserted OPRA exemptions to justify withholding the majority of the requested records. Post-lawsuit, NJIT abandoned its reliance on those exemptions and produced most of the records. Golden and Locke's lawsuit was the catalyst for the production of documents and thereby satisfied the\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   test. That NJIT withheld records at the behest of the FBI does not afford it a basis to abdicate its role as the records custodian. NJIT alone bore the burden of allowing or denying access to the requested records. With that burden comes the attendant responsibility of paying attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff. We will therefore reverse and remand for the calculation of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Enacted in 2002, the purpose of OPRA is \"to maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1025 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Asbury Park Press v.

On April 8, 2015, Golden submitted the first OPRA request to Williams, NJIT's records custodian. The first request sought\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) \"all e-mail communications since January 1, 2010, between the Central Intelligence Agency or its representatives using the email domains @ucia.gov, @cia.gov, or any other address, and the following people at the New Jersey Institute of Technology: the president, chancellor(s),\n   provost(s), vice provost(s), vice presidents, deans, general counsel, assistant general counsel, outside counsel, and campus police chief\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) \"all e-mail communications since January 1, 2010, between the Federal Bureau of Investigation or its representatives using the email domains @ic.fbi.gov, @fbi.gov, or any other email address, and the same people at NJIT.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   App. 58. NJIT staff accessed the computer system to search for the email extensions contained in Golden's request. NJIT located over 1,400 emails, which Williams began to review and print. Due to the volume of emails, Williams asked for and received from Golden an extension of the seven-day OPRA deadline to turn over records covered by the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During Williams's review, she discovered that many of the emails-which were mostly from the FBI to NJIT-contained dissemination controls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, some emails warned, \"do not disclose,\" or \"proprietary and confidential information.\" App. 213, \u00b6 27. Williams believed that these emails likely fell within OPRA's exemption for third-party confidential information, and she notified the FBI of the first request and the responsive emails. In turn, the FBI told Williams that it would need to review all of the emails before she disclosed them to Golden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In May 2015, FBI agents visited NJIT to review the emails Williams had compiled. The FBI advised Williams \"that any emails directed to and received from the FBI are deemed FBI records and, as such, are the property of the United States Government.\" App. 214, \u00b6 31. The FBI also told Williams that it, not NJIT, \"is cloaked with full and exclusive authority to determine whether or not any such email is subject to disclosure.\" App. 214, \u00b6 31. The FBI redacted some emails and marked others as classified. The FBI instructed Williams to produce certain records and to withhold others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 29, 2015, Williams responded to Golden's first request. NJIT produced approximately 540 pages of records, many of which were redacted. NJIT also withheld 3,949 pages, citing several OPRA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 61-62 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , exemptions for domestic security and documents that would be exempt under federal law, including the federal Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\")). Williams's response included a letter from the FBI memorializing its directive to withhold the records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Approximately two months later, on July 28, 2015, Locke submitted to NJIT a second OPRA request, which was identical to the first request. The following day, Williams contacted the FBI to advise it of the second request and to confirm her understanding that NJIT was prohibited from releasing any additional records. Williams then denied Locke's request; citing many of the same OPRA exemptions as before, Williams advised that NJIT would not produce any additional records and enclosed the FBI's May 2015 letter prohibiting disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Just a few weeks later, on August 13, 2015, Golden submitted a third OPRA request. The third request mirrored the first and second requests. Noticing this duplication, Williams asked Golden if he had submitted the request in error; he responded that the third request was broader than the first two because it sought records through the date of the most recent request. After again consulting with the FBI, Williams denied the third request pursuant\n   to the same OPRA exemptions and enclosed the FBI's May 2015 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Roughly a month later, in September 2015, Golden and Locke sued NJIT and Williams under OPRA and New Jersey's common law right of access in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division, Essex County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court issued a show cause order to NJIT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the FBI initially told NJIT it would intervene in the lawsuit, the Bureau opted not to do so. As a result, NJIT filed a third-party complaint against the FBI for indemnification in the event the Court awarded Golden and Locke attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In December 2015, the FBI removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The FBI counterclaimed against NJIT, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent NJIT from releasing responsive records to Golden and Locke. The Court stayed all discovery in the case pending a status conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Beginning in January 2016, the Magistrate Judge to whom the case was referred held a series of status conferences with the parties. As of February 2016, NJIT and the FBI possessed approximately 6,000 pages of undisclosed documents responsive to the OPRA requests. Of the 6,000 pages, the Bureau claimed that 4,000 were federal records that were purportedly exempt from disclosure under OPRA. The FBI agreed to treat the remaining 2,000 pages as a request from NJIT to consult, and the Bureau would review the documents at a rate of 500 pages per month. Although Golden and Locke did not agree with the FBI's position as to the 4,000 purportedly exempt pages, all parties agreed to the consultation procedure. Given the progress, the Magistrate Judge stayed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2016, the FBI reported that it had reviewed approximately 2,000 pages of responsive records. The FBI redacted and returned the documents to NJIT, \"which in turn produced the redacted documents to Plaintiffs in accordance with FBI protocols for consultation requests.\" App. 143. The FBI also undertook \"a further cursory review\" of the remaining purportedly exempt pages and agreed to review them at a rate of 500 pages per month. App. 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In October 2016, the FBI finished its review of the 6,000 pages. NJIT produced 3,445 unredacted pages and 379 partially redacted pages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   NJIT withheld 26 pages pursuant to a FOIA exemption and 1,614 pages because the FBI asserted control over those documents. The Bureau agreed to provide Golden and Locke with additional information concerning the withheld documents in an effort to narrow the issues for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In January 2017, the parties reported that they had \"made substantial progress in narrowing the issues to be litigated.\" App. 151. Golden and Locke agreed not to challenge a substantial number of the withheld documents. They also provided NJIT and the FBI with a list of specific withheld documents that they wanted the Bureau to revisit. In February 2017, the FBI produced additional records. In light of upcoming publication deadlines for\n   Golden's book, he and Locke opted not to challenge the remainder of the withheld documents. The parties advised the Magistrate Judge that the only issue that remained to be resolved was Golden and Locke's forthcoming motion for attorneys' fees as prevailing parties under OPRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Golden and Locke filed a motion for attorneys' fees in November 2017, seeking $197,829.50. NJIT opposed the motion. In April 2018, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") recommending that the District Court deny the fee motion. The Magistrate Judge believed that no causal nexus existed between Golden and Locke's lawsuit and the production of records. The Magistrate Judge reasoned that because the FBI-not NJIT-asserted and then abandoned OPRA exemptions, NJIT's conduct was \"unaffected and unchanged\" by the filing of the lawsuit. App. 23. The Magistrate Judge also ruled that NJIT's conduct was reasonable. Golden and Locke objected to the R&amp;R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On August 2, 2018, the District Court adopted the R&amp;R and denied Golden and Locke's fee motion. Like the Magistrate Judge, the District Court considered NJIT's conduct to be \"reasonable in light of the FBI's repeated demand that NJIT not release records without its approval, NJIT's consistent position to Plaintiffs that it would not do so, and its attempts to facilitate a resolution for Plaintiffs.\" App. 7. The District Court also agreed with the Magistrate Judge that, while the FBI's conduct had changed because of the lawsuit, NJIT had not altered its position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Golden and Locke timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Neither of the parties questioned the District Court's jurisdiction, nor did the Court raise the issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .

Before the lawsuit, NJIT refused to release the majority of documents responsive to the first OPRA request and completely denied the second and third requests.

By releasing these previously withheld records, NJIT abandoned any reliance on the OPRA exemptions it had formerly asserted. There is no indication in the record that NJIT would have produced the previously withheld documents absent Golden and Locke's lawsuit.

NJIT did not err by advising the FBI that its interests may be affected by production of the documents or by seeking the FBI's position as to whether disclosure would be proper. Where NJIT went astray was in failing to exercise independent judgment and, instead, unquestioningly obeying the FBI's orders to withhold the records. NJIT is responsible for that choice and must bear the consequences, i.e., paying attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In a final attempt to avoid liability, NJIT argues that the New Jersey Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   imposed a requirement of reasonableness on parties in an OPRA dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3916374\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/196/51/\">\n    951 A.2d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to NJIT, its own actions were eminently reasonable, thus immunizing it from any obligation to pay attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   NJIT's proffered interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive. There, the Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that OPRA includes a rebuttable presumption that attorneys' fees are warranted whenever a defendant discloses a record post-lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1032-33. The Court instead adopted the catalyst theory-that a requestor is entitled to attorneys' fees only if he can demonstrate \"a factual causal nexus between [the] litigation and the relief ultimately achieved,\" and \"that the relief ultimately secured ... had a basis in law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1032. The Supreme Court explained: \"[t]rial courts would conduct that fact-sensitive inquiry on a case-by-case basis, evaluating the reasonableness of, and motivations for, an agency's decisions, and viewing each matter on its merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1033.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Supreme Court's reference to \"reasonableness\" in\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   is best read in light of its facts. There, the agency had attempted to work with the requestor to produce records well before the requestor filed suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1021-22. In the midst of attempting to fulfill the plaintiff's record request, the records custodian was also caring for his critically ill mother, who died the day before the requestor filed suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In assessing whether attorneys' fees were warranted, the Supreme Court focused on the reasonableness of the agency's efforts to produce records to the requestor: the agency's immediate response that certain records were temporarily unavailable, the illness and death of the records custodian's mother, and the agency's production of some records around the time the requestor filed suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1034. \"Because [the agency] had agreed to plaintiff's request before she even filed suit, she cannot establish that her lawsuit entitles her to fees under the catalyst theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1034-35 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spectraserv, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3909646\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/416/565/\">\n    7 A.3d at 239, 241-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ruling that the agency's actions were reasonable-and that attorneys' fees were thus unwarranted-due in part to the agency's pre-suit attempts to accommodate the requestor's demands). We thus conclude that the \"reasonableness\" language in\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   refers to the reasonableness of an agency's efforts to comply with a document request before a lawsuit is filed-not\n   whether the proffered basis for denying access is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047\">\n    N.J.
