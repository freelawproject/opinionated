At sentencing, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   concluded that Clark was subject to an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because his prior Missouri convictions for first-degree robbery, second-degree robbery, and second-degree assault all qualified as \"violent felon[ies]\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). Based on a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of V, the United States Sentencing Guidelines (2016) range of imprisonment was 210 to 262 months. The district court varied below the advisory range and sentenced Clark to the ACCA statutory minimum of 180 months' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Clark challenges the district court's application of the ACCA, arguing only that his 2001 conviction for second-degree robbery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20569.030.1\">\n    Mo.

He acknowledges that our court, sitting en banc, previously held otherwise in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the contrary, it reaffirmed our reasoning that Missouri second-degree robbery-as the statute existed at the time of Clark's conviction-satisfies the force clause of the ACCA because it \"requires the use of force capable of preventing or overcoming resistence\"; mere snatching of property does not suffice.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p671\">\n    886 F.3d at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up) (so reasoning),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    139 S. Ct. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that robbery qualifies as a violent felony under the force clause where the offense requires the perpetrator to \"overcome the victim's resistance,\" but not where there is mere snatching of property);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dembry v.

Accordingly, the district court did not err in classifying Clark's second-degree robbery conviction as a violent felony, and we affirm his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The Honorable John A.
