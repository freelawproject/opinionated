Instead, in conclusory fashion, the district court stated that nationwide relief is warranted simply because district courts have the authority to impose such relief in some cases and because such relief has been applied in the immigration context. The district court clearly erred by failing to consider whether nationwide relief is necessary to remedy Plaintiffs' alleged harms.

Indeed, were we to adopt the dissent's view, a nationwide injunction would result any time an enjoined action has potential nationwide effects. Such an approach would turn broad injunctions into the rule rather than the exception.

Based on the briefing and limited record before us, and absent an explanation by the district court as to why a nationwide injunction is necessary to remedy Plaintiffs' alleged harm in this case, we must grant the motion for stay pending appeal insofar as the injunction applies outside the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Our dissenting colleague also argues that it is \"perplexing\" that the government's failure to demonstrate a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits \"does not ... require that a stay of the nationwide aspect of the injunction [ ] be denied.\" That contention misses the mark, however, by conflating the merits of the government's position with district court's authority to issue a nationwide injunction. Whether Appellants have made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits entitling them to a stay of the preliminary injunction is a separate question from whether the scope of the injunction is appropriate.

As we explain above, our law requires that injunctive relief be narrowly tailored to remedy the plaintiffs' alleged harm, and it may only be broadened \"if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    are entitled.\"\n    <em>\n     Bresgal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548583\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/1163/#p1170\">\n     843 F.2d at 1170-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-20\">\n   TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I concur in the portion of the order denying the motion for stay pending appeal [Dkt. 3] insofar as the injunction applies within the Ninth Circuit, but dissent from the balance of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Acting as a motions panel, all we have before us is the government's motion for a stay. I do not believe that it is within a motions panel's province to parse the record for error at this stage, which is what the majority does in concluding that \"the nationwide scope of the injunction is not supported by the record as it stands.\" (Citation omitted.) But the majority then goes beyond the recognized authority of a motions panel by concluding that \"[t]he district court clearly erred by failing to consider whether nationwide relief is necessary to remedy Plaintiffs' alleged harms,\" and, on that basis \"grant[s] the motion for stay pending appeal insofar as the injunction applies outside the Ninth Circuit.\" It then, in the penultimate paragraph of the Order, in effect, remands the case to the district court for a partial do-over:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   While this appeal proceeds, the district court retains jurisdiction to further develop the record in support of a preliminary injunction extending beyond the Ninth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But vacating and remanding it to the district court for a more searching inquiry into whether this case justifies the breadth of the injunction is indubitably an action within the province of a merits panel-not a motions panel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the same time, the order places the merits briefing (of this appeal) on an expedited schedule for placement \"on a December 2019 argument calendar.\" What issues are the parties expected to brief, assuming that parallel proceedings in the district court are still ongoing? And if the district court completes its second-look remand proceedings within the next few weeks or months and issues a modified injunction, or issues the same nationwide injunction,\n   but one which is supported by supplemental findings of fact, should the parties seek to file supplemental briefs on the newly-raised and newly-decided issues in this appeal to the merits panel assigned to this appeal, or should a new notice of appeal be filed, giving rise to a new appeal? These are some of the new and difficult questions raised by the majority's split-decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While time does not permit a full exploration of the merits of the \"nationwide\" issue, some problems posed by the majority's Ninth Circuit-only injunction are apparent. Perhaps, the district court did not make detailed findings in support of a nationwide injunction because the need for one in the circumstances of this case is obvious. For starters, the joint interim final rule, \"Asylum Eligibility and Procedural Modifications,\" will affect asylum applications across the breadth of the southern border. Should asylum law be administered differently in Texas than in California? These issues and problems illustrate why tinkering with the merits on a limited stay motion record can be risky. And it is why such issues are reserved for the more deliberate examination that a merits panel can give them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There is also a glaring inconsistency-a contradiction-in the majority's split-the-baby approach.
