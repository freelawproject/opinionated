However, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), the statutory maximum sentence is 30 years for each count, or 60 for both.

In the plea agreement, Williams waived his right \"to appeal any non-jurisdictional issues\" with these exceptions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties agree that excluded from this waiver is the Defendant's right to appeal any decision by the Court to depart upward pursuant to the sentencing guidelines as well as the length of his sentence for a determination of its substantive reasonableness should the Court impose an upward departure or an upward variance pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Defendant understands he may not appeal a sentence up to and including his 30 year recommendation as set forth in paragraph G, even if that sentence is reached via upward departure or variance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plea agreement thus prohibits Williams from appealing a sentence \"up to and including his 30 year recommendation.\" This could be interpreted to mean that Williams may appeal a total sentence longer than 30 years. In this case-where 30 years was the mandatory minimum for both counts combined (15 years each), and also the statutory maximum on each count individually-the waiver's reference to \"30 year recommendation\" is unclear and ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Reviewing the waiver, the magistrate judge explained that Williams could appeal \"if there's an upward departure that goes above and beyond the 30 years\" or \"if an upward departure variance would place you above the 30-year mandatory minimum and you receive a sentence as such.\" The government admits this explanation \"lacked optimal clarity.\" This court agrees. The explanation does not clarify the ambiguous language of the written agreement, and it does not ensure that Williams understood the scope of the waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For sentencing on multiple counts of conviction, the Guidelines state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) For all counts not covered by subsection (a), the court shall determine the total punishment and shall impose that total punishment on each such count, except to the extent otherwise required by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (d) If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.

Imposing the sentence, it discussed the \"seriousness of the offense,\" the need to \"send a message to the larger community\" that \"the violation of children by felonious sexual behavior will not be tolerated,\" and the \"protection of society.\" A sentencing court need not provide \"a separate statement of reasons\" for imposing consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It calculated the Guidelines range and considered the parties' arguments before overruling Williams' objections to two enhancements. In addition to discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court described Williams' conduct as \"among the most serious offenses we have had\" and noted there was \"nothing mitigating about your criminal behavior here.\" \"Where the district court in imposing a sentence makes 'an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,' addressing the defendant's proffered information in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such sentence is not unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court addressed and distinguished the cases Williams cites. It stated that it considered a number of 30-year sentences for sexual crimes against children and determined each case had factors that were \"lesser or different than the factors in this case.\" The court continued, \"I've analyzed it, looked at other cases I have sentenced in, looked across the nation; the guideline range is what anyone could expect to receive in the United States District Court for crimes that you have committed against these children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   * * * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Honorable Jeffrey L.
