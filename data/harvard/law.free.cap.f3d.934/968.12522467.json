The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the Dancers did not prove at the outset of the case that they were employees rather than independent contractors. As we explain below, the district court erred in reaching that decision. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellants Josephine Tijerino, Tamicka Toliver, and Jane Roe Dancer (collectively, the \"Dancers\") all worked as exotic dancers at L\u00e9 Girls Gentlemen's Club, a strip club in Phoenix, Arizona. The club is owned and operated by Defendants-Appellees Stetson Desert Project, LLC, dba L\u00e9 Girls Cabaret, Cory Anderson, and Cary Anderson (collectively, the \"Club\"). Initially, each dancer filed a separate complaint against the Club alleging violations of employment law. The Dancers all allege that the Club failed to pay them any wages in violation of the FLSA and willfully failed to pay them at the rate of Arizona's minimum wage in violation of the Arizona Minimum Wage Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2023-363\">\n    Ariz.

She filed a motion to consolidate the Dancers' cases, which the district court granted. She also filed a motion for conditional certification and to authorize notice to putative class members, and she included a declaration in which she provided information suggesting that the exotic dancers who worked at the Club were similarly situated for purposes of the FLSA. Shortly after the cases were consolidated, the parties submitted a proposed joint case management order in which they agreed that \"[t]he basis for the court's subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims is the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court denied the Dancers' motion to conditionally certify an opt-in class and dismissed the case with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. First, in denying the motion to conditionally certify a FLSA opt-in class, the district court called such a motion \"premature.\" It\n   held that Jane Roe \"must satisfy her initial burden of alleging specific facts that permit an inference that she is an 'employee' (and the Defendants her 'employer') within the meaning of the FLSA.\" It also noted that the Dancers' status as employees or independent contractors of the Club was \"unsettled,\" and ordered the Dancers to file a brief \"on whether Plaintiff and her putative class are employees within the meaning of FLSA under the economic realities test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court next denied the Dancers' renewed motion for conditional class certification and held that the Dancers were independent contractors, not employees. It held that \u00a7 216(b) 's requirement that\n   <em>\n    employees\n   </em>\n   bring actions under the statute constituted an \"antecedent issue\" of jurisdiction and thus that, if the Dancers were not employees under the FLSA, there could be no violation of the FLSA and therefore no federal question jurisdiction. The district court proceeded to evaluate the Dancers' employment status under the FLSA's economic realities test and declared them to be independent contractors. It then denied the Dancers' motion to conditionally certify a FLSA opt-in class based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, the district court dismissed all three plaintiffs' cases with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court \"reiterate[d] its position that employee status under the FLSA is an antecedent jurisdictional issue,\" and that plaintiffs had not \"come forward with any evidence from which the Court could find a reasonable indicia of employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Dancers appeal from the final judgment, the order dismissing the cases with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the order denying their renewed motion for conditional certification of an FLSA opt-in class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    APPELLATE JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We have appellate jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But if the employment status provision is an essential ingredient related to the merits of a claim, then whether plaintiffs are employees should be decided at summary judgment or trial, assuming the complaint sufficiently alleges that plaintiffs are employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In determining whether a statutory provision constitutes a jurisdictional limitation or an \"essential ingredient\" of a claim, the Supreme Court has set forth a bright-line test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute's scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not left to wrestle with the issue.

Most importantly, Congress did not state that the statute's employment status provision was jurisdictional, and \u00a7 203(e) and \u00a7 216(b) are not located in jurisdiction-granting provisions of the statute. Finally, courts have not historically treated the employment status provision as jurisdictional.

Moreover, the Dancers allege numerous facts supporting their claims that the Club owes them wages because they are employees under the FLSA, and relatedly, under Arizona state law.

First, they ask us to remand with instructions to grant the Dancers' motion for conditional class certification under the FLSA. The district court did not reach a merits-based analysis of conditional certification because it erroneously determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. Our holding that employee status under the FLSA is nonjurisdictional necessarily reverses the reasoning of the district court's denial of conditional certification. On remand, the district court will have the opportunity to determine whether to conditionally certify an FLSA collective action in accordance with our precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518509\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1090/#p1100\">\n    903 F.3d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (9th Cir. 2018) (discussing the \"near-universal practice\" of the two-step approach to conditional certification under \u00a7 216(b) ). We deny the Dancers' request to remand with specific instructions to grant the Dancers' motion for conditional certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, the Dancers ask us to remand with instructions \"to adjudicate the merits of the Dancers' claims in accordance with well-established case law applying the FLSA's economic realities test.\" The district court applied the economic realities test in reaching its conclusion that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Because we reverse the district court's conclusion that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, on remand, it will have the opportunity to address the economic realities test when it addresses the merits of the Dancers' FLSA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Real v.
