We hold that the individual plaintiffs, but not the Tribe, can challenge the citations under \u00a7 1983. And, we conclude that all the citations occurred within Indian country. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment dismissing the complaint as to the individuals but affirm the judgment as to the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Chelsea Lynn Bunim, Jasmine Sansoucie, Tommie Robert Ochoa, and Naomi\n   Lopez are enrolled members of the Chemehuevi Tribe. Each was stopped and cited by a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Deputy for violating a California regulatory traffic law. Deputy Sheriff Ronald Sindelar stopped and cited Bunim on Section 36 for driving without a valid registration. Sindelar impounded Bunim's car, leaving her alone on the roadside. Deputy Sindelar also stopped Sansoucie on Section 36, citing her for driving with a suspended license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Deputy Sindelar cited Ochoa for driving without a valid registration and failing to provide evidence of financial responsibility. Sindelar had Ochoa's car towed, leaving him alone on the roadside. Deputy Sheriff J. Wagner cited Lopez for driving without a valid registration. Both of these citations were issued at locations that the parties agree are inside the boundaries of the Chemehuevi Reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bunim, Sansoucie, Ochoa, Lopez, and the Tribe sued the Sheriff and the Deputies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violations of various federal statutory and constitutional rights. The complaint sought monetary damages, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief. The defendants argued that none of the plaintiffs' claims was cognizable under \u00a7 1983. In addition, in response to the claims raised by Bunim and Sansoucie, the defendants argued that Section 36 was outside the Reservation boundaries, and therefore within the County's regulatory jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court initially entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from \"citing, arresting, impounding the vehicles of, and prosecuting Chemehuevi tribal members for on-reservation violations\" of California regulatory vehicle laws, including violations occurring on Section 36. The court determined there were \"at least serious questions going to the merits\" of whether Section 36 was \"Indian country.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But, the court later granted summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that Section 36 was not part of the Chemehuevi Reservation and therefore not Indian country under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In a motion to amend the judgment, Ochoa and Lopez noted that they were not ticketed in Section 36. The district court denied the motion, holding that even if the plaintiffs were cited on the Reservation, they failed to allege \"a well-established constitutional violation for purposes of their section 1983 claim.\" The court reasoned that \u00a7 1983 \"is concerned with the relationship between individuals and the state, not the distribution of power between state, federal, or tribal governments,\" and therefore neither the \"right to be free of state regulation\" nor \"the right to tribal government\" is \"within the scope of section 1983.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Tribe and the individual plaintiffs timely appealed.

Kelsey was then dispatched to visit the Chemehuevi Tribe and identify territory for a reservation. In 1907, Kelsey issued a report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, identifying land to be included in the reservation. He specifically recommended that the reservation include the eastern half of Township 5 North, Range 24 East (\"E. 1/2 of T. 5 N., R. 24 E.\")-which contains Section 36. Kelsey noted that this land was the \"present location\" of the tribal members and that \"there is no question but they have occupied this land since primeval times.\" The Commissioner forwarded Kelsey's recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In an executive order (the \"1907 Order\"), the Secretary then \"direct[ed] that the lands referred to\" by Kelsey and the Commissioner \"be withdrawn from all form of settlement,\" and created the Chemehuevi Reservation.

The factual premise of that argument, however, is subject to question. The 1853 Act excluded any land \"in the occupation or possession of any Indian tribe,\" 10 Stat. at 246-47, and the Kelsey survey, adopted by the Secretary, documents that Section 36 falls in that exception. The district court erred in excluding the Kelsey report as hearsay. It is plainly admissible as an ancient document, Fed. R.

Given the language of the 1853 Act, the Kelsey report identifying Section 36 as land occupied historically by Indians, and the express inclusion of Section 36 in the 1907 Order, the Chemehuevi Tribe (and indeed, the Secretary of the Interior) surely understood Section 36 to be within the Reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nor can we conclude that the boundaries of the Reservation as established in the 1907 Order were later diminished. \"We do not lightly infer diminishment of reservations.\"\n   <em>\n    Confederated Tribes of Chehalis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649382\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/96/334/#p340\">\n    96 F.3d at 343-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More importantly, because the 2010 patent was issued over a century after the Reservation was established, it provides no evidence of the intent of the Executive or the understanding of the Tribe in 1907.

Nor can the Tribe assert its members' individual rights as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   in a \u00a7 1983 action. To assert\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing, the Tribe would have to \"articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties,\" i.e., \"be more than a nominal party,\" and \"express a quasi-sovereign interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Missouri ex rel.

Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Chemehuevi Reservation, as established by the 1907 Order, includes Section 36. Section 36 is therefore Indian country, and San Bernardino County does not have jurisdiction to enforce California regulatory laws within it. The individual plaintiffs\n   may bring \u00a7 1983 claims against the defendants. The Tribe, however, cannot assert its sovereign rights under that statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.
