The answer, based on the plain language of \u00a7 1228, is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner Baldemar Zuniga contends that in his hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") to review a negative reasonable fear determination made by an asylum officer, the IJ denied him his right to counsel. Because we conclude that Zuniga had a statutory right to counsel, that the colloquy at the beginning of the hearing before the IJ was inadequate to waive that right, and that no showing of prejudice is required, we reverse and remand for further proceedings in which Zuniga is given the opportunity to proceed with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Baldemar Zuniga is a Mexican national who illegally entered the United States as a child. In 2012, he was convicted of participating in a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute drugs and launder money. Zuniga testified in open court against two of his co-conspirators, who were part of Mexico's notorious Knights Templar cartel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While he was in prison, immigration authorities served Zuniga with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Removal Order. Because he had been convicted of a drug trafficking aggravated felony, Zuniga was placed in expedited removal proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). During an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), he expressed a fear that, if removed to Mexico, he would face torture or persecution by the cartel as retribution for his testimony. He was then referred to an asylum officer for an interview to evaluate whether his fear was \"reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the beginning of the reasonable fear interview, the asylum officer explained that Zuniga had \"the right to have [his] attorney present for the interview.\" Zuniga stated that he had an attorney helping with his reasonable fear case but that he was willing to continue with the reasonable fear interview without his attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The asylum officer then proceeded with the interview questions and concluded that Zuniga had not established a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Zuniga requested review of the asylum officer's negative reasonable fear determination by an Immigration Judge. Zuniga's case was referred to the Immigration\n   Court in San Francisco, California. The notice of referral to the IJ included the following language: \"You may be represented in this proceeding, at no expense to the government, by an attorney or other individual authorized and qualified to represent persons before an Immigration Court. If you wish to be so represented, your attorney or representative should appear with you at this hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Zuniga appeared at the hearing by video conference from a detention center in Mesa Verde, California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the outset of the hearing, when announcing the case number and who was participating, the IJ stated that Zuniga did \"not have a lawyer.\" Shortly thereafter, the IJ engaged in the following colloquy with Zuniga:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   JUDGE: In these proceedings you have the right to counsel of your own choosing, but the government will not pay for your attorney. You should have received a copy of the free legal service list. Did you get that list?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ZUNIGA: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   JUDGE: So, sir, do you have a lawyer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ZUNIGA: I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   JUDGE: All right, sir, were you interviewed by an asylum officer regarding your fear of returning to Mexico?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The IJ then proceeded with the substance of the hearing. The IJ ultimately agreed with the asylum officer that Zuniga lacked \"a reasonable fear of persecution on account of a ground protected by the law[s] of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Zuniga petitioned our court for review of that decision, arguing that his due process rights were violated by the use of the video conference in his reasonable fear review hearing before the IJ and by the IJ's failure to obtain a proper waiver of his right to an attorney in that proceeding. He also argued that the IJ erred in determining that he lacked a reasonable fear of persecution on a protected ground and in evaluating his fear of torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review de novo due process challenges to reasonable fear proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Colmenar v.

The Government does not contest that, if Zuniga had a right to counsel, there was no adequate waiver here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Government rests its defense to this petition primarily on the argument that there is no statutory right to counsel in reasonable\n   fear proceedings.

Other subsections of \u00a7 1228 reinforce the right to counsel.

Because the text of \u00a7 1228 is both \"clear and consistent with the statutory scheme at issue, the plain language of the statute is conclusive\" in providing a statutory right to counsel.\n   <em>\n    Emmert Indus.

Since there is no specific regulatory guidance on this point, the issue is left to the discretion of the Immigration Judge.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government is correct that the regulations specify only that non-citizens may be represented by counsel in the initial reasonable fear interview before an asylum officer, and that they are silent as to representation by counsel in the review hearing before the IJ.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).
