Wyatt Decker, Lois Krahn, Terrence Trentman, William Stone, and David Rosenfeld, and Operations Administrator Roshanak Didehban. In anticipation of trial, the parties submitted joint proposed jury instructions. The parties disagreed whether Murray's ADA discrimination claim should be tried under a but-for causation standard or a motivating factor causation standard. Murray argued that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Head\n   </em>\n   required him to show only that the defendants' belief that he had a disability was a motivating factor in their adverse employment decision. He accordingly requested the following instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   As to Dr. Murray's claim that his disability was the reason for Mayo Clinic Arizona's decision to discharge him, Dr. Murray has the burden of proving the following evidence by a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Dr. Murray was discharged because Defendants regarded him as disabled, which means that Defendants' belief that\n   Plaintiff had a disability was a motivating factor in Defendants' decision to terminate him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court instead instructed the jury to apply a but-for causation standard to Murray's ADA claim. The instruction provided that Murray must prove he was discharged\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his disability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As to Dr. Murray's claim that his disability was the reason for Mayo Clinic Arizona's decision to discharge him, Dr. Murray has the burden of proving the following evidence by a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3.
