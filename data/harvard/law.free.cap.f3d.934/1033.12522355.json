We affirm Begay's conviction for second-degree murder.

Begay was charged with second-degree murder and discharging a firearm during a \"crime of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a few hours of drinking and smoking methamphetamine, Begay, Ben, Begay's nephew Lionel Begay, and Begay's girlfriend Meghan Williams were sitting inside a van parked in front of Begay's parents' residence in Tuba City, Arizona, located within the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation. While sitting inside the van, Williams and Begay were arguing about Williams' alleged infidelity, including Begay's accusations that she had been cheating on him with Ben. Begay stated he was tired of people thinking that he was a \"bitch\" because of Williams cheating on him. During the argument, Begay pulled out a gun and laid it on his leg. Ben saw the gun and told Begay not to shoot the windows of the van. Begay continued to argue with Williams, stating that he was not going to be a \"bitch\" anymore and that he was not scared to go to prison for life. Begay then shot Ben in the head once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, Begay's theory of defense was that someone else in the car had shot Ben. In closing argument, Begay's attorney briefly argued that Begay lacked the requisite malice because he did not act deliberately. During closing argument, the government argued that Begay intentionally shot Ben because he was angry about Williams' alleged infidelity with Ben. Begay and the government submitted joint jury instructions, requesting an instruction on second-degree murder only. Begay's attorney did not request a voluntary or involuntary manslaughter instruction, nor did he object to the instructions as presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury, instructed to find second-degree murder to be a \"crime of violence,\" convicted Begay of second-degree murder (Count One) and discharging a firearm during a \"crime of violence\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(iii) (Count Two). The district court sentenced Begay to 204 months' imprisonment on Count One and a consecutive term of 120 months' imprisonment on Count Two. The district court imposed mandatory restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A in the amount of $23,622. Begay appeals his conviction on both counts as well as the restitution order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An \"Indian\" who commits murder in \"Indian country\" is subject to applicable federal criminal laws.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

At trial, Begay's attorney did not request a voluntary manslaughter instruction, object to the absence of such an instruction, or introduce evidence of sudden quarrel or heat of passion at trial. Begay's theory of defense was that he did not kill the victim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The argument Begay's attorney made regarding malice centered on Begay's lack of deliberation, arguing \"to deliberate and to intend to do something is not to simply be high and pull the trigger.\" Begay's attorney did not argue that Begay lacked malice because he shot Ben in heat of passion or because he was provoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757458\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/1145/#p1153\">\n    201 F.3d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A failure to give a jury instruction, even if error, does not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings if the defense at trial made no argument relevant to the omitted instruction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although the government introduced evidence at trial that Begay may have been angry at the time of the shooting and discussed Begay's anger during closing argument, the evidence, arguments, and jury instructions taken as a whole did not \"properly present\" the issue of heat of passion or provocation to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Based on the facts of this case, it may be hard to understand how the shooting of Ben by Begay might not be a \"crime of violence.\" Under the categorical approach, however, we do not look to the facts underlying the conviction, but \"compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant's conviction with the elements of\" a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.

Thereafter, in\n   <em>\n    Leocal v.
