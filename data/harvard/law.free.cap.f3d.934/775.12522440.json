Forrest contends, however, that once\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   eliminates his Kansas attempted burglary conviction as a violent felony, he is entitled to a \"recount\" of his other convictions under current law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Forrest also suggests that because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   provides \"an avenue of relief that was not previously available,\"-that is, a means to avoid counting any of the convictions under the residual clause-Forrest for the first time has reason to dispute that his convictions count under the force clause or the enumerated offenses clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoner v.

Mo. June 12, 2017). Because his motion \"uses\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to eliminate counting convictions under the residual clause, he intimates that the motion \"relies on\" a new rule of constitutional law and satisfies the requirements for a successive motion under \u00a7 2255(h)(2).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Forrest asserts that once he relies on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to file a successive motion, he may rely on the non-retroactive decisions in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   to avoid counting his prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We reject these contentions because Forrest's motion does not \"rely on\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   in the relevant sense.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not establish that he is entitled to relief, because that intervening decision does not undermine our conclusion on direct appeal that three of Forrest's prior convictions qualified as violent felonies under the force clause or the enumerated offenses clause. That\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   might have eliminated a fourth conviction, or an unnecessary alternative ground for counting the three qualifying convictions, does not entitle Forrest to pursue a successive motion. Without a showing that the retroactive decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   justifies relief, Forrest cannot challenge his sentence based on intervening decisions with no retroactive effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325907\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1014/#p1016\">\n    826 F.3d at 1016-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the district court observed, Forrest's approach would also be unjust: an offender with three non-residual clause convictions could not satisfy the prerequisites for filing a successive motion, while an offender who had sustained the same three convictions plus another conviction that qualified under the residual clause would be entitled to a \"recount.\" The statute does not countenance that sort of disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The concurring opinion would avoid the disparate treatment by allowing virtually every armed career criminal to proceed with a successive motion, whether or not\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   would justify relief. So long as a defendant had sustained\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prior conviction that counted under the residual clause at the time of sentencing, even if the residual clause was immaterial to the sentence, the concurrence would allow relief and resentencing under current law. In our view, this is simply a backdoor means of applying nonretroactive decisions like\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   retroactively, and we do not approve it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   KELLY, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under \u00a7 2255(h)(2), a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must \"contain ... a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" In my view, Forrest's motion\n   meets this requirement because it contains a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. But under our circuit's case law, \"[a] 2255 movant bringing a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim must 'show by a preponderance of the evidence that the residual clause led the sentencing court to apply the ACCA enhancement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Golinveaux v.

It is undisputed that under current law, Forrest does not qualify for an ACCA enhancement. Yet he will be required to serve five years more than the statutory maximum sentence for his offense as the result of the ACCA enhancement because the original application of the enhancement might have resulted from not one mistake, but two: first, application of the residual clause, which the Supreme Court later struck from the statute as unconstitutional; and second, application of our circuit's case law on the modified categorical approach, which the Supreme Court later explained was erroneous and had been for some time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.

I would not penalize Forrest with five years' imprisonment because of our error while similarly situated \u00a7 2255 movants in other circuits obtain relief, just as I would not \"penalize a movant for a district court's discretionary choice not to specify under which clause of Section 924(e)(2)(B) an offense qualified as a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518150\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1012/#p1015\">\n    900 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (cleaned up).

I do not read\n    <em>\n     Donnell\n    </em>\n    to stand for this proposition.\n    <em>\n     Donnell\n    </em>\n    concerned a \u00a7 2255 motion seeking to extend\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    to invalidate the residual clause of the career offender sentencing guideline.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Donnell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325907\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1014/#p1016\">\n     826 F.3d at 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This court refused to authorize the motion, holding that \u00a7 2255(h)(2) requires a second or successive motion to \"contain[ ] a new rule that recognizes the right asserted in the motion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325907\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1014/#p1016\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1016 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518150\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1012/#p1015\">\n     900 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1014 n.2. We explained that the motion before us did not satisfy this standard because it \"cite[d] a new rule that merely serves as a predicate for urging adoption of another new rule,\" and therefore the new rule-\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    -was not \"sufficient to justify a grant of relief.\"\n    <em>\n     Donnell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325907\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1014/#p1016\">\n     826 F.3d at 1017\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Forrest, in contrast, does not ask us to extend\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    or any other rule. The government concedes that under\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , one of Forrest's prior convictions no longer qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. There is no question that\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    \"recognizes the right asserted\" in Forrest's motion. Therefore, I do not join in the court's reasoning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Contrary to the court's characterization, I do not read \u00a7 2255 to \"allow relief and resentencing\" whenever a defendant identifies a \"prior conviction that counted under the residual clause at the time of sentencing.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    at 778. Rather, I read \u00a7 2255 as allowing the court to\n    <em>\n     consider the merits of the motion\n    </em>\n    when \"the movant has shown that his sentence may have relied on the residual clause, and the government is unable to demonstrate to the contrary.\"\n    <em>\n     Walker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518150\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1012/#p1015\">\n     900 F.3d at 1016\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
