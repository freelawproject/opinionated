Dorman participated in a defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan through his employment with Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. (\"Schwab\"). In 2017, Dorman filed a class action suit in district court alleging that Defendants violated ERISA and breached their fiduciary duties by including Schwab-affiliated investment funds in the Plan-despite the funds' poor performance-to generate fees for Schwab and its affiliates. Defendants moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement in the Plan. The district court denied the motion, and this interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Defendants contend that the district court erred by not enforcing the Plan's arbitration agreement. We address these arguments in a concurrently filed memorandum disposition. But before we can reach the parties' specific contentions, we must first address the threshold question of whether ERISA claims can be subject to mandatory arbitration. In so doing, we must revisit our holding in\n   <em>\n    Amaro v. Continental Can Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1920204\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/724/747/\">\n    724 F.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1984), in which we held that ERISA claims were not arbitrable. In light of intervening Supreme Court case law, including\n   <em>\n    American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    570 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), we conclude that our holding in\n   <em>\n    Amaro\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Michael Dorman was employed at Schwab from February 17, 2009, until October 8, 2015. Through his employment, Dorman joined the Plan in 2009, and he voluntarily contributed to his retirement account through payroll deductions until he left his employment with Schwab. Dorman withdrew his full account balance on December 18, 2015, and ceased participating in the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan, Plan participants are given the choice to allocate their earnings among a menu of investment funds, and they may alter their investment allocations at any time. During the relevant period, the Plan offered as many as 17 different funds in which participants could choose to invest, including both Schwab-affiliated and unaffiliated funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2014, the Plan was amended to add an arbitration provision. That provision took effect on January 1, 2015, nine months before Dorman ended his employment at Schwab and nearly a year before he terminated his participation in the Plan. The Plan document states that \"[a]ny claim, dispute or breach arising out of or in any way related to the Plan shall be settled by binding arbitration ....\" The arbitration provision includes a waiver of class or collective action that requires individual arbitrations, even if absent the waiver Dorman could have represented the interests of other Plan participants. It states that any arbitration would be conducted \"on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective or representative basis,\" and that Plan participants waive the right to be part of any class action. If that waiver of collective action were to be held unenforceable, the arbitration provision\n   mandates that \"any claim on a class, collective or representative basis shall be filed and adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction, and not in arbitration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2014, Dorman was promoted to financial consultant, and he enrolled in the Schwab Investor Financial Consultant Compensation Plan (the \"Compensation Plan\"). By enrolling in the Compensation Plan, Dorman agreed to arbitrate \"[a]ny controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to [his] employment ....\" By its terms, the arbitration provision encompassed claims that arise out of \"federal, state, or local law.\" The arbitration agreement carved out \"claims for benefits\" under the Plan and provided that such \"claims for benefits\" would be resolved pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the Plan. The Compensation Plan further contains a \"Class Action Waiver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2017, Dorman filed his First Amended Class Action Complaint against Defendants, asserting claims under \u00a7 502(a)(2) and (3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (3), and seeking plan-wide relief on behalf of a class comprising all participants in, and beneficiaries of, the Plan at any time within six years of the filing of the Complaint. The Complaint alleges that various Defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence and violated ERISA's prohibited transaction rules by selecting for inclusion in the Plan investment funds that are affiliated with Schwab. According to the Complaint, the Schwab-affiliated funds performed poorly but were kept in the Plan solely to generate fees for Schwab and its affiliates. The Complaint also alleges that members of the Board of Directors of Charles Schwab &amp; Co. breached their duty to monitor the Plan fiduciaries who selected the investment funds for inclusion in the Plan. The Complaint further asserts claims for co-fiduciary breach and knowing participation in a breach against various Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the Complaint, Defendants moved to compel individual arbitration of the asserted claims pursuant to the arbitration agreements in the Plan and the Compensation Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 18, 2018, the district court denied Defendants' motion, holding that neither agreement required the claims asserted in the Complaint to be arbitrated. In the district court's view, neither of the two arbitration provisions applied to the claims in the Complaint. The district court erroneously held that the arbitration provision in the Plan document was inapplicable because the provision was enacted after Dorman's participation in the Plan ended, and it thus did not bind him. With respect to the Compensation Plan's arbitration agreement, the district court concluded that \"it is not clear\" that the asserted ERISA claims arose out of Dorman's employment at Schwab as required by that agreement. It also held that the claims were \"claims for benefits\" that were expressly carved out of the arbitration agreement in the Compensation Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an alternative basis for denying Defendants' motion, the district court held that even if the claims asserted in the Complaint did fall within the scope of one or more of the arbitration agreements, the agreements would be unenforceable on two grounds. According to the district court, Dorman's claims were brought \"on behalf of the Plan\"-not on his own behalf-and without the Plan's consent he \"cannot waive rights that belong to the Plan, such as the right to file this action in court.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Bowles v. Reade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654146\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/752/#p760\">\n    198 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (9th Cir. 1999) ) (holding that a plan participant cannot settle an ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) claim without the plan's consent). The district court acknowledged that the Plan did consent to arbitration \"by virtue of its Plan\n   Document's arbitration provision,\" but it erroneously held that consent invalid because the Plan fiduciaries added the arbitration provision to the Plan document after they were sued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court cited\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Couturier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671813\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/1067/\">\n    572 F.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2009), which held that plan fiduciaries cannot insulate themselves from fiduciary responsibility by amending a plan document.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671813\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/1067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671813\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/1067/\">\n    at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the district court's view, allowing Plan fiduciaries to amend the Plan document to consent to arbitration would \"in a sense, be allowing the fox to guard the henhouse.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Munro v. Univ. of S. Cal.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 16-6191-VAP (CFEx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201654075\">\n    2017 WL 1654075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (C.D.
