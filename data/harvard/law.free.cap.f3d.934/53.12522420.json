Plaintiffs include the U.S. citizen victims, and relatives and representatives of the estates of those victims, of certain terrorist attacks committed by Hamas in Israel. They contend that Facebook unlawfully provided Hamas, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, with a communications platform that enabled those attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court granted Facebook's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the basis of Section 230(c)(1) immunity, an affirmative defense. After entering judgment without prejudice to moving to file an amended complaint, the district court denied with prejudice plaintiffs' motion to file a second amended complaint on the basis that the proposed complaint did not cure the deficiencies in the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly dismissed their claims because Section 230(c)(1) does not provide immunity to Facebook under the circumstances of their allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the district court properly applied Section 230(c)(1) to plaintiffs' federal claims.

The Attacks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist organization centered in Gaza. It has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. Since it was formed in 1987, Hamas has conducted thousands of terrorist attacks against civilians in Israel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint describes terrorist attacks by Hamas against five Americans in Israel between 2014 and 2016. Yaakov Naftali Fraenkel, a teenager, was kidnapped by a Hamas operative in 2014 while walking home from school in Gush Etzion, near Jerusalem, and then was shot to death. Chaya Zissel Braun, a 3-month-old baby, was killed at a train station in Jerusalem in 2014 when a Hamas operative drove a car into a crowd. Richard Lakin died after Hamas members shot and stabbed him in an attack on a bus in Jerusalem in 2015. Graduate student Taylor\n   Force was stabbed to death by a Hamas attacker while walking on the Jaffa boardwalk in Tel Aviv in 2016. Menachem Mendel Rivkin was stabbed in the neck in 2016 by a Hamas operative while walking to a restaurant in a town near Jerusalem. He suffered serious injuries but survived. Except for Rivkin, plaintiffs are the representatives of the estates of those who died in these attacks and family members of the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facebook's Alleged Role in the Attacks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. How Facebook Works\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Facebook operates an \"online social network platform and communications service[ ].\" App'x 230. Facebook users populate their own \"Facebook 'pages' \" with \"content,\" including personal identifying information and indications of their particular \"interests.\" App'x 250-51, 345. Organizations and other entities may also have Facebook pages. Users can post content on others' Facebook pages, reshare each other's content, and send messages to one another. The content can be text-based messages and statements, photos, web links, or other information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Facebook users must first register for a Facebook account, providing their names, telephone numbers, and email addresses. When registering, users do not specify the nature of the content they intend to publish on the platform, nor does Facebook screen new users based on its expectation of what content they will share with other Facebook users. There is no charge to prospective users for joining Facebook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Facebook does not preview or edit the content that its users post. Facebook's terms of service specify that a user \"own[s] all of the content and information [the user] post[s] on Facebook, and [the user] can control how it is shared through [the user's] privacy and application settings.\" App'x 252 (alterations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Facebook users may view each other's shared content simply by visiting other Facebook pages and profiles, Facebook also provides a personalized \"newsfeed\" page for each user. Facebook uses algorithms-\"a precisely defined set of mathematical or logical operations for the performance of a particular task,\"\n   <em>\n    Algorithm\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2012)-to determine the content to display to users on the newsfeed webpage. Newsfeed content is displayed within banners or modules and changes frequently. The newsfeed algorithms-developed by programmers employed by Facebook-automatically analyze Facebook users' prior behavior on the Facebook website to predict and display the content that is most likely to interest and engage those particular users. Other algorithms similarly use Facebook users' behavioral and demographic data to show those users third-party groups, products, services, and local events likely to be of interest to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Facebook's algorithms also provide \"friend suggestions,\" which, if accepted by the user, result in those users seeing each other's shared content. App'x 346-47. The friend-suggestion algorithms are based on such factors as the users' common membership in Facebook's online \"groups,\" geographic location, attendance at events, spoken language, and mutual friend connections on Facebook. App'x 346.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Facebook's advertising algorithms and \"remarketing\" technology also allow advertisers on Facebook to target specific ads to its users who are likely to be most interested\n   in them and thus to be most beneficial to those advertisers. App'x 347. Those advertisements are displayed on the users' pages and other Facebook webpages. A substantial portion of Facebook's revenues is from such advertisers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hamas's Use of Facebook\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Hamas used Facebook to post content that encouraged terrorist attacks in Israel during the time period of the attacks in this case. The attackers allegedly viewed that content on Facebook. The encouraging content ranged in specificity; for example, Fraenkel, although not a soldier, was kidnapped and murdered after Hamas members posted messages on Facebook that advocated the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. The attack that killed the Braun baby at the light rail station in Jerusalem came after Hamas posts encouraged car-ramming attacks at light rail stations. By contrast, the killer of Force is alleged to have been a Facebook user, but plaintiffs do not set forth what specific content encouraged his attack, other than that \"Hamas ... use[d] Facebook to promote terrorist stabbings.\" App'x 335.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hamas also used Facebook to celebrate these attacks and others, to transmit political messages, and to generally support further violence against Israel. The perpetrators were able to view this content because, although Facebook's terms and policies bar such use by Hamas and other designated foreign terrorist organizations, Facebook has allegedly failed to remove the \"openly maintained\" pages and associated content of certain Hamas leaders, spokesmen, and other members. App'x 229. It is also alleged that Facebook's algorithms directed such content to the personalized newsfeeds of the individuals who harmed the plaintiffs. Thus, plaintiffs claim, Facebook enables Hamas \"to disseminate its messages directly to its intended audiences,\" App'x 255, and to \"carry out the essential communication components of [its] terror attacks,\" App'x 256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

For example, terrorist photos or videos that users attempt to upload are matched against an inventory of known terrorist content. Facebook is also experimenting with artificial intelligence to block or remove \"text that might be advocating for terrorism.\" App'x 373. When Facebook detects terrorist-related content, it also uses artificial intelligence to identify similar, socially interconnected accounts, content, and pages that may themselves support terrorism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The General Counsel also testified that, for content that is not automatically detected, Facebook employs thousands of people who respond to user reports of inappropriate content and remove such\n   content.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Facebook also has a 150-person team of \"counterterrorism specialists,\" including academics, engineers, and former prosecutors and law enforcement officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The district court determined that it had personal jurisdiction over Facebook, a ruling that Facebook does not challenge on appeal.

Plaintiffs similarly contend that Facebook contributed to that content through its algorithms.

For example, plaintiffs allege that Facebook's \"newsfeed\" uses algorithms that predict and show the third-party content that is most likely to interest and engage users. Facebook's algorithms also provide \"friend suggestions,\" based on analysis of users' existing social connections on Facebook and other behavioral and demographic data. And, Facebook's advertising algorithms and \"remarketing\" technology allow advertisers to target ads to its users who are likely most interested in those ads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We disagree with plaintiffs' contention that Facebook's use of algorithms renders it a non-publisher. First, we find no basis in the ordinary meaning of \"publisher,\" the other text of Section 230, or decisions interpreting Section 230, for concluding that an interactive computer service is not the \"publisher\" of third-party information when it uses tools such as algorithms that are designed to match that information with a consumer's interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n    521 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that Matchmaker.com website, which \"provided neutral tools specifically designed to match romantic partners depending on their voluntary inputs,\" was immune under Section 230(c)(1) ) (citing\n   <em>\n    Carafano, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104618\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1119/#p1123\">\n    339 F.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Carafano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104618\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1119/#p1123\">\n    339 F.3d at 1124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Matchmaker's decision to structure the information provided by users allows the company to offer additional features, such as 'matching' profiles with similar characteristics ..., [and such features] [a]rguably promote[ ] the expressed Congressional policy 'to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services.'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\");\n   <em>\n    Herrick v.

Accepting plaintiffs' argument would eviscerate Section 230(c)(1) ; a defendant interactive computer service would be ineligible for Section 230(c)(1) immunity by virtue of simply organizing and displaying content exclusively provided by third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs' \"matchmaking\" argument would also deny immunity for the editorial decisions regarding third-party content that interactive computer services have made since the early days of the Internet. The services have always decided, for example, where on their sites (or other digital property) particular third-party content should reside and to whom it should be shown. Placing certain third-party content on a homepage, for example, tends to recommend that content to users more than if it were located elsewhere on a website. Internet services have also long been able to target the third-party content displayed to users based on, among other things, users' geolocation, language of choice, and\n   registration information. And, of course, the services must also decide what type and format of third-party content they will display, whether that be a chat forum for classic car lovers, a platform for blogging, a feed of recent articles from news sources frequently visited by the user, a map or directory of local businesses, or a dating service to find romantic partners. All of these decisions, like the decision to host third-party content in the first place, result in \"connections\" or \"matches\" of information and individuals, which would have not occurred but for the internet services' particular editorial choices regarding the display of third-party content. We, again, are unaware of case law denying Section 230(c)(1) immunity because of the \"matchmaking\" results of such editorial decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Seen in this context, plaintiffs' argument that Facebook's algorithms uniquely form \"connections\" or \"matchmake\" is wrong. That, again, has been a fundamental result of publishing third-party content on the Internet since its beginning. Like the decision to place third-party content on a homepage, for example, Facebook's algorithms might cause more such \"matches\" than other editorial decisions. But that is not a basis to exclude the use of algorithms from the scope of what it means to be a \"publisher\" under Section 230(c)(1). The matches also might-as compared to those resulting from other editorial decisions-present users with targeted content of even more interest to them, just as an English speaker, for example, may be best matched with English-language content. But it would turn Section 230(c)(1) upside down to hold that Congress intended that when publishers of third-party content become especially adept at performing the functions of publishers, they are no longer immunized from civil liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, plaintiffs argue, in effect, that Facebook's use of algorithms is outside the scope of publishing because the algorithms\n   <em>\n    automate\n   </em>\n   Facebook's editorial decision-making. That argument, too, fails because \"so long as a third party willingly provides the essential published content, the interactive service provider receives full immunity regardless of the specific edit[orial] or selection process.\"\n   <em>\n    Carafano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104618\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1119/#p1123\">\n    339 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1124 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall's Locksmith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521269\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/925/1263/#p1267\">\n    925 F.3d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"automated editorial act[s]\" are protected by Section 230 ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    O'Kroley v.

There, \"scam locksmiths\"-who were apparently actual locksmiths seeking to mislead consumers with lock emergencies into believing that they were closer in proximity to the emergency location than they actually were-allegedly provided Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!'s internet mapping services with false locations, some of which were exact street addresses and others which were \"less-exact,\" such as telephone area codes.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1265-70. The internet mapping services of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! translated this information into textual and pictorial \"pinpoints\" on maps that were displayed to the services' users.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1269. The D.C. Circuit concluded that this \"translation\" of the third-party information by the interactive computer services did not develop that information (or create new content) because the underlying \"information [was] entirely provided by the third party, and the choice of\n   <em>\n    presentation\n   </em>\n   \" fell within the interactive computer services' prerogative as publishers.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As to the \"less-exact\" location information, such as area codes, provided by the scam locksmiths, the plaintiffs also argued that the mapping services' algorithmic translation of this information into exact pinpoint map locations developed or created the misleading information.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1269-70. The D.C. Circuit also rejected that argument, holding that \"defendants' translation of [imprecise] third-party information into map pinpoints does not convert them into 'information content providers' because defendants use a neutral algorithm to make that translation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1270. In using the term \"neutral,\" the court observed that the algorithms were alleged to make no distinction between \"scam\" and other locksmiths and that the algorithms did not materially alter (i.e., they \"hew[ed] to\") the underlying information provided by the third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1270 n.5, 1270-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, plaintiffs' allegations about Facebook's conduct do not render it responsible for the Hamas-related content. As an initial matter, Facebook does not edit (or\n   suggest edits) for the content that its users-including Hamas-publish. That practice is consistent with Facebook's Terms of Service, which emphasize that a Facebook user \"own[s] all of the content and information [the user] post[s] on Facebook, and [the user] can control how it is shared through [the user's] privacy and application settings.\" App'x 252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nor does Facebook's acquiring certain information from users render it a developer for the purposes of Section 230. Facebook requires users to provide only basic identifying information: their names, telephone numbers, and email addresses. In so doing, Facebook acts as a \"neutral intermediary.\"\n   <em>\n    LeadClick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172540\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/158/#p173\">\n    838 F.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, plaintiffs concede in the pleadings that Facebook does not publish that information,\n   <em>\n    cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n    521 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and so such content plainly has no bearing on plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations likewise indicate that Facebook's algorithms are content \"neutral\" in the sense that the D.C. Circuit used that term in\n   <em>\n    Marshall's Locksmith\n   </em>\n   : The algorithms take the information provided by Facebook users and \"match\" it to other users-again, materially unaltered-based on objective factors applicable to any content, whether it concerns soccer, Picasso, or plumbers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Merely arranging and displaying others' content to users of Facebook through such algorithms-even if the content is not actively sought by those users-is not enough to hold Facebook responsible as the \"develop[er]\" or \"creat[or]\" of that content.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall's Locksmith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521269\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/925/1263/#p1267\">\n    925 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1269-71 ;\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n    521 F.3d at 1169-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. For one, they point to the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com\n   </em>\n   as holding that requiring or encouraging users to provide\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   particular information whatsoever to the interactive computer service transforms a defendant into a developer of that information. The\n   <em>\n    Roommates.Com\n   </em>\n   holding, however, was not so broad; it concluded only that the site's conduct in requiring users to select from \"a limited set of pre-populated answers\" to respond to particular \"discriminatory questions\" had a content-development effect that was actionable in the context of the Fair Housing Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n    521 F.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no comparable allegation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Facebook develops Hamas's content because Facebook's algorithms make that content more \"visible,\" \"available,\" and \"usable.\" Appellants' Br. at 45-46. But making information more available is, again, an essential part of traditional\n   <em>\n    publishing\n   </em>\n   ; it does not amount to \"developing\" that information within the meaning of Section 230. Similarly, plaintiffs assert that Facebook's algorithms suggest third-party content to users \"based on what Facebook believes will cause the user to use Facebook as much as possible\" and that Facebook intends to \"influence\" consumers' responses to that content. Appellants' Br. 48. This does not describe anything more than Facebook vigorously fulfilling its role as a publisher. Plaintiffs' suggestion that publishers must have no role in organizing or distributing third-party content in order to avoid \"develop[ing]\" that content is both ungrounded\n   in the text of Section 230 and contrary to its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, we note that plaintiffs also argue that Facebook should not be afforded Section 230 immunity because Facebook has chosen to undertake efforts to eliminate objectionable and dangerous content but has not been effective or consistent in those efforts. However, again, one of the purposes of Section 230 was to ensure that interactive computer services should not incur liability as developers or creators of third-party content merely because they undertake such efforts-even if they are not completely effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We therefore conclude from the allegations of plaintiffs' complaint that Facebook did not \"develop\" the content of the Facebook postings by Hamas and that Section 230(c)(1) applies to Facebook's alleged conduct in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Whether Applying Section 230(c)(1) to Plaintiffs' Claims Would Impair the Enforcement of a Federal Criminal Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Section 230(c)(1) may not be applied to their claims because that would impermissibly \"impair the enforcement\" of a \"Federal criminal statute.\" Appellant's Br. at 52 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) ).

Here, there is no irreconcilable conflict between the statutes. Section 230 provides an affirmative defense to liability under Section 2333 for only the narrow set of defendants and conduct to which Section 230 applies.

Indeed, it is unclear how an American court could apply such a provision \"extraterritorially.\" Even if it could be applied extraterritorially-say, by somehow treating the defendant's conduct rather than the lawsuit itself as the \"focus\" of a liability-limiting provision-the presumption against extraterritoriality primarily \"serves to avoid the international discord that can result when U.S. law is applied to conduct in foreign countries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2100. Allowing a plaintiff's claim to go forward because the cause of action applies extraterritorially, while then applying the presumption to block a different provision setting out defenses to that claim, would seem only to increase the possibility of international friction. Such a regime could also give plaintiffs an advantage when they sue over extraterritorial wrongdoing that they would not receive if the defendant's conduct occurred domestically. It is doubtful that Congress ever intends such a result when it writes provisions limiting civil liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Ninth Circuit addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Blazevska v.

The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Blazevska\n   </em>\n   argued that the General Aviation Revitalization Act's (\"GARA\") statute of repose could not limit the defendant's liability because, like here, certain events related to plaintiffs' claims occurred overseas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761710\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761710\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/948/\">\n    at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It found that GARA did not \"impermissibly regulate conduct that has occurred abroad,\" and instead,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   merely eliminates the power of any party to bring a suit for damages against a general aviation aircraft manufacturer, in a U.S. federal or state court, after the limitation period. The only conduct it could arguably be said to regulate is the ability of a party to initiate an action for damages against a manufacturer in American courts-an entirely domestic endeavor. Congress has no power to tell courts of foreign countries whether they could entertain a suit against an American defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 953. \"Accordingly,\" the Ninth Circuit held, \"the presumption against extraterritoriality simply is not implicated by GARA's application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Supreme Court has left open the question of whether certain types of statutes might not be subject to the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WesternGeco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612860\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2129/#p2137\">\n    138 S.

Suppose that you are a published author. One day, an acquaintance calls. \"I've been reading over everything you've ever published,\" he informs you. \"I've also been looking at everything you've ever said on the Internet. I've done the same for this other author. You two have very similar interests; I think you'd get along.\" The acquaintance then gives you the other author's contact information and photo, along with a link to all her published works. He calls back three more times over the next week with more names of writers you should get to know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Now, you might say your acquaintance fancies himself a matchmaker. But would you say he's acting as the\n   <em>\n    publisher\n   </em>\n   of the other authors' work?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Facebook and the majority would have us answer this question \"yes.\" I, however, cannot do so. For the scenario I have just described is little different from how Facebook's algorithms allegedly work. And while those algorithms do end up showing users profile, group, or event pages written by other users, it strains the English language to say that in targeting and recommending\n   these writings to users-and thereby forging connections, developing new social networks-Facebook is acting as \"the\n   <em>\n    publisher\n   </em>\n   of ... information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   It would be one thing if congressional intent compelled us to adopt the majority's reading. It does not. Instead, we today extend a provision that was designed to encourage computer service providers to shield minors from obscene material so that it now immunizes those same providers for allegedly connecting terrorists to one another. Neither the impetus for nor the text of \u00a7 230(c)(1) requires such a result. When a plaintiff brings a claim that is based not on the content of the information shown but rather on the connections Facebook's algorithms make between individuals, the CDA does not and should not bar relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Anti-Terrorism Act (\"ATA\") claims in this case fit this bill. According to plaintiffs' Proposed Second Amended Complaint (\"PSAC\")-which we must take as true at this early stage-Facebook has developed \"sophisticated algorithm[s]\" for bringing its users together. App'x 347 \u00b6 622. After collecting mountains of data about each user's activity on and off its platform, Facebook unleashes its algorithms to generate friend, group, and event suggestions based on what it perceives to be the user's interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 345-46 \u00b6\u00b6 608-14. If a user posts about a Hamas attack or searches for information about a Hamas leader, Facebook may \"suggest\" that that user become friends with Hamas terrorists on Facebook or join Hamas-related Facebook groups. By \"facilitat[ing] [Hamas's] ability to reach and engage an audience it could not otherwise reach as effectively,\" plaintiffs allege that Facebook's algorithms provide material support and personnel to terrorists.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 347 \u00b6 622;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 352-58 \u00b6\u00b6 646-77. As applied to the algorithms, plaintiffs' claims do not seek to punish Facebook for the content others post, for deciding whether to publish third parties' content, or for editing (or failing to edit) others' content before publishing it. In short, they do not rely on treating Facebook as \"the publisher\" of others' information. Instead, they would hold Facebook liable for its affirmative role in bringing terrorists together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   When it comes to Facebook's algorithms, then, plaintiffs' causes of action do not run afoul of the CDA. Because the court below did not pass on the merits of the ATA claims pressed below, I would send this case back to the district court to decide the merits in the first instance. The majority, however, cuts off all possibility for relief based on algorithms like Facebook's, even if these or future plaintiffs could prove a sufficient nexus between those algorithms and their injuries. In light of today's decision and other judicial interpretations of the statute that have generally immunized social media companies-and especially in light of the new reality that has evolved since the CDA's passage-Congress may wish to revisit the CDA to better calibrate the circumstances where such immunization is appropriate and inappropriate in light of congressional purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   To see how far we have strayed from the path on which Congress set us out, we must consider where that path began.

Of the myriad issues the emerging Internet implicated, Congress tackled only one: the ease with which the Internet delivers indecent or offensive material, especially to minors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Telecommunications Act of 1996, tit. V, subtit. A, 110 Stat. at 133-39. And \u00a7 230 provided one of two alternative ways of handling this problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The action began in the Senate. Senator James J. Exon introduced the CDA on February 1, 1995.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   141 Cong. Rec. 3,203. He presented a revised bill on June 9, 1995, \"[t]he heart and the soul\" of which was \"its protection for families and children.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15,503 (statement of Sen. Exon). The Exon Amendment sought to reduce the proliferation of pornography and other obscene material online by subjecting to civil and criminal penalties those who use interactive computer services to make, solicit, or transmit offensive material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15,505.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The House of Representatives had the same goal-to protect children from inappropriate online material-but a very different sense of how to achieve it. Congressmen Christopher Cox (R-California) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) introduced an amendment to the Telecommunications Act, entitled \"Online Family Empowerment,\" about two months after the revised CDA appeared in the Senate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22,044. Making the argument for their amendment during the House floor debate, Congressman Cox stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   We want to make sure that everyone in America has an open invitation and feels welcome to participate in the Internet. But as you know, there is some reason for people to be wary because, as a Time Magazine cover story recently highlighted, there is in this vast world of computer information, a literal computer library, some offensive material, some things in the bookstore, if you will, that our children ought not to see.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   As the parent of two, I want to make sure that my children have access to this future and that I do not have to worry about what they might be running into on line. I would like to keep that out of my house and off my computer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22,044-45. Likewise, Congressman Wyden said: \"We are all against smut and pornography, and, as the parents of two small computer-literate children, my wife and I have seen our kids find their way into these chat rooms that make their middle-aged parents cringe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22,045.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As both sponsors noted, the debate between the House and the Senate was not over the CDA's primary purpose but rather over the best means to that shared end.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep. Cox) (\"How should we do this? ... Mr. Chairman, what we want are results. We want to make sure we do something that actually works.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep. Wyden) (\"So let us all stipulate right at the outset the importance of protecting our kids and going to the issue of the best way to do it.\"). While the Exon Amendment would have the FCC regulate online obscene materials, the sponsors of the House proposal \"believe[d] that parents and families are better suited to guard the portals of cyberspace and protect our children than our Government bureaucrats.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22,045 (statement of Rep. Wyden). They also feared the effects the Senate's approach might have on the Internet itself.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep. Cox) (\"[The amendment] will establish as the policy of the United States that we do not wish to have content regulation by the Federal Government of what is on the Internet, that we do\n   not wish to have a Federal Computer Commission with an army of bureaucrats regulating the Internet ....\"). The Cox-Wyden Amendment therefore sought to empower interactive computer service providers to self-regulate, and to provide tools for parents to regulate, children's access to inappropriate material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 104-230, at 194 (1996) (Conf. Rep.); 141 Cong. Rec. 22,045 (statement of Rep. Cox).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   There was only one problem with this approach, as the House sponsors saw it. A New York State trial court had recently ruled that the online service Prodigy, by deciding to remove certain indecent material from its site, had become a \"publisher\" and thus was liable for defamation when it failed to remove other objectionable content.\n   <em>\n    Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v.

The authors of \u00a7 230 saw the\n   <em>\n    Stratton-Oakmont\n   </em>\n   decision as indicative of a \"legal system [that] provides a massive disincentive for the people who might best help us control the Internet to do so.\" 141 Cong.

The first, which is at issue in this case, states that \"[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The second provision eliminates liability for interactive computer service providers and users for \"any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be ... objectionable,\" or \"any action taken to enable or make available to ... others the technical means to restrict access to [objectionable] material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 230(c)(2). These two subsections tackle, in overlapping fashion, the two jurisprudential moves of the\n   <em>\n    Stratton-Oakmont\n   </em>\n   court: first, that Prodigy's decision to screen posts for offensiveness rendered it \"a publisher rather than a distributor,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20323710\">\n    1995 WL 323710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ; and second, that by making good-faith efforts to remove offensive material Prodigy became liable for any actionable material it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   remove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The legislative history illustrates that in passing \u00a7 230 Congress was focused squarely on protecting minors from offensive online material, and that it sought to\n   do so by \"empowering parents to determine the content of communications their children receive through interactive computer services.\" S. Rep. No. 104-230, at 194. The \"policy\" section of \u00a7 230's text reflects this goal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)-(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not surprising, then, that Congress emphasized the narrow civil liability shield that became \u00a7 230(c)(2), rather than the broad rule of construction laid out in \u00a7 230(c)(1). Indeed, the conference committee summarized \u00a7 230 by stating that it \"provides 'Good Samaritan' protections from civil liability for providers or users of an interactive computer service for actions to restrict or to enable restriction of access to objectionable online material\"-a description that could just as easily have applied to \u00a7 230(c)(2) alone. S. Rep. No. 104-230, at 194. Congress also titled the entirety of \u00a7 230(c) \"Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and screening of offensive material,\" suggesting that the definitional rule outlined in \u00a7 230(c)(1) may have been envisioned as supporting or working in tandem with the civil liability shield in \u00a7 230(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   None of this is to say that \u00a7 230(c)(1) exempts interactive computer service providers from publisher treatment only when they remove indecent content. Statutory text cannot be ignored, and Congress grabbed a bazooka to swat the\n   <em>\n    Stratton-Oakmont\n   </em>\n   fly. Whatever prototypical situation its drafters may have had in mind, \u00a7 230(c)(1) does not limit its protection to situations involving \"obscene material\" provided by others, instead using the expansive word \"information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Illuminating Congress's original intent does, however, underscore the extent of \u00a7 230(c)(1)'s subsequent mission creep. Given how far both Facebook's suggestion algorithms and plaintiffs' terrorism claims swim from the shore of congressional purpose, caution is warranted before courts extend the CDA's reach any further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   With the CDA's background in mind, I turn to the text. By its plain terms, \u00a7 230 does not apply whenever a claim would\n   treat the defendant as \"a publisher\" in the abstract, immunizing defendants from liability stemming from any activity in which one thinks publishing companies commonly engage.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 65, 66, 70. It states, more specifically, that \"[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   publisher or speaker\n   <em>\n    of any information provided by another\n   </em>\n   information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphases added). \"Here grammar and usage establish that 'the' is a function word indicating that a following noun or noun equivalent is definite ....\"\n   <em>\n    Nielsen v.

The word \"publisher\" in this statute is thus inextricably linked to the \"information provided by another.\" The question is whether a plaintiff's claim arises from a third party's information, and-crucially-whether to establish the claim the court must necessarily view the defendant, not as a publisher in the abstract, but rather as\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   publisher of that third-party information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

A publisher might write an email promoting a third-party event to its readers, for example, but the publisher would be the author of the underlying content and therefore not immune from suit based on that promotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), (f)(3). Similarly, the fact that publishers may sell advertising based on user data does not immunize the publisher if someone brings a claim based on the publisher's selling of the data, because the claim would not treat the defendant as the publisher of a third party's content.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oberdorf v.

For instance, a claim against a newspaper based on the content of a classified ad (or the decision to publish or withdraw that ad) would fail under the CDA not because newspapers traditionally publish classified ads, but rather because such a claim would necessarily treat the newspaper as the publisher of the ad-maker's content. Similarly, the newspaper does not act as an \"information content provider\"-and thus\n   maintains its CDA protection-when it decides to run a classified ad because it neither \"creates\" nor \"develops\" the information in the ad.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   This case is different. Looking beyond Facebook's \"broad statements of immunity\" and relying \"rather on a careful exegesis of the statutory language,\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663159\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/1096/#p1102\">\n    570 F.3d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the CDA does not protect Facebook's friend- and content-suggestion algorithms. A combination of two factors, in my view, confirms that claims based on these algorithms do not inherently treat Facebook as the publisher of third-party content.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Facebook uses the algorithms to create and communicate its own message: that it thinks you, the reader-you, specifically-will like this content. And second, Facebook's suggestions contribute to the creation of real-world social networks. The result of at least some suggestions is not just that the user consumes a third party's content. Sometimes, Facebook's suggestions allegedly lead the user to become part of a unique global community, the creation and maintenance of which goes far beyond and differs in kind from traditional editorial functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   It is true, as the majority notes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 70, that Facebook's algorithms rely on and display users' content. However, this is not enough to trigger the protections of \u00a7 230(c)(1). The CDA does not mandate \"a 'but-for' test that would provide immunity ... solely because a cause of action would not otherwise have accrued but for the third-party content.\"\n   <em>\n    HomeAway.com, Inc. v. City of Santa Monica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520462\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/676/#p684\">\n    918 F.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (9th Cir. 2019). Rather, to fall within \u00a7 230(c)(1)'s radius, the claim at issue must inherently fault the defendant's activity as the publisher of specific third-party content. Plaintiffs' claims about Facebook's suggestion algorithms do not do this. The complaint alleges that \"Facebook collects detailed information about its users, including, inter alia, the content they post, type of content they view or engage with, people they communicate with, groups they belong to and how they interact with such groups, visits to third party websites, apps and Facebook partners.\" App'x 345 \u00b6 608. Then the algorithms \"utilize the collected data to suggest friends, groups, products, services and local events, and target ads\" based on each user's input.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520462\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/676/#p684\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 346 \u00b6 610.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   If a third party got access to Facebook users' data, analyzed it using a proprietary algorithm, and sent its own messages to Facebook users suggesting that people become friends or attend one another's events, the third party would not be protected as \"the publisher\" of the users' information. Similarly, if Facebook were to use the algorithms to target\n   <em>\n    its own\n   </em>\n   material to particular users, such that the resulting posts consisted of \"information provided by\" Facebook rather than by \"another information content provider,\" \u00a7 230(c)(1), Facebook clearly would not be immune for that independent message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Yet that is ultimately what plaintiffs allege Facebook is doing. The PSAC alleges that Facebook \"actively provides 'friend suggestions' between users who have expressed similar interests,\" and that it \"actively suggests groups and events to users.\" App'x 346 \u00b6\u00b6 612-13. Facebook's algorithms thus allegedly provide the user with a message from Facebook. Facebook is telling users-perhaps implicitly, but clearly-that they would like these people,\n   groups, or events. In this respect, Facebook \"does not merely provide a framework that could be utilized for proper or improper purposes; rather, [Facebook's] work in developing\" the algorithm and suggesting connections to users based on their prior activity on Facebook, including their shared interest in terrorism, \"is directly related to the alleged illegality of the site.\"\n   <em>\n    Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n    521 F.3d 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1171 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc). The fact that Facebook also publishes third-party content should not cause us to conflate its two separate roles with respect to its users and their information. Facebook may be immune under the CDA from plaintiffs' challenge to its allowance of Hamas accounts, since Facebook acts solely as the publisher of the Hamas users' content. That does not mean, though, that it is also immune when it conducts statistical analyses of that information and delivers a message based on those analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Moreover, in part through its use of friend, group, and event suggestions, Facebook is doing more than just publishing content: it is proactively creating networks of people. Its algorithms forge real-world (if digital) connections through friend and group suggestions, and they attempt to create similar connections in the physical world through event suggestions. The cumulative effect of recommending several friends, or several groups or events, has an impact greater than the sum of each suggestion. It envelops the user, immersing her in an entire universe filled with people, ideas, and events she may never have discovered on her own. According to the allegations in the complaint, Facebook designed its website for this very purpose. \"Facebook has described itself as a provider of products and services that enable users ... to find and connect with other users ....\" App'x 250 \u00b6 129. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has similarly described Facebook as \"build[ing] tools to help people connect with the people they want,\" thereby \"extending people's capacity to build and maintain relationships.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 251 \u00b6 132. Of course, Facebook is not the only company that tries to bring people together this way, and perhaps other publishers try to introduce their readers to one another. Yet the creation of social networks goes far beyond the traditional editorial functions that the CDA immunizes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Another way to consider the CDA immunity question is to \"look ... to what the duty at issue actually requires: specifically, whether the duty would necessarily require an internet company to monitor[, alter, or remove] third-party content.\"\n   <em>\n    HomeAway.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520462\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/676/#p684\">\n    918 F.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, too, the claims regarding the algorithms are a poor fit for statutory immunity. The duty not to provide material support to terrorism, as applied to Facebook's use of the algorithms, simply requires that Facebook not actively use that material to determine which of its users to connect to each other. It could stop using the algorithms altogether, for instance. Or, short of that, Facebook could modify its algorithms to stop them introducing terrorists to one another. None of this would change any underlying content, nor would it necessarily require courts to assess further the difficult question of whether there is an affirmative obligation to monitor that content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, I note that ATA torts are atypical. Most of the common torts that might be pleaded in relation to Facebook's algorithms \"derive liability from behavior that is identical to publishing or speaking\"-for instance, \"publishing defamatory material; publishing material that inflicts emotional distress; or ... attempting to de-publish hurtful material but doing it badly.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663159\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/1096/#p1102\">\n    570 F.3d at 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The fact that Facebook has figured out how to target material to people more likely to read it does not matter to a defamation claim, for instance, because the mere act of publishing in the first place creates liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The ATA works differently. Plaintiffs' material support and aiding and abetting claims premise liability, not on publishing\n   <em>\n    qua\n   </em>\n   publishing, but rather on Facebook's provision of services and personnel to Hamas. It happens that the way in which Facebook provides these benefits includes republishing content, but Facebook's duties under the ATA arise separately from the republication of content.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663159\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/1096/#p1102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (determining that liability on a promissory estoppel theory for promising to remove content \"would come not from Yahoo's publishing conduct, but from Yahoo's manifest intention to be legally obligated to do something, which happens to be removal of material from publication\"). For instance, the operation of the algorithms is allegedly provision of \"expert advice or assistance,\" and the message implied by Facebook's prodding is allegedly a \"service\" or an attempt to provide \"personnel.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For these reasons, \u00a7 230(c)(1) does not bar plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Even if we sent this case back to the district court, as I believe to be the right course, these plaintiffs might have proven unable to allege that Facebook's matchmaking algorithms played a role in the attacks that harmed them. However, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that such might have been the situation here, I do not think we should foreclose the possibility of relief in future cases if victims can plausibly allege that a website knowingly brought terrorists together and that an attack occurred as a direct result of the site's actions. Though the majority shuts the door on such claims, today's decision also illustrates the extensive immunity that the current formulation of the CDA already extends to social media companies for activities that were undreamt of in 1996. It therefore may be time for Congress to reconsider the scope of \u00a7 230.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As is so often the case with new technologies, the very qualities that drive social media's success-its ease of use, open access, and ability to connect the world-have also spawned its demons. Plaintiffs' complaint illustrates how pervasive and blatant a presence Hamas and its leaders have maintained on Facebook. Hamas is far from alone-Hezbollah, Boko Haram, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and many other designated terrorist organizations use Facebook to recruit and rouse supporters.

Recent news reports suggest that many social media sites have been slow to remove the plethora of terrorist and extremist accounts populating their platforms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that such efforts, when they\n   occur, are often underinclusive. Twitter, for instance, banned the Ku Klux Klan in 2018 but allowed David Duke to maintain his account,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Roose &amp; Conger,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , while researchers found that Facebook removed fewer than half the terrorist accounts and posts those researchers identified,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Waters &amp; Postings,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 8; Desmond Butler &amp; Barbara Ortulay,\n   <em>\n    Facebook Auto-Generates Videos Celebrating Extremist Images\n   </em>\n   , Assoc. Press (May 9, 2019), http://apnews.com/f97c24dab4f34bd0b48b36f2988952a4. Those whose accounts\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   removed often pop up again under different names or with slightly different language in their profiles, playing a perverse and deadly game of Whack-a-Mole with Silicon Valley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Isaac,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; Silver &amp; Frier,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Of course, the failure to remove terrorist content, while an important policy concern, is immunized under \u00a7 230 as currently written. Until today, the same could not have been said for social media's unsolicited, algorithmic spreading of terrorism. Shielding internet companies that bring terrorists together using algorithms could leave dangerous activity unchecked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Take Facebook. As plaintiffs allege, its friend-suggestion algorithm appears to connect terrorist sympathizers with pinpoint precision. For instance, while two researchers were studying Islamic State (\"IS\") activity on Facebook, one \"received dozens of pro-IS accounts as recommended friends after friending just one pro-IS account.\" Waters &amp; Postings,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 78. More disturbingly, the other \"received an influx of Philippines-based IS supporters and fighters as recommended friends after liking several non-extremist news pages about Marawi and the Philippines during IS's capture of the city.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   News reports indicate that the friend-suggestion feature has introduced thousands of IS sympathizers to one another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martin Evans,\n   <em>\n    Facebook Accused of Introducing Extremists to One Another Through\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    'Suggested Friends' Feature\n   </em>\n   , The Telegraph (May 5, 2018), http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/05/facebook-accused-introducing-extremists-one-another-suggested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   And this is far from the only Facebook algorithm that may steer people toward terrorism. Another turns users' declared interests into audience categories to enable microtargeted advertising. In 2017, acting on a tip, ProPublica sought to direct an ad at the algorithmically-created category \"Jew hater\"-which turned out to be real, as were \"German Schutzstaffel,\" \"Nazi Party,\" and \"Hitler did nothing wrong.\" Julia Angwin et al.,\n   <em>\n    Facebook Enabled Advertises to Reach 'Jew Haters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    '\n   </em>\n   ProPublica (Sept. 14, 2017), https://www.propublica.org/article/facebookenabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters. As the \"Jew hater\" category was too small for Facebook to run an ad campaign, \"Facebook's automated system suggested 'Second Amendment' as an additional category ... presumably because its system had correlated gun enthusiasts with anti-Semites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   That's not all. Another Facebook algorithm auto-generates business pages by scraping employment information from users' profiles; other users can then \"like\" these pages, follow their posts, and see who else has liked them. Butler &amp; Ortutay,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . ProPublica reports that extremist organizations including al-Qaida, al-Shabab, and IS have such auto-created pages, allowing them to recruit the pages' followers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The page for al-Qaida in the Arabian\n   Peninsula included the group's Wikipedia entry and a propaganda photo of the damaged USS Cole, which the group had bombed in 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Meanwhile, a fourth algorithm integrates users' photos and other media to generate videos commemorating their previous year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Militants get a ready-made propaganda clip, complete with a thank-you message from Facebook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This case, and our CDA analysis, has centered on the use of algorithms to foment terrorism. Yet the consequences of a CDA-driven, hands-off approach to social media extend much further. Social media can be used by foreign governments to interfere in American elections. For example, Justice Department prosecutors recently concluded that Russian intelligence agents created false Facebook groups and accounts in the years leading up to the 2016 election campaign, bootstrapping Facebook's algorithm to spew propaganda that reached between 29 million and 126 million Americans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Robert S.

Russia also purchased over 3,500 advertisements on Facebook to publicize their fake Facebook groups, several of which grew to have hundreds of thousands of followers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. On Twitter, Russia developed false accounts that impersonated American people or groups and issued content designed to influence the election; it then created thousands of automated \"bot\" accounts to amplify the sham Americans' messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28. One fake account received over six million retweets, the vast majority of which appear to have come from real Twitter users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gillian Cleary,\n   <em>\n    Twitterbots: Anatomy of a Propaganda Campaign\n   </em>\n   , Symantec (June 5, 2019), http://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/twitterbots-propaganda-disinformation. Russian intelligence also harnessed the reach that social media gave its false identities to organize \"dozens of U.S. rallies,\" some of which \"drew hundreds\" of real-world Americans. Mueller,\n   <em>\n    Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 29. Russia could do all this only because social media is designed to target messages like Russia's to the users most susceptible to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   While Russia's interference in the 2016 election is the best-documented example of foreign meddling through social media, it is not the only one. Federal intelligence agencies expressed concern in the weeks before the 2018 midterm election \"about ongoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran,\" to \"influence public sentiment\" through means \"including using social media to amplify divisive issues.\" Press Release, Office of Dir. of Nat'l Intelligence, Joint Statement from the ODNI, DOJ, FBI, and DHS: Combatting Foreign Influence in U.S. Elections, (Oct. 19, 2018), https://www.dni.gov/index. php/newsroom/press-releases/item/1915-joint-statement-from-the-odni-doj-fbi-and-dhs-combating-foreign-influence-in-u-s-elections.

All too often, however, the code itself turns those tastes sour.

The text and legislative history of the statute shout to the rafters Congress's focus on reducing children's access to adult material. Congress could not have anticipated the pernicious spread of hate and violence that the rise of social media likely has since fomented. Nor could Congress have divined the role that social media providers themselves would play in this tale. Mounting evidence suggests that providers designed their algorithms to drive users toward content and people the users agreed with-and that they have done it too well, nudging susceptible souls ever further down dark paths. By contrast, when the CDA became law, the closest extant ancestor to Facebook (and it was still several branches lower on the evolutionary tree) was the chatroom or message forum, which acted as a digital bulletin board and did nothing proactive to forge off-site connections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Whether, and to what extent, Congress should allow liability for tech companies that encourage terrorism, propaganda, and extremism is a question for legislators, not judges.

It is undeniable that the Internet and social media have had many positive effects worth preserving and promoting, such as facilitating open communication, dialogue, and education. At the same time, as outlined above, social media can be manipulated by evildoers who pose real threats to our democratic society. A healthy debate has begun both in the legal academy\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in the policy community\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   about changing the scope of \u00a7 230. Perhaps Congress will clarify what I believe the\n   text of the provision already states: that the creation of social networks reaches beyond the publishing functions that \u00a7 230 protects. Perhaps Congress will engage in a broader rethinking of the scope of CDA immunity. Or perhaps Congress will decide that the current regime best balances the interests involved. In the meantime, however, I cannot join my colleagues' decision to immunize Facebook's friend- and content-suggestion algorithms from judicial scrutiny. I therefore must in part respectfully dissent, as I concur in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    I agree with the majority that the CDA's exception for enforcement of criminal laws,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(1), does not apply to plaintiffs' claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 71-72.

Rec. 22,045 (emphasis added). This history, along with the provision's title, strongly suggests that \u00a7 230(e)(1) was intended as a narrow criminal-law exception.
