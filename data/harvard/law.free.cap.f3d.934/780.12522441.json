We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officers stopped a vehicle and discovered over thirty-five pounds of methamphetamine. The driver, Blanca Avila De Vega, agreed to assist officers with a controlled buy. Carlos and another man, Alejandro Buendia-Ramirez, arrived at the buy with approximately $90,000, and officers arrested them. Carlos subsequently assisted officers by directing them to a stash house he had rented. At the stash house, officers arrested Carlos's brother, Alfredo Valquier. Carlos, Alfredo, and several other conspirators were charged with drug offenses, but only Alfredo went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the plea process, in an effort to obtain safety valve relief, Carlos participated in two proffer sessions with the government. In those sessions, he claimed to have played a minor role in the conspiracy. He explained that his mother had put a cousin in touch with him and Alfredo and that the cousin first recruited Alfredo. After learning that Alfredo had been paid $500 to drive a short distance, Carlos asked Alfredo to get work for him too. Subsequently, Carlos said he was tasked with renting the stash house and transporting Buendia-Ramirez there. Carlos claimed that the cousin was ultimately the person \"calling the shots.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At his sentencing, the government argued that Carlos's proffer was neither complete nor truthful. For support, the government referred to testimony that Avila De Vega and Buendia-Ramirez gave during Alfredo's trial, over which the same district court judge had presided. According to the government, Avila De Vega testified that she had delivered drugs to Carlos and Alfredo on a previous occasion, and Buendia-Ramirez testified that the brothers: (1) brought him cash on different occasions; (2) \"were aware that they were dealing in drugs\"; and (3) had plans to take the proceeds of the drugs to a different state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government also offered testimony from an agent involved in the investigation of the case and the proffer discussions. The agent testified primarily about two phone calls between Carlos and Alfredo during which Carlos essentially told Alfredo that \"he wasn't going to tell them anything\" and \"they weren't as innocent as they would like to believe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After hearing the evidence, the district court noted that Carlos's eligibility for safety valve relief was a \"close question.\" The court ultimately determined, however, that the government had a \"reasonable basis\" for arguing against relief because, while the information Carlos provided was truthful, the evidence suggested that it was not complete. The district court therefore denied Carlos safety valve relief and sentenced him to the statutory mandatory-minimum term of 120 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In the safety valve statute and parallel advisory guidelines provision, Congress provided relief for less culpable drug offenders from its harsh mandatory minimum sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
