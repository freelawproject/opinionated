Martin's suit proceeded to trial, where a jury awarded him $1.00 in damages after finding that two of the defendants lacked reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain him. The jury found against Martin and in favor of the officers on the remainder of his claims. Martin appeals, challenging only the district court's pretrial grant of partial summary judgment to the defendants, which limited the damages Martin could seek at trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Martin's suit arises from a traffic stop in May 2013. We recount the facts surrounding the stop and subsequent events in the light most favorable to Martin, noting disputed facts where relevant and viewing the facts on which the jury reached a verdict in the light most favorable to the verdict. On the evening of May 24, 2013, Martin was driving in Chicago when Officers Davis Marinez and Sofia Gonzalez pulled him over. According to Martin, he had not committed any traffic violations when the officers stopped him, although the officers claim they initiated the stop because Martin's tail and brake lights were not working. When Officer Gonzalez approached the car and asked Martin for his license and insurance, Martin explained that he did not have his driver's license because it had been \"taken for a ticket.\" At that point both officers asked Martin to step out of the car as the other defendants, Officers Armando Chagoya and Elvis Turcinovic, arrived on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Martin, the officers forced him from the car, conducted a pat-down search, handcuffed him, and put him into a police car. At that point, they searched his car, where they recovered a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun with a defaced serial number, and a plastic baggie of crack cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officers then took Martin into custody. At the police station, Officer Marinez learned that Martin had previously been convicted of first-degree murder and unlawful use of a weapon by a convicted felon. Ultimately Martin was transferred to Cook County Jail and charged with four Illinois felonies: (i) being an armed habitual criminal in violation of 720 ILCS \u00a7 5/24-1.7 ; (ii) being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 720 ILCS \u00a7 5/24-1.1 ; (iii) possessing a firearm with a defaced serial number in violation of 720 ILCS \u00a7 5/24-5(b) ; and possessing cocaine in violation of 720 ILCS \u00a7 570/402. He also received traffic citations under Chicago Municipal Code Section 9-76-050 (taillight operation) and 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/6-112 (outlining requirement to carry a driver's license).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Martin spent sixty-five days-from May 24 through July 29, 2013-incarcerated in connection with the charges resulting from the traffic stop. On July 29th, a different court revoked Martin's bond when he was convicted in an unrelated criminal case. During the course of the criminal proceedings for the felony charges arising from the traffic stop, Martin filed a motion to\n   suppress the evidence, which the trial court granted on November 7, 2013. The state then dismissed the charges against Martin through a nolle prosequi motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Martin filed this suit in federal court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against all of the officers involved in the stop as well as the City of Chicago (on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory of liability), seeking money damages for violations of his Fourth Amendment rights. Martin sought civil damages totaling $110,500: $1,000 per day of his 65-day incarceration and $45,500 in lost business income-calculated at $700 per day-from his automobile dealership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before trial, the defendants moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that even if the stop was unlawful, once the officers saw the handgun and cocaine, they had probable cause for Martin's arrest, which limited Martin's damages to the short period between his stop and his arrest. The district court agreed, granting the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment and concluding that although Martin's \u00a7 1983 case could proceed as to the initial stop of his car and seizure of his person-before the defendants discovered the illegal gun and cocaine-he could not seek damages for conduct post-dating the discovery of contraband, including his 65-day incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Martin's case proceeded to a jury trial, limited as described above by the grant of partial summary judgment. At trial, the facts largely tracked those described above, with the same basic areas of conflicting testimony: (1) Martin testified that his tail and brake lights were both functioning when he was stopped; (2) he also testified that he handed Officer Gonzalez his traffic ticket when he was unable to produce his license; and (3) Martin maintained that the handgun was under the driver's seat, as opposed to on it and visible when he stepped out of the car as directed by Officers Gonzalez and Marinez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court instructed the jury to decide the following Fourth Amendment questions: (1) whether the officers \"unlawfully seized\" Martin without reasonable suspicion to support a traffic stop; (2) whether they falsely arrested him without probable cause; or (3) whether they unlawfully searched his person or car without probable cause. The court also instructed the jury that if they found that Martin proved his claims, they could not award him damages for any time spent in custody after officers found the handgun, and should limit their consideration to the period of detention beginning with his traffic stop and ending when they found the gun. The jury found in favor of Martin and against Officers Marinez and Gonzalez on the unlawful seizure claim and awarded him $1.00 in compensatory damages. On that same claim, they found in favor of Officers Chagoya and Turcinovic, and on the remaining claims for false arrest and unlawful search, they found against Martin and in favor of all four officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Martin now appeals from the district court's grant of partial summary judgment before trial limiting the scope of damages available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , considering the record in the light most favorable to Martin and construing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in his favor.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

He does not dispute the jury's verdict in his favor as to the initial traffic stop and against him on all of his remaining claims. His appeal thus raises the narrow issue of what type of damages he can recover as a result of his unlawful seizure by Officers Marinez and Gonzalez. In considering this issue, we are mindful of the jury's verdict rejecting Martin's false arrest claim as well as his claim for unlawful search based on the officers' search of his vehicle. We thus consider solely whether Martin's initial unconstitutional seizure can support his claim for damages arising from losses from his subsequent incarceration on the weapon and drug charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Martin argues that the district court erroneously based its conclusion that he was barred from collecting damages from his wrongful incarceration on the premise that a \u00a7 1983 claimant may not recover damages as a result of the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. According to Martin, when assessing available damages under \u00a7 1983, we should begin by asking whether the plaintiff's alleged damages were proximately caused by the constitutional violation. From that starting point, Martin maintains that he is, at the very least, entitled to have a jury decide whether his incarceration and any consequential damages arising from it were proximately caused by the unconstitutional stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The \"basic purpose\" of damages under \u00a7 1983 is to \"compensate persons for injuries that are caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Carey v.

His complaint asserts claims for \"false arrest\" as well as \"unlawful search\" arising from the defendants' violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from \"unreasonable searches and seizures,\" U.S. Const. Amend. IV. But a claim for false arrest cannot succeed because it is undisputed that officers discovered an illegal handgun and cocaine in Martin's vehicle, which gave them probable cause for his arrest, notwithstanding the previous unlawful stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

And although Martin's complaint is limited to claims for false arrest and unlawful search, it bears noting that the existence of probable cause for the arrest would also bar recovery on a theory of malicious prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

Although the district court considered Martin's claim that his entitlement to damages for post-arrest incarceration should be resolved using a proximate cause analysis, after reviewing the cases Martin cited, the court deemed such an approach unnecessary in light of its conclusion that the existence of probable cause after the initial detention foreclosed any further damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , Martin points out that he should not be barred from recovering \u00a7 1983 damages simply because recovery would not be permitted under a common-law tort such as false arrest. As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , \"the interests protected by a particular constitutional right may not also be protected by an analogous branch of the common law torts.\"\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    435 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court recognized that although the common law elements of damages and the prerequisites for their recovery are the appropriate \"starting point for the inquiry under \u00a7 1983,\" those common-law tort theories may not \"provide a complete solution to the damages issues in every \u00a7 1983 case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court accordingly set out an approach to handling those situations where the common-law tort theories would not allow recovery but there were constitutional interests implicated that might nonetheless warrant redress when violated.\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   explained that \"to further the purpose of \u00a7 1983, the rules governing compensation for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights should be tailored to the interest protected by the particular right in question-just as the common-law rules of damages themselves were defined by the interests protected in the various branches of tort law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    at 258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit considered whether to award compensatory damages in a \u00a7 1983 civil suit after police stopped a taxi without probable cause and discovered an illegal firearm and cocaine. The plaintiff's motion to suppress the firearm was initially denied, and he was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Over two years later, the state appellate division reversed the conviction on the grounds that police had lacked probable cause to stop and search the taxicab. In his subsequent civil suit, the\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   plaintiff sought to recover compensatory damages arising from his conviction and incarceration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Carey,\n   </em>\n   the panel in\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   rejected the plaintiff's damages claim. After ruling out recovery under any common-law tort theories, the Second Circuit also rejected proximate cause as a possible basis for recovery. In doing so, the court noted that \"the chain on causation between a police officer's unlawful arrest and a subsequent conviction and incarceration is broken by the intervening exercise of independent judgment\"-specifically, the trial court's failure to suppress the incriminating evidence before trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147.

So unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Borunda\n   </em>\n   , whose claim succeeded precisely because the jury concluded that the defendant officers manufactured a tale to support probable cause for both the arrest and subsequent prosecutions, the jury here concluded that probable cause existed for\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Martin's arrest and any search of his\n   automobile that yielded contraband.

First, the precise relevant questions in\n   <em>\n    Borunda\n   </em>\n   were evidentiary: whether the district court had erred in admitting evidence of the plaintiffs' prior acquittal of the criminal charges and evidence of attorneys' fees spent during the criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Borunda\n   </em>\n   , the court considered the jury's finding that the officers lacked probable cause and concluded it was defensible in light of general tort principles of recovery; the jury's verdict here cuts in the opposite direction given that, with the exception of the initial traffic stop, the jury concluded that the defendants\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have probable cause for everything that followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Martin relies heavily on a case from the District of New Mexico holding that a plaintiff raising a constitutional claim based on an illegal search may be permitted to recover damages for post-indictment proceedings if the constitutional deprivation proximately caused the damages.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Train v.

Federal criminal charges, federal detention, and all of the negative consequences of those charges and attendant to federal custody implicated Train's interest in liberty and his sense of security and individual dignity. That imprisonment occasioned economic losses.

Nor did\n   <em>\n    Train\n   </em>\n   analyze the plaintiff's claim in light of common-law false arrest. Because Martin explicitly framed his claim as one for false arrest, (Pl.

Allowing Martin to recover damages for his subsequent imprisonment, set in motion by an arrest supported by probable cause, would amount to precisely the sort of mismatch between the violation and the damages that\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hector\n   </em>\n   sought to avoid. We do not go so far as to hold that post-arrest damages may\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   be recovered, only that here such damages would be inconsistent with the rule in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   that damages should be tailored to protect the right in question,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    435 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2517\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/247/#p254\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the right in question is Martin's Fourth Amendment right not to be stopped by officers without reasonable suspicion. That right was vindicated by the nominal damages the jury awarded Martin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is thus ultimately unnecessary to delve into the thorny question of proximate cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hector\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11167115\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/154/#p155\">\n    235 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Given that the cases on intervening causes are legion and difficult to reconcile ... and that we have other, sufficient grounds for resolving this case, we will not reach the issue of intervening causation.\"). That said, it is worth noting that there is no reason Martin's claim would fare any better under that analysis. Martin's stop was certainly the but-for cause of his imprisonment in the sense that but for the stop officers would never have discovered the handgun and cocaine and arrested him. But that tells us little about whether the stop was the\n   <em>\n    proximate cause\n   </em>\n   of his incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp., Inc. v.

Any number of superseding, intervening events could have broken the chain of causation, from the discovery of the contraband itself to the independent decision to deny bail, which was undoubtedly predicated in part on Martin's criminal history and other factors unrelated to the initial stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, consideration of proximate cause takes us back around to where we began: with the observation that probable cause for Martin's arrest, which the jury concluded existed shortly after Martin was pulled over, forecloses Martin's claim for damages from all that followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11607991\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/176/138/#p145\">\n    176 F.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that \"ordinary principles of tort causation\" apply to initial stop and search but concluding that allowing the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to \"elongate the chain of causation\" would \"distort basic tort concepts of proximate causation\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In short, the damages\n   arising from Martin's incarceration are simply too attenuated from and unrelated to the Fourth Amendment violation he has proven: a brief detention unsupported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion. His damages award was thus properly limited to the harm arising from his unconstitutional detention before his lawful arrest. The decision regarding those damages was left to the jury, which determined one dollar was the proper amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In the officers' version of events, they spotted a handgun between Martin's legs as he stepped out of his car and placed him immediately into custody.

Martin characterizes\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    as holding that damages could be recovered for incarceration subsequent to a failure to provide\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings, despite the fact that a failure to provide such warnings is itself not a violation of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But Martin misreads\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , which specifies that an actual Fifth Amendment violation occurs only when the information acquired without\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings is introduced at trial to secure a criminal conviction. Martin claims\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    would allow damages based on a violation of a prophylactic rule-the failure to give\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warnings itself-but he misreads\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    .
