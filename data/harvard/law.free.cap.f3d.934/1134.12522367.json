In 2016, Colorado voters approved Amendment 71, a ballot initiative that made changes to the ballot initiative process.

Const. art. V, \u00a7 1 (2).

Thus, the allegation cannot be used to support the district court's ruling in favor of Plaintiffs on their equal protection claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Plaintiffs' complaint, however, also alleges that the number of\n    <em>\n     registered voters\n    </em>\n    in each state senate district differs considerably. Specifically, it states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    There is a huge variation in the population of registered voters in the various state senate districts. For example, as of January 1, 2017, district 11 had 86,181 voters, district 25 had 85,051 voters, district 21 had 80,499 voters, and five other districts (1, 12, 13, 29, and 35) had between 91,728 and 96,463 voters. By way of comparison, district 4 had 121,093 voters, district 16 had 119,920 voters, district 18 had 120,222 voters, district 20 had 126,844 voters, and district 23 had 132,222 voters. Thus, district 23 has 51,723 more voters than district 21, and that variance is slightly more than 60%.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Presuming this allegation to be true,\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    the complaint can be read to allege that an inequality in the number of registered voters\n    in each of Colorado's equally populous senate districts dilutes the voting rights of petition signatories who live in districts with a higher number of registered voters.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n     136 S.

In other words, because only the signatures of registered voters are valid for purposes of citizen-initiative petitions, the number of signatures required to meet the two-percent threshold established by Section 2.5 varies from district-to-district.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Using the numbers alleged by Plaintiffs, approximately 1610 signatures must be collected in District 21 to satisfy the two percent requirement, but 2537 signatures must be collected in District 20 (the district in which Plaintiff Hayes resides) and 2404 signatures must be collected in District 18 (the district in which Plaintiff Semple resides). As the argument goes, Plaintiffs' votes have less influence on whether a citizen initiative appears on the state-wide ballot than the votes of individuals living in districts with fewer registered voters. Defendant understood this to be Plaintiffs' assertion and addressed it in her motion to dismiss. She argued Plaintiffs' claim fails as a matter of law because every court to consider the matter has held that signature-collection requirements involving ballot initiatives do not violate the Equal Protection Clause as long as the districts from which signatures are collected have substantially the same total population.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Angle v.

Just as in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs allege this sub-group varies in size from district to district. Thus, Plaintiffs' equal protection claim is the same as that of the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    -that the population of either eligible or registered voters, not the total population, in each state senate district must be equal or voting power is diluted.

Plaintiffs, however, rightly conceded during oral argument in this matter that citizen initiatives and direct democracy do, in fact, implicate the principle of representational equality. As the Court stated in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    , \"[n]onvoters have an important stake in many policy debates-children, their parents, even their grandparents, for example, have a stake in a strong public-education system-and in receiving constituent services, such as help navigating public-benefits bureaucracies.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n     136 S.

Because elected representatives make decisions that affect both voting and nonvoting constituents, representation is equal when total population in each district is equal.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1130-31. The same is true in the direct democracy context. Because legislators \"serve all residents, not just those eligible or registered to vote,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    voters choose a legislator who they expect will adequately advance the interests of both voters and non-voters. In the direct democracy context, voters are able to directly advance the interests of non-voting members of their families and communities when they decide whether to support a citizen initiative. Although citizens, unlike elected representatives, are not \"subject to requests and suggestions\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    from constituents, their vote on citizen initiative petitions can be influenced by private discussions with non-voting friends, family, and neighbors.

This interpretation is consistent with the Supreme Court's statement in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    that the \"one-person, one-vote guarantee\" can properly be viewed as a guarantee of equal representation, \"not voter equality.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1131.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Supreme Court precedent is clear.

This matter, however, was resolved on a motion to dismiss. After denying that motion, the district court ordered Defendant to show cause why final judgment should not enter in favor of Plaintiffs but gave Defendant a mere thirty days to respond to that order, clearly an insufficient time to permit Defendant to prepare a comprehensive response. Further, the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling in favor of Plaintiffs. Defendant addressed the\n     <em>\n      Anderson\n     </em>\n     balancing test in her response but specifically preserved her objections to the procedural path taken by the district court and the court's refusal to permit sufficient time for discovery or to \"hold Plaintiffs to their burden at the dispositive motions stage.\" Thus, even assuming the total population and registered voter data in the record is complete and accurate, that information is only relevant to but one piece of the\n     <em>\n      Anderson\n     </em>\n     balancing test.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n      460 U.S. at 789\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n      103 S.Ct. 1564\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

It is on this point that the record suffers because of the lack of evidence. For example, one of the documents submitted by Defendant was authored by Dr. Seth Masket, the Director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver. Dr. Masket prefaced his report on the feasibility of drawing state senate districts that are approximately equal both in number of residents and number of registered voters with the following statement: \"[I]t is difficult to give a complete report on these matters given the short time available.\" He further stated that his assessment was \"of necessity, based on incomplete information.\" Thus, despite taking the prudent approach by addressing the Anderson balancing test as required by the district court's order, Defendant clearly disputes the dissent's position that the record contains sufficient facts or evidence to properly apply the test. Compounding the problem, the dissent suggests a method to remedy the perceived equal protection problem. Dissenting Op. at 1155-56.

In arriving at this conclusion, the majority begins by suggesting that \"[p]laintiffs ... rightly conceded during oral argument in this matter that citizen initiatives and direct democracy do, in fact, implicate the principle of representational equality.\" Maj. Op at 1141. A careful review of the oral argument recording, however, reveals that plaintiffs' counsel made no such concession. During oral argument in this matter, plaintiffs' counsel argued that signature gathering for initiative petitions \"is fundamentally a ballot access issue,\" and he in turn argued that\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    \"was not a ballot access case\" and was instead \"focused on the issue of representational\" equality. Oral Argument at 20:11. Plaintiffs' counsel was asked by the panel if it is true that when a person in Colorado signs an initiative proposal, they are acting in a representative capacity for everyone in their district. Plaintiffs' counsel responded: \"I don't think so.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21:05. Plaintiffs' counsel argued that when a person signs an initiative proposal, that is \"a personal decision\" indicating that that person \"personally wants to see this on the ballot.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21:30. Plaintiffs' counsel was then asked by the panel if it is true that when a person casts a vote or signs a signature relating to a school board measure, they may be taking their own family members' interests into consideration. Plaintiffs' counsel responded: \"I suppose to some extent that's true. That if I have a family and they're interested in a school board\" issue, \"that I'm expressing their interest.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22:03. Plaintiffs' counsel was then asked by the panel, in light of his response, \"Didn't the district court say something diametrically opposed to that,\" i.e., \"that signators do not fulfill any representational\" role?\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22:15. Plaintiffs' counsel responded: \"It's a different situation from voting for a representative who represents everyone in the district than it is for signing a petition. I think that's categorically different.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22:29. A panel member responded by stating to plaintiffs' counsel: \"You've just conceded something the opposite of what the district court said, that a signator can well have representational interests.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22:53. Plaintiffs' counsel responded: \"You're right.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 23:06.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In my view, this final statement by plaintiffs' counsel was not intended as an abandonment of any of the arguments he made preceding that, nor was it intended as a concession that the case at hand involves the principle of representational equality. Likewise, plaintiffs' counsel's acknowledgment that a signator may, when signing a petition, have in mind the interests of others in no way amounts to a concession that the principle of representational equality is at play here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Setting aside the purported concession by plaintiffs' counsel, the majority baldly concludes that the citizen initiative process, including the gathering of signatures for petitions, involves the principles of representational equality:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    In the direct democracy context, voters are able to directly advance the interests of non-voting members of their families and communities when they decide whether to support a citizen initiative. Although citizens, unlike elected representatives, are not \"subject to requests and suggestions\" from constituents,\n    their vote on citizen initiative petitions can be influenced by private discussions with non-voting friends, family, and neighbors. In this way, voting-eligible citizens assume a role similar to that of elected representatives when those voters engage in the initiative process.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Maj. Op. at 1141 (footnote omitted). Notably, but not surprisingly, the majority fails to cite to a single authority of any kind in support of that conclusion. And that is precisely because the conclusion is wrong. When an individual casts a vote or provides a signature, he or she is representing only himself or herself and no one else. Of course, a voter or signator may well have in mind the interests of others when casting a vote or providing a signature. For example, a voter may believe that a particular ballot measure is in the best interests of the people of his or her district or state. But that does not mean that the voter is officially representing anyone else, let alone all of the people in his or her district or state. To conclude otherwise would wreak havoc on our system of elections and, in turn, on the legal framework we have built to address voting-related legal issues. In the case at hand, for example, if a single signator is deemed to represent his or her senate district, then why require any additional signatures in order to assure that a proposed ballot measure carries sufficient support to be placed on the ballot? Or likewise, in terms of voting, why require more than one person in any given senate district to vote on a particular ballot initiative or office?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In the end, I agree with plaintiffs' counsel: a voter or signator represents only himself or herself. As a result, I conclude that the case at hand does not implicate the principle of representational equality and is thus distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     Did\n     <em>\n      Evenwel\n     </em>\n     completely reject the concept of voter equality?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    That leaves one final question regarding the possible impact of\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    on this case: did the Court in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    intend to completely reject or abandon the concept of voter equality? In addressing the parties' respective positions regarding what the Equal Protection Clause requires a jurisdiction to do when drawing state and local legislative districts, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    stated: \"we reject appellants' attempt to locate a voter-equality mandate in the Equal Protection Clause.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n     136 S.

Immediately thereafter, the Court explained: \"As history, precedent, and practice demonstrate, it is plainly permissible for jurisdictions to measure equalization by the total population of state and local legislative districts.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n     at 1126-27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Later in its opinion, the Court noted that appellants had \"extract[ed] far too much from selectively chosen language\" in the Court's prior decisions \"and the 'one-person, one-vote' slogan.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594939\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1120/#p1124\">\n     at 1131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In other words, I do not believe that it is reasonable to interpret the Court's statements as rejecting or abandoning the concept of voter equality for all contexts and disputes. To conclude otherwise would be to abandon or reject a long line of Supreme Court decisions, some of which arose in contexts other than the drawing of legislative districts, that explicitly recognize the right of individual voters to have their votes weighted equally to all other\n    voters. It would also mean, in practical terms, that a State could legitimately assign different weights to votes placed in different geographic locations within the State. For example, Colorado could, in terms of its ballot initiative process, require initiative proponents to gather signatures from ten thousand registered voters in each urban state senate district, while requiring initiative proponents to gather signatures from only one hundred registered voters in each rural state senate district.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Surely the Court in\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    did not intend such a result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    I therefore conclude that\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    does not preclude the type of voter equality claim that is being asserted by plaintiffs in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Analysis of plaintiffs' equal protection claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Supreme Court has long recognized that the Equal Protection Clause affords individual voters the right to have their votes weighted equally.

Br. at 22. Defendant argues that, \"[a]gainst\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    's backdrop, Amendment 71's geographic distribution requirement is fully consistent with the Equal Protection Clause's one-person, one-[vote] principle.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 25. He notes that \"Colorado's 35 state senate districts are approximately equal in total population, deviating no more than five percent between the most populous and the least populous district.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 25-26. He argues that \"[t]his is well within the presumptively permissible range established by the Supreme Court's precedent.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. \"At bottom,\" defendant argues, \"if\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    's total-population framework is adequate to protect the right to vote-a fundamental right-it is more than adequate to protect the lesser state-created right to sign an initiative petition.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In other words, defendant argues, \"[t]he Equal Protection Clause cannot logically demand different or more stringent protections for petition signers than it does for actual voters.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The chief problem with defendant's arguments, aside from being grounded on\n    <em>\n     Evenwel\n    </em>\n    , is that they ignore the fact that Amendment 71 does not rely solely on a total-population framework in imposing its 2% petition requirement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    To be sure, Amendment 71 makes a passing nod to total-population figures by requiring that a petition for an initiated constitutional amendment contain signatures from each state senate district in Colorado. But that is where its reliance on total-population figures ends. Amendment 71 then shifts course and mandates that the required signatures come not simply from residents of each state senate district, but rather from \"registered electors\" in each state senate district. And that is where the problem in this case lies. As the record establishes, there are significant variances in registered electors from one state senate district to another. And those variances in numbers of registered electors effectively undercut defendant's reliance on the relatively equal total population figures.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In the district court, defendant agreed that in 2012, Colorado's thirty-five state senate districts had total resident populations that varied from 140,096 to 147,272, but total voter registration numbers that varied from a low of 70,746 (Senate District 21) to a high of 128,777 (Senate District 31). Aplt. App. at 114-15. Defendant further agreed that as of February 22, 2018, the total voter registration numbers for the thirty-five state senate districts varied from a low of 82,477 (Senate District 21) to a high of 133,727 (Senate District 23), for a total variance of 44.41%.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 115-16. Thus, for 2012, the total resident populations of the state senate districts varied only 4.98%, but the total voter registration numbers varied by 58.17%.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    For 2018, the total voter registration numbers varied by 47.41%.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    These variances mean that voters who reside in state senate districts with the lowest numbers of total voters effectively wield greater power in determining whether initiated constitutional amendments make it onto the ballot. And, conversely, voters who reside in state senate districts with the highest numbers of total voters effectively wield less power in these determinations. For example, using the 2012 figures outlined above, only 1,415 registered voters in State Senate District 21 would have needed to sign a petition in order to satisfy Amendment 71's 2% requirement, whereas 2,576 registered voters in State Senate District 31 would have needed to sign the same petition. Similarly, using the 2018 figures outlined above, only 1,650 registered voters in State Senate District 21 would have needed to sign a petition in order to satisfy Amendment 71's 2% requirement, whereas 2,708 registered voters in State Senate District 23 would have needed to sign the same petition. In other words, using these same examples, in 2012, 1,415 voters in State Senate District 21 would have wielded the same political power as 2,576 voters in State Senate District 31. In 2018, 1,650 voters in State Senate District 21 would have wielded the same political power as 2,708 voters in State Senate District 23. Thus, in terms of voter equality, Amendment 71 is constitutionally problematic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Defendant argues, however, that \"[f]ederal court precedent uniformly upholds\n    laws like Amendment 71 that impose geographic distribution requirements on signature-gathering.\" Aplt. Br. at 27. But an examination of the four cases cited by defendant reveals that they are either distinguishable from the case at hand or, in one instance, flawed. In\n    <em>\n     Angle v. Miller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742713\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1122/#p1131\">\n     673 F.3d 1122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1126-27 (9th Cir. 2012), the first of those four cases, the Ninth Circuit upheld a challenge to a provision of the Nevada Constitution that required initiative proponents to obtain \"signatures from a number of registered voters equal to 10 percent of the votes cast in the previous general election,\" and to also \"meet the 10 percent signature threshold in each of the state's congressional districts.\" In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied on the principle \"that geographic distribution requirements are permissible for signature collection, so long as they involve districts with equal populations.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742713\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1122/#p1131\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742713\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1122/#p1131\">\n     at 1131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Notably, however, the plaintiffs in that case did not argue that variations in registered voter populations in each congressional district resulted in an Equal Protection violation, and in turn did not present any evidence of what the registered voter populations were in each congressional district. Thus, the case is distinguishable from the case at hand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Two of the cases cited by defendant involved challenges to laws that, unlike Amendment 71, required a specified number of signatures from each equally-populated district, rather than, as in the case at hand, a specified percentage of signatures from registered voters in each district.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Libertarian Party of Va. v.

Ind. 1976) (upholding an Indiana law requiring presidential candidates, in order to be placed on the primary ballot, to submit 500 signatures from each of the state's 11 congressional districts). Clearly, the laws at issue in these two cases-because they rely on specified numbers of signatures rather than percentages of registered voters in each district-would not present the same problems as Amendment 71.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In the fourth and final case cited by defendant,\n    <em>\n     Libertarian Party v. Bond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n     764 F.2d 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (8th Cir. 1985), the Eighth Circuit upheld a challenge to a Missouri law governing the formation of new political parties. The challenged law permitted the formation of a new political party if that party filed a timely petition (a) containing signatures from each state congressional district equal to \"at least one percent of the total number of votes cast in the district for governor in the last gubernatorial election,\" or (b) signed \"by the number of registered voters in each of one-half of the several congressional districts which [wa]s equal to at least two percent of the total number of votes cast in the district for governor at the last gubernatorial election.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20115.315\">\n     Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 115.315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4) (1978). In upholding this law, the Eighth Circuit noted, in pertinent part, that \"the Missouri congressional districts [we]re virtually equal in population, as the district boundaries were drawn in 1982 by a three-judge court with population equality as a foremost objective.\"\n    <em>\n     Bond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n     764 F.2d at 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Notably, the plaintiff also argued \"that the State's use of a formula based on a percentage of\n    <em>\n     votes cast\n    </em>\n    in each district in the preceding gubernatorial election, rather than a percentage of the\n    <em>\n     population\n    </em>\n    of each district, create[d] an impermissible discrimination amongst voters.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis in original). But the Eighth Circuit rejected this argument on the grounds that \"[t]he minimal variance [that] result[ed] ... d[id] not reflect an impermissible discrimination amongst voters.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, the court cited to a table outlining the number of votes that the law required in each of the nine state congressional districts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 544 n.4. Those numbers ranged from 4,266 signatures to 5,348 signatures.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378042\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/538/#p539\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 539 n.2. There is no indication, however, that the Eighth Circuit calculated the variance (which was approximately 22.5%). Instead, it appears that the Eighth Circuit's \"minimal variance\" comment/rationale was based solely on the raw numbers. And, to the extent that the Eighth Circuit silently calculated and relied on the true variance of 22.5%, it made no attempt to explain why it considered this variance \"minimal,\" particularly in light of existing Supreme Court precedent. Consequently, any conclusion that the variance of 22.5% was \"minimal\" was erroneous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    For these reasons, I think it is apparent that Amendment 71 violates plaintiffs' right to have their votes weighted equally to all other voters in Colorado. Under the analytical framework outlined by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , however, it is still necessary to balance the harm that Amendment 71 does to plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights against \"the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\"\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n     460 U.S. at 789\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n     103 S.Ct. 1564\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Unfortunately, defendant makes no mention of this analytical step in his appellate brief, nor does he expressly challenge the district court's analysis of this step.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Out of an abundance of caution, I will nevertheless proceed to review the interests that have been forwarded by defendant as justifications for the burden imposed by Amendment 71. In his appellate brief, defendant notes that prior to Amendment 71, \"an initiative proponent seeking to amend the state constitution could place an initiative on the statewide ballot by satisfying modest requirements that were among the loosest in the country.\" Aplt. Br. at 6-7. Defendant further notes that \"[b]efore Amendment 71, rural citizens had almost no voice in determining which measures appeared on the ballot, due to the relative ease of collecting signatures in heavily populated urban areas compared to sparsely populated rural areas.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9. Amendment 71, defendant asserts, \"was enacted to ensure that citizens from across Colorado's diverse geographical regions all have input into which measures are placed on the statewide ballot.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \"Amendment 71,\" defendant asserts, was also \"designed to strengthen the process for changing Colorado's constitution.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Thus, he asserts, \"Amendment 71 was meant to make the state constitution more stable and to spur increased citizen use of the\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    initiative process.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    These are, without question, valid state interests. But defendant does not argue that these interests outweigh the harm caused to plaintiffs' voting rights by Amendment 71. Indeed, defendant denies that Amendment 71 results in any violation of plaintiffs' rights. More importantly, the significance of the variances that result from Amendment 71's reliance on registered voter signatures convinces me that Amendment 71 cannot survive analysis under the balancing test in any event.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    I note, as a final matter, that Amendment 71 could be easily revised to eliminate the Equal Protection problem that results from its reliance on percentages of registered voters from each state senate district. For example, if Amendment 71 continued to require signatures from registered voters in each state senate district but required a set number of those signatures from each state senate district, that would seemingly eliminate the problem outlined above.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In conclusion, I agree with the district court that Amendment 71 effectively imposes a significant burden on plaintiffs' Equal Protection rights, and that this burden is not justified by the State's interests cited by defendant, particularly given the fact that Amendment 71 is susceptible to revisions that would wholly eliminate the Equal Protection problem.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Crawford v.

Under that framework, this court would apply the balancing test, rather than strict scrutiny, in examining Amendment 71.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-118\">\n     The majority suggests that\n     <em>\n      Anderson\n     </em>\n     's balancing test cannot be applied in this case because the case \"was resolved on a motion to dismiss\" and the record does not contain sufficient evidence to allow us to properly conduct that test. Maj. Op. at 1139-40 n.8. That is, however, an inaccurate characterization of both the procedural history of this case and of the record on appeal. The district court actually denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint and, in doing so, ordered defendant to show cause why final judgment should not enter in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant filed a response and objection to the district court's show cause order. Aplt. App. at 99. That response specifically addressed the\n     <em>\n      Anderson\n     </em>\n     balancing test and argued that it favored the defendant.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 104-108. The response also included and referenced multiple declarations, including two that discussed total population and registered voter data for all thirty-five Colorado counties for the years 2012 and 2018. Plaintiffs filed a written response to defendant's response and objection. Notably, plaintiffs did not object to or otherwise dispute the total population and registered voter data that was submitted and cited by defendant. Thus, contrary to the majority's assertion, there is, in fact, undisputed evidence in the record regarding the total population and registered voter figures for each Colorado state senate district. Moreover, the parties discussed the\n     <em>\n      Anderson\n     </em>\n     test at length in their district court pleadings.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     It simply cannot be the case, as defendant argues, that\n     <em>\n      Evenwel\n     </em>\n     effectively immunizes from Equal Protection challenges any voting-related law that relies in part on districts with equal total populations.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-120\">\n     These variances were calculated using the following steps for each set of figures: (1) subtract the lowest figure from the highest to arrive at A; (2) add the lowest figure and the highest figure and then divide that total by 2 to arrive at B; (3) divide A by B, then multiply that result by 100 to arrive at the percentage.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-121\">\n     The Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce (DMCC), in its amicus brief, argues that the district court \"should have followed Colorado [state law] interpretive guidelines and at least considered alternatives to invalidating the entirety of [Amendment 71's] statewide support requirement.\" Br. of Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce at 7. In particular, DMCC argues that the district court could have stricken \"the word 'registered' from subsection 2.5 of Amendment 71,\" thus making it necessary only for signatures to come from qualified voters.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 7-8. That change alone, DMCC argues, could have alleviated the potential Equal Protection problems posed by the \"registered voter\" signature requirement. It may well be true that this alteration, standing alone, could have alleviated the problems with Amendment 71. The problem, however, is that defendant never made this argument below, i.e., he never asked the district court to take this action (nor has he made the argument on appeal). Further, and relatedly, there is no evidence in the record regarding the numbers of qualified voters in each state senate district. Thus, it is impossible to determine whether this measure would actually alleviate the Equal Protection problem outlined above.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
