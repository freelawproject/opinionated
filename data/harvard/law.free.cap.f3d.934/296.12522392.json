A grand jury in the District of New Jersey charged Williams with two counts of conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts 1 and 3); and one count of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count 2).

Williams's conviction and sentence on Count 2, the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) count, was premised on the District Court's determination at sentencing that he brandished the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Williams appealed his judgment of conviction. This Court upheld the convictions but vacated the sentence and remanded for re-sentencing in light of\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On remand, the District Court re-imposed the same aggregate sentence of 224 months.

One of the issues raised was whether his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when he was sentenced to a consecutive seven-year term of imprisonment under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) for brandishing the firearm. Williams contended that he should have received a five-year term instead, for mere use or carrying of a firearm, \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i), as found by the jury. This Court held, based on the law at the time, that brandishing or discharging a firearm in violation of \u00a7 924(c) is a sentencing factor, rather than an element of the offense,\n   that a judge may find to increase a mandatory minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Williams has filed one previous\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   motion. It was denied by the District Court on July 7, 2010. He appealed to this Court, which issued an order denying a certificate of appealability on November 8, 2010. On May 10, 2016, Williams, through counsel, filed an application for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and on May 12, 2016, Williams filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
