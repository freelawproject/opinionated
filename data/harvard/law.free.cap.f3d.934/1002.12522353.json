Following his arrest, a Customs and Border Protection official seized Cano's cell phone and searched it, first manually and then using software that accesses all text messages, contacts, call logs, media, and application data. When Cano moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the warrantless searches of his cell phone, the district court held that the searches were valid under the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545805\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/952/\">\n    709 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc), we conclude that\n   <em>\n    manual\n   </em>\n   cell phone searches may be conducted by border officials without reasonable suspicion but that\n   <em>\n    forensic\n   </em>\n   cell phone searches require reasonable suspicion. We clarify\n   <em>\n    Cotterman\n   </em>\n   by holding that \"reasonable suspicion\" in this context means that officials must reasonably suspect that the cell phone contains digital contraband. We further conclude that cell phone searches at the border, whether manual or forensic, must be limited in scope to a search for digital contraband. In this case, the officials violated the Fourth Amendment when their warrantless searches exceeded the permissible scope of a border search. Accordingly, we hold that most of the evidence from the searches of Cano's cell phone should have been suppressed. We also conclude that Cano's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims are unpersuasive. Because we vacate Cano's conviction, we do not reach his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse the district court's order denying Cano's motion to suppress and vacate Cano's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. THE BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant-Appellant Miguel Cano worked in the flooring and carpet installation trade and lived with his wife and children in the Mission Hills community north of Los Angeles. In the summer of 2016, however, Cano moved from Los Angeles to Tijuana, Mexico, where he stayed with his cousin Jose Medina. While staying with Medina, Cano crossed the border into the United States six times, sometimes remaining in the United States for less than thirty minutes. On two of those trips, Cano was referred to secondary inspection, but no contraband was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 25, 2016, Cano arrived at the San Ysidro Port of Entry from Tijuana. In primary inspection, Cano stated that \"he was living in Mexico, working in San Diego, but going to LA on that day.\" Pursuant to a random Customs and Border Protection (CBP) computer referral, Cano was referred to secondary inspection, where a narcotic-detecting dog alerted to the vehicle's spare tire. A CBP official removed the spare tire from the undercarriage of the truck and discovered 14 vacuum-sealed packages inside, containing 14.03 kilograms (30.93 pounds) of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cano was arrested, and a CBP official administratively seized his cell phone. The CBP officials called Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which dispatched Agents Petonak and Medrano to investigate. After arriving, Agent Petonak \"briefly\" and manually reviewed Cano's cell phone, noticing a \"lengthy call log\" but no text messages. Agent Petonak later stated that the purpose of this manual search was \"two-pronged\": \"to find some brief investigative leads in the current case,\" and \"to see if there's evidence of other things coming across the border.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Agent Petonak proceeded to question Cano, who waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and agreed to talk. During that interview, Cano denied any knowledge of the cocaine. Cano stated that he had moved to Tijuana to look for work in nearby San Diego, because work was slow in Los Angeles. He also said he had crossed the border every day for the previous three weeks looking for work. He told Agent Petonak that he was headed to a carpet store in Chula Vista that day to seek work. When pressed, Cano was not able to provide the name or address of the store, claiming that he intended to look it up on Google after crossing the border. Cano also explained that he did not have his flooring tools with him in his pickup truck so as to avoid problems with border crossings; Cano intended to drive to Los Angeles to retrieve his tools if he located work in San Diego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the interrogation, Agent Petonak specifically asked Cano about the lack of text messages on his cell phone. Cano responded that his cousin had advised him to delete his text messages \"just in case\" he got pulled over in Mexico and police were to check his cell phone. Cano stated that he erased his messages to avoid \"any problems\" with the Mexican police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While Agent Petonak questioned Cano, Agent Medrano conducted a second manual search of the cell phone. Agent Medrano browsed the call log and wrote down some of the phone numbers on a piece of paper. He also noticed two messages that arrived after Cano had reached the border, and he took a photograph of the messages. The first message stated, \"Good morning,\" and the second message stated, \"Primo, are you coming to the house?\" Agent Medrano gave all of this information-the recorded list of calls and the photograph-to Agent Petonak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, Agent Medrano conducted a \"logical download\" of the phone using Cellebrite software. A Cellebrite search enables the user to access text messages, contacts, call logs, media, and application\n   data on a cell phone and to select which types of data to download. It does not, however, allow the user to access data stored within third-party applications. Agent Medrano typically does not select the option to download photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Agent Petonak interviewed Cano, he reviewed the results of the Cellebrite download of Cano's phone by Agent Medrano. The Cellebrite results revealed that Cano had sent no text messages, and it listed all the calls made by Cano. Agent Petonak later concluded that none of the phone numbers in the call log corresponded to carpeting stores in San Diego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Cano was indicted for importing cocaine. Before trial, Cano moved to suppress any evidence obtained from Agents Petonak and Medrano's warrantless searches of his cell phone at the border. The district court denied Cano's motion, ruling that the manual searches and the Cellebrite search of Cano's phone were valid border searches. During trial, the government introduced evidence that resulted from the manual searches of the phone and from Agent Medrano's Cellebrite download of the phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In preparation for trial, Cano indicated his intent to present a third-party culpability defense claiming that his cousin, Jose Medina, was responsible for placing the drugs in Cano's spare tire without Cano's knowledge. Cano proffered evidence that Medina had a key to Cano's car and had driven it shortly before Cano's attempted border crossing, that Medina had a criminal record including a conviction for cocaine possession, that Medina was a member of a Chicago-based gang called the Latin Kings, and that the Latin Kings sold cocaine within the United States and were involved with a cartel that trafficked drugs across the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following Cano's implication of Medina, the government contacted Medina and promised him immunity and immigration papers in exchange for his cooperation. Medina initially denied being involved with drugs, but later contacted the government on his own and offered to help them with the \"biggest RICO case\" and \"drug seizures of 20 to 25 kilograms at a time.\" All of this information was made available to Cano.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As part of his defense, Cano sought additional discovery from HSI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) regarding: (1) records linking Medina to drug sales, distribution, or trafficking; and (2) records linking the Latin Kings to drug trafficking from Mexico to Southern California. The government opposed Cano's discovery motion, arguing that the evidence was not material under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(E)(i) and that discovery should be limited to HSI, as neither the DEA nor the FBI had participated in the investigation of Cano. The district court originally overruled both objections, finding the evidence material under Rule 16 and exculpatory under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). The court also reasoned that, because HSI could inquire of the DEA and FBI if it sought inculpatory\n   evidence, HSI had access to the files and was required to provide any exculpatory evidence held by the DEA or FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response to the court's discovery order, HSI produced Medina's immigration file and his Bureau of Prisons record. Agent Petonak also searched for Medina's name in two different police clearinghouses, but neither returned any hits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Agent Petonak and the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) subsequently requested information showing a link between the Latin Kings and drug trafficking from Mexico from the legal counsel of both the FBI and DEA. Both agencies denied the requests without providing any explanation or any indication as to whether the requested information existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following these attempts, the government moved for the district court to reconsider its discovery order and excuse it from discovery relating to files held by the FBI and DEA. The district court granted the motion to reconsider, finding that the prosecutor did not have access to the evidence when he was \"rebuffed\" by agencies over which he had no control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The case proceeded to trial and Cano presented his third-party culpability defense. The first trial resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial. On retrial, Cano again relied on his third-party culpability defense. The second trial resulted in Cano's conviction. This appeal followed, in which Cano raises three issues: (1) whether the warrantless searches of his cell phone violated the Fourth Amendment and whether the resulting evidence should be suppressed; (2) whether the government's non-disclosure of materials that may have been held by the DEA and FBI violated his right to due process under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 ; and (3) whether the government raised an improper propensity inference in its closing argument. We address Cano's first two arguments in turn. Because we conclude that the district court erred in denying Cano's motion to suppress, we vacate Cano's conviction and do not reach his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. THE WARRANTLESS SEARCH OF CANO'S CELL PHONE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ordinarily, before conducting a search, police must obtain a warrant issued by a judicial officer based \"upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Warrants are generally required \"unless 'the exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Mincey v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p393\">\n    437 U.S. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p393\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p393\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) (citation omitted).

First, any search conducted under an exception must be within the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the exception. Second, some searches, even when conducted within the scope of the exception, are so\n   <em>\n    intrusive\n   </em>\n   that they require additional justification, up to and including probable cause and a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first constraint is illustrated by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

In\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed \"whether the police may, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested\"; in other words, whether cell phones fell within the scope of the search incident to arrest exception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court began by recognizing the increasing role in our lives of \"minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone\"; \"[m]odern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Impact of a Limited Scope for Border Searches\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Our conclusion that the border search exception is restricted in scope to searches for contraband implicates two practical limitations on warrantless border searches. First, border officials are limited to searching for contraband only; they may not search in a manner untethered to the search for contraband. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \"[t]he scope of the search must be 'strictly tied to and justified by' the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Manual searches of a cell phone at the border can be conducted without any suspicion whatsoever,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545805\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/952/\">\n    709 F.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and both agents were officers of HSI and thus had authority to conduct border searches,\n   <em>\n    Soto-Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493707\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/598/545/#p549\">\n    598 F.2d at 548-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , however, \"a search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p19\">\n    392 U.S. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p19\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Once Cano was arrested, Agent Petonak briefly searched Cano's phone and observed that there were no text messages. The observation that the phone contained no text messages falls comfortably within the scope of a search for digital contraband. Child pornography may be sent via text message, so the officers acted within the scope of a permissible border search in accessing the phone's text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Agent Medrano conducted a second manual search of the phone log and text messages on Cano's phone. Medrano, however, did more than thumb through the phone consistent with a search for contraband. He also recorded phone numbers found in the call log, and he photographed two messages received after Cano had reached the border. Those actions have no connection whatsoever to digital contraband. Criminals may hide contraband in unexpected places, so it was reasonable for the two HSI officers to open the phone's call log to verify that the log contained a list of phone numbers and not surreptitious images or videos. But the border search exception does not justify Agent Medrano's recording of the phone numbers and text messages for further processing, because that action has no connection to ensuring that the phone lacks digital contraband. Accordingly, to the extent that Agent Medrano's search of Cano's phone went beyond a verification that the phone lacked digital contraband, the search exceeded the proper scope of a border search and was unreasonable as a border search under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, because the border search exception is limited in scope to searches for contraband, border officials may conduct a forensic cell phone search only when they reasonably suspect that the cell phone contains contraband. We have held that a \"highly intrusive\" search-such as a forensic cell phone search-requires some level of particularized suspicion.\n   <em>\n    Cotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545805\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/952/\">\n    709 F.3d at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores-Montano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879348\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/149/#p152\">\n    541 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879348\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/149/#p152\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that just begs the question: Particularized suspicion of what? Contraband? Or evidence of future border-related crimes? Having concluded above that border searches are limited in scope to searches for contraband and do not encompass searches for evidence of past or future border-related crimes, we think the answer here is clear: to conduct a more intrusive, forensic cell phone search border officials must reasonably suspect that the cell phone to be searched itself contains contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Were we to rule otherwise, the government could conduct a full forensic search of every electronic device of anyone arrested at the border, for the probable cause required to justify an arrest at the border will always satisfy the lesser reasonable suspicion standard needed to justify a forensic search. As the Court pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , modern cell phones are \"minicomputers\" with \"immense storage capacity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20373\">\n    573 U.S. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such phones \"carry a cache of sensitive personal information\"-\"[t]he sum of an individual's private life\"-such that a search of a cell phone may give the government not only \"sensitive records previously found in the home,\" but a \"broad array of private information never found in a home in any form-unless the phone is.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cano requested that the U.S. Attorney's Office turn over any material held by HSI, the FBI, and the DEA relating to: (1) records linking his cousin Jose Medina to drug sales, distribution, and trafficking; and (2) documentation showing a link between the Latin Kings and drug trafficking through the United States-Mexico border. The district court found that both requests might produce evidence that was exculpatory under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and material under Rule 16, but limited Cano's discovery to only material held by HSI. The court concluded that the prosecutor did not have access to evidence held by the FBI and DEA, and thus had no obligation to provide such evidence, because both agencies had \"rebuffed\" the prosecutor's attempts to obtain information. Thus, the only issue raised on appeal is whether any material held by the DEA and FBI should be deemed \"within the government's possession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We find no evidence that the prosecution had knowledge or possession of evidence showing that Medina or the Latin Kings were involved in drug trafficking at the Mexico-California border. Medina had one drug-related conviction, and it was for simple possession of cocaine, not trafficking. Before trial, however, the prosecution team reached out to Medina and promised him immunity and immigration documents in exchange for cooperation and information concerning drug importation. Although Medina originally rebuffed the government, he eventually offered to work with the government and \"stated that he would be able to assist the Government with the ... biggest RICO ... case and drug seizures of 20 to 25 kilograms at a time.\" The district court found that Medina's statements \"spawn[ed] an inference that [he] is closely connected to the drug-traffickers in Tijuana.\" Based on this inference, Cano argues that the government had sufficient knowledge of a possible connection between Medina and drug trafficking to trigger the government's discovery obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Cano's argument, however, misstates the test we first set out in\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   . Cano has argued only that the prosecutor had knowledge that certain\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   might exist.

One of the HSI agents ran Medina's name through two different law enforcement clearinghouses-in which the FBI and DEA both participate-and neither search returned any hits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Moreover, the prosecutor did not have access to FBI or DEA files and thus was under no obligation to \"comb the files\" of the FBI and DEA for documents relating to Medina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have occasionally presumed\n   that a prosecutor has access to an agency's files where the prosecutor actually obtained inculpatory information from the agency, even if the agency was not involved in the investigation or prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412674\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/885/#p893\">\n    46 F.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the prosecutor had access to other inmates' prison files where the prosecutor was able to obtain the defendant's prison file from the Bureau of Prisons). Here, however, the U.S. Attorney's Office advised the district court that it did not obtain any evidence-inculpatory or exculpatory-from the FBI or the DEA. Following the district court's initial discovery order, HSI's agent-Agent Petonak-made a formal request to the legal counsel for the FBI and the DEA for any \"materials related to the Latin Kings importing cocaine from Mexico to the United States,\" but both agencies \"declined to provide [him] with any such information.\" Neither agency revealed whether any such information existed or provided a reason for its refusal. The U.S. Attorney's Office also reached out to the FBI and the DEA for Latin Kings-related discovery. That request was also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Cano argues that the FBI and DEA's refusal to turn over information in this particular case should not be determinative and that the test for access under\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   requires only that the U.S. Attorney's Office or investigating agency generally have access to this type of information. Cano points to evidence from both prosecution and defense witnesses that HSI regularly works with the FBI and the DEA; that \"interagency cooperation has been emphasized\" after September 11, 2001; that agents from the different agencies regularly access information for one another; that a DEA representative worked in Agent Petonak's office; and that agents are often cross-listed between agencies. From this, Cano argues that HSI generally has access to FBI and DEA files for inculpatory purposes, and thus asserts that the refusal of the FBI and DEA to provide information in this particular case should not relieve HSI of its discovery obligations. To rule otherwise, Cano contends, would allow these withholding agencies \"to effectively wall off exculpatory information from the government in a particular defendant's case, all the while providing the government free-flowing access to information in its overall investigations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although we are sympathetic to Cano's concerns regarding strategic withholding, the rule Cano urges us to adopt is much too broad.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and Rule 16 obligations are case specific.
