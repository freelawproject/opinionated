Jacob Anderson (Jacob) died of hypothermia in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 15, 2013. His father, William Anderson (Anderson), brought this suit alleging federal constitutional and state tort claims against the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, and several city and county employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted defendants' motions to dismiss with prejudice. Anderson appeals the dismissal of his constitutional claims, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fall of 2013, Jacob was a 19-year old freshman at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He was an active member of the university community. On the night of December 14, 2013, he attended a party with several other students. He left around 11:15 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jacob was discovered the next morning, lying face down in the snow in a remote area of Minneapolis near the Mississippi River. The passerby who found him called 911 at 8:44 a.m. The first responders, employees of the Minneapolis Fire Department, arrived on the scene ten minutes later. The fire department defendants, some of whom were certified emergency medical technicians, performed a 30-second check on Jacob's pulse by holding his wrist, which was frostbitten and cold to the touch. Failing to find a heartbeat, the fire department defendants pronounced him dead at 8:57 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having declared Jacob dead, the fire department defendants cancelled the ambulance and called police to the scene. However, the paramedics had already arrived. The paramedic defendants spoke with the fire department defendants but did not separately evaluate Jacob's condition and left after about two minutes. Several police officers arrived next. Shortly after the first police defendants arrived, the fire department defendants left. The police treated the area as a potential crime scene and notified the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office at 10:30 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The medical examiner's office sent two investigators to the scene. After conducting an examination of Jacob's body, which was still where it had been found almost two hours earlier, the investigators called defendant Assistant Medical Examiner Mitchel Morey, M.D. Based on the investigators' report, Morey did not visit the scene. Eventually, the medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and determined that Jacob died of hypothermia. The autopsy listed the time of death as 8:48 a.m. Anderson alleges that Jacob may have in fact died several hours later, after emergency responders had declared him dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hypothermia is a medical condition that occurs when a body falls below 95 degrees Fahrenheit and cannot produce enough heat to replace what it loses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 86. Frostbite is a medical condition that occurs when the skin and underlying tissues freeze. App. 87. Hypothermia and frostbite act together in ways that often disguise signs of life and make it particularly difficult for first responders to determine whether an individual is actually dead or just in a severely hypothermic condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite appearances, individuals can make remarkable recoveries from even severe hypothermia. App. 88. As a result, first responders are trained to provide treatment even to apparently deceased hypothermia victims. For example, Minneapolis Fire Department standard operating procedures prescribe that first responders \"[b]egin CPR immediately when [a] patient is found cold in a cold environment.\" App. 93. The Hennepin EMS protocol specifically notes that \"clinical signs of death may be misleading\" and instructs medical personnel to transport any bodies with a temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit in a cold environment to facilities prepared \"for active internal rewarming.\" App. 104. Anderson alleges that Jacob passed away because these guidelines were not followed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Anderson and his wife, Kristi Anderson, filed a complaint in the district court against individual responders\n   and the entities that responded to the 911 call. The complaint listed Anderson as the personal representative of Jacob's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 9, 2017, more than three years after Jacob's death, Anderson was appointed as trustee for Jacob. On April 19, 2017, Anderson filed the operative Second Amended Complaint, alleging four causes of action under federal law and two causes of action under state law. The district court dismissed both state law causes of action, finding that, under Minnesota law, the claims were required to be brought by an appointed trustee within three years of Jacob's death. Anderson does not appeal that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court also dismissed the federal claims, all of which were brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging violations of Jacob's substantive due process rights by first responders and their employing municipalities. Although it held that a different statute of limitations governed those claims and they were therefore properly before the court, the district court concluded that qualified immunity barred the claims against the individual defendants. Anderson could not show that the individual defendants had violated Jacob's substantive due process rights because he could not show that the state actors had created or exacerbated the danger to Jacob, placed Jacob \"in custody,\" or alleged conduct sufficiently \"conscience-shocking\" to give rise to a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the district court found no individual liability, it dismissed the claims against the city and county defendants too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Anderson timely appeals the federal claims advancing the single argument that the district court erred in finding qualified immunity, because the individual defendants created or exacerbated the danger to Jacob.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before reaching the merits of the dispute, \"[w]e begin with jurisdiction, which is always our first and fundamental question.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin v.

The defendants claim that we lack jurisdiction because this action was not brought by an appointed trustee within three years of Jacob's death as Minnesota state survival law requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20573.02\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 573.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1. The district court thoroughly addressed this argument and correctly concluded that it (and we) have jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the district court explained, we look to Minnesota's survivorship statute only to determine\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   can bring a \u00a7 1983 action on behalf of a deceased individual.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Guled v.

We do not incorporate other rules-like the limitations period-that are found in that statute. Rather, as we have held several times, the limitations period for all \u00a7 1983 actions in Minnesota comes from the state's personal injury statute and is set at six years.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Egerdahl v.

Because Jacob has failed to identify a clearly established right, we hold the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a general rule, state actors are not liable for failing to save individuals in life-threatening situations. The due process clause is not \"a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security\" and it does not \"impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that [its citizens'] interests do not come to harm through other means.\"\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v.

Anderson argues that happened here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We need not reach the merits of this argument if the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \"The qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

While it seems likely that the contours of a regulation regarding punishing prisoners will be informed at least in part by the Eighth Amendment, there is no reason to think that medical guidelines for first responders enshrine duties arising out of the Fourteenth Amendment. That the medical guidelines were not followed here could possibly be the basis for a negligence suit, but it is not the basis for a constitutional one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We also reject Anderson's argument that qualified immunity is inapplicable because the first responders were not executing discretionary functions.
