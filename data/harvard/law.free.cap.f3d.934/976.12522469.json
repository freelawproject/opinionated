In 2005 and 2006, Amazon restructured its European businesses in a way that would shift a substantial amount of its income from U.S.-based entities to newly created European subsidiaries. Because the restructuring would allow the European entities to generate income using Amazon's pre-existing intangible assets developed in the United States, the tax code and corresponding regulations required that the European entities compensate Amazon for the use of assets that meet the regulatory definition of an \"intangible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The compensation was provided through a cost sharing arrangement, whereby Amazon and a holding company for the European subsidiaries would be treated as co-owners of the intangibles. Under the arrangement, the holding company was required to make a \"buy-in\" payment for the pre-existing intangibles Amazon contributed to the arrangement and to make cost sharing payments going forward for its share of future research and development (R&amp;D) efforts. The buy-in payment was taxable income to Amazon, and the holding company's cost sharing payments would reduce Amazon's U.S. tax deductions for R&amp;D costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To guard against manipulation by jointly controlled entities, the regulations require that the buy-in payment reflect the fair market value of the pre-existing intangibles made available under a cost sharing arrangement. Amazon initially reported a buy-in payment of about $255 million. Appellant, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, concluded that the buy-in payment had not been determined at arm's length in accordance with the transfer pricing regulations, so the IRS performed its own calculation, valuing the buy-in at about $3.6 billion. Amazon filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the IRS's valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the tax court proceedings, Amazon and the Commissioner offered competing methods for valuing Amazon's pre-existing intangibles. There was a key difference between the parties' respective approaches. Amazon's methodology isolated and valued only the specific intangible assets that it transferred to the European holding company under the cost sharing arrangement, including website technology, trademarks, and customer lists. The Commissioner's methodology essentially valued the entire European business, minus pre-existing tangible assets. That method necessarily swept into the calculation all contributions of value, including those that are more nebulous and inseparable from the business itself, like the value of employees' experience, education, and training (known as \"workforce in place\"), going concern value, goodwill, and other unique business attributes and expectancies (which the parties refer to as \"growth options\"). The tax court sided primarily with Amazon, and the Commissioner appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case requires us to interpret the meaning of an \"intangible\" in the applicable (but now outdated) transfer pricing regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case turns on whether, as the Commissioner argues, the regulatory\n   definition is broad enough to include all intangible assets of value, even the more nebulous ones that the Commissioner refers to as \"residual-business assets\" (i.e., Amazon's culture of innovation, the value of workforce in place, going concern value, goodwill, and growth options). We conclude that the definition does not include residual-business assets. Although the language of the definition is ambiguous, the drafting history of the regulations shows that \"intangible\" was understood to be limited to independently transferrable assets. We thus affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before summarizing Amazon's corporate restructuring and the procedural history of this case, we first provide an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework for transfer pricing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When a taxpayer sells or licenses its property, including intangible assets, to another entity, the purchase price or license royalty is taxable income.

As new intangibles continue to be developed, the value of the license changes and becomes open to dispute for tax purposes on an ongoing basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As an alternative to licensing, the regulations authorize jointly controlled entities to enter a cost sharing arrangement, under which they become co-owners of intangibles developed as a result of the entities' joint R&amp;D efforts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.482\">\n    Treas.

First, the subsidiary must make an arm's length \"buy-in\" payment reflecting the value of the pre-existing intangibles the parent contributes to the arrangement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If a controlled participant makes pre-existing intangible property in which it owns an interest available to other controlled participants for purposes of research in the intangible development area under a qualified cost sharing arrangement, then each such other controlled participant must make a buy-in payment to the owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.482\">\n    Treas.

The buy-in payment is taxable income for the entity contributing the intangibles-here, Amazon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the subsidiary must pay a share of the intangible development costs (or R&amp;D) \"equal to its share of reasonably anticipated benefits attributable to such development.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.482\">\n    Treas.

If the controlled taxpayer incurs the lion's share of the intangible development costs, the subsidiary is required to make cost sharing payments to reflect its share of the anticipated benefits. The subsidiary's cost sharing payments serve to reduce the deductions the controlled taxpayer can take for R&amp;D costs (thereby increasing tax liability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Amazon is an online retailer that began operating in the United States in 1995. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Amazon expanded operations into France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Amazon's business in Europe had a siloed structure, with separate European subsidiaries independently operating and managing the business, each subsidiary having its own\n   website, fulfillment centers, and customer base. The European subsidiaries licensed the right to use Amazon's website technology, customer information, and marketing intangibles (including trademarks and domain names).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To address operational inefficiencies in Europe, in the early 2000s Amazon investigated options for creating a centralized European headquarters. Amazon ultimately located its new headquarters in Luxembourg, which offered a central location, the lowest value-added tax rate in Europe, and a relatively low corporate tax rate. Beginning in 2004, Amazon undertook a series of transactions to implement its plan for centralizing business operations in Europe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Amazon formed Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS (\"AEHT\") and transferred to AEHT the pre-existing European subsidiaries, their operating assets, and their preexisting intangible rights (i.e., those developed in Europe). Amazon and AEHT also entered a cost sharing arrangement-the transaction most pertinent to this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the arrangement to be a \"qualified cost sharing arrangement\" under the transfer pricing regulations outlined above, AEHT needed to pay Amazon for the pre-existing intangibles Amazon contributed to the arrangement. To determine the amount of this \"buy-in,\" Amazon hired a tax firm, which concluded the pre-existing intangibles were worth $217 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under the cost sharing arrangement, AEHT also makes cost sharing payments to Amazon for its share of ongoing intangible development costs. Amazon reported cost sharing payments from AEHT of about $116 million for 2005 and about $77 million for 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The IRS rejected Amazon's calculation of AEHT's buy-in, concluding that Amazon grossly undervalued the intangibles Amazon made available to AEHT. Applying a discounted-cash-flow valuation methodology, the IRS determined a buy-in payment of $3.6 billion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amazon filed a petition in the tax court challenging the IRS's valuation. Amazon argued that the cost sharing arrangement covered three distinct groups of transferred assets-website technology, marketing intangibles, and European-customer information-that must be valued separately using a methodology referred to in the transfer pricing regulations as the comparable uncontrolled transaction method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After a six-week trial that included testimony and written reports of thirty expert witnesses, the tax court concluded that the Commissioner abused his discretion in determining that the discounted cash flow methodology supplied the best method for determining an arm's length buy-in payment and in determining that the required payment is $3.468 billion.\n   <em>\n    Amazon.Com, Inc. v.

The Commissioner argues both elements are satisfied. First, he argues that Amazon's growth options \"derive their value from intangible, rather than physical, attributes.\" He then cites testimony from Amazon's expert (Dr. Bradford Cornell) that Amazon's growth options are primarily attributable to its culture of innovation. Second, he argues that the value of Amazon's growth options is independent of the services of any individual because they are \"part of the culture of Amazon to be able to have creative ideas bubble up in their organization and actually use them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Amazon argues that the Commissioner's interpretation of the catchall provision is too sweeping for several reasons. Amazon's central argument is that to qualify as an \"intangible\" under the regulation, an item must be capable of being bought and sold independently of the business-and residual-business assets are inseparable from the business. The tax court agreed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amazon.Com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20T.C.%20108\">\n    148 T.C. at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that, unlike the specific intangibles listed in the regulation, \"workforce in place, going concern value, goodwill, and what trial witnesses described as 'growth options' and corporate 'resources' or 'opportunities' ... cannot be bought and sold independently\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Amazon offers several arguments in support of its position that assets that are inseparable from the business do not meet the regulatory definition of an \"intangible.\" Quoting\n   <em>\n    Arcadia v.

After all, if all 28 listed items share a common attribute, why would anyone understand a catchall for \"similar items\" to include a non-listed item that doesn't share that attribute? Amazon's commonality argument falters, however, because the catchall provision did not simply say \"[o]ther similar items.\" Instead, the catchall elaborated by explaining how an item is determined to be \"similar\" to the other items: \"if it derives its value not from its physical attributes but from its intellectual content or other intangible properties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.482-4\">\n    Treas.

The definition of an \"intangible\" is susceptible to, but does not compel, an interpretation that embraces residual-business assets. The problem is that residual-business assets, such as \"growth options\" and a \"culture of innovation,\" are amorphous, and it's not self-evident whether such assets have \"substantial value independent of the services of any individual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%201.482-4\">\n    Treas.

Amazon raises legitimate concerns about the regulation's catchall being stretched too far, and those concerns likely bear on which party has the more reasonable view of the regulatory definition. It nonetheless remains that the definition of \"intangible\" could be construed as covering residual-business assets if the language of \u00a7 1.482-4(b) is viewed in isolation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   But we are required to look at the regulatory scheme \"as a whole,\" viewing the regulatory \"definition in the context of the entire [transfer pricing] regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Alaska Trojan P'ship v.

The Commissioner argues that other regulations governing transfer pricing support his view that the regulatory definition of an \"intangible\" embraces residual-business assets.

But the expert explained at trial the difference between an investor or purchaser of the entire business (who would pay for the full value of the business) and a partner (who would not). The question becomes whether a cost sharing arrangement is akin to the sale of a business or like a partnership in certain assets or aspects of the business.

First, in 1993, Treasury confirmed that the then-existing definition of \"intangible\" did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include residual-business assets when it asked for comments on whether the definition of intangibles \"should be\n   <em>\n    expanded\n   </em>\n   to include items not normally considered to be items of intellectual property, such as work force in place, goodwill or going concern value.\" 58 Fed. Reg. at 5312 (emphasis added). Second, a year later after opting against such an expansion, and instead retaining the same essential definition from before (including the same list of 28 items), Treasury explained that the final (1994) rule merely \"clarified\" when an item would be deemed similar to the 28 items listed in the definition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034971\">\n    59 Fed. Reg. at 34983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Commissioner is thus forced to argue that what Treasury explicitly confirmed would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be considered an \"intangible\" without a substantive \"expan[sion]\" of the definition was implicitly added to the definition through a non-specific \"clarifi[cation].\" The Commissioner's argument stretches \"clarification\" beyond its commonly understood meaning of merely clearing up what was previously ambiguous or otherwise restating a standard consistent with what was previously intended.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motorola, Inc. v.

Treasury's temporary regulations in 1993 defined an \"intangible\" as \"any commercially transferable interest\" in the intangibles listed in section 936(h)(3)(B) that had \"substantial value independent of the services of any individual.\" 58 Fed. Reg. at 5287. When Treasury left out the \"commercially transferrable\" language from the final regulations issued a year later, it explained that the omitted language was \"superfluous\" because \"if the property was not commercially transferrable, then it could not have been transferred in a controlled transaction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034971\">\n    59 Fed.

This is consistent with the basic premise of the transfer pricing regulations, which contemplate a situation in which particular assets are\n   <em>\n    transferred\n   </em>\n   from one entity to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Commissioner now contends that the 1994 definition was intended to embrace residual-business assets even though such assets \"cannot be transferred independently.\" Yet the Commissioner fails to identify any contemporaneous statement by the agency that would \"display awareness\" that it was changing its position on whether residual-business assets are included within the definition of intangibles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

To that end, the proposed regulations provided rules for determining whether a taxpayer has substantially misstated the value of property.

Reg. at 5312. Considering the context, Treasury's use of \"goodwill\" in \u00a7 1.6662-5 but not in \u00a7 1.482-4(b) most likely evinces an intent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to include goodwill or other residual-business assets within \u00a7 1.482-4(b) 's definition of \"intangible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Amazon points to other Treasury regulations that define certain covered property by incorporating the definition of intangible property under section 936(h)(3)(B) and then adding goodwill and going concern value.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201.954-2\">\n    Treas.
