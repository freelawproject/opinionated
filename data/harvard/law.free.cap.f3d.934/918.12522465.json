In this case, current and former minor league baseball players allege that\n   the American tradition of baseball collides with a tradition far less benign: the exploitation of workers. We are tasked with deciding whether these minor league players may properly bring their wage-and-hour claims on a collective and classwide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Most major professional sports in America have their own \"farm system\" for developing talent: for the National Basketball Association, it's the G-League; for the National Hockey League, it's the American Hockey League; and for Major League Baseball (MLB), it's Minor League Baseball. MLB and its thirty franchise teams rely heavily on this extensive minor league system, which has nearly 200 affiliates across the country and employs approximately 6,000 minor league players. Nearly all MLB players begin their careers in the minor leagues. Each minor league club is associated with one of the thirty franchise MLB teams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The minor league system is governed by the Major League Rules (MLRs), which dictate the terms of employment and compensation for both minor and major league players. Under the MLRs, all minor league players are required to sign a seven-year Uniform Player Contract (UPC). Ostensibly, players are required to sign the UPC for \"morale\" and \"to produce the similarity of conditions necessary for keen competition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The UPC \"obligates Player[s] to perform professional services on a calendar year basis, regardless of the fact that salary payments are to be made only during the actual championship playing season.\" It describes its scope as setting \"the terms and conditions of employment during all periods in which Player is employed by Club as a Minor League Player.\" Players are paid by the MLB franchise affiliated with the minor league team for which they play. Under the UPC, first-year players are paid a fixed salary of $1,100 per month during the regular (\"championship\") season that runs from April through September. In addition to their salaries during the championship season, some players receive signing or performance-related bonuses and college scholarships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in early March each year, the minor league affiliates conduct spring training in Arizona and Florida; every MLB franchise operates a minor league training complex in one of these two states. The parties dispute whether spring training is required, but the UPC strongly indicates that it is mandatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Virtually all players are unpaid during spring training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Spring training lasts approximately four weeks, until the championship season begins in April. Some players attest that spring training entails working seven days a week, with no days off. During spring training, teams typically have scheduled activities in the morning prior to playing games in the afternoon. For example, a team spring training schedule for one of the San Francisco Giants' affiliates describes that at 6:30 AM, there was an \"Early Van for Treatment and Early Work\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; at 7:00 AM, the \"Regular Van\" departed; at 7:45 AM, the \"Early Work\" began; and then between 9:00 AM and\n   11:00 AM, the team would perform activities such as \"Stretch,\" \"Throwing Program,\" and \"Batting Practice.\" Lunch was to be at 11:00 AM, before a 12:10 PM bus to a neighboring city for a 1:00 PM away game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the conclusion of spring training in early April, some players are assigned to minor league affiliates, and begin playing games in the championship season. During the championship season, minor league teams play games either six or seven days per week. The championship season lasts around five months, beginning in April and ending in September. One of the regular season leagues within minor league baseball is the California League, which-as the name implies-plays games exclusively within California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Players who are not assigned to play for affiliates in the championship season stay at the Arizona or Florida facilities for \"extended spring training.\" Extended spring training continues until June, and involves similar activities to spring training. Although most players do not get paid during extended spring training, as many as seven MLB clubs do pay for work during extended spring training due to an ambiguity in the MLRs over when players are permitted to be paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the championship season ends in September, some players participate in the \"instructional leagues,\" which run from approximately mid-September to mid-October. The parties dispute whether participation in the instructional leagues is mandatory for the players involved, although as with spring training, the UPC strongly implies that participation is required. Activities and schedules during the instructional league are similar to spring training. And just as with spring training, players are virtually never paid for participation in the instructional league.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs are forty-five current and former minor league baseball players who bring claims under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the wage-and-hour laws of California, Arizona, and Florida against MLB, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, and a number\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of MLB franchises. Plaintiffs allege that defendants do not pay the players at all during spring training, extended spring training, or the instructional leagues. They further allege that because players are \"employees\" and the activities the players perform during those periods constitute compensable work, defendants have unlawfully failed to pay them at least minimum wage. And according to plaintiffs, while the players are paid-albeit not much-during the championship season, they routinely work overtime, for which they are never compensated as a matter of policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2015, plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which alleged wage-and-hour claims under the laws of eight states and the FLSA; plaintiffs also sought certification of a FLSA collective action. The district court preliminarily certified the FLSA collective in October 2015. Notice was sent to approximately 15,000 current and former minor league players, of which more than 2,200 opted in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2016, defendants moved to decertify the FLSA collective, while plaintiffs moved to certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class as well as Rule 23(b)(3) classes under the laws of eight states. The district court denied certification for all proposed Rule 23(b)(3) classes, concluding that predominance was\n   not satisfied for two primary reasons.\n   <em>\n    Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n    315 F.R.D. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572, 577-84 (N.D. Cal. 2016). First, the court concluded that predominance was defeated by the choice-of-law issues presented by the proposed classes, given that (1) the winter off-season training claims entailed work performed in dozens of different states with no common schedule or situs; and (2) the championship season claims involved frequent travel between state lines for away games.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n    at 580-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court also determined that the inclusion of claims for winter off-season work fatally undermined predominance, as the court would be required to undertake an overwhelming number of individualized inquiries to determine which activities constituted compensable \"work\" and how much time was spent doing \"work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n    at 577-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For similar reasons, the court held that plaintiffs were not \"similarly situated\" and therefore decertified the FLSA collective.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/523/#p572\">\n    at 585-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court further refused to certify the proposed Rule 23(b)(2) class, concluding that because the plaintiffs were all former-rather than current-players, they lacked standing to represent a (b)(2) class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    at 584-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration, narrowing their proposed classes significantly in response to the concerns the district court expressed in its initial certification order. Plaintiffs requested Rule 23(b)(3) certification of an Arizona class and a Florida class for work performed during spring training, extended spring training, and the instructional leagues in those states. Plaintiffs also moved for certification of a 23(b)(3) California class, covering players who participated in the California League during the championship season. Additionally, plaintiffs sought to certify a reworked FLSA collective of players who participated in the California League or in spring training, extended spring training, and the instructional leagues. In addition to the 23(b)(3) classes and FLSA collective, plaintiffs requested certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive relief class consisting of current minor league players who participate in spring training, extended spring training, or the instructional leagues in Florida or Arizona. To cure the court's earlier concerns about standing, four current minor league players moved to intervene to represent the proposed (b)(2) class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On reconsideration, plaintiffs argued that they could meet Rule 23(b)(3) 's predominance requirement and FLSA's \"similarly situated\" requirement through a combination of the use of representative evidence and application of the so-called \"continuous workday\" rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' representative evidence took a variety of forms, including an expert survey (the \"Main Survey\"), hundreds of team schedules, payroll data, and testimony from both players and league officials. The most controversial piece of evidence was the Main Survey, which plaintiffs argued served as representative evidence of hours worked,\n   particularly when used in concert with a continuous workday theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Main Survey asked players to report the times they \"most often\" arrived and departed from the ballpark or training facility during the championship season, spring training, extended spring training, and the instructional leagues, and asked players to estimate how much time they spent eating meals while at the ballpark. The survey did not, however, ask players about the kinds of activities they performed at the facilities, or how much time they spent performing particular activities. Given these purported shortcomings, defendants moved to exclude the Main Survey, and further argued that even if the survey were admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , it still could not be used to meet the predominance and \"similarly situated\" requirements due to its alleged flaws. The district court denied defendants' motion to exclude the Main Survey, finding it admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and concluding that defendants' challenges went \"to the weight of the Survey and not its admissibility\" and were \"better left to a jury to evaluate.\" The district court further concluded that the Main Survey could be used in combination with other evidence-such as team schedules, testimony, and payroll data-to meet Rule 23(b)(3) 's predominance and FLSA's \"similarly situated\" requirements, observing that certifying the classes and the FLSA collective \"will not preclude Defendants from challenging the sufficiency of the Main Survey and Plaintiffs' damages model on summary judgment and/or at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because it concluded that the predominance and \"similarly situated\" requirements could be met with the use of representative evidence and application of the continuous workday rule, the district court recertified the narrowed FLSA collective and certified a California (b)(3) class. However, the district court denied certification for the Arizona, Florida, and (b)(2) classes, holding that choice-of-law concerns defeated predominance for the Arizona and Florida classes and undermined \"cohesiveness\" for the (b)(2) class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At defendants' request, the district court certified the FLSA collective certification order for interlocutory review under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs petitioned us for permission to appeal the denial of certification for the Arizona, Florida, and Rule 23(b)(2) classes, and defendants likewise petitioned to appeal the certification of the California class; we granted both petitions, consolidating those cross-appeals with the FLSA collective appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review for abuse of discretion the district court's class certification rulings, and review for clear error any findings of fact the district court relied upon in its certification order.\n   <em>\n    Parsons v.

For their part, plaintiffs challenge the district court's decision to deny certification for the Arizona and Florida Rule 23(b)(3) classes and the Rule 23(b)(2) class on the grounds that choice-of-law issues defeated the predominance requirement for the Arizona and Florida (b)(3) classes and also thwarted \"cohesiveness\" for the proposed (b)(2) class. Defendants, on the other hand, contest the district court's certification of the California (b)(3) class, arguing first that choice-of-law issues defeat both predominance and adequacy, and second, that plaintiffs cannot meet the predominance requirement through the use of their proffered representative evidence: the Main Survey, team schedules, payroll records, deposition testimony, and declarations. Defendants further charge that the district court erred in certifying the FLSA collective because plaintiffs' representative evidence does not show that the collective members are \"similarly situated.\" Defendants also contend that the district court erred by not \"rigorously analyzing\" plaintiffs' expert evidence at the class and collective certification stage. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.

Here, plaintiffs proposed classes under two of Rule 23(b) 's class types: Rule 23(b)(3) and 23(b)(2). A class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) only if the district court \"finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).

The district court's decision was split on the impact of choice-of-law questions: as to the proposed Rule 23(b)(3) California class, the court held that choice-of-law concerns defeated neither Rule 23(b)(3) 's predominance requirement nor Rule 23(a) 's adequacy requirement. Yet as to the proposed 23(b)(3) Arizona and Florida classes, the district court held the opposite: that choice-of-law issues posed an insurmountable hurdle to meeting both predominance and adequacy.

The defendants argued that Illinois law should apply to\n   Hilligoss' work in California because the time he spent in California was a small proportion of his overall career (around two months out of a six-year career). The district court, however, correctly read\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   as indicating that California law should nonetheless apply to Hilligoss' California work.

Borchers, Dkt. No. 21, at 12-13 (hereinafter \"Professors' Amicus Brief\"). If the law of the state in which work is performed is not the law that generally applies, employers and employees alike would be subjected to an unworkable scheme. Employers would be required to properly ascertain the residency status-itself not necessarily an easy task, as any student or seasonal worker could attest-of each of its employees. For every nonresident employee, employers would then have to determine whether the wage laws of that employee's state of residence apply extraterritorially, and then come up with\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   rules for each of its employees according to their state of residence and any extraterritorial application of their home state's laws. This would mean that at a single worksite, employees working side-by-side in the same position would not only be owed vastly different minimum wages, but also that an employer would need to set different rules for meal and rest breaks for different employees, and so on and so forth. It cannot be in any state's legitimate \"interest\" to foist such an administrative nightmare upon both employers and employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Such a scenario would also result in an enormous competitive advantage-or disadvantage-for prospective employees based solely on their state of residency. Employers would be incentivized to hire residents of states with low minimum wages and otherwise employer-friendly wage laws, while residents of states with higher minimum wages and more protective employment laws would suddenly be far less appealing. Amici Professors Hays and Borchers persuasively point out that as defendants would have it, a college student still domiciled in Seattle while attending a Nebraska university would have to be paid $15 per hour at a part-time job in Nebraska, \"nearly double Nebraska's minimum wage of $8 per hour.\" Professors' Amicus Brief at 13. This, of course, would put the student at a crushing disadvantage; what rational employer would hire her?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, given the administrative cost involved in attempting to comply with a patchwork of multiple states' wage laws at a single workplace, some employers might instead choose to stick to hiring only resident employees, or perhaps only non-resident employees from a particular state (presumably one with a low minimum wage and minimally protective employment laws).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We do not foreclose the possibility that there could be some circumstances in which a proper application of California's choice-of-law rules might lead to the application of another state's wage and hour laws to work performed in California. Nor do we create a per se rule or an unrebuttable presumption. We hold only that, given the above considerations, we are more than satisfied that the district court did not err in concluding that under\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , California law applies to the California class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We next address whether the district court erred in determining that choice-of-law considerations defeated predominance and adequacy for the proposed Arizona and Florida Rule 23(b)(3) classes, and conclude that the district court's determination must be reversed. Our conclusion is animated in part by several of the considerations outlined above, which apply with equal force to the Arizona and Florida classes. Moreover, the aforementioned enormous practical implications of a contrary holding would be just as problematic and unworkable in Arizona and Florida as in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With those considerations in mind, we apply California's three-step governmental interest analysis, and conclude that Arizona law should apply to the work performed in Arizona, and Florida law to the work performed in Florida.

Defendants contend that the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs had demonstrated predominance for two main reasons: (1) because the Main Survey asked only about arrival and departure times at the ballpark and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   about what activities the players actually performed while at the ballpark, plaintiffs cannot rely on the continuous workday theory because there is no way to determine the beginning or end of the \"workday,\" and (2) the Main Survey revealed significant variations in players' arrival and departure times, even among players employed by the same MLB franchise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This task requires us to address the proposed Arizona and Florida classes separately from the California class. As an initial matter, however, we note that despite defendants' repeated suggestions to the contrary, the representative evidence offered by plaintiffs was not limited to just the Main Survey, nor are observational studies the only type of evidence permitted to fill in evidentiary gaps under\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   .

Given the differences in the types of claims brought by the California class as compared to the Arizona and Florida classes, certification of the California class is more complex and requires additional analysis. Unlike the Arizona and Florida classes, the California class brought claims relating to work performed during the championship season-a time when the players\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   get paid, albeit not much. As a result, in order to prove liability on their overtime claims, the California class must show that its members worked more than 8 hours in a day, more than 40 hours in a week, and/or worked 7 days in a workweek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    Cal.

Likewise, to establish liability on their minimum wage claims, the California class must demonstrate that they worked hours for which they were not paid at least minimum wage-but whereas the Arizona and Florida classes can demonstrate liability simply by showing they worked any hours, the California class's burden is made more challenging by the fact that the players receive some pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201182\">\n    Cal.

Nonetheless, a number of considerations lead us to affirm the district court's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, as with defendants' uniform policy of not paying players for participation outside of the championship season, defendants do not credibly dispute that their policy is to never pay overtime and to pay a fixed salary, regardless of the actual number of hours worked. We reiterate that common corporate policies like this \"carry great weight for certification purposes,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo Home Mortg. Overtime Pay Litig\n   </em>\n   ., 571 F.3d at 958, and that predominance is \"rarely\" defeated in cases where such uniform policies exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 23:33 (5th ed. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, the team schedules alone-independent of the Main Survey or any other evidence-may suffice to show overtime liability. As the district court noted, plaintiffs' expert testified that approximately 65-85% of California League players had at least one workweek with games on all seven days, and that nearly half of all workweeks included games on all seven days. For those workweeks, the players\n   would be entitled to overtime pay for their work on the seventh day of the workweek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Third, and most significantly, we are persuaded that under\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   , the representative evidence plaintiffs offered was adequate to meet their burden at this stage. As we observed in the preceding section, defendants do identify multiple legitimate criticisms of the Main Survey, and it is certainly possible that a jury may not find the Main Survey-even in combination with all of plaintiffs' other evidence-adequate proof of liability (or at least not to the extent plaintiffs allege). In particular, a jury may be persuaded by defendants' arguments that players did not begin compensable work upon arriving at the ballpark or that players stopped engaging in compensable work long before they left the ballpark, such that the Main Survey's estimated arrival and departure times are insufficient to clear the preponderance hurdle. As we explain below, however,\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   counsels that such criticisms do not doom certification here\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   no reasonable jury could conclude that the combination of the Main Survey and plaintiffs' other representative evidence was probative of the amount of time players actually spent performing compensable work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1045\">\n    136 S.

Second, the Court is now persuaded that the payroll records maintained by Defendants will allow any variations in compensation to be analyzed without burdensome individualized inquiries. This is especially true as to the spring training, extended spring training and instructional league claims because players generally were not compensated for their participation in these activities and the small fraction of players who\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive compensation for these activities can be identified using payroll records maintained by Defendants. Third, as discussed above, the Court finds that the defenses asserted by Defendants to the FLSA present common questions that are not likely to be overwhelmed by the need to conduct individualized inquiries. Finally, the possibility that the Court will be required to apply the laws of numerous states (or at a minimum, conduct numerous choice of law inquiries) is not present as to the FLSA class, which will require the Court to apply only federal wage and hour law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendants' arguments in support of reversal echo those they make in relation to the Rule 23(b)(3) classes, and we reject\n   them for largely the same reasons.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1045\">\n    136 S.

Specifically, for these time periods, two common legal questions drive the litigation: are the players employees, and do the activities they perform during those times constitute compensable work? As nearly all players are unpaid during these time periods, if the answers to those two questions are resolved in plaintiffs' favor, liability may be established by showing that the players performed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   We also affirm the district court's certification of the FLSA collective as to plaintiffs' overtime claims, although this holding requires additional explanation. Critical to our decision is that plaintiffs allege a single, FLSA-violating policy-the failure to pay overtime under any circumstances-and argue a common theory of defendants' statutory violations: that defendants \"suffer or permit\" plaintiffs to perform compensable work before and after scheduled practice and game times. These are \"similar issue[s] of law or fact material to the disposition of their FLSA claims,\" thus making plaintiffs \"similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518509\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/1090/\">\n    903 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No wonder the district court concluded that consideration of the plaintiffs' claims on a classwide basis would be overwhelmed by individualized choice-of-law inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Yet the majority feels empowered to cut through all these complexities by applying a simple rule of its devise: just apply the law of the jurisdiction where the work took place. Under this simple formula, each class can readily be certified without any fuss. One may admire the simplicity of this rule-but unfortunately, it is contrary to our framework for analyzing the intersection of class action and choice-of-law issues, overlooks the complexity of California's choice-of-law rules, and creates significant practical and logistical problems. I therefore dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The plaintiffs in this case are current or former Minor League Baseball players who played during the period from 2009 to 2015. They sued Major League Baseball (MLB) (which they argue is a joint employer of all minor league players) and the MLB Clubs for which they worked for violations of federal and state labor laws, including the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, state minimum wage laws, and state overtime laws. The plaintiffs argue that they were entitled to the minimum wage and overtime rates established by California, Arizona, or Florida for work they performed in those states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   MLB is an unincorporated association headquartered in New York. The MLB Clubs, which are corporate entities that own MLB teams, are members of the MLB. All told, there are 30 MLB Clubs, based in 17 states throughout the United States (with one Club located in Canada). The MLB Clubs employ around 6,000 minor league players. Each of these players signs a Uniform Player Contract, which governs the employment relationship between the player and an MLB Club. The Uniform Player Contract contains a New York choice-of-law provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Each MLB Club is associated with at least six minor league affiliate teams; most Clubs have seven or eight. Minor league affiliate teams are loose associations or groups, rather than corporate entities; they do not function as employers. The minor league teams are located in one of 44 different states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Each spring, each Major League Club sends its minor league players to spring training in either Arizona or Florida. Following spring training, the Club assigns selected employee-players to play on one or more of its minor league affiliate teams. Employees who are not selected to play on an affiliate team remain at the Arizona or Florida facilities for extended spring training. The Clubs reassign their employee-players to different minor league affiliate teams throughout the five-month championship season, sometimes playing on a minor league team for only a single game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   During each championship season, the affiliate minor league teams play against\n   other teams in one of several minor leagues. One of these minor leagues, the California League, is comprised of eight to ten minor league affiliate teams. During the 2010 through the 2015 championship seasons, a total of 2,113 minor league players were assigned to play for affiliate teams in the California League. While the California League plays its championship season games only in California, the players participating in the California League are employees of MLB Clubs located in one of six different states: California, Arizona, Ohio, Colorado, Washington, or Texas. Several of the plaintiffs in this appeal who played in the California League during the championship season worked for MLB Clubs located outside of California. For example, Ryan Kiel, who played in the California League on the Bakersfield Braves during part of the 2012 championship season, is a resident of Florida and an employee of the Cincinnati Reds, a Club headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Brad McAtee, a New York resident and another representative of the California class, worked for the Colorado Rockies, a club headquartered in Denver, Colorado; he trained or played in Washington, Arizona, California, and New York. And another California class representative, Mitch Hilligoss, resides in Illinois and was employed by both the New York Yankees and the Texas Rangers. He played not only in California, but also in Arizona, Texas, and South Carolina during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. In short, the potentially affected jurisdictions include: (1) Arizona and Florida, where the employees trained for varying lengths of time; (2) the states in which the players reside, which includes at least 19 states (only accounting for the 61 class representatives); and (3) the states in which the players' employers (the 22 MLB Clubs) are located. Because the employees argue that MLB (headquartered in New York) is also an employer, and because the Uniform Player Contract provides that the laws of New York apply to any dispute under the contract, New York minimum wage and overtime law is likewise applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Plaintiffs initially sought certification of eight classes under Federal Rule of Procedure 23(b)(3): a California class, a Florida class, an Arizona class, a North Carolina class, a New York class, a Pennsylvania class, a Maryland class, and an Oregon class. The district court declined to certify the plaintiffs' proposed classes, in part because they presented significant choice-of-law problems that could not be handled on a classwide basis. The plaintiffs then moved for reconsideration, narrowing the proposed classes to the Florida and Arizona classes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the California class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The proposed Arizona class consists of players who are employees of Major League Baseball Clubs located in 14 states, who are residents of at least 13 states (only accounting for the 25 class representatives), and who were assigned to spring training in Arizona for four weeks or more. The proposed Florida class consists of players who are employees of Major League Baseball Clubs located in 17 states, who are residents of at least 13\n   states (only accounting for the 29 class representatives), and who were assigned to spring training in Florida for four weeks or more. The proposed California class consists of 2,113 players who are employees of the 11 Major League Baseball Clubs that had affiliate teams in the California League during the 2010 through 2015 championship seasons, who are residents of at least 11 states (only accounting for the named class representatives), and who played on an affiliate team in the California League during the 2010 through 2015 championship seasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The district court declined to certify a Florida class and an Arizona class of plaintiffs under Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It held that under California choice-of-law principles, the problems that would have to be navigated in order to adjudicate the claims of the Florida and Arizona classes presented significant individualized issues that could not be handled on a classwide basis.

In other words,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   rejected the very approach that the majority now adopts, and instead,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the determination of which state's law applies requires a careful analysis of each relevant state's law and policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Second, the majority's argument that practical considerations compel the adoption of a general rule has the situation entirely backwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The only practical consideration flagged by the majority is that, absent a rule that the hours and wage laws of the situs always apply to workers within its borders, Maj. Op. at 936, employers would be required to properly ascertain the residency status of each of its employees, to track applicable state laws, and to determine which law applies, Maj. Op. at 932\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Such a concern does not arise if the state law at issue merely requires a resident employer to pay each of its employees according to the resident state's laws, even when the employee is working temporarily in another state. In other words, if an MLB Club in Ohio paid each of its player-employees pursuant to Ohio overtime law, the MLB Club would have no extra burden at all. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , the majority fails to recognize that states may enact many different types of laws, and that conflicts between state laws can be resolved through the application of choice-of-law rules.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915496\" index=\"506\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/51/1191/\">\n    51 Cal. 4th at 1201-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"507\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20185\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"508\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20P.3d%20237\">\n    254 P.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   On the other hand, the rule the majority establishes today could have dire consequences for employers and employees. For example, a rule requiring that the law of the situs always applies would require employers to research and comply with various states' laws whenever their employees traveled for short conferences or business meetings. An employer would have to research applicable state law whenever an employee traveled across state lines, including when an employee was in transit. Presumably, when an employee traveled across state lines by car or airplane, the employer would need to track the amount of time the employee spent in each state during travel in order to comply with this rule. Such a rule would make it difficult for employers to compensate interstate truck drivers or traveling salespersons. Moreover, the majority's rule would also burden employees who would no longer be protected by the laws of their resident state or employer's state while traveling for work, forcing the employees to earn less money for work travel. Rather than adopting a rule that the law of the situs applies, the better solution is faithfully adhering to long-established choice-of-law principles, which resolve the issue in a reasonable and time-tested way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Because it is not possible to derive a general rule from\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , and California's choice-of-law rules weigh against any such rule, the majority should have considered the applicability of California's choice-of-law rules to the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Given that a minimum of 22 states potentially have an interest in applying their wage and hour laws, and that (as the majority concedes) there are material differences between the states, applying California's\n   three-step governmental interest test would be a significant task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   First, as a threshold matter, the court must analyze the contractual choice-of-law provision (i.e., New York) in the governmental law analysis under\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2008201\" index=\"509\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/3/459/#p465\">\n    3 Cal. 4th at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"510\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20330\">\n    11 Cal.Rptr.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%201148\">\n    834 P.2d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.

Moreover, the plaintiffs argue that the MLB, a New York-based entity, is also an employer. The players themselves hail from at least 11 states, even if only the 26 class representatives named in this lawsuit were included in the class. In addition, 68.7% to 74.7% of the players who were assigned to a minor league affiliate in the California League also played as a member of a minor league affiliate in a different state during the 2010 to 2015 championship seasons. Approximately 11% of the proposed class members from the 2010 championship season were assigned to an affiliate in the California League for one week or less.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   requires that the court weigh each relevant jurisdiction's interest in applying its laws, including all of the relevant variables: whether the players are employed by an out-of-state MLB Club; whether the players are nonresidents of California; whether the players spent only a short time in California; whether any other state's law might apply; and whether that state's interest in applying its own law outweighs California's interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915496\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/51/1191/\">\n    51 Cal. 4th at 1202-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20185\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20P.3d%20237\">\n    254 P.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the choice-of-law inquiries cannot be neatly solved with a law-of-the-situs rule as the majority suggests, individual choice-of-law issues also appear to defeat predominance for the California class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   No doubt the analysis of the intersection between Rule 23(b)(3) 's predominance inquiry and California's choice-of-law inquiry is multilayered and complex, particularly in a case like this one, involving different types of wage and hour claims, employers residing in multiple states, employees residing in multiple states, and three states where work was performed. But the majority errs in attempting to sidestep the analysis entirely in one fell swoop by the simple expedient of declaring that each jurisdiction generally has a predominant interest in regulating conduct that occurs within its borders, a conclusion that is contrary to the requirement that California courts undertake the governmental interest analysis in every case. Although the majority gives lip service to the possibility of exceptions to this rule, its failure to consider all the variables in this case to determine whether any exception was applicable\n   here gives the lie to such claimed flexibility. Because the majority's conclusion that courts can sidestep a choice-of-law analysis by relying on a general rule is contrary to our precedents, and because it will impose burdens on employers and disadvantage employees in many circumstances, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    The Florida and Arizona classes were defined (respectively) as including \"[a]ny person who, while signed to a Minor League Uniform Player Contract, participated in spring training, instructional leagues, or extended spring training in [Florida or Arizona] on or after Feb 7, 2009, and had not signed a Major League Uniform Player Contract before then.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    The California class was defined as \"[a]ny person who, while signed to a Minor League Uniform Player Contract, participated in the California League on or after February 7, 2010, and had not signed a Major League Uniform Player Contract before then.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Rule 23(b)(3) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n    A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n    (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.

Maj. Op. at 933-35. In other words, because the California Supreme Court has expressed a strong interest in regulating wage and hour claims within its borders, the majority assumes that Arizona and Florida have the exact same interest. To support this assumption, the majority cites California cases which determined-after the application of the governmental interest test-that a particular foreign state had a superior interest in having its law applied. The majority fails to identify any Arizona or Florida opinion expressing such an interest, however. This is clearly wrong. Although the district court is bound to apply the\n    <em>\n     choice-of-law\n    </em>\n    provisions of California (the forum state), the district court may not impute California's interest in regulating conduct within its borders to Arizona and Florida.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    The majority notes that, in many cases, state \"courts have looked closely at where the relevant work is performed\" to determine whether to apply the state's laws extraterritorially. Maj. Op. at 936 n.13. Certainly, state courts look to where the work is performed as one factor to determine which state's law applies. The majority errs by concluding that where the work is performed is effectively the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    relevant factor in the choice-of-law analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
