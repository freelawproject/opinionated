Their veterinarians prescribed cat food manufactured by Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., and sold under Hill's \"Prescription Diet\" brand. For several years Vanzant and Land purchased this higher-priced cat food from their local PetSmart stores using their veterinarian's prescriptions. They eventually learned, however, that the Prescription Diet cat food is not materially different from nonprescription cat food. And the prescription requirement is illusory; no prescription is necessary. Feeling deceived, Vanzant and Land filed a class-action lawsuit against Hill's and PetSmart, Inc., asserting claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILL. COMP. STAT. 505/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district judge dismissed the Consumer Fraud Act claim for two reasons: (1) the complaint lacked the specificity required for a fraud claim; and (2) the claim is barred by a statutory safe harbor for conduct specifically authorized by a regulatory body-here, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). The judge dismissed the unjust-enrichment claim because it was premised on the same conduct as the statutory claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We reverse. First, the safe-harbor provision does not apply. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , pet food intended to treat or prevent disease and marketed as such is considered a drug and requires approval of a new animal drug application. Without FDA approval, the manufacturer may not sell it in interstate commerce and the product is deemed adulterated and misbranded. The FDA issued guidance recognizing that most pet-food products in this category do not have the required approval; the guidance states that the agency is less likely to initiate an enforcement action if consumers purchase the food through or under the direction of a veterinarian (among other factors guiding the agency's enforcement discretion). But the guidance does not specifically\n   <em>\n    authorize\n   </em>\n   the conduct alleged here, so the safe harbor does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   And the plaintiffs pleaded the fraud claim with the particularity required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So the statutory claim may proceed. The unjust-enrichment claim is more appropriately construed as a request for relief in the form of restitution based on the alleged fraud. In Illinois unjust enrichment is not a separate cause of action but is a condition brought about by fraud or other unlawful conduct.\n   <em>\n    Toulon v. Cont'l Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265867\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/725/#p741\">\n    877 F.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (7th Cir. 2017). The request for restitution based on unjust enrichment therefore rests entirely on the consumer-fraud claim, and it too may move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case comes to us from a dismissal at the pleadings stage, so we recount the facts as alleged in the amended complaint. Hill's Pet Nutrition manufactures a variety of pet food, and this case concerns its Prescription Diet brand. Hill's sells its Prescription Diet pet food through veterinarians and pet-food retailers, though consumers may purchase it from a retailer only with a veterinarian's prescription. PetSmart sells pet supplies and pet food, including Hill's Prescription Diet brand. Consumers need a veterinarian's prescription to purchase Hill's Prescription Diet food at PetSmart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2013 Holly Vanzant's cat Tarik underwent emergency surgery for bladder stones. At a follow-up appointment, Tarik's veterinarian prescribed Hill's Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline Bladder Health cat food. That same day Vanzant purchased the food at a PetSmart store. Inside she saw marketing materials indicating that the cat food is \"prescription only,\" and the label on the bag read \"Hill's Prescription Diet.\" PetSmart provided her with a pet prescription card listing Tarik's name, prescription number, and prescription date. For three years Vanzant purchased Hill's Prescription Diet cat food from PetSmart, paying a higher price than for nonprescription food. She showed the prescription card to the cashier each time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Land had a similar experience. In October 2013 a veterinarian diagnosed her cat Chief with diabetes and prescribed Hill's Prescription Diet m/d Feline Glucose/Weight Management cat food. Within a few weeks, Land purchased Hill's Prescription Diet cat food at a PetSmart store. She too saw marketing materials inside the store indicating that the food is meant to treat or control diabetes. PetSmart provided Land with a pet prescription card listing Chief's name, prescription number, and prescription date. For two years Land purchased Hill's Prescription Diet cat food from PetSmart, paying a higher price than for nonprescription food. She too showed the prescription card each time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Vanzant and Land eventually learned they were not receiving what they expected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   They thought prescription pet food was medically necessary for the health of their pets, had been approved by the FDA, and could not be sold legally without a prescription. But the FDA had not approved it, and nothing required that it be sold with a prescription. They filed a proposed class action in state court against Hill's and PetSmart alleging claims for violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act and unjust enrichment. The defendants removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss it under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judge granted the motion. He held that the Consumer Fraud Act claim is foreclosed by the statute's safe-harbor provision, which shields actions authorized by laws administered by a regulatory body. Specifically, the judge relied on an FDA Compliance Policy Guide, which he construed as regulatory authorization for \"the gate-keeping role of veterinarians in ensuring that pet owners purchase only appropriate therapeutic foods.\" The judge also concluded that Vanzant and Land failed to plead the consumer-fraud claim with the particularity required by Rule 9(b). With no underlying fraud claim remaining, the judge likewise dismissed the unjust-enrichment claim. Vanzant and Land appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The defendants rely on this factor as evidence that the FDA specifically authorizes the prescription requirement.

These are separate categories; deceptive conduct is distinct from unfair conduct. A claim under the Consumer Fraud Act may be premised on either (or both), but the two categories have different pleading standards. If the claim rests on allegations of deceptive conduct, then Rule 9(b) applies and the plaintiff must plead with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\n   <em>\n    Camasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p736\">\n    761 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the complaint must identify the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" of the alleged fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the other hand, \"[a] plaintiff may allege that conduct is unfair ... without alleging that the conduct is deceptive.\"\n   <em>\n    Siegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700528\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/932/#p934\">\n    612 F.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To determine\n   whether a practice is unfair, Illinois courts consider three factors: whether it \"offends public policy\"; is \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\"; or \"causes substantial injury to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Live Nation Entm't, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239632\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/827/#p830\">\n    746 F.3d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (7th Cir. 2014). A plaintiff need not satisfy all three factors; \"[a] practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Ill.%20Dec.%20879\">\n    266 Ill.Dec. 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=775%20N.E.2d%20951\">\n    775 N.E.2d at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). And because fraud is not a required element, Rule 9(b) 's heightened pleading standard does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Windy City Metal Fabricators &amp; Supply, Inc. v. CIT Tech. Fin. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763916\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/663/#p670\">\n    536 F.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670 (7th Cir. 2008). Finally, under either theory of the case, the plaintiff must adequately plead causation-more specifically, he must allege that but for the defendant's deceptive or unfair conduct, he \"would not have been damaged.\"\n   <em>\n    Siegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700528\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/932/#p934\">\n    612 F.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The complaint alleges that the defendants' marketing practices are both deceptive\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   unfair. Taking the first category first, the complaint alleges that the prescription requirement, prescription label, and related marketing materials for Hill's Prescription Diet pet food are deceptive because no prescription is necessary and there is no material difference between the \"prescription\" food and nonprescription food. Hill's and PetSmart respond that the complaint is deficient because it does not allege that Vanzant and Land relied on the deceptive representations when purchasing Hill's Prescription Diet food. This argument misconstrues Illinois law. \"[R]eliance is not an element of statutory consumer fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"223623\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/174/482/\">\n    174 Ill.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n    675 N.E.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (1996). Rather, it's the plaintiff's \"damage,\" not his purchase, that must occur \"as a result of\" the deceptive act or practice.\n   <em>\n    Oliveira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20Ill.%20Dec.%2014\">\n    267 Ill.Dec. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 N.E.2d at 160. Indeed, it was enough in\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiffs' purchases \"occurred after the allegedly fraudulent statements.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20Ill.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    221 Ill.Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20584\">\n    675 N.E.2d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, the complaint alleges that the prescription requirement, prescription label, and associated marketing materials for Hill's Prescription Diet were deceptive; that Vanzant and Land saw the specific \"prescription\" language and symbols when they made their purchases; that the prescription pet food was something less than they expected; and that they suffered damages because they paid a higher price. These allegations detail the \"who,\" \"what,\" and \"how\" of the fraud claim with particularity.\n   <em>\n    Camasta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151433\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/732/#p736\">\n    761 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The complaint also alleges the \"when\" and \"where\" of the fraud. Vanzant saw marketing materials for Prescription Diet pet food before purchasing the cat food at PetSmart in February 2013 and thereafter. Land saw similar marketing materials before purchasing Prescription Diet cat food from PetSmart in November 2013 and thereafter. Nothing more is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In short, the complaint pleads a deceptive-practices claim to the degree of particularity required by Rule 9(b). That's enough to reverse the dismissal of the Consumer Fraud Act claim, so it's not necessary to address the adequacy of the allegations under the unfair-practices theory of the case. As we've noted, an unfair-practices claim has no fraud element and therefore is not subject to a heightened pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The complaint also seeks restitution for unjust enrichment. \"Under Illinois law, unjust enrichment is not a separate cause of action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Med. Benefits Tr. v. Walgreen Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086352\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/436/#p447\">\n    631 F.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (7th Cir. 2011). Rather, it's a condition brought about by fraud or other unlawful conduct.\n   <em>\n    Toulon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265867\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/725/#p741\">\n    877 F.3d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the request for relief based on unjust enrichment is tied to the fate of the claim under the Consumer Fraud Act.\n   <em>\n    Cleary v.
