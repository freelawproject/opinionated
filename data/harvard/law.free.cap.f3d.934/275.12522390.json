We are now asked to decide whether the same is true when the envelope does not, on its face, show the account number but does display an unencrypted \"quick response,\" or \"QR,\" code that reveals the number when scanned. The District Court held that such conduct violates the FDCPA. We agree and will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts underlying this appeal are undisputed. Donna DiNaples had a credit card through Chase Bank. Eventually, she fell behind on her payments, so Chase assigned her account to a debt collection agency called MRS BPO, LLC (\"MRS\"). MRS sent DiNaples a collection letter as a pressure-sealed envelope that had a QR code printed on its face. QR codes, including the one here, can be scanned by a reader downloadable as an application (better known as an \"app\") on a smartphone. And this QR code, when scanned with a QR-code reader, revealed the following sequence: \"LU4.###1813.3683994.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The string \"LU4.###1813\" was the internal reference number associated with DiNaples's account at MRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DiNaples filed a class action lawsuit against MRS, alleging that the collection agency, by printing the QR code on the envelope, had violated the FDCPA, which prohibits debt collectors from \"[u]sing any language or symbol, other than the debt collector's address, on any envelope when communicating with a consumer by use of the mails.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(8). Each side eventually filed a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Court granted DiNaples's motion on liability, concluding that MRS violated the FDCPA. The District Court explained that this conclusion was required by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Douglass\n   </em>\n   , in which we held that a debt collector violates \u00a7 1692f(8) by placing on an envelope the consumer's account number with the debt collector.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185756\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/299/\">\n    765 F.3d at 303, 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pa. Nov. 21, 2017). The District Court further rejected MRS's contention that DiNaples had not \"suffered a concrete injury,\" explaining that DiNaples was injured by \"the disclosure of confidential information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205593471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the District Court rejected MRS's argument that it was protected by the FDCPA's \"bona fide error defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The District Court also certified the proposed class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties thereafter stipulated that, to the extent that there was liability, the damages would be $11,000. The District Court granted judgment for DiNaples and the class for that amount, and this timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We consider first a jurisdictional issue -- DiNaples's standing to sue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court, while it did determine that DiNaples had suffered a concrete injury,\n   never explicitly addressed standing, seemingly assuming it was a non-issue.

As explained above with respect to standing, the harm here is still the same -- the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. And if such disclosure was not benign, disclosure via an easily readable QR code is not either. Protected information has still been compromised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   MRS argues that\n   <em>\n    Douglass\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. There, the account information was on the face of the envelope, capable of being seen by all. Here, by contrast, the envelope facially displayed no connection to debt collection. It just revealed a QR code, which is facially neutral and appears on many commercial mailings. Any account information, according to MRS, is hidden from public sight and could only be seen by \"unlawfully scanning\" the envelope. MRS Br. 24 n.3. MRS suggests that \"scanning\n   the QR Code on an envelope addressed to another is akin to opening a letter addressed to another.\" MRS Br. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We are not persuaded. While we do not decide here whether a benign language exception to \u00a7 1692f(8) exists, it would apply only to language truly benign relative to the purposes of the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185756\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/299/\">\n    765 F.3d at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e cannot find language exempt from \u00a7 1692f(8) if its disclosure on an envelope would run counter to the very reasons Congress enacted the FDCPA.\"). If, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Douglass\n   </em>\n   , disclosure of a debtor's account number is an invasion of privacy, it follows that disclosure of a QR code embedded with that number is not benign. A QR code is still \"susceptible to privacy intrusions,\" even if it does not facially display any \"core information relating to the debt collection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185756\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185756\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/299/\">\n    at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no material difference between disclosing an account number directly on the envelope and doing so via QR code --the harm is the same, especially given the ubiquity of smartphones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether it is illegal to scan someone's mail, as MRS argues, is beside the point.
