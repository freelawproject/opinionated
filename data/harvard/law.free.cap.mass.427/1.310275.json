L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (Mass.) (BFI), appeals from a jury verdict that it unlawfully fired the plaintiff, Brian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>A. Dartt, because of a handicap, an earlier work-related injury to his back. BFI maintained that Dartt\u2019s prior injury played no role in its decision to terminate him, and that he was terminated because he was grossly negligent when a BFI tractor-trailer that he was operating flipped over. The jury awarded Dartt $83,000 in back pay, $16,000 in emotional distress damages, and $175,000 in punitive damages. BFI filed posttrial motions and Dartt filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees. After a hearing, the judge denied BFI\u2019s motions and awarded Dartt substantially all of his attorney\u2019s fees. We granted BFI\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">We rule that to establish a prima facie case of unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of handicap under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), a plaintiff must present credible evidence that (1) he is handicapped within the meaning of the statute; (2) he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) he was terminated or otherwise subject to an adverse action by his employer; and (4) the position he had occupied remained open and the employer sought to fill it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 541 (1995). See also <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 441 (1995). It is not a requirement that a plaintiff show, as part of his prima facie case, that he was terminated \u201csolely\u201d because of his handicap. In this case the judge\u2019s instructions were generally consistent with these requirements. We nevertheless conclude that a new trial is required because two of the judge\u2019s rulings, described below, constitute prejudicial error. We also conclude that Dartt presented insufficient evidence to support the punitive damages awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">From 1985 until 1992, when he was terminated, Dartt was employed by BFI as a truck driver, first in Colorado and later in Tyngsborough. Dartt operated a ten-wheel tractor-trailer used to transport and dump large loads of waste. In March, 1990, Dartt injured his back when he fell from a trailer while attempting to secure a canvas flap. BFI\u2019s safety review board determined that Dartt was not at fault for that accident. As a result of his injury, Dartt was required to undergo two operations and he was unable to work for almost two years. BFI paid Dartt $61,389 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits for that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">On May 19, 1992, approximately two months after returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>to full-time work, Dartt had another accident that precipitated this lawsuit. On that day, the vehicle that Dartt was operating flipped over while he was dumping a load of sludge at a landfill in Rochester, New Hampshire. After he had backed the vehicle to an appropriate location, Dartt engaged the hydraulic dumping mechanism located in the cab of the vehicle to raise the trailer bed. He aborted that initial process when he observed through the vehicle\u2019s mirrors that the trailer was rising unevenly. Dartt then moved the vehicle forward to what he thought was more level ground, and commenced the dumping procedure a second time. He testified that, while he watched through two side mirrors as the trailer rose, he reached down for a soda located in a plastic lunch box placed to the right of the driver\u2019s seat. To retrieve the soda, Dartt removed the lid on the plastic cooler and then transferred the soda bottle from one hand to the other. Dartt testified that \u201cthe next thing [he] knew,\u201d the truck had flipped and was lying on its side. Dartt did not sustain any injury, but the accident caused damage to the tractor-trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Dartt immediately telephoned Ernest G. Stone, the district safety manager for BFI, and informed him of the accident. Stone traveled to the landfill to investigate. Dartt told Stone that the vehicle had tipped over while he was reaching for the soda. He testified that he also told Stone that, in his view, the sludge load had stuck to one side of the trailer, creating an imbalance that had caused the vehicle to tip over.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The following morning BFI\u2019s management review board consisting of Stone, Ronald Greenwood, BFI\u2019s district manager, and Donald Butler, Dartt\u2019s immediate supervisor, met to discuss the accident. Based on his observations at the site and on his interview with Dartt, Stone informed the others that it was his view that Dartt had not been paying attention to what he was doing when the truck flipped on its side. Greenwood directed Stone to terminate Dartt for violating BFI\u2019s safety policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A few days later, at his request, Dartt met with Greenwood and Butler to explain the accident. Greenwood told Dartt that he would look into the matter, but Dartt heard nothing further from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>On May 31, 1992, after Stone had told Dartt he was terminated, BFI\u2019s safety review board met to review the accident. The role of the safety review board in employee discipline matters, as described in BFI\u2019s policy and procedures manual, is to determine whether an accident was \u201cpreventable.\u201d The board, composed of managers and other employees, reviews all aspects of the accident with the driver involved, then presents its findings to the district manager for- evaluation, and possible disciplinary action, including termination. The driver also is informed of the board\u2019s decision, and he may appeal it. The manual provides that after a third \u201cpreventable\u201d accident in any twelve-month period, a driver \u201cmay\u201d be subject to discharge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case the board concluded that the accident could have been prevented by Dartt. Although the manual provided that \u201cthe board will review all aspects of the accident with the driver involved,\u201d Dartt was not informed of the board meeting. Other than this incident, Dartt had a safe driving record, as documented by BFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Dartt never claimed that he was injured in the second accident. He argued that he was fired because BFI was concerned that he might file a new claim for workers\u2019 compensation, and that BFI wanted to avoid paying him any such compensation. There was evidence that before this accident BFI was concerned about containing what it perceived were escalating workers\u2019 compensation claims: Dartt testified that, at one of the weekly safety meetings that he was required to attend, Stone told a group of employees that the number of workers\u2019 compensation claims had to .be reduced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, while Dartt was on the earlier disability leave of absence, BFI\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation administrator told Stone that BFI would have \u201cexposure for future temporary partial benefits in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that [BFI] would not be able to accommodate [Dartt] on a permanent basis in a position within his restrictions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">BFI claims that the judge erred in her instructions to the jury on the elements of a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, and that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support a finding of discriminatory termination. We address first BFI\u2019s challenge to the judge\u2019s instructions. In cases of handicap discrimination brought under G. Li c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), we use the familiar three-stage order of proof that we have recognized in cases alleging disparate treatment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), which prohibits discrimination \u201cbecause of the race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, sexual orientation ... or ancestry\u201d of an individual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 821 (1997). At issue here is the first stage order of proof \u2014 the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 441 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16), provides that an employer may not \u201cdismiss from employment or refuse to hire, rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against, <em>because </em>o/his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation\u201d (emphasis supplied). The parties dispute how the term \u201cbecause of\u201d affects a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie burden of proof. At trial, relying on <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995), and <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Mental Health, </em>419 Mass. 356, 361 (1995), BFI asked the judge to charge the jury that in his prima facie case Dartt had to prove that he was terminated \u201csolely because of his handicap.\u201d The judge rejected BFI\u2019s request. Relying on <em>Blare, supra, </em>she gave the following charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201cTo recover, the plaintiff must prove at the outset the following by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence, first, that the plaintiff had a \u2018handicap\u2019 at the relevant time; second, that the plaintiff was a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019; and third, that the plaintiff was terminated by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On appeal, BFI argues further that any dispute concerning this issue was put to rest by our recent opinion in <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813 (1997), where we said that it is a plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish in his prima facie case that he was terminated \u201csolely\u201d because of his handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">We recognize that some of our earlier decisions concerning a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie burden in a case of handicap discrimination may have been the cause of confusion, for we previously have not been consistent in our descriptions of that burden.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We sometimes have said that a plaintiff must establish that he was terminated \u201cin spite of [his] qualifications,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Info. Resources Co., </em>419 Mass. 792, 795-796 (1995); <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 541 (1995), or that he was fired \u201cbecause of\u201d a handicap, see, e.g., <em>Tate, supra </em>at 361-362, while at other times we have said that to establish a prima facie case a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was fired \u201csolely because of his handicap.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Labonte, supra </em>at 821; <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 60; <em>Tate, supra </em>at 362. We now make clear that as part of his prima facie case, a plaintiff alleging a violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16), need not establish that he was terminated (or received some other adverse treatment from his employer) \u201csolely\u201d because of his handicap.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We reach this conclusion for several reasons. We commence our analysis, appropriately, with the plain language of the statute. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd., </em>397 Mass. 734, 738 (1986). General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), does not use the term \u201csolely.\u201d We discern no other similarly restrictive language in the statutory scheme, and we hesitate to rewrite the statute judicially to import such a restriction. In interpreting the substantially identical causal language in the context of Title VII, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201cbecause of\u201d does not mean \u201csolely because of.\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 241 (1989) (plurality opinion). While no opinion of the Court garnered a majority of votes, all the Justices agreed on this point. See <em>id. </em>at 241 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 258-259 (White, J., concurring in the judgment); <em>id. </em>at 262-263 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment); <em>id. </em>at 284 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Writing for the plurality, Justice Brennan noted that \u201csince we know that the words \u2018because of\u2019 do not mean <em>\u2018solely </em>because of,\u2019 we also know that Title VII meant to condemn even those decisions based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations\u201d (footnote omitted; emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 241. Similarly, we will not read the restrictive term \u201csolely\u201d into G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The legislative history confirms that our interpretation is consistent with what the Legislature intended. Prior to adopting St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7 2, the 1983 amendment that inserted \u00a7 4 (16) into G. L. c. 15IB, the Legislature rejected proposed amendments that would have prohibited discrimination \u201csolely because of\u201d a handicap. See, e.g., 1981 Senate Doc. No. 208; 1981 House Doc. No. 353; 1981 House Doc. No. 485; 1981 House Doc. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>3537; 1980 House Doc. No 650.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> BH is correct that the legislative history does not elucidate why the Legislature rejected each of these competing bills. But we will not add to a statute a word that the Legislature had the option to, but chose not to, include. <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 706 (1984). Nor does our conclusion ignore the cognate amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution enacted a few years before the statutory amendment at issue here. Article 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, enacted in 1980, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, <em>solely </em>by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity within the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added). A statute may provide greater protection than a constitutional counterpart. Here, the statute protects fully those persons covered under art. 114.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Were we to require the plaintiff to prove at the prima facie stage that he had been discriminated against \u201csolely because of a handicap,\u201d we would be imposing on him a greater burden at the first stage than he is required to meet at the third stage of proof. Conversely, the standard we adopt today achieves the purpose we intend by requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate a prima facie case: to \u201celiminate[] the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981). See <em>Blare, supra </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We are also guided in our resolution by interpretations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq. \u25a0 (1994) (ADA),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> even though that statute was enacted in 1991, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>after the enactment of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). The ADA provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because that causal language is substantially similar to the prohibition of G. L. c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4 (16), that an employee may not be discriminated against because of his handicap, judicial analyses of the ADA are helpful.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Clean-Up Group, Inc., </em>96 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir. 1996), is particularly instructive. In that case, the court concluded, as we have, that a plaintiff could prove a claim of discrimination under the ADA by using the three-stage framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <em>Jacques </em>court then outlined a five-part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>test a plaintiff must meet to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201c[A] plaintiff must first prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she (i) has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (ii) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations; (iii) was subject to an adverse employment action by a company subject to the Act; (iv) was replaced by a non-disabled person or was treated less favorably than non-disabled employees; and (v) suffered damages as a result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 511. See <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Amego, Inc., </em>110 F.3d 135, 141 n.2 (1st Cir. 1997). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit uses a similar test to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA. See <em>Aucutt </em>v. <em>Six Flags Over Mid-America, Inc., </em>85 F.3d 1311, 1318 (8th Cir. 1996) (third and final element of prima facie case is that plaintiff \u201chas suffered an adverse employment action under circumstances from which an inference of unlawful discrimination arises\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For all these reasons we hold that Dartt was not required to demonstrate at the prima facie stage that he was terminated by BFI \u201csolely\u201d because of his handicap. There was no error in the judge\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>BFI also argues, in passing, that the jury instructions as a whole did not require the jury to find affirmatively at any stage that BFI was motivated by discrimination. We agree that the burden of persuasion rests with the plaintiff at all times. <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 445 (1995). We have said that at the third stage of proof, \u201cthe presumption of discrimination vanishes, and the burden returns to the plaintiff to persuade the court, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for its employment decision was not the real reason, but is a pretext.\u201d <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 128 (1997). We have also said that \u201c[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue of discrimination . . . and therefore must \u2018produce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict that it was more likely than not that the articulated reason was pretext for actual discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, quoting <em>Blare, supra </em>at 447. Read as a whole, we conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions correctly informed the jury of Dartt\u2019s burden.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">BFI also argues that the judge committed prejudicial error in refusing to instruct the jury on BFI\u2019s obligations under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, and that she erroneously admitted in evidence two legally irrelevant and, it is argued, highly prejudicial, outdated employment application forms previously used by BFI. We review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>At the time of his second accident, Dartt no longer suffered from a handicap.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He also suffered no injury when the tractor-trailer flipped over at the landfill. Dartt\u2019s only claim was that he was terminated immediately after the accident because BFI was concerned that it might again have to pay him workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> BFI requested an instruction explaining to the jury BFI\u2019s obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Dartt had he been injured at the landfill. An employer is liable for all accidents \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. BFI argued, correctly, that its workers\u2019 compensation liability would not and could not turn on whether or not Dartt remained at BFI. See <em>Zygmuntowicz </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of N.J., </em>240 Mass. 421 (1922). Dartt responded that the workers\u2019 compensation statute exempts an employer from paying benefits to an employee who is injured because of his own \u201cserious and wilful misconduct,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27, and that BFI could have defended against any claim on that basis.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> BFI, in turn, informed the judge that it would accept an instruction that informed the jury of both BFI\u2019s continuing obligation to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Dartt had he been injured, and BFI\u2019s opportunity to defend against a claim for benefits on grounds of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d by Dartt.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The judge refused to give either instruction, concluding that BFI\u2019s potential obligation under the workers\u2019 compensation statute was \u201ctoo hypothetical\u201d to present to the jury. Her refusal to do so was error sufficiently prejudicial, we conclude, to require a new trial. Dartt himself testified that he was terminated because BFI hoped to avoid paying him any potential workers\u2019 compensation liability.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> BFI\u2019s continuing legal obligation to pay any workers\u2019 compensation claim by Dartt was therefore directly relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>jury\u2019s consideration of Dartt\u2019s accusation. The jury also heard and may well have been confused by counsels\u2019 closing arguments in which both described to the jury, without objection, their respective interpretations of BFI\u2019s legal obligations under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. It is the responsibility of the judge, not counsel, to state to the jury the \u201cgoverning principles of law as to the issues raised by the pleadings and supported by [the] evidence, so that the jury may clearly understand their duty and be enabled to perform it intelligently.\u201d <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Title Ins. Co., </em>206 Mass. 197, 200 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judge also allowed in evidence information concerning BFI\u2019s attempt to contain workers\u2019 compensation claims and other safety and cost control efforts. See notes 5 and 6, <em>supra. </em>Having done so, the judge should not have left the jury uninformed about BFI\u2019s obligations to Dartt under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. In <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>McGeeney, </em>344 Mass. 200, 208 (1962), we held that when erroneous instructions \u201ctended to confuse and mislead the jury,\u201d substantial justice required a new trial. See <em>Squeri </em>v. <em>McCarrick, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 203 (1992) (when effect of instructions is substantially to confuse jury, new trial required). Ignorant about BFI\u2019s legal obligation to Dartt, the jury could well have concluded that by terminating him, BFI could have avoided any further workers\u2019 compensation liability to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We next review whether an application form for new hires previously used by BFI was improperly admitted in evidence. The form contained questions about medical conditions, and claims for work-related injuries, now prohibited by the ADA. There was evidence that BFI ceased using the form some time prior to, and in response to, the enactment of the ADA. BFI filed a motion in limine to exclude the form because, it claimed, it had discontinued its use, the form was irrelevant to the issues in the case,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and was prejudicial to BFI. The judge allowed Dartt to admit the form for the purpose of demonstrating BFI\u2019s \u201cstate of mind.\u201d That ruling was erroneous. Dartt argues that the form demonstrated that BFI \u201cconsidered back injuries and workers\u2019 compensation claims in the hiring stage,\u201d and therefore \u201cconsidered the same factors\u201d in the decision to terminate Dartt. We disagree. Dartt was not suffering from a back injury, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>other medical condition, when he was terminated. See notes 19 and 20 and accompanying text, <em>supra. </em>He cannot claim that BFI terminated him because of an injury, and his argument concerning BFI\u2019s preemployment inquiries about back injuries fails. Dartt said that he was fired because BFI was concerned he might file a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. See note 22, <em>supra. </em>Construing Dartt\u2019s argument with respect to that claim in the manner most favorable to him, he says that the BFI form violated Massachusetts law,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> as evidenced by \u201cguidelines\u201d adopted by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) on September 30, 1986. (Unlike the statute, the \u201cguidelines\u201d prohibit specifically preemployment inquiries about receipt of workers\u2019 compensation. See 8 Mass. Discrimination Law Rep. 2003, 2012 \u00a7 IV[B] [1986]). Assuming that the use of a hiring form is probative of a reason to terminate, of which we are dubious, see, e.g., <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Camden City Bd. of Educ., </em>105 F.R.D. 49, 60 (D.N.J. 1985) (discovery of hiring practices precluded in wrongful denial of tenure action); <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>85 F.R.D. 53, 62 (E.D. Pa. 1979) (litigation history in hiring, promotion, and classification not relevant discovery in illegal discharge action), Dartt\u2019s reliance on MCAD guidelines<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> that prohibit preemployment inquiries concerning workers\u2019 compensation is simply too tenuous to warrant the admission of the form as probative of BFI\u2019s state of mind in this wrongful termination case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We find equally troublesome the wholly unwarranted contention by Dartt\u2019s counsel during his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>closing argument that BFI had violated the ADA.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Counsel for BFI objected to the statement but the judge overruled the objection. That was error. There was no such evidence<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that assertion should never have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We consider BFI\u2019s claim that the judge erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because, BFI claims, there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law supporting the verdict. \u201cWe start with the proposition that taking the question out of the jury\u2019s hands is disfavored in the context of discrimination cases based on disparate treatment because the ultimate issue is often that of intent, and is a factual question.\u201d <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 820 (1997), citing <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 439-440 (1997). \u201c[W]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and disregard evidence favorable to the [employer].\u201d <em>Labonte, supra </em>at 820-821, citing <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 326 (1982). We sustain a jury verdict if a jury could reasonably have arrived at their verdict from any of the evidence that the plaintiff presented. <em>Labonte, supra </em>at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">BFI argues, first, that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Dartt was \u201chandicapped\u201d at the time of his termination for the purposes of establishing liability under G. L. c. 15IB.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17), the term \u201chandicap\u201d means (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major fife activities of a person; (b) a record of having such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>impairment; or (c) \u201cbeing regarded as having such impairment.\u201d BFI urges us to hold that a temporary disability does not constitute a handicap within the meaning of the statute. We decline to do so. Not every temporary disability is short lived. Dartt, for example, was unable to work for over two years while he was undergoing two operations for work-related injuries,- the costs of which BFI paid. Cf. <em>Hallgren </em>v. <em>Integrated Fin. Corp., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 686, 688-689 (1997) (plaintiff, who had recovered from knee injury within month and had no residual disability, neither had \u201crecord\u201d of disability nor was \u201cregarded\u201d as having disability). While we agree that the evidence was slight, we cannot say as a matter of law that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that, at the least, Dartt was \u201cregarded by [BFI] as having an impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Second, BFI argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Dartt was terminated because of a handicap. While we have held that the evidence concerning BFI\u2019s efforts to contain its workers\u2019 compensation claims was improperly admitted, on balance we conclude that evidence that BFI may have deviated from its normal management procedures when it summarily terminated Dartt could support a reasonable inference that BFI had terminated Dartt because of his perceived handicap. Upon remand, the judge should be careful to exclude all evidence about BFI\u2019s management of its workers\u2019 compensation claims and its safety maintenance program. Such evidence is not probative of discriminatory motive and is prejudicial to BFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Finally, BFI argues there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support the award of punitive damages. In <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 767 (1997), we said that punitive damages are appropriate \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s conduct warrants condemnation and deterrence.\u201d Although G. L. c. 151B does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17a\">*17a</page-number>provide any limit for punitive damages, the award of such damages is governed by common law and constitutional principles. <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 826 (1997). The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908(2) (1979) provides that \u201c[pjunitive damages may be awarded for conduct that is outrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u201d The judge gave the jury instructions consistent with the common law principles governing punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">While we do not substitute our judgment for that of the jury, there was no admissible evidence that BFI\u2019s conduct \u2014 measured under G. L. c. 15 IB \u2014 was outrageous in any respect. It is possible that the jury awarded punitive damages because they concluded that BFT had knowingly violated the ADA and had deliberately sought to avoid its legal obligations to Dartt under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. The evidence to support those claims was improperly admitted. Absent such evidence, the question of punitive damages should not have been sent to the jury. See <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>Emerson Elec. Co., </em>94 F.3d 502, 509 (8th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1692, 1693 (1997) (punitive damages claim should not have been submitted to jury in sex discrimination case because evidence did not support finding that employer\u2019s conduct was outrageous, as required under State law claim, or that employer acted with malice or reckless indifference, as required under Title VII); <em>Braverman </em>v. <em>Penobscot Shoe Co., </em>859 F. Supp. 596 (D. Me. 1994) (although plaintiff had established case of prima facie discrimination under ADA and evidence of pretext sufficient to defeat employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, plaintiff had not raised sufficient evidence that employer had discriminated against him with \u201cmalice\u201d or \u201creckless indifference\u201d to allow claim of punitive damages to go to jury). On remand, the issue of punitive damages should not be sent to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-15\">The plaintiff also alleged a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq. (1994) (count HI of his complaint), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (count IV). A judge in the Superior Court granted defendant Browning-Ferns Industries, Inc.\u2019s (BFI\u2019s) motion for summary judgment as to those two counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-9\">We use the male pronoun because in this case the plaintiff is a man.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b24-7\">BFI\u2019s safety policy, which Dartt signed as a condition of his employment, required him to use \u201cmaximum care and good judgment.\u201d Greenwood testified that he terminated Dartt because he did not believe that Dartt could have kept his eyes on the trailer while reaching for a soda, and that in his judgment, a vehicle such as the one operated by Dartt was \u201ca lethal weapon out on the highway,\u201d and he could not afford to tolerate even occasional carelessness by a driver while operating it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The BFI manual also provides that the district manager (Greenwood) may discharge an employee forthwith if he determines that the employee has violated company policy. Greenwood testified at trial that he also had the authority to override the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Although there was no objection to this evidence, we fail to see its relevance to the claim of handicap discrimination made by Dartt. As a matter of company policy, BFI required all drivers to attend weekly safety meetings, and it was Dartt\u2019s own testimony that Stone\u2019s remark occurred in the context of BFI\u2019s safety maintenance program. Evidence of employer attempts to contain or reduce workers\u2019 compensation claims, without more, is not probative of handicap discrimination. It is proper, for example, for an employer to urge workers to comply with safety regulations or to exercise appropriate cautionary measures when handling heavy-duty equipment such as the vehicle in this case, even if one purpose of doing so is to contain or reduce workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\">At trial, BFI objected to the introduction of this evidence, a point it does not pursue here. It is not clear to us on what basis the judge admitted the evidence. Evidence that an employer seeks to have an injured worker return to work once he is physically able to do so (as happened in Dartt\u2019s case) is not probative of handicap discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Cases of disparate impact have a different burden of proof. See <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 699-700 (1992). Dartt made no claim of disparate impact, and we are not here concerned about the standard of proof in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b26-10\">Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, we apply the three-stage burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).

In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995), it was also undisputed that the plaintiff was fired \u201csolely\u201d because of her handicap, alcoholism.

The Rehabilitation Act provides: \u201cNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, <em>solely by reason </em>of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity [that receives Federal support]\u201d (emphasis supplied). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). As we describe above, prior to adopting the 1983 amendment to G. L. c. 151B, the Legislature rejected several bills that contained the term \u201csolely.\u201d See <em>supra </em>at 8. We have considered instructive interpretations of the Rehabilitation Act where the issue concerned a provision of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), similar to a provision of that Federal statute. See, e.g., <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 382 (1993) (term \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d in G.

See also <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 59; <em>Tate, supra </em>at 361 (making reference to Rehabilitation Act because plaintiff had also brought a claim in that case under Rehabilitation Act). Those considerations do not apply here.

The parties dispute the reason for this. BFI had argued that, because the law precludes an employer from ascertaining the handicap status, if any, of a prospective hire, there was no evidence, nor could there be, that Dartt was replaced by a nonhandicapped person. It is not necessary for a handicapped plaintiff to demonstrate that his replacement was not handicapped. It is sufficient for him to demonstrate that his position remained open and the employer sought to fill it. A defense by BFI that Dartt was terminated because of a reduction in force is not at issue here, and there was evidence that BFI had continued to hire drivers after Dartt was terminated. The error, if any, was harmless. It would be advisable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>remand for the judge, as in all cases, to instruct the jury on the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie burden in full.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">\u201cWe have now got the plaintiff showing the first three things, handicap, qualified, and termination.
