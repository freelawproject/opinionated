Based on the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the Appeals Court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 78 (1997). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We summarize the facts of the case, which are reported in full in the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion. See <em>id. </em>at 79-80. On New Year\u2019s Eve, the defendant, who had been engaged to the victim\u2019s sister, offered to take the victim and her friends out for the evening. The victim\u2019s mother assented. After being unable to locate any of her friends and finding that two amusement arcades were closed, the defendant drove the victim to his apartment, where he had sexual intercourse with her. At the time, the victim was twelve years old. The victim did not report the incident to her mother or anyone else until two weeks later, when she realized that her menstrual period was late. A test performed at a hospital showed that she was pregnant. She had an abortion, and analysis of the fetal tissue, as well as the doctor\u2019s testimony, showed a range of possible dates of conception which arguably included the date of the alleged incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The defendant has raised four issues on appeal: (1) the prosecutor made improper remarks during closing argument; (2) the judge improperly prohibited inquiry into the victim\u2019s sexual history; (3) the judge erred in instructing on the lesser included offense; and (4) the judge improperly denied his request for individual voir dire of the venire on the issue of race. Because we substantially agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s resolution of the last two issues, we discuss only the first two in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">1. The defendant argues that, during closing argument, the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jurors\u2019 sympathies, vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility, and stated facts not in evidence. To determine whether reversal is required, we consider such factors as whether the defendant seasonably objected; whether the error pertained to a merely collateral issue or went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to the heart of the case; what remedial steps, if any, the judge took to mitigate the error; and whether, in all the circumstances, the error could have made a difference to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">a. We first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility. Because the defendant seasonably objected, we review this claim for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Counsel may argue from the evidence, including a witness\u2019s demeanor and motive for testifying, that the witness should be believed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 232 (1997). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>366 Mass. 506, 516 (1974). Here, many of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks fit this description. For example, the prosecutor said, \u201cYou have to think about how she presented, how she looked, how she appeared from the witness stand. You must ask yourself: Can I believe this person? Can I believe her? You should. There\u2019s no reason not to believe her. There was nothing that occurred during the course of direct and on cross examination that diminished her credibility as a witness. Nothing.\u201d These remarks merely invited the jurors to draw a conclusion from their own observations of the victim as she testified. Therefore, they were within the bounds of proper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Counsel may not, however, \u201cexpress]] a personal belief in the credibility of a witness . . . or . . . indicate]] that he or she has knowledge independent of the evidence before the jury verifying a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989). Here, the prosecutor did exactly that. For example, the prosecutor said, \u201cThis is not a twelve-year-old who was sexually active running the streets, doing things that might [lead] you to believe that she would come in here and lie. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, she was credible.\u201d These remarks not only expressed the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief in the victim\u2019s credibility, but also suggested that he knew, independent of the evidence, that she was not sexually active, because there was no evidence of her sexual activity, or lack thereof, at trial. The prosecutor apparently intended these remarks to refute the defendant\u2019s theory that the victim had accused him of rape to explain and avoid punishment for a pregnancy that resulted from other sexual activity. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks thus improperly suggested that he had possessed independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>knowledge disproving the defendant\u2019s claim. Moreover, because the Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted primarily of the victim\u2019s testimony and four fresh complaint witnesses, her credibility went to the heart of the matter. It is possible that such improper remarks could have an effect on a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Nonetheless, we do not believe reversal is required. In response to the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge specifically instructed the jury that \u201cit is improper for any attorney to express a personal belief in the credibility of any witness, and that includes that of the complaining witness, as well as every other witness from whom you have heard. So, if you heard such, then you are to disregard it, because you are the only ones who decide whether to believe someone.\u201d We have affirmed convictions, despite improper closing argument, on the basis of much more general instructions than in this case. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 474 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockwell, </em>426 Mass. 17, 23 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 580 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 392 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>421 Mass. 90, 104 (1995). In addition, the judge instructed the jury at least four times that the arguments of counsel were not evidence. Finally, it is apparent from the jury\u2019s verdict that, despite the prosecutor\u2019s argument, they rejected at least part of the victim\u2019s account, namely, that the defendant had used force. The prosecutor\u2019s vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility, although improper, was not prejudicial error and therefore does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">b. We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jurors\u2019 sympathy for the victim. Again, the defendant seasonably objected on this ground, so we review for prejudicial error. See <em>Santiago, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">\u201cThe prosecutor has a particular obligation not only to argue the Commonwealth\u2019s case forcefully and aggressively, but also to do so in a way that states the evidence clearly and fairly and inspires confidence that the verdict was reached based on the evidence rather than sympathy for the victim . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494. Although some of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here did appeal to the jurors\u2019 sympathy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we do not think they went beyond \u201ctolerable hyperbole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>425 Mass. 378, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>381 (1997). Cf. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 494 (repeated references to murder victim\u2019s age, pregnancy, and birthday undermined integrity of verdict). Moreover, after the judge instructed the jury, the defendant made a request for further instructions, to which the judge responded by instructing the jurors to disregard any plea for sympathy or emotion. We conclude that the defendant has shown no prejudicial error as to this aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">c. The defendant also contends that the prosecutor improperly asserted facts not in evidence by stating that the victim was not sexually active. Because the defendant did not object to the argument on this ground, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loguidice, </em>420 Mass. 453, 455-456 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\u201cA prosecutor must limit comment in closing statement to the evidence and fair inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 30 (1982). There was no evidence at trial as to the victim\u2019s sexual activity or lack thereof. The prosecutor\u2019s remark was therefore improper. However, it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The remark, as mentioned above, was apparently \u2022intended as a response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the victim falsely accused the defendant of rape to conceal her sexual activity. The defendant\u2019s theory, advanced for the first time in closing argument, lacked evidentiary support for the claim that she was sexually active. While a prosecutor must not \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 519 &amp; n.9, the defendant\u2019s improper argument undermines his claim that the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument requires reversal. Considering the prosecutor\u2019s argument as a whole, the judge\u2019s repeated instructions that arguments are not evidence, and the defendant\u2019s own reference to facts not in evidence, we conclude that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">We remind both prosecutors and defense attorneys, as well as attorneys in civil cases, that arguments must be based solely on the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom. We remind trial judges that they have the authority to interrupt any argument that violates this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2. Before trial, the defendant filed a written motion in limine, as required by the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking to introduce evidence that the victim had been sexually molested at the age of five and raped at the age of eight. There was no indication that these had been false allegations; rather, the defendant wanted to use them to demonstrate the victim\u2019s, bias, motive to lie, and knowledge of sexual matters. The judge denied the motion. During trial, the victim testified, \u201cI was trying to tell him that I was going to end up pregnant, because I was scared. I never had sex before.\u201d The defendant then sought permission to \u201cimpeach her credibility as to having never had sex before,\u201d apparently by introducing the prior assault. The judge stood by her original ruling excluding the evidence. Nevertheless, the judge, interpreting the victim\u2019s testimony to mean that she told the defendant she had never had sexual intercourse before, invited defense counsel to cross-examine her as to whether she made that statement. Defense counsel chose not to do so. The defendant, who made no objection to this second ruling, now argues that it was error so to limit cross-examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">First, we believe that the original ruling on the motion in limine was proper. \u201cThe rape-shield statute is principally designed to prevent defense counsel from eliciting evidence of the victim\u2019s promiscuity as part of a general credibility attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>412 Mass. 516, 523 (1992). Inquiry into a subject that could show a rape complainant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>bias, prejudice, or motive to lie about the alleged attack remains permissible under the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 229 (1981). The defendant thus offered the evidence for a proper puipose. However, that is not the end of the inquiry. Under the statute, the judge must also determine whether \u201cthe weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. This determination is within the sound discretion of the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>426 Mass. 301, 307-308 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 25 (1996) (determination of relevancy is within sound discretion of trial judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As for the second ruling, we are not convinced that the judge properly interpreted the victim\u2019s testimony. At least, the testimony is ambiguous; the victim could have been testifying that she had never had intercourse before the rape. Where testimony is susceptible of competing interpretations, the question is properly for the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, </em>373 Mass. 626, 629 (1977). However, we perceive no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Having observed the victim testify, the judge was in a better position than we are to interpret her testimony. Moreover, we do not think that her rape at the age of eight is inconsistent with a claim that she had never had sexual intercourse before. Possibly, in the victim\u2019s mind, a forced act does not count. It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to determine, as she apparently did, that the probative value of the earlier assaults did not outweigh the harm to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The defendant also argues that the judge improperly precluded cross-examination about the victim\u2019s sexual activity concurrent with the alleged rape. Such evidence, the defendant argues, would have supported his theory that the complainant, realizing she was pregnant, falsely accused the defendant to conceal and avoid punishment for her sexual activity. Under the rape-shield statute, it is permissible to use sexual conduct evidence to show motive to lie or to explain a complaining witness\u2019s pregnancy. See <em>Joyce, supra; </em>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B (permitting \u201cevidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim\u201d). However, the statute requires \u201ca written motion for admission of [such evidence] and an offer of proof\u201d before evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct can be admitted. Neither the written motion in limine nor the trial transcript shows that the defendant offered any evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>around the time of the incident. The judge therefore never had an opportunity to make the determination, as required by the statute, whether the probative value of such evidence outweighed the prejudice to the victim. The defendant cannot complain that the judge precluded this line of cross-examination, because he never made the required offer of proof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no error on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">3. We agree with and adopt the reasoning of the Appeals Court as to the defendant\u2019s remaining issues. See <em>Pearce, supra </em>at 80-81 (lesser included offense instruction was proper); <em>id. </em>at 84-85 (individual voir dire on race was unnecessary because crime was not clearly interracial).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The defendant points to such remarks as, for example, \u201cI therefore ask . . . that you think about the trust that was given to [the defendant] . . . and how insulted, how violated [the victim] was, how angry she was to get, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>traumatized [she] must have been,\u201d and, \u201cShe wanted to wipe away the hurt. But she can\u2019t wipe it away. She felt it here today. It was extremely painful during the course of her testimony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 21B, provides: \u201cEvidence of the reputation of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct shall not be admissible in any investigation or proceeding before a grand jury or any court of the commonwealth for a violation of sections thirteen B, thirteen F, thirteen H, twenty-two, twenty-two A, twenty-three, twenty-four and twenty-four B of chapter two hundred and sixty-five or section five of chapter two hundred and seventy-two. Evidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct in such an investigation or proceeding shall not be admissible except evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim; provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing on a written motion for admission of same and an offer of proof. If, after said hearing, the court finds that the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim, the evidence shall be admitted; otherwise not. If the proceeding is a trial with jury, said hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. The finding of the court shall be in writing and filed but shall not be made available to the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">We also note that this is not a case in which the victim\u2019s testimony unexpectedly opened the door to inquiry about her sexual conduct. The defendant\u2019s position from the outset was that some other person impregnated the victim. It therefore was, or should have been, apparent that the defendant would need to produce evidence that the victim engaged in sexual activity with this other person. There is no reason the defendant could not have included this matter in his original motion in limine and no reason to forgo the procedural requirements of the rape-shield statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b671-8\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYm\">(dissenting, with whom Fried, J., joins). For substantially the reasons stated in the opinion of the Appeals Court I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks do not require a new trial. As the court concedes, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989), and argued facts not in evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994), in telling the jury that the victim was \u201cnot a twelve-year-old who was sexually active running the streets, doing things that might [lead] you to believe that she would come in here and lie. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, she was credible.\u201d Unlike the court, however, I believe that the circumstances surrounding this blunder were such that a new trial is warranted. Given that the defendant\u2019s primary defense was that the victim manufactured the rape allegation to conceal her other sexual activity, the prosecutor\u2019s remark that she was not sexually active went to the very heart of the defendant\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987). Moreover, apart from the victim\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence linking the defendant to this crime was far from overwhelming. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 591 (1983). Finally, the judge\u2019s instructions, though pointing out that closing arguments are not evidence and that vouching should be disregarded, were too general. The judge\u2019s failure to correct the misstatement regarding the victim\u2019s sexual activity, in particular, rendered the instructions insufficient to remedy the prosecutor\u2019s errors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Even if the defendant\u2019s objection was not specific enough to extend to the comments concerning the victim\u2019s lack of sexual activity, the prosecutor\u2019s blunders in my view created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loguidice, </em>420 Mass. 453, 455-456 (1995). The defendant is entitled to a new trial, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
