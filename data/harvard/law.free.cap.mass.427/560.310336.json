L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13 (Uniform Arbitration Act for Commercial Disputes). We transferred the matter here on our own motion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The plaintiffs brought an arbitration proceeding against the defendants before the National Association of Securities Dealers. On July 25, 1994, the arbitrators awarded the plaintiffs $11,798 in damages, which they revised the next day to $29,581.50.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs requested further modification of the award by letter to the arbitration panel, claiming that the damage award contained additional miscalculations. On October 13, 1994, the arbitration panel issued a decision affirming the July 26, 1994, damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On October 24, 1994, the plaintiffs filed, in the Federal District Court, an action pursuant to the Federal-Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 (1994), seeking modification of the July 26, 1994, arbitration award. This action was dismissed on May 31, 1996, for failure to include a necessary and indispensable party pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. R 19 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On June 14, 1996, the plaintiffs filed their application in the Superior Court, which is the subject of this appeal.* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This application was dismissed as being time-barred because it had not been filed within thirty days of the delivery of the arbitration award, as required by G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The plaintiffs argue that their application was timely because G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> permitted its filing in the Superior Court, within one year from the Federal dismissal, where that dismissal was for a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">This statute is unavailing to the plaintiffs both because it does not apply to applications involving arbitration under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13, and because the application was not \u201cduly commenced\u201d as required by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">An action has been \u201cduly commenced\u201d if it has been commenced within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>1 Gray 580, 582-583 (1854). General Laws c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13, require that applications to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>vacate or to modify an arbitrator\u2019s award be filed within thirty days from the delivery of the arbitrator\u2019s award to the applicant. The plaintiffs received the award by facsimile transmission on July 26, 1994, or shortly thereafter, and filed the Federal petition to modify or to vacate the award on October 24, 1994, eighty-nine days later. Although this application was timely under the Federal requirements, it would not have been timely if filed in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we have no trouble deciding that the savings provision under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, would apply to an action duly commenced in another jurisdiction, see <em>Liberace </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 42 (1991), we conclude that, to obtain the benefit of revival in such a case, the foreign action must be commenced within the time limits of G. L. c. 251. See <em>Stare </em>v. <em>Pearcy, </em>617 F.2d 43, 45 (4th Cir. 1980). To conclude otherwise would permit the plaintiffs to \u201cforum shop\u201d for jurisdictions with longer periods of limitations after the action had become time barred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Even if the foreign petition were duly commenced, the provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, would not apply. That section applies to \u201caction[sj duly commenced within the time limited in this <em>chapter\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The time Emits contained in c. 260 specifically apply to common law actions of contract or tort. AppeHate decisions in this Commonwealth have not been entirely consistent in interpreting this language where the Emitation is imposed in another statute. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>405 Mass. 439, 441-443 (1989) (tolling provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7, apply to actions brought under G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21); <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>387 Mass. 43, 50 (1982) (tolling provisions of G. L. c. 260 have no application to actions not having a common law basis); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 628, 629 (1997) (tolhng provisions of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>c. 260, \u00a7 32, apply to actions commenced under G. L. c. 258); <em>Ciampa </em>v. <em>Beverly Airport Comm\u2019n, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 974 (1995) (tolling provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, have no application to actions not having a common law basis). Section 19 of G. L. c. 260 provides: \u201cIf a special provision is otherwise made relative to the limitation of any action, any provision of this chapter inconsistent therewith shall not apply.\u201d We have opined that \u201cthe inconsistency contemplated by the Legislature occurs where the length of the limitations period set forth in the special statute is different from the length of a limitations period set forth in G. L. c. 260.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 442. In such circumstances the special statute applies. See <em>id.; Carroll </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 630. Furthermore there is nothing in our appellate decisions to suggest that arbitration matters fall within the revival language of c. 260, and we decline to reach that conclusion here. Our arbitration statute was enacted for the speedy resolution of disputes by a method which is not subject to delay in the courts. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., ante </em>194, 200 (1998), quoting <em>Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Walter\u2019s of Hadley, Inc., </em>403 Mass. 772, 774 (1989). Cf. <em>Shafnacker </em>v. <em>Raymond James &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>425 Mass. 724, 729-730 (1997). Our decision here is consistent with the policy to accord arbitration finality in a timely fashion. <em>Chauffeurs, Teamsters, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Local 135 </em>v. <em>Jefferson Trucking Co., </em>628 F.2d 1023, 1027 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1125 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">The revision was based on a mathematical miscalculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\">General Laws c. 251, \u00a7 12, permits a party to request that a court vacate an arbitration award; G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 13, permits a party to apply for a modification of an award. Both provisions require that a party\u2019s application be \u201cmade within <em>thirty days </em>after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 12 &amp; 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 32, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\u201cIf an action duly commenced within the time limited in this chapter is dismissed for . . . any matter of form ... the plaintiff. . . may commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The plaintiffs asserted during oral argument that the event that commences the running of the statute of limitations was the denial of their request for further modification on October 13, 1994. Such an interpretation ignores the specific language of the statute, which keys the period of limitation to the delivery of the arbitration award, not the final decision or petition for rehearing, as is the case in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Furthermore, in an analogous situation, we have determined that a plaintiff\u2019s request for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and Mass. R. Civ. R 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), would not toll the thirty-day statutory period for appellate review of an administrative decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 664-665 n.l (1993). Where the statute is clear, we shall not create distinctions by judicial decision. <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84, 86 n.5 (1997). Cf. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
