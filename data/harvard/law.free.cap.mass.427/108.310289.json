On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to police; (2) denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(3) instructing the jury on joint venture. He also requests that we exercise our plenary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the murder conviction to a lesser degree of guilt. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the conviction and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with certain issues raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 210 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>417 Mass. 740, 741 (1994). On the evening of June 3, 1993, the defendant, two companions, and the victim purchased a case of beer and a bottle of vodka, and then proceeded to an area known as \u201cSharon Woods\u201d in Sharon. The four spent the next two hours drinking in a secluded area of the woods near Gavin\u2019s Pond. While still in the woods at approximately 9 p.m., the defendant and his two companions secretly made plans to \u201cjump\u201d the victim. Soon thereafter, the three attacked the victim by wrapping a jacket or shirt around the victim\u2019s head, knocking him to the ground, and beating him with their fists and feet. They also removed the victim\u2019s clothing as he lay motionless on the ground. One of the defendant\u2019s companions then found a stick with which he subsequently penetrated the victim\u2019s rectum and struck his testicles. For his part, the defendant conceded that he \u201cjust kept hitting\u201d and \u201ckicking\u201d the victim. The attack lasted about thirty minutes. At this point, the victim\u2019s face was still covered, and there were no signs that he was either conscious or breathing. The defendant\u2019s two companions then dragged the victim to the edge of the pond and held his head under water for an extended period. The defendant checked the victim\u2019s pulse and found none. Finally, one of the defendant\u2019s companions stabbed the victim in the neck. They then covered the half-submerged body with a blanket and sticks from the woods, and the three left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">After finding the victim\u2019s body and learning that he had last been seen in the company of the defendant and his two companions, the police interviewed the defendant on the morning of Saturday, June 5. He told them at that time that, on the night of the victim\u2019s disappearance, he and his two companions had dropped off the victim at 8 p.m. at Wrentham Center. He then left the police station. At approximately 6 p.m., however, the defendant voluntarily returned to the station, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>subsequently placed under arrest in connection with the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">1. <em>The defendant\u2019s statement. </em>At a suppression hearing, the motion judge found the following facts. On his arrest the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights, and chose not to make any statements at that time. After his father encouraged him to speak openly with the police, the defendant agreed to be interviewed again. The interview was tape recorded by the police. At the outset, the defendant was given a written form containing Miranda warnings. State police Lieutenant Robert Zepf then read the form aloud to the defendant. The defendant acknowledged that he understood each right, and subsequently signed the Miranda form. Over the next hour and twenty minutes, the defendant made statements linking himself to the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress these statements. \u201cIn reviewing a judge\u2019s determination regarding a knowing waiver of Miranda rights and voluntariness, we \u2018grant substantial deference to the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions and we will not reject a judge\u2019s subsidiary findings if they are warranted by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 412 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>389 Mass. 411, 419 (1983). \u201cHowever, we conduct an independent review to ascertain whether the judge properly applied the law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>425 Mass. 361, 364 (1997). The Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a Miranda waiver was valid. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 386 (1996). \u201cTo be valid [a] waiver must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 670 (1995). In determining the voluntariness of a waiver, \u201cthe court must examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the waiver.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, supra </em>at 386, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 670. The relevant factors include \u201cpromises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, supra </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In the present case, the judge\u2019s findings, which were warranted by the evidence, amply support the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights was valid. At the time of his arrest, the defendant was seventeen years old and had attained a tenth-grade education. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. 152, 158 (1997) (no suppression where defendant was a \u201chigh school dropout\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guyton, </em>405 Mass. 497, 498 (1989) (no suppression where defendant was sixteen years old). Moreover, he was apprised of his Miranda rights both orally and in writing, stated that he understood them, and subsequently waived them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 384 (1995). As he did this, the defendant appeared \u201cresponsive\u201d and \u201ccoherent,\u201d and \u201cdid not appear to be confused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 396 (1997). Finally, there was no evidence of coercion or other \u201cunfair tactics\u201d on the part of the police. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. 495, 503 (1983). The interviewing officer\u2019s warning to the defendant that \u201cit would be better if he were truthful\u201d falls far short of the type of police assurances, express or implied, which we have previously found impermissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 395-396; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, supra </em>at 414-415, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 564 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). Similarly, the defendant\u2019s lack of prior experience with police procedures does not necessarily invalidate his waiver, especially where, as the judge found, he had successfully invoked his right to silence earlier in the evening. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, supra </em>at 414. Consequently, the judge properly concluded that the defendant\u2019s waiver was valid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">2. <em>Motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>next contends that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. In reviewing such a contention, \u201cwe determine whether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 686 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Specifically, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he shared the requisite intent for conviction under a joint, venture theory. In order to convict a defendant as a joint venturer, the Commonwealth must establish that the defendant \u201cwas (1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement . . . willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 366, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). \u201cAdditionally, the Commonwealth must show that the defendant shared with the principal the mental state required for the crime of murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 719 (1996). The mental state required for murder is malice aforethought. Malice aforethought includes intent to kill or cause grievous bodily injury. Alternatively, malice may be inferred if, in the circumstances known to the defendant, \u201ca reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.l (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Here, the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence presented by the Commonwealth that the defendant shared malice aforethought with his companions. \u201cThe jury may infer the requisite mental state from the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances and subsequent participation in the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). According to his own statement to the police, the defendant struck the first or second blow of the attack, knocking the victim to the ground. He subsequently hit the victim \u201cin the chest\u201d and \u201con the jaw,\u201d and \u201ckicked\u201d him during the next thirty minutes. From this evidence, the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>have inferred that the defendant not only intended to injure the victim, but also recognized (or should have recognized) the plain and strong likelihood that the victim\u2019s death would follow. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, supra </em>at 720 (shared murderous intent present where defendant \u201cparticipated ... in a brutal battery\u201d and \u201cbattered the victim\u2019s head and body\u201d with his shod foot); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sinnott, 399 Mass. 863, 873 (1987) (jury might properly infer shared intent necessary to convict defendant of murder by joint venture from infliction of repeated blows and kicks to victim\u2019s head, shoulders, and groin). Moreover, there was evidence of previous hostility between the defendant and the victim, including an incident just days before the attack during which the defendant struck the victim repeatedly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 577 (1996) (necessary intent present where defendant \u201chad previously expressed animosity toward one of the victims\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 487 (1988) (requisite mental state for joint venture inferable where there was \u201cevidence of hostility\u201d between defendant and victim). In addition, there was evidence that, just hours before the attack, the defendant was present during a conversation in which killing the victim was discussed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, supra </em>at 487-488 (defendant\u2019s murderous intent inferable where defendant was present during conversation where it was stated that the victim \u201cwas next\u201d). Considering this evidence in light of the fact that inferences drawn by the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state \u201cneed only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980), the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">3. <em>Joint venture instructions. </em>The defendant next claims that the judge\u2019s joint venture instructions were erroneous in several respects. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims, but will address each individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">First, the defendant maintains that the judge\u2019s instructions effectively permitted the jury to find joint venture based merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>on the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge stated, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201c[Wjhat is required is that the Commonwealth prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] intentionally participated in some meaningful way in the offense either by counseling, hiring, otherwise procuring the principal or the other venturers to commit the crime, by agreeing to stand by, at or near the scene, to render aid, assistance, encouragement if it became necessary or to assist the perpetrators of the crime in making an escape from the scene. . . . The Commonwealth must show that the defendant somehow participated in the venture . . . to the extent that he sought to make that venture succeed. . . . However, Jurors, mere knowledge that a crime is being committed is not sufficient. . . . <em>The evidence must show more than mere presence at the scene even coupled with the knowledge of the planned act. </em>Mere acquiescence, passive acquiescence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction. There must be some evidence of some actual participation and assistance by [the defendant] in the perpetration of the crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The judge subsequently explained to the jury that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] shared the mental state or the intent of the persons, the other persons, allegedly perpetrating the crime.\u201d We conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions adequately conveyed all the requirements for conviction under a joint venture theory. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No reversal, therefore, is required on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Second, the defendant contends that the judge should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>expressly instructed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication in deciding whether he shared the requisite intent for a joint venture. The defendant clearly failed to object to the judge\u2019s instruction in this instance; therefore we review the judge\u2019s instruction only to determine whether a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice has occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 596 (1994), we concluded that a judge\u2019s joint venture instructions need not mention the effect of intoxication on the defendant\u2019s ability to share the requisite intent, so long as later instructions \u201cexplicitly link[] the element of specific intent with the defendant\u2019s intoxication.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 675-676 (1996). Here, the judge made that link. First, she correctly told the jury during her joint venture instructions that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] shared the mental state or the intent of the persons, the other persons, allegedly perpetrating the crime.\u201d Soon thereafter, in discussing the intent required for deliberate premeditation, the judge instructed the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cvoluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs.\u201d Likewise, in explaining malice aforethought, the judge told the jury that they could \u201cconsider any evidence that you have as to the defendant\u2019s mental condition on the day in question including any impairment caused by the ingestion of alcohol or drugs.\u201d Considered together, these instructions adequately conveyed to the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining whether he had, and shared, the requisite intent. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>402 Mass. 333, 336 (1988) (error for judge to instruct jury to ignore defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining his ability to form shared intent). Consequently there was no error and therefore no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Third, the defendant maintains that the judge improperly instructed the jury regarding abandonment and withdrawal.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, he claims that, because \u201cthe evidence raised a jury question whether he had withdrawn from the joint venture appreciably before the crime was committed and that the others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>had notice of that detachment ... a charge on withdrawal or abandonment in that regard was required.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the judge thoroughly instructed the jury on withdrawal and abandonment. These instructions, moreover, included the warning that the withdrawal and abandonment must be \u201cin a timely and effective manner\u201d and that, \u201cif [the] withdrawal comes so late that the crime cannot be stopped, then it is too late and it is not effective.\u201d The judge also stated that \u201ca withdrawal is effective only if it is communicated to the other persons in the joint venture.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">4. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Finally, the defendant requests us, pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the conviction to a lesser degree of guilt. He maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction as a joint venturer. He alternatively contends that his conviction for murder in the first degree was unfair, in light of the fact that one of his coventurers pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree. After reviewing the entire record, however, we have concluded that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of murder under a joint venture theory. Moreover, the undisputed brutality of this attack leaves us with little doubt that a conviction of murder in the first degree, and nothing less, was appropriate. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AfD\">For similar reasons, we also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that his statement was involuntary. \u201cDue process requires a separate inquiry into the voluntariness of the [defendant\u2019s] statement, apart from the validity of the Miranda waiver.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 387 (1996). Although the validity of a Miranda waiver and voluntariness are distinct issues, \u201cthey are both determined in light of the totality of the circumstances and they share many of the same relevant factors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 673 (1995). As previously discussed, the judge in the present case found that the defendant was seventeen years old, had a tenth-grade education, and was generally coherent at the time of his statements. He received Miranda warnings both orally and in writing, and subsequently waived his rights. In addition, there was no evidence of improper behavior by the police. Indeed, the interrogation lasted less then two hours, and included a nineteen-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>break. Taken together, these facts warrant the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s statements to the police, like his Miranda waiver, were voluntarily made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence on premeditation. The evidence recited demonstrates that there was ample evidence warranting the jury\u2019s finding in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The defendant claims that he objected to the charge on this basis, but the Commonwealth maintains that the defendant only objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s request for instructions and did not raise this objection which he now seeks to raise on appeal. We do not resolve the dispute and treat the defendant\u2019s objection as though it had been raised below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The judge\u2019s statement, to which the defendant takes particular exception, that, \u201c[i]f one is in agreement and in a position to render aid, he is an abettor even if he did not participate in the actual perpetration of the crime because his presence may have encouraged the perpetrators by giving the hope of immediate assistance,\u201d was wholly appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>407 Mass. 216, 224-225 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988). Similarly, her instruction that \u201csharing [intent] may be in a conditional sense,\u201d has consistently been approved by this court. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 216 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 650 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Again it is doubtful whether this claim was raised below but we pass over this question and dispose of it on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
