The plaintiffs challenge a decision of the State Ballot Law Commission (commission) to include on the November, 1998, statewide ballot a referendum to repeal Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They argue that the petition forms used to collect signatures in support of the referendum suffered several defects of constitutional or statutory significance. We hold that some, but not all, of the petition forms were improper, and remand to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On December 3, 1997, the defendants, ten original signers, filed a petition for a referendum on Chapter 164. To comply with the referendum provisions of art. 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, the defendants were required to gather at least 32,464 certified signatures, no more than one-quarter of which could come from any one county in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 23, 1998, the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) acknowledged receipt of 44,136 certified signatures, of which 43,469 were allowable under the county distribution rule. On March 19, 1998, the plaintiffs filed an objection with the commission seeking to keep the referendum from the ballot because, they alleged, (1) all the petition forms used to collect signatures violated art. 48\u2019s requirement that a summary of the law in question be \u201cat the top\u201d of the form; (2) approximately 8,000 signatures were on forms that violated art. 48 and G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A, because the referendum\u2019s proponents added a preprinted box containing the name of their organization and a return address on the forms; (3) over 17,600 signatures were on forms that improperly contained a hand stamp in blue or red ink with similar information, and (4) approximately 3,400 signatures were invalid because the referendum\u2019s proponents highlighted certain sentences on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The commission ruled that the Secretary\u2019s arrangement of text on the petition forms did not violate art. 48 and that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the preprinted box nor the stamps violated art. 48 or G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A. The commission declined to rule on the highlighting issue. The commission thus ordered the Secretary to place the referendum on the November, 1998, ballot. The plaintiffs then filed a petition in the Superior Court for judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 56, \u00a7 59. The parties filed a joint motion with a single justice of this court for transfer to the full court. The motion was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Article 48, The Referendum, in, \u00a7 4, of the Massachusetts Constitution states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">\u201cA referendum petition may ask for the repeal of an emergency law .... Such petition shall first be signed by ten qualified voters of the commonwealth, and shall then be filed with the secretary of the commonwealth .... The secretary of the commonwealth shall provide blanks for the use of subsequent signers, and shall print at the top of each blank a fair, concise summary of the proposed law as such summary will appear on the ballot together with the names and residences of the first ten signers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">General Laws c. 53, \u00a7 22A, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-9\">\u201cIn no case shall any blank forms for such . . . referendum petitions be larger than eight and one half inches by fourteen inches, nor shall anyone be prohibited from making exact copies of such blanks provided by the secretary of state for the purpose of collecting signatures for such petitions, nor shall any such copies be rejected for certification or submittal to the secretary of state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The plaintiffs claim that the Secretary and the referendum proponents have violated these provisions in their design and use of the petition forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Since the adoption of art. 48 in 1918, we have struggled as to how strictly to interpret its detailed provisions and requirements. See <em>Tobias </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 665, 670-671 (1995), citing <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 631, 643-644 (1941); <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>326 Mass. 313 (1950). See also <em>Citizens for a Competitive Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>413 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Mass. 25, 30 (1992) (\u201c[although it is trae . . . that the provisions of art. 48 are mandatory rather than directory, ... it is equally true that our interpretation of the amendment must be \u2018the one most consonant with [its] general design and purpose\u2019 \u201d [citation omitted]). We have recently reaffirmed that \u201c[w]e subscribe to an interpretation of art. 48, as amended, that will achieve its stated purposes. We reject any restrictive reading of art. 48, as amended, that results in a failure to give effect to the purpose for which its words were chosen.\u201d <em>Tobias </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 674 (holding that the Secretary could provide separate pieces of paper containing ballot summaries, although art. 48 requires summaries to be printed \u201con the ballot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Article 48 provides means for the public to participate directly in the lawmaking process, but also safeguards against abuse of those means by special interests to invalidate acts by the people\u2019s elected representatives in the Legislature. The State Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 sought a balance between competing impulses toward direct versus representative democracy. The proper form and use of petitions is an important aspect of the balance art. 48 represents, and our review must respect that balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Article 48 and G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A, require that the forms used to collect signatures be provided by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and impose certain limitations on the content and layout of those forms. This specificity serves at least two purposes. First, by guaranteeing that all signatories see a fair and complete summary of the challenged law, as well as the signatures of the first ten petitioners, art. 48 guards against the possibility that the public will be misled by those campaigning for a referendum. Second, by dictating that the Secretary must summarize the law in question and create the petition form, art. 48 and G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A, provide a means for the creation of a neutral form free from advocacy by those for or against the referendum. Like ballot forms and the voting booth, petition forms are thus protected as a space free from the tumult and bias of political sloganeering. See generally <em>Burson </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191 (1992) (one hundred foot \u201ccampaign free\u201d zone around polling places).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The plaintiffs argue that all the petition forms must be invalidated because the Secretary violated art. 48 by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>place the summary of Chapter 164 and the names and addresses of the first ten signers \u201cat the top of each blank.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 Several items appear above the summary: the title \u201cA Referendum Petition\u201d; the seal of the Commonwealth; the constitutionally required statement that those signing the petition \u201cprotest against Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1997\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and certain statutorily required information on the Secretary\u2019s filing deadlines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The last, to which the plaintiffs object, is actually printed to the side of the first three items. The Secretary argues that \u201cat the top\u201d means \u201cabove the blanks provided for signers,\u201d and that the forms comply with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Although the Secretary\u2019s placement of the summary and names and addresses of the first ten signers is not literally at the top of the petition in the sense that there is nothing above it, the higher placed material is more like a caption or a title. Moreover, we note that the plaintiffs, perhaps recognizing it would be absurd to do so, do not object to the first three items which are placed ahead of the summary. In any event, the layout of the petition forms neither misleads the public nor advocates in any way on behalf of those for or against the referendum. A signer is presented with the constitutionally required information on the form\u2019s front and in an immediately accessible manner. For all functional purposes, the summary of the proposed law is \u201cat the top\u201d of the form. The commission was correct in holding that the placement of this information was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Second, the plaintiffs argue that 8,374 signatures must be invalidated because they were collected on forms to which the defendants had added a printed, and sometimes shaded, box containing the name and address of the defendants\u2019 organization: \u201cThe Campaign for Fair Electric Rates.\u201d In addition, they challenge forms, bearing over 17,600 certified signatures, to which the defendants added a stamp containing similar information. Article 48 requires that the Secretary generate blank forms for use in collecting signatures. Although this could be interpreted to mean that the Secretary must provide all copies of the forms used, the Legislature, pursuant to art. 48, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>in 1944 by art. 74, has provided that \u201cexact copies\u201d are an acceptable substitute for the original petition blank created by the Secretary. See G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A. The question, therefore, is whether the forms containing the added preprinted box, stamp, or highlighting are \u201cexact copies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">They are not. Because the additions and alterations which \u00a7 22A guards against would be the work not of the Secretary, a neutral government official, but of the advocates of the measure, it is important to interpret the term \u201cexact\u201d exactly. The addition of information such as the name \u201cThe Campaign for Fair Electric Rates\u201d to the petition form permits the very sort of advocacy that \u00a7 22A defends against. Altering the form, particularly in a way that, as with the printed box, blends together the added information and the original content provided by the Secretary, invades the small but vital area of neutrality that the Constitution and G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A, demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Sorting permissible from impermissible additions on a case by case basis would almost certainly prove an impossible task, and one requiring untestable assumptions about the public\u2019s perception of the added information. The defendants argue that the material in the box is purely informational, giving just a name and return address. This case illustrates the difficulty. The name given here is itself a slogan, and that slogan is added to the form, which is supposed to be an \u201cexact\u201d copy of the officially sanctioned petition. In future cases the name might be more neutral, or it might be a good deal lengthier and more shrill. The commission cannot and should not have to draw fine lines distinguishing them. The statute draws a sufficiently clear line. The petition must be an exact copy of the official form, nothing less and nothing more. We therefore hold today that no alterations \u2014 additions or deletions \u2014 of any sort may be made to forms provided by the Secretary under art. 48 and \u00a7 22A.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In this case, however, we apply this holding only to those petition forms to which the defendants added the printed box, and not to those forms on which the defendants hand stamped a name and return address. These stamps were generally perpendicular to the printing on the ballot and in red or blue ink. The Secretary warned the defendants against the printed box but not the stamps (a distinction to which the dissent does not advert), and the defendants relied on the commission\u2019s prior decision in Ann Marie Johnnene vs. Robert Chip Ford, SBLC 96-1, which held that such stamps are permissible. We take very seriously the invalidation of over 17,600 signatures of voters in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the Commonwealth who desire a referendum on Chapter 164, and because the defendants, and those voters, had reason to believe that the stamps complied with \u00a7 22A, we do not apply the rule announced today to the stamped petition forms. As to such hand stamps, this decision is prospective only.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Third, the plaintiffs challenge approximately 3,400 signatures collected on forms to which the defendants added highlighting or underlining to emphasize certain sentences of the Secretary\u2019s summary of Chapter 164. By altering the petition forms in this way, those collecting signatures could only have intended to draw a signer\u2019s attention to those parts of the summary that favored their cause. Even more than the addition of a name and address, such highlighting constitutes impermissible advocacy. The signatures on these forms must therefore be invalidated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The parties disagree about whether the elimination of those forms to which the defendants added a printed box and those forms to which the defendants added highlighting or similar markings reduces the number of valid signatures to below the required minimum. Their dispute turns in part upon the admissibility of several hundred signatures from Barnstable and Berkshire counties that were collected on forms containing either a printed box or highlighting. The plaintiffs argue that these signatures should not count toward the total. The defendants claim that the plaintiffs failed to object in a timely fashion to the inclusion of these signatures, and did not include these Barnstable and Berkshire signatures in the \u201clist of signatures\u201d objected to as required by 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 59.03(18).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>The commission did not reach this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Statute 1997, c. 164, is entitled \u201cAn Act relative to restructuring the electric utility industry in the commonwealth, regulating the provision of electricity and other services, and promoting enhanced consumer protections therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Article 48, General Provisions, H, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, provides in part: \u201cNot more than one-fourth of the certified signatures on any petition shall be those of registered voters of any one county.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">For a history of the provision requiring a summary on the petition form, see <em>Tobias </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 665, 669 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">This information is required by art. 48, The Referendum, III, \u00a7 4.

In examining the petitions supporting the referendum, we must keep uppermost in mind that \u201cart. 48 . . . created a people\u2019s process . . . [which] was intended to provide both a check on legislative action and a means of circumventing an unresponsive General Court.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 199 (1976). Our interpretations of the process are guided by the \u201cfirmly established principle that art. 48 is to be construed to support the people\u2019s prerogative to initiate and [repeal] laws.\u201d <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>403 Mass. 203, 211 (1988). Thus, petitions should not be examined in a hypertechnical manner which may contravene the people\u2019s right to repeal a law which they believe was improvidently enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The court correctly holds that the Secretary\u2019s arrangement of the summary of Chapter 164, and the names and addresses of the first ten signers, did not violate the requirement of art. 48, \u00a7 4, concerning the information that must be contained \u201cat the top of each blank.\u201d I also agree with the court that the addition to the face of the petitions of other extraneous material, either printed or stamped, which may subtly or overtly convey an advocacy position violates the \u201cexact copies\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">I conclude, however, that this holding should be entirely prospective and should not be applied to invalidate the 8,374-signatures that were collected on petitions which contained printed (and sometimes shaded) boxes stating the names and addresses of the organizations sponsoring the referendum. As the court acknowledges, \u201csimilar\u201d information is conveyed by the stamps and the printed boxes. The Commission\u2019s prior decision in Ann Marie Johnnene vs. Robert Chip Ford, SBLC 96-1, held that stamps providing the names and addresses of the sponsoring organizations are permissible. A reasonable person reading the Johnnene decision would conclude that putting the names and addresses in printed boxes was also permissible. This being so, it is overly technical in my opinion to differenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ate between the petitions conveying similar information through printed boxes and stamps. Affirmance of the commission\u2019s decision on these two contested matters strikes a proper balance between sensible application of the general principles supporting the people\u2019s process provided for by art. 48 and the need to preserve the integrity of that process consistent with the mandate contained in G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 22A. Because it is agreed that there are sufficient valid signatures to support the referendum when the petitions with printed boxes are counted, there is no need to remand the case to the commission for further inquiry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
