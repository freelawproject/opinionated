Their complaint contains thirteen counts alleging various constitutional and statutory violations. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on eight of the thirteen counts. After a timely appeal we granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. The plaintiffs assert that the judge erred in finding that (1) the conditions present in the DDU do not offend the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; (2) the DDU is not an \u201cisolation unit\u201d and thus not subject to the requirements of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 40; (3) the procedures governing DDU confinement do not deprive inmates of procedural due process rights, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 26; and (4) the conditions present in the DDU do not violate G. L. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 39. For the reasons set forth below, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and, accordingly, affirm the allowance of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\"><em>Facts. </em>The judge found the following facts. In April, 1992, the Department of Correction (department) opened the DDU at MCI-Cedar Junction to house inmates who have committed major disciplinary violations while incarcerated. Inmates who, after a hearing before a department special hearing officer, have been found guilty of committing a violation calling for a major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>sanction may be sentenced to up to ten years in the DDU.* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.25(3)(d) (1993). The DDU is a modem secure facility which can hold up to 124 male inmates in individual cells. The DDU inmates are allowed five hours of outdoor exercise weekly, weather permitting, and they also are allowed to leave their cells to shower and to shave three times weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">At all other times, DDU inmates remain in their cells. Each inmate\u2019s cell is approximately seven by twelve feet, and contains a toilet, sink, bed, desk with attached seat, and one window. The cell\u2019s steel door also has a window, two slots through which items can be passed, and several small holes to facilitate communication through the door. While there, DDU inmates receive hourly visits from correction officers, and daily visits from the director and captain of the DDU. The correctional program officer also makes rounds two or three times weekly. In addition, medical personnel visit the inmates four times each day, while religious and mental health staff make rounds once each week. Inmates may communicate with any of their visitors through their cell doors or by passing a note through one of the door\u2019s slots. Inmates may also speak with each other while in the exercise yard or in their cells. While in their cells, DDU inmates have access to the resources of the prison law library and other reading material. Finally, inmates who have not committed further disciplinary violations while in DDU may eventually have a radio and television in their cells, make four thirty-minute telephone calls monthly, and have four one-hour, noncontact visits per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">1. <em>Rights under the Eighth Amendment and art. 26. </em>The plaintiffs first claim that the judge erred in ruling on summary judgment that DDU confinement does not subject inmates to cruel <em>and </em>unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and cruel <em>or </em>unusual punishment, in violation of art. 26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, a plaintiff-inmate must demonstrate that (1) a prison\u2019s conditions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>confinement present \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm\u201d; and (2) prison officials acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to inmate health or safety. See <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994); <em>Helling </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). To survive a motion for summary judgment, a nonmoving plaintiff must \u201cdesignate \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 714 (1991), quoting <em>Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323-324 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In support of their claim that a factual dispute exists the plaintiffs cite the affidavit of Dr. Stuart Grassin, who opined that DDU\u2019s conditions of confinement can cause \u201csevere psychiatric harm.\u201d The plaintiffs therefore contend that a genuine issue exists as to whether DDU\u2019s conditions pose \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, supra </em>at 834. However, other courts have concluded, and we agree that, whether prison conditions are sufficiently harmful to establish an Eighth Amendment violation, is a purely legal determination for the court to make. See <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>12 F.3d 754, 756 (8th Cir. 1993), citing <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6 (1992); <em>Madrid </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>889 F. Supp. 1146, 1246 (N.D. Cal. 1995). Therefore, expert opinion regarding what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is entitled to little weight. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 348 n.13 (1981) (expert opinions \u201cmay be helpful and relevant with respect to some questions, but \u2018they simply do not establish the constitutional minima\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, there is no factual dispute over the conditions endured by DDU inmates. Rather, the only arguable dispute concerned the extent to which these conditions generally caused inmates\u2019 psychological problems. In these circumstances the judge properly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed. See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Falmouth, </em>420 Mass. 749, 754 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1067 (1996) (deeming summary judgment proper where the \u201cissues before the judge were issues of law, i.e., whether the condom-availability program, the provisions of which are not in dispute, infringes on the rights of the plaintiffs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Absent a factual dispute, the judge properly allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has observed, \u201cfederal appellate decisions during the past decade which have focused on the factor of segregated confinement and lack of inmate contact reveal[] to us a widely shared disinclination to declare even very lengthy periods of segregated confinement beyond the pale of minimally civilized conduct on the part of prison authorities.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>699 F.2d 578, 583 (1st Cir. 1983). See <em>Santana </em>v. <em>Collazo, </em>714 F.2d 1172, 1179 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 974 (1984) (\u201ccourts that have examined the confinement of adults in prison isolation cells have been reluctant to find them unconstitutional, based either on the length of confinement or on the possibility that isolation might cause psychiatric deterioration\u201d). Similarly, in <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>385 Mass. 421, 431 (1982), we held that a prison isolation unit whose conditions were more restrictive than those in DDU did not offend the Eighth Amendment because its inmates were provided adequate food, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and communication with others. <em>Id. </em>at 431-432.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe \u2018isolation\u2019 and \u2018loneliness\u2019 of which the plaintiffs complain,\u201d we concluded, \u201cis not in and of itself unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. If conditions of confinement harsher than those posed by DDU did not offend the Eighth Amendment, it follows that DDU\u2019s confinement is likewise constitutional. Consequently, the judge acted properly in allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">For identical reasons, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that summary judgment was improperly granted to the defendants on the art. 26 claim. While the rights guaranteed under art. 26 \u201care at least equally as broad as those guaranteed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Eighth Amendment,\u201d <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Essex County, </em>390 Mass. 523, 534 (1983), a prisoner seeking relief under this provision of the Massachusetts Constitution must point to <em>both </em>(1) a condition or situation \u201cwhich poses a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d; <em>and </em>(2) facts establishing that a prison official \u201chas knowledge of the situation and ignores it.\u201d <em>Good </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>417 Mass. 329, 336 (1994). See <em>\u2018Abdullah </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 395 (1997). As previously discussed, the plaintiffs failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the first requirement. The evidence instead described conditions of confinement more favorable to inmates than those of an isolation unit we have previously deemed adequate under art. 26. <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 435. Consequently, the judge properly allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 40. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that DDU\u2019s conditions of confinement violated G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 40, which limits confinement in an \u201cisolation unit\u201d to fifteen consecutive days.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the judge concluded that DDU is not an \u201cisolation unit\u201d and, therefore, is exempt from the fifteen-day limit imposed by \u00a7 40. The plaintiffs claim this was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Enacted in 1955, \u00a7 40 sought to \u201csubstitute more humane treatment for the harsher conditions of solitary confinement previously imposed, which were \u2018deplored\u2019 as \u2018barbaric.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>382 Mass. 57, 61 (1980), citing Report and Recommendations of the Governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Committee to Study the Massachusetts Correctional System, 1955 Senate Doc. No. 750, at 43; McGrath, Criminal Law, Procedure, and Administration, 1955 Ann. Survey Mass. Law 119, 126-127. These \u201charsher conditions,\u201d as the motion judge expressly found, included twenty-four hour solitary confinement without communication, exercise, reading material (other than a religious book), medical visits, showers, telephone calls, television, or radio. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 139 (1993) (\u201cIsolation . . . involves a significant loss of freedom, opportunity for exercise or earning good time credits, as well as contact with visitors and others\u201d); <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>385 Mass. 421, 432-433 (1982) (presupposing that \u00a7 40 was applicable to segregated unit in which inmates had no exercise time, no reading material other than Bible and legal papers, and no nonstaff visitors other than attorneys and chaplains).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The judge\u2019s findings and the parties\u2019 stipulation demonstrate that DDU confinement, while uncomfortable, is a far cry from the \u201cbarbaric\u201d conditions \u00a7 40 sought to alleviate. Cell construction, access to prison officials and other prisoners, exercise, and entertainment opportunities, to name a few, demonstrate much less severe conditions of confinement than the' isolation confinement regulated by \u00a7 40. Other courts have reached the same conclusion. See <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>891 F. Supp. 25, 29 (D. Mass. 1995), aff\u2019d, 88 F.3d 1146 (1st Cir. 1996); <em>Abrazinski </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>876 F. Supp. 313, 319 (D. Mass. 1995). Accordingly, the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this count was proper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">3. <em>Due process. </em>The plaintiffs next contend that the judge erred in ruling on summary judgment that the administrative disciplinary process governing DDU confinement does not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process rights under the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Prison inmates have the protections of procedural due process only if there is an existing liberty or property interest at stake. <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, supra </em>at 135, citing <em>Regents of State Colleges' </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571 (1972). In <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995), the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Supreme Court held that \u201cthese interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which . . . imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d Whether a particular restraint imposes an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d depends, in turn, on its \u201cduration and degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. Where such an interest is deemed to exist, we next ask whether the disciplinary procedures afforded to inmates are adequate to satisfy the due process requirements mandated by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 379, 389 (1983), citing <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557-558 (1974). In these circumstances disciplinary procedures must include \u201c(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and to present evidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, supra </em>at 138, quoting <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst. at Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985), citing <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, supra </em>at 563-567.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Applying this analysis to the present case, we conclude that, even if there has been an \u201catypical and significant hardship,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights have not been violated. Cf. <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, supra </em>at 484; <em>Dominique </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>73 F.3d 1156, 1160-1161 (1st Cir. 1996). An inmate facing a DDU disciplinary hearing must receive both a disciplinary report and notice of the hearing at least twenty-four hours in advance. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.11(2) (1993); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra </em>at 564 (deeming twenty-four hours\u2019 notice of disciplinary hearing sufficient). Moreover, an inmate may call witnesses and offer other evidence at the DDU hearing in his defense, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.14(4), doing so either himself or with the assistance of counsel, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.12(1). Finally, after the hearing, the department is required to prepare a written decision, which must include a description of the evidence relied on, a statement of the reasons for the sanctions imposed, and an explanation for the exclusion of any evidence or witnesses. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.17(l)(a)-(c). With these procedural safeguards in place, DDU\u2019s disciplinary process comports with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, as set forth in <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>pra </em>at 563-567. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s allowance of summary judgment was proper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">4. <em>General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 32. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs request that we reverse the judge\u2019s ruling on summary judgment that DDU\u2019s conditions of confinement do not violate G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 32. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 32, requires prison officials to \u201ctreat the prisoners with the kindness which their obedience, industry and good conduct merit.\u201d This requirement, however, extends only to those inmates \u201cwho are not being disciplined.\u201d Inmates are sentenced to DDU only after committing a \u201cmajor\u201d disciplinary offense in a prison facility. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.25(3). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forte, </em>423 Mass. 672, 673, 677 (1996) (confinement in DDU part of major prison discipline in Massachusetts). Cf. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.09 (providing that \u201c[a]n inmate may be placed or retained in a [departmental segregation unit] only for administrative, and not for disciplinary, reasons\u201d). Considered in this light, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 32, does not apply to confinement in DDU. The judge, therefore, was correct in allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">These plaintiffs were sentenced to from seventeen months to six and one-half years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d Similarly, art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo magistrate or court of law, shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">At least one Federal District Court, however, has noted that, while \u201cthe opinions of experts are entitled to little weight in determining whether a condition is \u2018cruel and unusual punishment\u2019 under the Eighth Amendment . . . expert opinion may be properly considered in assessing the effects of challenged conditions or practices.\u201d <em>Madrid </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>889 F. Supp. 1146, 1159 (N.D.

Moreover, they were allowed no reading material other than a Bible and personal legal papers. There was likewise no evidence that the inmates could have radios or televisions in their cells. Finally, aside from prison and medical staff, only attorneys and chaplains could visit the inmates. See <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>385 Mass. 421, 424-426 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We do not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that there was a factual dispute with respect to the defendants\u2019 \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d (i.e., the second requirement of an Eighth Amendment claim). The plaintiffs must meet both the first and second requirements to have an Eighth Amendment claim. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure with respect to the first requirement precludes the need for trial with respect to the second requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The defendants do not raise the claim of issue preclusion and we express no opinion as to its applicability to this appeal. We note, however, that in Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>James Clark, Norfolk Superior Court No. 97-4079 (April 6, 1998), several inmates claimed, inter alia, that incarceration in DDU violates the Eighth Amendment and art. 26. After making extensive factual findings regarding the conditions of confinement in DDU, a Superior Court judge concluded that DDU\u2019s conditions offend neither the Eighth Amendment nor art. 26. <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>E.M.

Section 39 provides, in relevant part, that prisons\u2019 segregated units \u201cshall provide regular meals, fully furnished cells, limited recreational facilities, rights of visitation and communication by those properly authorized, and such other privileges as may be established by the commissioner.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the judge\u2019s allowance of the motion was \u201can apparent clerical error,\u201d given the judge\u2019s notation that \u201c[n]either plaintiffs nor defendants have addressed the allegation in Count V that the [department] defendants have violated G.

Moreover, undisputed facts in the summary judgment record indicate that DDU has met \u00a7 39\u2019s requirements. Each inmate receives three meals daily, while residing in a cell equipped with a toilet, sink, bed and desk with attached seat. Moreover, DDU inmates have access to an exercise facility for five hours weekly. They also may communicate with both prison staff and each other throughout the week.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
