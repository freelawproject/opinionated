L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the authority contends that the judge erred in (1) imposing liability on the authority under G. L. c. 93A, and (2) award<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing the defendant punitive damages in connection with the authority\u2019s c. 93A violation. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that c. 93A does not apply to the authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The judge found the following facts. The authority administers public housing and is the landlord of the premises in which the defendant began residing in 1981. In March, 1992, the authority served the defendant with notice to quit the premises for nonpayment of rent. The defendant counterclaimed, contending, inter aha, that the authority\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in compliance with the State sanitary code constituted an \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d practice under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The judge found that the authority\u2019s violations of the State sanitary code cumulatively amounted to a breach of the warranty of habitability. Based on these findings, the judge concluded that \u201c[t]he [authority\u2019s] renting [of] premises that contained conditions which breached the warranty of habitability constituted an unfair and deceptive practice\u201d under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(a). </em>Consequently, the judge awarded the defendant damages in the amount of $708,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plus attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), prohibits \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Engaging in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d in turn requires a party to act \u201cin a business context.\u201d <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>426 Mass. 436, 439 (1998), citing <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 611 (1978). Whether a party is acting \u201cin a business context\u201d depends on particular circumstances such as \u201cthe nature of the transaction, the character of the parties involved, and [their] activities . . . and whether the transaction [was] motivated by business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Begelfer </em>v. <em>Najarian, </em>381 Mass. 177, 190-191 (1980). Chapter 93A contains no explicit indication that governmental entities are to be liable under its provisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>United States Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>402 Mass. 228, 232 (1988). Regardless whether such entities may be hable in some circumstances, we have repeatedly refrained from imposing liability on parties motivated by \u201clegislative mandate, not business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 52 (1994), quoting <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, <em>777 </em>(1992). Although not dispositive, a party\u2019s status as a \u201cnonprofit operation\u201d has influenced our analysis. See <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, supra </em>at 440, citing <em>Poznik, </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 53; <em>All Seasons Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, </em>416 Mass. 269, 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In the present case, we conclude that the authority was not acting \u201cin a business context.\u201d The authority is an entity whose creation, organization, and operation are products of G. L. c. 121B, and its accompanying regulations, 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.17 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is prohibited by statute from operating at a profit. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32, first par. The rents for the dwelling units in its projects are fixed by statute and any deficiency in its budget caused by its reduced rentals shall be paid by the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the authority\u2019s legislative mandate to \u201cprovide housing projects for families of low income,\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 26 <em>(e), </em>is analogous to the activities of other entities we have concluded were not conducted in a business context. See <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 53 (insurance association not engaging in trade or commerce where \u201c[i]ts customers are those who cannot obtain insurance from insurance companies in the general marketplace\u201d); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at 775-776 (insurers\u2019 association not engaged in trade or commerce where it covers claims of parties whose insurance companies have become insolvent).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The fact that the authority in the present case and other governmental entities may have been permitted to bring c. 93A claims is not significant. An entity may be engaged in trade or commerce when dealing with large insurance companies in behalf of patients of a hospital under its control or in purchas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ing electrical power from a public utility, and be not so engaged when fulfilling its statutory mandate to benefit some segment of the general public. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 569, 574-575 (1987) (city was engaged in trade or commerce in procuring health insurance policies for patients at Boston City Hospital); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 615-616 (1983) (Boston Housing Authority was engaged in trade or commerce in contracting with Boston Edison for steam in public housing).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Manifestly the authority did not act \u201cin a business context\u201d and thus, was not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d in its dealings with the defendant. Consequently, imposing liability under c. 93A and the consequent award of double damages and attorney\u2019s fees was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Housing Court for entry of a new judgment under which (1) the defendant is entitled to possession of the premises and $890 in damages; and (2) the authority is entitled to $1,072 in withheld rental payments. The defendant is also entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, to be calculated by the judge on remand, for work performed at trial in furtherance of his claim under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-17\">The authority makes no argument here respecting its claim for possession, and therefore that claim is waived. <em>Dullea </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>424 Mass. 37, 38 n.2 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Worcester Housing Authority and numerous other housing authorities throughout the Commonwealth and by the Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">In arriving at this figure the judge first found that the defendant was entitled to actual damages in the amount of $890: $540 in a rent \u201crebate,\u201d and $350 in \u201cout of pocket damages.\u201d The judge then doubled this amount, under G. L. c. 93A, to $1,780. Finally, the judge subtracted from this sum $1,072, for use and occupation of the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ag9\">For example, \u00a7 3 of G. L. c. 121B covers the creation and dissolution of housing authorities, \u00a7 5 explains the membership requirements of housing authorities, \u00a7 26 delineates housing authorities\u2019 powers, and \u00a7 32 outlines tenant selection requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
