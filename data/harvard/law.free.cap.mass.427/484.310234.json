The Appeals Court concluded that the issue was for the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 921 (1997). We agree with the Appeals Court in its reasoning and result. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions of trafficking in cocaine and trafficking within 1,000 feet of a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">1. The defendant acknowledged that he sold cocaine to an undercover State trooper on three occasions. He testified, however, that the trooper had approached him and set him up in the business of selling cocaine. According to the defendant\u2019s testimony, the trooper gave him money to buy a pager, instructed him to find a cocaine supplier, and threatened that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfamily was going to pay for it\u201d if he did not cooperate. Based on this testimony, the defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury to acquit the defendant if they found the trooper\u2019s conduct fundamentally unfair.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge did not give the requested instruction. When the defendant objected, the judge responded that he did not believe such an instruction was appropriate on these facts. The defendant argues that the refusal to give this instruction was error. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The principle that egregious government misconduct may violate due process and bar prosecution is well-established in Federal law. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 431-432 (1973). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>965 F.2d 906, 909 (10th Cir. 1992), and cases cited. We also have recognized that dismissal of an indictment may be necessary when the government\u2019s conduct is so egregious as to prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>373 Mass. 438, 443 (1977). However, we have never decided whether the judge or the jury should make this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In cases alleging egregious government conduct, \u201cthe focus ... is not on the propensities and predisposition of a specific defendant, but on \u2018whether the police conduct revealed in the particular case falls below standards, to which common feelings respond, for the proper use of governmental power.\u2019 . . . Under this approach, the determination of the lawfulness of the [government's conduct must be made \u2014 as it is on all questions involving the legality of law enforcement methods \u2014 by the trial judge, not the jury.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, supra </em>at 441 (Stewart, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 369, 382 (1958). \u201c[T]he jury is not equipped and should not be permitted to speculate on whether particular facts do or do not amount to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>565 F.2d 179, 182 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1075 (1978). See <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 497 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dudden, </em>65 F.3d 1461, 1466 (9th Cir. 1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mosley, supra </em>at 909 n.3; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>962 F.2d 1228, 1232 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1033, and cert. denied sub nom. <em>King </em>v. <em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 909 (1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bontkowski, </em>865 F.2d 129, 131 (7th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>820 F.2d 3, 7 n.5 (1st Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, 777 </em>F.2d 958, 963 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nunez-Rios, 622 </em>F.2d 1093, 1098 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>543 F.2d 640, 648 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u201c[W]e have never ordered the dismissal of an indictment for misconduct in the absence of prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 246 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>413 Mass. 50, 59 (1992). \u201cThe only reason to dismiss criminal charges because of nonprejudicial but egregious police misconduct would be to create a climate adverse to repetition of that misconduct that would not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 587 (1989). Because the issue of outrageous government conduct is a question of constitutional (due process) law, it is not a jury issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>instruct the jury on egregious government conduct was correct.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The defendant did not ask the judge to rule on his claim of egregious government conduct as a matter of constitutional law. His claim was solely that the issue was for the jury. \u201c[W]e shall not disregard the theory of law on which the parties proceeded at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 382 (1981), citing <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>382 Mass. 347, 349 n.5 (1981). See <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 107 (1956). Nevertheless, we review the issue to determine whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We conclude that the alleged threat does not meet the standards for dismissal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 355 (1984) (requiring \u201ccoercion, violence or brutality\u201d or \u201cpersistent exploitation of personal weakness\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mosley, supra </em>at 910 (\u201cthe challenged conduct must be shocking, outrageous, and clearly intolerable\u201d; egregious government conduct defense is not \u201cintended merely as a device to circumvent the predisposition test in the entrapment defense\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 182 (alleged \u201cdemands persisting over a period of months\u201d and \u201cpressure that became occasionally angered and even threatening,\u201d even if true, was not outrageous conduct).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no error, and no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in limiting the jurors\u2019 consideration to the defendant\u2019s entrapment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">2. The defendant\u2019s testimony, noted above, also raised the issue of entrapment by showing, if believed, that the trooper induced him to commit the crimes. It then became the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 652 (1972). The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>argues that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty because the Commonwealth produced no evidence directly showing that he was predisposed to commit the crime on the day of the alleged inducement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The evidence showed that at the first sale, which took place only two weeks after the alleged inducement, the defendant had a supplier, additional customers, and access to large quantities of cocaine. He sold the cocaine readily and without reluctance. Furthermore, cocaine and drug paraphernalia, as well as other assorted possessions of the defendant, were found at a Chelsea address to which a utility bill had been sent in the defendant\u2019s name. Although the defendant claimed that he was merely storing some possessions at the apartment and that the utility bill in his name was to establish a Chelsea residence for school purposes, the jurors were entitled to disbelieve his explanation of the evidence. The evidence was sufficient for them to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crimes at the time of the alleged inducement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>(\u201c[t]he jury may . . . properly consider the conduct of the defendant as related to the indictments at issue before the jury, and predisposition may warrantably be found upon this kind of evidence alone, if the evidence is of sufficient significance\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 784-785 (1997) (on motion for required finding of not guilty, court views evidence in the light most favorable to Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">3. During deliberations, the jury asked the following question, in relevant part: \u201cMust the Commonwealth prove that there was no entrapment? Or must the jury decide this on the basis of the evidence given by the witnesses?\u201d The judge responded by repeating the entire entrapment instruction. When some jurors still expressed confusion over part of the instruction, the judge repeated the entire instruction again. The defendant did not object at trial, but now argues that the judge responded inappropriately to the jury question because he did not specifically address their confusion. We disagree. \u201cThe proper response to a jury question must remain within the discretion of the trial judge, who has observed the evidence and the jury firsthand and can tailor supplemental instructions accordingly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 807 n.11 (1996). The judge\u2019s discretion to formulate a response is broad. <em>Id. </em>The instruction correctly set out the law of entrapment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the fact that the jurors asked no further questions suggests that their confusion was dispelled. There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Egregious government conduct is similar to entrapment. The challenge under egregious conduct is a constitutional due process challenge and is \u201creserved for . . . only the most intolerable government conduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Restrepo, </em>930 F.2d 705, 712 (9th Cir. 1991), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bogart, </em>783 F.2d 1428, 1435 (9th Cir.), vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wingender, </em>790 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1986). \u201cThe essence of due process entrapment inheres in the egregious or blatant wrongfulness of the government\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>127 N.J. 458, 470 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The defendant requested the following instruction: \u201c8. If you find that the police conduct in this case was so fundamentally unfair as to be offensive to our basic standards of decency, justice and fairness, then you must acquit the defendant. If the government\u2019s actions reached this level of impropriety, you need not consider whether or not the Defendant was predisposed to commit the crime, since society cannot condone behavior on the part of government agents which is contrary to- our fundamental standards of fairness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The defendant argues that, because the alleged conduct in this case may have been entrapment and entrapment is a jury question, the issue of egregious government misconduct should also be a jury question. We do not agree. Entrapment focuses on the defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit a crime. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>421 Mass. 686, 691 (1996). By contrast, the inquiry here focuses primarily on the government\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">We recognize that occasionally egregious government misconduct may not come to light until the trial. In such a situation, a motion for a required finding of not guilty would be appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">We have suggested that the issue of egregious government misconduct should be raised at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 353 (1984). The Federal courts have used factors such as \u201c(1) the extent of the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime; (2) whether the defendant\u2019s criminal activity predated the government\u2019s involvement; (3) the extent and type of government involvement in the crime; and (4) the nature of the crime.\u201d See Note, Reconfiguring the Entrapment and Outrageous Government Conduct Doctrines, 84 Geo. L.J. 1945, 1967-1968 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
