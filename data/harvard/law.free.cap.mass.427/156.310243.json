L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, commonly referred to as the anti-SLAPP statute, are applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant, Francis E. Marino, breached a confidentiality agreement with it, and other related claims, and if so, whether the statutory procedure for early dismissal of such claims is constitutional. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend the anti-SLAPP statute to apply to claims such as those in this case, a result also reached by the Appeals Court in a thoughtful opinion. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 572 (1997). We affirm the judge\u2019s interlocutory order denying the defendants\u2019 special motions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">1. We summarize the undisputed background facts to the controversy. The plaintiff, Duracraft Corporation (Duracraft), and the defendant, Holmes Products Corporation (Holmes), are direct competitors supplying the market for consumer home appliances. The two companies also are adversaries in adjudicatory proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From 1987 to mid-1990, Marino was employed as a senior executive for Holmes. He subsequently was employed by Duracraft from August, 1990, to August, 1994, and was then again employed by Holmes in December, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">On August 6, 1990, shortly after he was hired by Duracraft, Marino executed a \u201cNondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement\u201d with Duracraft. The agreement bound Marino to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>confidential information concerning Duracraft\u2019s products and processes, except \u201cupon the lawful demand of any governmental agency (including court process).\u201d The agreement further provided that, prior to Marino\u2019s making any disclosure in the event of such a demand, \u201cDuracraft shall have the opportunity to review and comment upon the Confidential Information requested and may participate with [Marino] in discussing with such agency concerning the scope and content of the requested Confidential Information.\u201d While at Duracraft, Marino was responsible for intellectual property matters, including litigation and applications for patents and trademarks. He served as Duracraft\u2019s liaison to counsel and as Duracraft\u2019s designated witness in the TTAB proceedings against Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In December, 1995, more than one year after he had left Duracraft, Marino was rehired by Holmes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 30, 1995, shortly before Marino rejoined Holmes, Holmes noticed Marino\u2019s deposition in the TTAB proceeding. Duracraft and Holmes offer divergent interpretations of discussions held between Marino and Holmes concerning Marino\u2019s deposition, Marino\u2019s reemployment with Holmes, any connection between these two events, and whether Duracraft had contemporaneous knowledge of Holmes\u2019s rehiring of Marino. After several postponements, Marino\u2019s deposition took place on February 7, 1996, by which time Marino was an employee of Holmes. Counsel for Duracraft was present at Marino\u2019s deposition and, in light of Marino\u2019s nondisclosure agreement with Duracraft, voiced a number of objections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>On March 21, 1996, Duracraft filed the complaint that led to this appeal, alleging that Marino had breached his nondisclosure contract with Duracraft and his fiduciary duties to it by his testimony at the deposition and in his discussions with Holmes prior to the deposition.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Duracraft alleged that Marino\u2019s disclosures also violated its attorney-client and work product privileges. Duracraft secured an ex parte temporary restraining order preventing Holmes from using Marino\u2019s deposition testimony in the underlying trademark proceeding. The restraining order was extended pending the defendants\u2019 filing, on April 17, 1996, of special motions to dismiss Duracraft\u2019s complaint, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. After a hearing on May 9, 1996, the judge denied both Duracraft\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and the defendants\u2019 special motions to dismiss, from which interlocutory order the defendants filed leave to appeal. On May 7, 1997, the Appeals Court affirmed the denial of the special motions to dismiss. 42 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 583 (1997). We granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">2. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59H, inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1, set out in relevant part in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is popularly known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d law.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was enacted on December 29, 1994, and this case presents the first occasion in which we have considered the statute. Marino and Holmes contend that the deposition testimony given by Marino in the TTAB proceeding is \u201cpetitioning activity\u201d protected under the statute, and that any claim by Duracraft based on the giving of that testimony is barred by the statute and must be dismissed. Duracraft counters that the anti-SLAPP statute was not intended to authorize dismissal of an otherwise valid claim, and that, if the statute was to be so construed, then it would violate Duracraft\u2019s own constitutionally protected right to petition a court for redress of its grievance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>3. In the preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520, the Legislature recognized that \u201cfull participation by persons and organizations and robust discussion of issues before legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies and in other public fora are essential to the democratic process, [and] that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\u201d In order that such \u201cdisfavored\u201d litigation could \u201cbe resolved quickly with minimum cost to citizens who have participated in matters of public concern,\u201d the act amended G. L. c. 231, inserting \u00a7 59H, to provide a procedural remedy for early dismissal of the disfavored SLAPP suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">One lawsuit appears to have been an impetus for introduction of the anti-SLAPP legislation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1991, fifteen residents of Rehoboth, concerned with the protection of wetlands draining into the Palmer River, signed a petition opposing a permit for construction of six single-family residences. The developer sued, and the Rehoboth petitioners said they had incurred more than $30,000 in legal fees before the suit was dismissed nine months later.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The typical mischief that the legislation intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development projects. SLAPP suits have been characterized as \u201cgenerally meritless suits brought by large private interests to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\u201d <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 816-817 (1994), citing Pring, SLAPPs: Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, 7 Pace Envtl. L. Rev. 3, 5-6, 9 (1989). The objective of SLAPP suits is not to win them, but to use litigation to intimidate opponents\u2019 exercise of rights of petitioning and speech. <em>Id. </em>SLAPP suits target people for \u201creporting violations of law, writing to government officials, attending public hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ings, testifying before government bodies, circulating petitions for signature, lobbying for legislation, campaigning in initiative or referendum elections, filing agency protests or appeals, being parties in law-reform lawsuits, and engaging in peaceful boycotts and demonstrations.\u201d Pring, <em>supra </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Justices of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire issued an advisory opinion on proposed anti-SLAPP legislation and observed that \u201c[identifying SLAPPs, which typically appear as ordinary lawsuits, presents difficulties.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>138 N.H. 445, 449 (1994). The New Hampshire Justices then recited objective identifying features: the implication of a defendant\u2019s constitutional speech and petitioning rights; the filing of limited types of legal claims; and certain types of persons or organizations who file SLAPP suits. <em>Id. </em>Professors Pring and Canan set out four SLAPP suit criteria: (1) a civil complaint or counterclaim (for monetary damages or injunction); (2) filed against nongovernmental individuals or groups; (3) because of their communications to a government body, official, or the electorate; and (4) on an issue of some public interest or concern. Pring, <em>supra </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The legislative history in Massachusetts demonstrates that in response to the problem of SLAPP suits the Legislature intended to enact very broad protection for petitioning activities. The Governor, in letters explaining his vetoes of anti-SLAPP bills passed in two successive legislative terms, suggested that the bills, as written, applied \u201cto a broad group of potential claims, sweeping in cases that are far beyond the types of lawsuits which the bill\u2019s proponents wish to control.\u201d See 1994 House Doc. No. 5604. The Governor\u2019s letter regarding 1994 House Doc. No. 3033, an earlier version of the bill, recognized that the statute shifted the normal burden of proof on a motion to dismiss, but went further by erecting \u201ca nearly insurmountable barrier to a suit, thereby transforming the law and creating an absolute privilege for the right to petition, for the first time,\u201d citing <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>472 U.S. 479 (1985) (right of petition not absolutely privileged). The Legislature rejected a proposed alternative bill offered by the Governor and legislative opponents, and overrode the Governor\u2019s second veto. 1994 Senate J. 1491; 1994 House J. 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">We are dubious that the Legislature intended to create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>absolute privilege.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also see no evidence that the statute was intended to reach suits such as this one between two corporate competitors involved in other ongoing litigation, where the special motion may have been deployed not to limit \u201cstrategic litigation,\u201d but as an additional litigation tactic. In the statute as enacted, the Legislature, however, did not address concerns over its breadth and reach, and ignored its potential uses in litigation far different from the typical SLAPP suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In trying to fashion a properly supported way to narrow the statute, the Superior Court judge in this case relied on the House floor debates and on anti-SLAPP statutes enacted in other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and concluded that the Massachusetts antiSLAPP statute was designed to protect \u201ccitizens sued for speaking out on issues of <em>public </em>concern.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Marino\u2019s deposition testimony was not protected by the statute because the trademark dispute between Duracraft and Holmes was not a matter of public concern. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 574-575 (1997). The Appeals Court, however, traced amendments to predecessor bills and documented that the phrase \u201cpublic concern\u201d was struck from the bill before it was passed in final form. <em>Id. </em>at 578. The Legislature may have had many reasons for dropping the phrase, including a fear that courts might find disputes among abutting property owners of insufficient public concern to trigger the statute\u2019s protections.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But despite expressions in the legislative debate about the need to protect the right of petition on matters of public concern, the phrase was removed from the text of the statute. Accordingly, we agree with the Appeals Court that it is inappropriate for a judge to \u201creinsert the rejected condition that the moving party\u2019s activity must involve a matter of public concern.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 579, citing <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). Accord <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 706 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u201cSLAPPs are by definition meritless suits.\u201d Barker, Common Law and Statutory Solutions to the Problems of SLAPPs, 26 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 395, 399 (1993). See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 816-817 (1994), citing Pring, SLAPPs: Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, 7 Pace Envtl. L. Rev. 3 (1989). The merit of claims in other contexts is tested by whether there is support for the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>contentions of law put forward. See <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 416 (1998); <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 368 (1987) (stating standard for compliance with Mass. R. Civ. R 11, 365 Mass. 753 [1974]). Such a test echoes the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s test to defeat a special motion to dismiss. The focus of the statutory test, however, is <em>not </em>on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but rather on the petitioning activity that the special movant asserts bars the plaintiff\u2019s claim: unless the plaintiff can show that the special movant\u2019s petitioning activity is \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\u201d the statute directs that the plaintiff\u2019s claim be dismissed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Massachusetts statute makes no provision for a plaintiff to show that its own claims are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The statutory test\u2019s focus on the petitioning activity of the special movant alone may adequately test a claim <em>solely </em>\u201cbased on\u201d the petitioning activity: a defamation claim, for example, can be tested by showing that the defendant\u2019s petitioning activity was devoid of factual or legal support and thus can overcome a presumption of qualified immunity. In this case, however, focusing on the defendants\u2019 petitioning activity and ignoring Duracraft\u2019s claims \u2014 that a contractual obligation precludes Marino\u2019s exercise of otherwise protected petitioning activity \u2014 fails to test fully whether Duracraft\u2019s claim lacks merit. Many preexisting legal relationships may properly limit a party\u2019s right to petition, including enforceable contracts in which parties waive rights to otherwise legitimate petitioning. A quintessential example of such a waiver is a settlement agreement, in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>party releases legal claims against an adversary that otherwise properly could be prosecuted by petitioning the court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But neither this example nor contractual or fiduciary relationships in general exhaust the conceivable occasions on which a party assumes obligations that in turn limit the party\u2019s subsequent free exercise of speech and petitioning rights. Furthermore, we are aware of no case that has immunized alleged breaches of such preexisting legal obligations based on constitutional protection for the right to petition, whether applying the <em>POME </em>standard <em>(Protect Our Mountain Env\u2019t, Inc. </em>v. <em>District </em>Court, 677 P.2d 1361 [Colo. 1984]) or otherwise; nor have we found cases dismissing such claims under anti-SLAPP statutes of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Despite the apparent purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute to dispose expeditiously of meritless lawsuits that may chill petitioning activity, the statutory language fails to track and implement such an objective. By protecting one party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition, unless it can be shown to be sham petitioning, the statute impinges on the adverse party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition, even when it is not engaged in sham petitioning.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This conundrum is what has troubled-judges and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>bedeviled the statute\u2019s application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition to its constitutional problems, the statute on its face alters procedural and substantive law in a sweeping way, as the motion judge noted in her memorandum of decision. \u201cA matter may be within the letter of a statute and not come within its spirit, if the matter is beyond the mischief intended to be reached or if to include it would require a radical change in established public policy or in the existing law and the act does not manifest any intent that such a change should be effected.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>304 Mass. 147, 150 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We must construe statutory provisions, when possible, to avoid unconstitutionality, <em>id., </em>and to preserve as much of the legislative intent as is possible in a fair application of constitutional principles. See <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 905 (1980); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 670 (1980). The Appeals Court attempted to rescue the statute by interpreting the statutory language \u201cshall grant . . . [the] special motion\u201d as \u201cmay\u201d grant it. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 582 n.20. Rather than committing decisions on such special motions to dismiss wholly to judicial discretion, we prefer another construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Because the Legislature intended to immunize parties from claims \u201cbased on\u201d their petitioning activities, we adopt a construction of \u201cbased on\u201d that would exclude motions brought against meritorious claims with a substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities implicated. The special movant who \u201casserts\u201d protection for its petitioning activities would have to make a threshold showing through the pleadings and affidavits that the claims against it are \u201cbased on\u201d the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>than or in addition to the petitioning activities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Once the special movant so demonstrates, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party as provided in the anti-SLAPP statute. See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 819 (1994). Such a showing by the special movant should serve to distinguish meritless from meritorious claims, as was intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Applying this construction to this case, Duracraft submitted to the court a copy of the nondisclosure agreement, which constitutes a substantial basis other than Marino\u2019s petitioning activity to support Duracraft\u2019s claims. The defendants\u2019 special motions therefore must fail. We need not resolve the remainder of the defendants\u2019 arguments in this appeal. Even though we hold that Marino may not avail himself of immunity derived from the anti-SLAPP statute, he has not lost recourse to other defenses. We leave to the Superior Court to determine whether the circumstances of Marino\u2019s deposition were legitimate and whether he may invoke any other basis for immunizing his deposition statements. The Superior Court, of course, must also determine the meaning of the terms of the contract between Marino and Duracraft, and whether Marino violated any of the contract\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We affirm the judge\u2019s interlocutory order denying the defendants\u2019 special motions to dismiss the complaint against them and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings on these and other pending issues between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-13\">In November, 1992, Holmes Products Corporation (Holmes) commenced an opposition proceeding against Duracraft Corporation (Duracraft) before the TTAB concerning Duracraft\u2019s registration of the word \u201cturbo\u201d as a trademark for its portable fans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">While Marino\u2019s nondisclosure obligation to Duracraft continued after he was hired by Holmes, Marino\u2019s noncompetition obligation to Duracraft expired one year following his termination date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">At the deposition, Duracraft made timely objections to Holmes\u2019s questions eliciting from Marino information that Duracraft claimed might breach confidentiality and fiduciary duties and attorney-client and work product privileges.

See, e.g., <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 424 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">See Linda Borg, <em>Legislature OK Bill Curbing Frivolous Suits, </em>The Providence Journal Bulletin, Jan. 6, 1994, at ID; Robert Cornea, <em>Legislature Sends Bill Back to Weld, </em>The Providence Journal Bulletin, Dec. 21, 1994, at ID.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Legislature\u2019s rejection of a narrower bill need not imply a legislative intent to preclude judicial narrowing of the bill\u2019s broad language in order that the courts may effect legislative intent that the statute be applied only to SLAPPs and not to suits arising in wholly different circumstances. \u201cStatutes are to be interpreted, not alone according to their simple, literal or strict verbal meaning, but in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation .... General expressions may be restrained by relevant circumstances showing a legislative intent that they be narrowed and used in a particular sense.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>377 Mass. 544, 548 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931), cert. denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932). Accord <em>Quincy City Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>406 Mass. 431, 443 (1990). We note in passing that rather than being perceived as constructive criticism offered to tighten the legislation, the Governor\u2019s opposition to the anti-SLAPP legislation was viewed as protecting developers\u2019 and real estate interests, the typical targets of the bill\u2019s proponents. See Nick Tate, <em>Enviro Lawsuits Take $$ Toll on Activists, </em>Boston Herald, April 17, 1994, at 6; Frank Phillips, <em>Approved Bill Would Stifle Developers\u2019 SLAPP Suits, </em>Boston Globe, Nov. 30, 1994, at 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">One way that other States have narrowed the scope of their anti-SLAPP statutes is to require that petitioning activities seeking the special procedural protections of such statutes be connected with matters of public concern. The Appeals Court in this case documented this element in the anti-SLAPP statutes of California, Delaware, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 577 n.10 (1997). See also Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-11-11.1(b) (Supp. 1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. 25-21, 242 (1995); Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 1443.1 (1991); Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-1002(a) (Supp. 1997). Other than G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, we are aware of no anti-SLAPP statute that fails to include \u201cpublic concern\u201d as an element of the petitioning activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Not only was such an interpretation reasonable, but this criterion was one of four that Pring and Canan, in coining the term, used originally to define SLAPP suits. See note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We recognize that distinguishing matters of public from matters of private concern is not always clear-cut. Such a consideration is reflected in Justice Thurgood Marshall\u2019s objection to creating a conditional constitutional privilege for defamation published in connection with an event that is found to be of \u201cpublic or general concern\u201d: \u201cassuming that . . . courts are not simply to take a poll to determine, whether a substantial portion of the population is interested or concerned in a subject, courts will be required to somehow pass on the legitimacy of interest in a particular event or subject,\u201d even though courts \u201care not anointed with any extraordinary prescience.\u201d <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc., </em>403 U.S. 29, 79 (1971) (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The Appeals Court attached no interpretive significance to the reference to \u201cpublic concern\u201d in the bill\u2019s preamble, as that court concluded that the enacting part of the statute, seen in the light of legislative history, is plain. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 579 n.13 (1997), citing <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>405 Mass. 390, 395-396 (1989). For the same reason, the Appeals Court disregarded statements attributed to the principal proponent of the legislation that the legislation addressed petitioning on \u201ca matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp., supra </em>at 579 n.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">A standard for summary judgment adopted in <em>Protect Our Mountain Env\u2019t, Inc. </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>677 P.2d 1361 (Colo. 1984) <em>(POME), </em>is a likely source of the standard for evaluating special motions to dismiss in the Massachusetts anti-SLAPP statute. See Pring &amp; Ganan, SLAPPS: Getting Sued for Speaking Out 199 &amp; n.73 (1996). The Supreme Court of Colorado announced its standard for protecting petitioners\u2019 activities in the absence of any State statute. In <em>POME, </em>that court required that \u201cthe plaintiff must make a sufficient showing to permit the court to reasonably conclude that the defendant\u2019s petitioning activities were not immunized from liability under the First Amendment because: (1) the defendant\u2019s administrative or judicial claims were <em>devoid of reasonable factual support, </em>or, if so supportable, <em>lacked any cognizable basis in law </em>for their assertion; and (2) the primary purpose of the defendant\u2019s petitioning activities was to harass the plaintiff or to effectuate some other improper objective; and (3) the defendant\u2019s petitioning activity had the capacity to <em>adversely affect a legal interest </em>of the plaintiff\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>POME, supra </em>at 1369.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In his amicus brief, the Attorney General urges us to decide this case based on a waiver theory without reaching the constitutional implications. He would have us conclude that, pursuant to the nondisclosure agreement with Duracraft, Marino waived his petitioning rights (or at least limited his freedom to exercise such rights short of a court order) and that his petitioning (deposition testimony) is consequently \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d To reach such a conclusion, a fact finder would have to consider evidence relevant to the contract, such as the parties\u2019 intent, the express language used, and the circumstances surrounding its formation. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 411 (1981) (effective waivers of constitutional rights, at least in some circumstances, must be express, knowing, and voluntary). Contrary to the focus of the statutory test on Marino\u2019s exercise of his petitioning rights, the focus of such an inquiry would be on Duracraft\u2019s claim under the nondisclosure agreement, an inquiry similar to that necessary to decide whether Marino breached his contract with Duracraft. Before being able to rule on a special motion to dismiss, a court would have to consider the merits of a matter that the special motion was designed to foreclose. In any event, this record does not establish an adequate basis on which we could conclude that, in signing the nondisclosure agreement, Marino made an effective waiver of his constitutional or statutory petitioning rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Massachusetts statute differs from the anti-SLAPP statutes of other jurisdictions in this respect as well. For example, California tests SLAPP suits by determining whether \u201cthe plaintiff has established a probability that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(1) (West Supp. 1998). New York grants motions to dismiss SLAPP suits, \u201cunless the party responding to the motion demonstrates that the cause of action has a substantial basis in law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 3211(g) (McKinney Supp. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In this case, the Appeals Court notes that literal application of the statutory test and procedure \u201cwould create grave constitutional problems where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s action asserts a legitimate, cognizable claim based on a pre-existing contract between the parties .... The plaintiff, after all, is simply exercising its right of petition.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We should also clarify that \u201cbased on\u201d does not mean \u201cin response to\u201d: although claims and related pleadings filed in court may be classified as petitioning activities, plaintiffs are not thereby immunized from counterclaims filed in response to the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">We concur with the Appeals Court on how the trial court on remand should regard the relationship between Duracraft\u2019s contract claim and its tort claims.
