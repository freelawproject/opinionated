The defendant was fifteen years old when he committed the murders and confessed to having done so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues on appeal that his admissions and confessions were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The defendant also requests we exercise our plenary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce or to overturn the verdicts. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument and conclude there is no basis for relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts: on October 9, 1993, after arguing with his parents, the defendant became angry and decided to kill them. He broke into his grandfather\u2019s quarters in the house that they shared and took a gun which he checked to be sure.it was loaded. Later on in the day, while his father and his sister were about to leave in the family automobile, he asked to accompany them. He then went inside the house, shot his mother in the back of the head, returned to the waiting automobile, and shot his sister and his father each in the back of the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">He drove the automobile to an area behind the house and moved his mother\u2019s body into his sister\u2019s room, locked the door, attempted to clean the bloodied areas, showered, and changed. With the bodies out of view he invited a female friend to visit him, which she did, and they spent the night together in his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The next day the defendant, his two aunts, and several cousins went to the Rochester police department to report the missing family members. Two hours later, the police went to the family\u2019s house, noticed a broken window and numerous red stains throughout the house, which the defendant explained as being caused by his sister\u2019s painting birdhouses red. After several hours the police found the victims\u2019 bodies and soon thereafter the defendant admitted to being involved in the killing of his family and was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s statements. </em>At a suppression hearing, the judge found the following facts. At approximately 9 p.m. on October 10, 1993, Chief Walter Denham introduced himself to one of the defendant\u2019s aunts, and at his request she agreed to act as the defendant\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Chief Denham advised the defendant and his aunt of the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights. They both indicated they understood the rights and signed forms acknowledging their understanding. The defendant was relaxed, calm, coherent, and responsive to all police questioning. The questions were asked one at a time and the defendant understood the questions. His aunt was present throughout the questioning and understood the questions. The questioning lasted approximately twenty to twenty-five minutes. During this period, the defendant made no admissions. There was no demonstration of animosity, hostility, or arguments between the defendant and his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">State Trooper Paul Petrino also questioned the defendant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>about one hour after which there was a ten- to fifteen-minute break. Petrino spoke with the defendant\u2019s aunt before again questioning the defendant. She once more agreed to act as guardian on the defendant\u2019s behalf. There was no hostility shown between the defendant and his aunt. The defendant and his aunt were again read the Miranda rights and both stated they understood. His aunt did not press the defendant to answer the questions; he answered responsively and was coherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">After a break at approximately 11:15 p.m., the questioning was resumed by State Trooper Leonard Coopenrath, who again administered Miranda warnings to the defendant and his aunt. Both said they understood and signed the forms. The defendant\u2019s aunt listened carefully to the questions asked of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">At approximately 12:30 a.m. on October 11, 1993, State police Lieutenant Bruce Gordon interrupted the questioning. Gordon spoke with the defendant\u2019s aunt and told her that something bad had happened to her family and that he wished to speak with the defendant. She indicated her willingness to continue to act as guardian and displayed no animosity toward the defendant nor had any reservations concerning her guardianship. Gordon did not seek her aid or assistance in the questioning, nor did she act as an agent for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Gordon told the defendant that something bad had happened to his family and that the defendant was involved. The defendant responded that he knew his rights and, when Gordon restated and emphasized the Miranda warnings, that he did not have to say anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">At that point, Gordon and the defendant heard a police officer state in a loud voice that the bodies had been found. The defendant told Gordon that he wanted to talk to only one person. Gordon got up to leave because he thought the defendant was indicating a desire to speak alone with his aunt. The defendant then stated to Gordon, \u201cNo I want to talk to you.\u201d His aunt agreed to leave the immediate area but remained close by. She was not asked to leave by Gordon. She knew she did not have to leave and believed she could have stopped the interview if she wanted or could have remained in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Gordon then asked the defendant whether he wanted to talk with him, and the defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The defendant then made a statement involving himself in the killing of his mother, father, and sister. The defendant was not upset and showed no emotion. He was placed under arrest and again given Miranda warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Sergeant Robert Kelleher took the defendant to the State police barracks. State police officers requested that the defendant\u2019s aunt come to the barracks so that the defendant could be interviewed. She agreed to continue to act as the defendant\u2019s guardian. At approximately 2:45 a.m. on October 11, 1993, the police repeated Miranda warnings to the defendant and his aunt. Both responded that they understood those rights and signed forms indicating their understanding. His aunt encouraged the defendant to tell the truth. The defendant then admitted killing his father, his mother, and his sister. His aunt was present during the entire interview which took place around a table in an interview room. Neither the defendant nor his aunt asked that the questioning stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">3. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the motion judge erred in failing to suppress the statements he made to police at his house and at the police barracks because he was deprived of the opportunity to consult with an interested adult. In reviewing the motion judge\u2019s decision, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>410 Mass. 31, 34 (1991). We proceed to make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts found. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018[Cjourts must proceed with \u201cspecial caution\u201d when reviewing purported waivers of constitutional rights\u2019 by juveniles . . . and certain procedures are to be followed in obtaining a juvenile\u2019s waiver of his rights against self-incrimination\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip S., </em>414 Mass. 804, 808-809 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">A juvenile defendant over the age of fourteen may properly waive his constitutional rights if, after having been advised of those rights, he was afforded an opportunity to consult with an interested adult who was informed of and understood those rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 35, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guyton, </em>405 Mass. 497, 500-502 (1989), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128, 131-134 (1983). \u201cIt is not necessary for such a juvenile actually to consult with the interested adult, for it is the <em>opportunity </em>to consult that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>critical\u201d (emphasis in original).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 35, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, </em>399 Mass. 71, 78 (1987). Here the juvenile was at least fourteen years of age and had ample opportunity to consult with an interested adult. Therefore, the waiver was valid without there having been an actual consultation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">4. <em>Interested adult. </em>In this appeal, the defendant argues that he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to consult with an interested adult because of his aunt\u2019s close relationship to the victims and her concern over what happened to them. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The purpose of our requirement that a juvenile defendant have an opportunity for a meaningful consultation with a parent, or an adult acting in loco parentis, is to ensure that the juvenile defendant has understood his rights and the consequences of waiving them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 35; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, supra </em>at 77, 79.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not hold a parent or an interested adult to the standards to which we would hold lawyers in explaining a defendant\u2019s rights and the possible consequences of waiver. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip S., supra </em>at 812 &amp; n.6. The fact that the defendant\u2019s aunt was the sister of one of the victims does not require the conclusion that she would be unable to act as an interested adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The motion judge found the defendant\u2019s aunt to be \u201can intelligent young woman,\u201d having a friendly relationship with the defendant, and who acted \u201cin the best interest of the defendant.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 36 (juvenile\u2019s father was able to fulfil role as interested adult despite emotional distress over seriousness of minder charge against son); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevenal, </em>401 Mass. 225, 227 (1987) (juvenile\u2019s mother was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>interested adult despite defendant\u2019s argument that mother became emotional after learning charges facing son). The defendant has not demonstrated otherwise nor that there were facts known to the investigating officers that would have made it \u201creasonably apparent\u201d to them that the defendant\u2019s aunt was \u201cactually antagonistic.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip S., supra </em>at 809. The judge\u2019s findings clearly indicate that the interrogating officers were reasonable in relying on the aunt as an adult interested in the defendant\u2019s welfare. Throughout the course of the questioning at the defendant\u2019s house and at the police barracks, there were no objective manifestations of animosity or hostility between the defendant and his aunt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 36. Even as the facts unfolded and the defendant\u2019s involvement in the murders was becoming a distinct possibility, she expressed a willingness to continue to act on his behalf, despite her concern for the victims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judge properly concluded that the defendant was given an opportunity to have a meaningful consultation with an interested adult before voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant, \u201can intelligent young man\u201d free from \u201cthe influence of alcohol or drugs,\u201d indicated orally his understanding of the Miranda rights and signed forms to that effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip </em>S., <em>supra </em>at 813 n.7. There was no evidence suggesting that the officers coerced the defendant to speak or urged his aunt to instruct him to do so. See <em>id. </em>at 813-814. The defendant has not demonstrated contrary facts to support his contention that his waiver was involuntary. The judge\u2019s findings were amply supported by the record. Accordingly, we conclude that the judge\u2019s determination that \u201cMiranda warnings were scrupulously furnished, understood, and waived\u201d was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">5. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant killed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>family with deliberate premeditation and used calculating efforts to conceal his crimes. We see no basis for exercising our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevenal, supra </em>at 231; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, supra </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-14\">The defendant was tried as an adult pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Juveniles under the age of fourteen, however, must actually consult with an interested adult in order for their Miranda waiver to be valid. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128, 134 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">An \u201cinterested adult\u201d does not act as defense counsel. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that the police were first required to determine whether his aunt could \u201cprovide the defendant with the necessary advice regardless of any conflicting interests.\u201d Nor does our rule impose a burden on police officers to make such an inquiry, especially given that the rule does not require investigating officials either to force the adult to speak with the juvenile, or to proscribe the content of whatever discussion takes place. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip S., </em>414 Mass. 804, 812 &amp; n.6 (1996). The \u201cinterested adult\u201d rule strikes a balance between protecting a juvenile\u2019s rights and the legitimate need of law enforcement officials to question juvenile suspects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that his aunt\u2019s presence in the face of the police questioning was \u201cpsychologically coercive\u201d to him. Although we have indicated that a defendant may offer evidence to show that the presence of a relative may have affected the voluntariness of a confession, we have not adopted a per se rule suggesting that the mere presence of a relative at questioning would be inherently coercive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>416 Mass. 55, 60-61 (1993) (forensic psychiatrist\u2019s testimony should have been considered for purposes of voluntariness ,of confession for humane practice rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The defendant concedes that the police properly advised him of his Miranda rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
