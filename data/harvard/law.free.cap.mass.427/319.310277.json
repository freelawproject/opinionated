L. c. 175, \u00a7 206D <em>(f) </em>(1), brought an action in Superior Court seeking de novo review of the decision by the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) to approve the acquisition of Paul Revere Life Insurance Company and Paul Revere Variable Annuity Insurance Company (Paul Revere), both Massachusetts insurance companies, by Provident Companies, Inc. (Provident), a Delaware corporation. The defendants filed motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motions were allowed based on the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of standing. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On March 24, 1997, after a hearing, the commissioner, pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 206B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> approved the acquisition of Paul Revere by Provident. At the hearing, Ginther gave testimony, cross-examined witnesses, and answered questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>from Provident\u2019s attorney. He also made posthearing submissions. The substance of Ginther\u2019s testimony at the hearing was that the acquisition was not in the public interest because the new company\u2019s market share would be so large that it would dominate the market, putting undue pressure on the industry\u2019s profit margins and allowing it to engage in predatory pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the Superior Court reasserted the claims made at the administrative hearing and also claimed that the acquisition would cause the loss of jobs in Massachusetts. The complaint alleged no direct injury to the plaintiffs caused by the commissioner\u2019s decision. In an affidavit filed with his complaint, as well as at oral argument on the motion to dismiss, Ginther alleged that the commissioner\u2019s decision would injure the plaintiffs because (1) the plaintiffs feared that, after the acquisition, Paul Revere would discontinue issuing a certain type of more extensive disability policy, as Provident had recently done: Ginther alleged that he owned a Provident disability policy and claimed that, if in the future he needed to supplement his coverage, it would be more difficult to do so if Paul Revere stopped selling that type of policy; Niagara Financial Services Incorporated (Niagara) claimed that it would be harmed because customers who owned disability policies would have difficulty supplementing their coverage if Paul Revere stopped selling that type of disability insurance; (2) Niagara feared that, after the acquisition, Paul Revere would terminate its agency with Niagara, as Provident had recently done; and (3) Niagara asserted that Provident had a reputation for rejecting and litigating claims and Niagara feared that Paul Revere would implement similar policies, causing difficulty for its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Superior Court judge concluded that the \u201c[pjlaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries are speculative and are not the proximate consequence of the subject acquisition. Whether Paul Revere will discontinue its disability policy line, discontinue Niagara\u2019s agency, or implement a policy of resisting claims is wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>speculative. Further, whether these contingencies come to pass or not will be the result of an internal business decision of Paul Revere, not the subject acquisition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>We treat standing as an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>The </em>Governor, 381 Mass. 702, 705 (1980). \u201cThe question of standing is one of critical significance. \u2018From an early day it has been an established principle in this Commonwealth that only persons who have themselves suffered, or who are in danger of suffering, legal harm can compel the courts to assume the difficult and delicate duty of passing upon the validity of the acts of a coordinate branch of government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tax Equity Alliance </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>423 Mass. 708, 715 (1996), quoting <em>Doe, supra </em>at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A defendant may properly challenge a plaintiff\u2019s standing to raise a claim by bringing a motion to dismiss under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) or (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). <em>Doe </em>v. <em>The Governor, supra </em>at 705. In reviewing a dismissal under rule 12 (b) (1) or (6), we accept the factual allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, as well as any favorable inferences reasonably drawn from them, as true. See <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 206D (/) (1), provides in part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any act, determination, rule, regulation, or order or any other action of the commissioner pursuant to sections two hundred and six to two hundred and six D, inclusive, may appeal therefrom to the superior court department of the trial court for Suffolk county.\u201d \u201c[T]o qualify as a \u2018person aggrieved,\u2019 a person must allege substantial injury as the direct result of the action complained of.\u201d <em>Harvard Law Sch. Coalition for Civ. Rights </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>413 Mass. 66, 69 (1992), quoting <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 177-178 (1978). <em>See Matter of Elec. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. (No. 2), </em>426 Mass. 1007, 1007 (1998) (EMLICO).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Alleging \u201c[i]njury alone is not enough; a plaintiff must allege a breach of duty owed to it by the public defendant.\u201d <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 75 (1985). Injuries that are speculative, remote, and indirect are insufficient to confer standing. See <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>417 Mass. 161, 164 (1994); <em>Massachusetts Auto Body Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>409 Mass. 770, 780-781 (1991). \u201cNot every person whose interests might conceivably be adversely affected is entitled to [judicial] review.\u201d <em>Group Ins. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>381 Mass. 199, 204 (1980). See <em>American Can Co. </em>v. <em>Milk Control Bd., </em>313 Mass. 156, 160 (1943). Moreover, the complained of injury must be a direct consequence of the complained of action. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 44 (1977). See <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 624 (1981) (\u201cTo have standing in any capacity, a litigant must show that the challenged action has caused the litigant injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In addition, for the plaintiff to have standing, the injury alleged must fall \u201cwithin the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u201d <em>Penal Insts. Comm\u2019r for Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>382 Mass. 527, 532 (1981), quoting <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The plaintiffs have not alleged facts that place them within the area of concern of the statute. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 206B, protects the Massachusetts insurance market and the policy holders of the acquired insurance company. See \u00a7 206B <em>(d) </em>(1) (ii) (the commissioner to consider whether \u201cthe effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance <em>in this commonwealth </em>or tend to create a monopoly <em>therein\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]); \u00a7 206B <em>(d) </em>(1) (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) (the commissioner to consider whether the terms of the acquisition are \u201cunfair, and unreasonable to policyholders of the [domestic] insurer\u201d). According to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Ginther is a New York citizen and a Provident policy holder. Niagara is a New York corporation. Neither plaintiff makes any allegation that they own a policy issued by Paul Revere (the acquired insurer) or otherwise participate in the Massachusetts insurance market.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiffs have also not alleged sufficient facts to show that they suffered a direct and certain injury from the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>sioner\u2019s order. See <em>EMLICO, supra </em>at 1007; <em>Harvard Law Sch. Coalition for Civ. Rights, supra </em>at 69. \u201cMere generalizations and fears are not sufficient to establish aggrievement.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Aldermatt, </em>166 Conn. 43, 59 (1974) (rejecting standing under Connecticut\u2019s cognate statute). The commissioner\u2019s decision does not require the plaintiffs to act, refrain from acting, or pay any money. See <em>Group Ins. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 204. Nor have they demonstrated that the commissioner violated a duty owed to them. See <em>Northbridge, supra </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that because G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 206B, seeks to protect the public interest generally and to provide broad protection to the insurance-buying public, they have standing to vindicate the statute\u2019s purpose. We do not agree. Were we to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, it would permit almost any one to claim standing to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 206B. One \u201czealous in the enforcement of law but without private interest\u201d is not an aggrieved person. See <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>263 Mass. 589, 590 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, because the Legislature provided for broad participation in the administrative hearing, it intended to grant participants in the administrative hearing \u201cparty-like\u201d status, entitling them to automatic standing to appeal. The language of the statute does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. Section 206B <em>(d) </em>(2) provides that \u201cany . . . person whose interest may be affected\u201d by the commissioner\u2019s decision may be a participant in the hearing, with the right to take discovery and to present and question witnesses. The right to appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision, however, is limited to \u201cany person aggrieved.\u201d \u00a7 206D (/) (1). Where the Legislature used different language in different paragraphs of the same statute, it intended different meanings. See <em>G.E.B. </em>v. <em>S.R.W., </em>422 Mass. 158, 170 (1996). Mere participation in the administrative process does not confer standing to raise a claim in the Superior Court. See <em>KES Brockton, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>416 Mass. 158, 165 n.8 (1993); <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 45-46; <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass 667, 673 (1975). Moreover, where the Legislature has intended to grant the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to appeal to aggrieved <em>parties, </em>it has done so explicitly. See <em>Save the Bay, Inc., supra </em>at 673.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory assertion that they must be granted standing because otherwise no one but an insurer whose application had been denied by the commissioner would have standing is without merit. \u201c[A]n unfounded assumption that, if the individual plaintiffs lack standing, no one will have standing to sue, is not a reason to find standing where none exists.\u201d <em>Tax Equity Alliance </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>423 Mass. 708, 716 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing the complaint affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In an affidavit accompanying the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the Superior Court, Ginther asserts that he is the \u201cfounder, owner, and President\u201d of Niagara Financial Services Incorporated (Niagara). According to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Niagara is a broker in the sale of insurance, incorporated in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The motions to dismiss were brought pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) and (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).

Under rule 12 (b) (1), the judge may consider affidavits and other matters outside the face of the complaint that are used to support the movant\u2019s claim that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. See generally 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1350 (1990). In considering subject matter jurisdiction, the judge appropriately considered matters outside the face of the complaint.
