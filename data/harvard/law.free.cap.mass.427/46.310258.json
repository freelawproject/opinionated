L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the common law tort of deceit, and invasion of privacy, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. A Superior Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). We vacate the dismissal of the claims for unfair and deceptive trade practices and deceit, affirm the dismissal of the claim for invasion of privacy, and remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">1. For purposes of reviewing disposition of a motion to dismiss, \u201cthe allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, are to be taken as true.\u201d <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 407 (1995). In evaluating the allowance of a motion to dismiss, we are guided by the principle that a complaint is sufficient \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). It is a \u201crelatively light, burden to be carried in maintaining a complaint.\u201d <em>Gibbs Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Truck Leasing Corp., 399 </em>Mass. 8, 13 (1987). We summarize the facts alleged from this perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Warner-Lambert, a Delaware corporation, regularly conducts business in Massachusetts. Execuquest is a Massachusetts corporation that provides executive employee search services. Over several days in November, 1996, Execuquest agents made numerous telephone calls to various Warner-Lambert offices throughout the United States. The Execuquest agents misrepresented themselves by using various aliases and titles, including misrepresenting themselves as employees in Warner-Lambert\u2019s corporate headquarters. The Execuquest callers requested information from the various Warner-Lambert offices, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, and positions of managerial employees and of minority and female sales representatives. Warner-Lambert employees disclosed some of this information to the callers.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">On December 10, 1996, Warner-Lambert filed its complaint. On February 25, 1997, the judge granted Execuquest\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6) for failure to set forth any allegations as to damages and for lack of standing to sue for invasion of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. Warner-Lambert appealed from the judgment of dismissal, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">2. The judgment of dismissal fails to make any distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>between the grounds for dismissing the G. L. c. 93A claim and the deceit claim, resting the dismissal of both claims on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to allege damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Warner-Lambert did allege in its complaint that it \u201chas been damaged by the release of such confidential and proprietary information and will continue to be damaged.\u201d We surmise that the judge concluded, despite Warner-Lambert\u2019s allegation in its complaint, that, even if Ex-ecuquest had fraudulently obtained such information concerning Warner-Lambert\u2019s employees, as alleged, Warner-Lambert could not prove a legally cognizable injury under either the statutory or the common law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In order to succeed on the G. L. c. 93A claim, the plaintiff must prove that it suffered \u201closs of money or property.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Alternatively, if it has not suffered any loss of money or property, it may obtain an injunction \u201cif it can be shown that the aforementioned unfair method of competition, act or practice may have the effect of causing such loss of money or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to succeed in its request for injunctive relief, Warner-Lambert need not already have suffered loss of money or property due to Execuquest\u2019s alleged unfair and deceptive conduct. See <em>Advanced Sys. Consultants Ltd. </em>v. <em>Engineering Planning &amp; Mgt., Inc., </em>899 F. Supp. 832, 833 (D. Mass. 1995) (injunction pursuant to G. L. c. 93A granted after plaintiff had \u201cnipped the scheme in the bud,\u201d and but for plaintiff\u2019s action, \u201cthere is little doubt but that it would have suffered extensive damages\u201d). The issue then is whether Execuquest\u2019s acquisition of employee information constituted loss of property to Warner-Lambert or may have the effect of causing loss of money or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As to the first of these questions, we have never decided whether a list of employees and associated information is property protectible against misappropriation. In one of our cases, which frequently has been cited as a seminal case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>trade secrets,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we relied on a theory that a trade secret was a property right that would be infringed by a defendant\u2019s disclosure. <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>98 Mass. 452, 458 (1868). We further have recognized that confidential and proprietary business information may be entitled to protection, even if such information cannot claim trade secret protection. <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Marson Fastener Corp., </em>379 Mass. 90, 104 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>392 Mass. 334 (1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have set out six factors of relevant factual inquiry to determine whether \u201cinformation sought to be protected is, in fact and in law, confidential.\u201d <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>361 Mass. 835, 840 (1972), <em>S.C., </em>377 Mass. 159 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On an issue somewhat analogous to this one, we ruled that an agricultural cooperative association could protect the names and addresses of its members as a trade secret and prevent disclosure of such information to the Attorney General, because such disclosure would facilitate competitor solicitation of association members to the detriment of the association\u2019s legitimate competitive interests, the list would be difficult to duplicate from independent sources, and the list was made available to officers and employees with the understanding of its confidentiality. <em>Matter of a Civil Investigative Demand Addressed to Yankee Milk, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 353, 359-360 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Having in mind these precedents, we are unable to conclude as a matter of law that the information acquired by Execuquest is not proprietary business information entitled to protection. A factual inquiry is required to determine that question. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>judge\u2019s dismissal of Warner-Lambert\u2019s complaint was error requiring reversal and remand for further proceedings. In the event that a fact finder were to determine that the employee information is proprietary business information entitled to protection, but that Warner-Lambert had not yet suffered damages, Warner-Lambert may nonetheless seek injunctive relief pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, to restrict use of the employee information, if it can show that it may lose money incident to the use of the information. Warner-Lambert may attempt to show, for example, loss of its human resource investment in recruiting, training, and retaining its valued employees, especially those women and minorities who may have been underrepresented in professional and executive level positions. This issue also raises a matter of factual inquiry entitled to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">3. Warner-Lambert\u2019s claim for invasion of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was dismissed below for lack of standing. We have not had occasion to decide whether a corporation has a corporate right to privacy entitled to the protection of c. 214, \u00a7 IB. We have said that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, protects against the \u201cdisclosure of facts about an individual that are of a highly personal or intimate nature.\u201d <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., 392 </em>Mass. 508, 518 (1984). A corporation is not an \u201cindividual\u201d with traits of a \u201chighly personal or intimate nature.\u201d Cases from other jurisdictions unanimously deny a right of privacy to corporations. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 652 (1950); <em>L. Cohen &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., </em>629 F. Supp. 1425, 1429 (D. Conn. 1986); <em>CNA Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Local 743 of Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, </em>515 F. Supp. 942, 946 (N.D. Ill. 1981); <em>Clinton Community Hosp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Southern Md. Medical Ctr., </em>374 F. Supp. 450, 456 (D. Md. 1974), cert, denied, 422 U.S. 1048 (1975); <em>Health Cent. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>152 Mich App. 336, 345 (1986). Nothing .in the facts and circumstances or the appellate argument<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in this case persuades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>us that a corporation should have a right to privacy protected by statute. We therefore affirm the judge\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We vacate the dismissal of the G. L. c. 93A and deceit claims, affirm the dismissal of the privacy claim, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-16\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2, declares unlawful \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . .\u201d General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, creates a cause of action for persons engaged in business who are injured by conduct declared unlawful in \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On appeal, Execuquest makes a single argument to support the judgment of dismissal on both the G. L. c. 93A and the deceit claims. Both claims require proof of damages. See <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Harbor Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>388 Mass. 141, 144 n.2 (1983) (G. L. c. 93A claim); J.R. Nolan &amp; L.J.

We will evaluate the sufficiency of the damages element common to both claims by focusing on the G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">See, e.g., <em>Sandlin </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>141 F.2d 660, 661 (8th Cir. 1944); <em>Herold </em>v. <em>Herold China &amp; Pottery Co., </em>257 F. 911, 913 (6th Cir. 1919); <em>Associated Press </em>v. <em>International News Serv., </em>245 F. 244, 247 (2d Cir. 1917), aff'd, 248 U.S. 215 (1918).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In that case we stated that \u201c[t]he law puts its imprimatur on fair dealing, good faith, and fundamental honesty.
