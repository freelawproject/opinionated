He claims error arising from (1) the denial of his motion to suppress; (2) the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the defense of lack of criminal responsibility; and (3) the judge\u2019s refusal to conduct an individual voir dire of the jurors after the foreperson saw photographs of the crime scene that were not in evidence. He also asks that we reduce the verdict by exercising our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>affirm the conviction and conclude there is no basis for granting relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts as the jury could have found them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain facts for discussion in conjunction with other issues. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarourt Nom, </em>426 Mass. 152, 153 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The defendant lived in Medford with his wife (victim) and their two young daughters. On October 26, 1991, the defendant and his children arrived at the house of his cousin in Windham, New Hampshire. The defendant told his cousin\u2019s son and his cousin\u2019s wife that he had a bad argument with the victim, had hit her, and possibly had hurt her. At the suggestion of his cousin\u2019s son the two men started to drive to Medford to check on the victim. The defendant changed his mind, and they returned to Windham whereupon his cousin\u2019s wife called the Medford police at 11:07 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Shortly thereafter the Medford police spoke with the Windham police who immediately dispatched two officers to the cousin\u2019s house. The Medford police, meanwhile, sent several officers to the defendant\u2019s house in Medford. The Medford officers discovered the victim\u2019s body on a bedroom floor; she appeared to have suffered massive head injuries. A claw hammer with the victim\u2019s blood type was found in a trash barrel, and a knife with human blood on it was found in the kitchen. An autopsy later revealed that the victim had been struck in the face and head seventeen times with a hammer by someone using severe force, causing seventeen lacerations and multiple fractures. The autopsy also found that the victim had been stabbed numerous times in the back, chest, and stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The Windham police officers who had been sent to the defendant\u2019s cousin\u2019s house engaged the defendant in general conversation until they received word from the Medford police that they had a \u201ccritical incident\u201d in Medford. The defendant then was arrested and brought to the Windham police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">2. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant moved to suppress statements he made to the officers at his cousin\u2019s house and later at the police station. On the basis of the evidence at the suppression hearing, the judge found the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">At the request of the Medford police, Windham police officers were dispatched to the cousin\u2019s house. When they arrived at approximately 11:15 p.m., the defendant was nervous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>distraught, and he said that he had a very bad argument with his wife and that she was not doing very well. One of the officers noticed blood on the defendant\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Medford officers, in the meantime, had arrived at the defendant\u2019s house and discovered the victim\u2019s body on the second floor in a bedroom. At this point the Medford police began the process necessary to obtain warrants to search the house and to arrest the defendant; two officers were sent to Windham.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">At 11:39 p.m., the defendant was first advised of his Miranda rights at his cousin\u2019s house in Windham. The defendant stated that he understood those rights, and, when he asked whether he was under arrest, he was told that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">At 12:30 a.m. on October 27, 1991, the defendant was placed under arrest as a fugitive from justice in Massachusetts, and he was transported to the Windham police station. On arrival, the defendant was again given his Miranda rights. The defendant did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">At about 1:30 a.m. the Medford officers arrived in Windham and began questioning the defendant after again advising him of his Miranda rights. Eventually the defendant told the officers that he had struck his wife on the head with a hammer one or two times earlier that evening. At about 3:30 a.m., the defendant stated that he might need a lawyer, and the officers stopped the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The defendant was booked at the Windham police station at about 3:40 a.m. on a charge of \u201cfugitive from justice.\u201d The defendant\u2019s bloodied clothing was seized and he was then transferred to the Rockingham County jail in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">The defendant\u2019s suppression motion was based on his contention that his arrest in New Hampshire as a fugitive from justice was unlawful because at the time of his arrest he had not been charged with a crime in Massachusetts, nor had an arrest warrant issued against him, and thus his arrest was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">The validity of the defendant\u2019s arrest is determined by the law of New Hampshire, the State where the arrest was made. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>386 Mass. 278, 281 (1982), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiRe, </em>332 U.S. 581, 589 (1948). Under New Hampshire law, a warrantless arrest on a felony charge is lawful if the officer had reasonable ground to believe that the suspect has committed a felony. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 594:10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>(1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vachon, </em>130 N.H. 37 (1987). In New Hampshire it is \u201cwell established\u201d that \u201creasonable ground\u201d to believe that a person has committed a felony means substantially the same thing as \u201cprobable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Because the New Hampshire officers had reasonable ground to believe that the defendant had committed a felony at the time of his arrest, it makes no difference that he was arrested as a fugitive from justice,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> since an arrest is lawful even though the officer may have based the arrest on an improper or inadequate offense. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 594:13; <em>State </em>v. <em>McBreairty, </em>697 A.2d 495, 497 (N.H. 1997). \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when the arresting officer has knowledge and trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution and prudence in believing that the arrestee has committed an offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>138 N.H. 407, 409 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Vachon, supra. </em>There was probable cause for the officers to believe the defendant had committed a felony. The officers observed blood on the defendant\u2019s clothing. He appeared agitated and nervous. He told them something bad had happened to his wife and that he had left her on the floor of her bedroom. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. 145, 163-164 (1994) (victim missing for several hours, defendant acting suspiciously). They were also aware that the defendant\u2019s visit to New Hampshire was unexpected and that he had told his cousin\u2019s son that he had hurt his wife by hitting her with a hammer. This evidence provided a reasonable basis for the officers to believe that the defendant had, at the very least, assaulted his wife with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">3. <em>Defense </em>strategy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>criminal responsibility even though the defendant personally opposed giving such an instruction. The defendant argues that, under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, his trial counsel had complete control over the decision whether to raise the issue of lack of criminal responsibility, and, even if that is not the general rule, before the defendant can go against his counsel\u2019s wishes, the judge must determine that he is competent and that the defendant\u2019s decision is knowing and voluntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">While we have never squarely addressed this issue, we have noted the importance of protecting the defendant\u2019s autonomy in decisions relating to his defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 721 (1997). Even in the face of the \u201cobvious truth that the average defendant lacks the skill necessary to protect oneself in a criminal proceeding,\u201d the United States Constitution and the Massachusetts Constitution protect a defendant\u2019s right to proceed pro se because \u201cit is the defendant who must suffer the personal consequences of a conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>419 Mass. 716, 719 (1995). \u201cIt is the defendant. . . who must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage. And although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 721, quoting <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834 (1975). A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to proceed pro se is protected \u201ceven in cases where the accused is harming himself by insisting on conducting his own defense\u201d because \u201crespect for individual autonomy requires that he be allowed to go to jail under his own banner if he so desires and if he makes the choice \u2018with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 721, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 52 (1974). We see no reason to afford lesser protection to the defendant\u2019s choice not to label himself as \u201ccriminally insane\u201d where the defendant has been found competent and has been fully advised beforehand of the consequences of his actions by both defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>counsel and the judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The defendant also argues that, even if the decision to assert the defense rests with him, the judge must first determine that he is competent to do so and that the decision is knowing and voluntary. The defendant was evaluated for competency on four separate occasions, and on the basis of these evaluations the judge found the defendant competent each time. The judge\u2019s own observations of the defendant at trial and during numerous colloquies support her conclusion that the defendant was competent. The defendant\u2019s own statements throughout the trial support the conclusion that he maintained, at the very least, a working knowledge of the legal process. There was an ample basis to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was competent to stand trial and that inferentially his waiver was both voluntary and intelligent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hung Tan Vo, ante </em>464, 468-469 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The defendant made it clear to the judge and defense counsel that he did not desire to raise the issue of insanity. Throughout the trial, the defendant opposed raising the issue, even though he was advised of defense counsel\u2019s belief that this presented his best opportunity to get a reduced sentence. The defendant vehemently protested any suggestion that he had killed the victim. At the close of the evidence, after the defendant declined the judge\u2019s invitation for an instruction on criminal responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ity, the judge ordered a fourth competency evaluation. After that evaluation, the judge again found that the defendant remained competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Shortly before closing arguments, the judge asked the defendant if he wanted an insanity instruction. The defendant also discussed the matter with defense counsel. The judge ruled that she would not instruct on the insanity defense over the defendant\u2019s objection, and defense counsel noted his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In these circumstances the judge had no obligation to do more and was entitled to rely on the defendant\u2019s refusal to present a defense of insanity. The judge properly found that the defendant had the ability to assist and to consult with counsel in the preparation of his defense, and that he had a rational understanding of the consequences of his decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">4. <em>Photographs. </em>While the jurors were deliberating, the foreperson opened a box of exhibits, which contained a folder of photographs not marked as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The judge found that none of the other jurors had seen any of the unmarked photographs and replaced the foreperson with an alternate juror. She denied the defense counsel\u2019s motion for an individual voir dire of the remaining jurors to determine whether they had seen the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The judge then addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">\u201cFirst of all, my understanding is no one but [the foreperson] saw any of the contents of the exhibit for identification. <em>If that is not correct, if there is anybody else who did, I would ask that person or those persons, when you go back to the jury room, let a court officer know immediately and bring that to my attention. </em>But, for the moment, I will assume that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">\u201cSecond, I just wanted to say, in line with what I said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>before, that when you continue your deliberations, obviously you must focus on the evidence that was before you in the form of testimony and exhibits and only that evidence. I would ask that the question of exhibits for identification not be discussed at all as any part of your deliberations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The determination of potential juror prejudice is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 96 (1986). G. L. c. 234, \u00a7\u00a7 26B, 28. The judge is not required to conduct an individual voir dire unless there exists a \u201csubstantial risk of extraneous influences on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>404 Mass. 298, 303 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass. 52, 55 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The record demonstrates that the judge was warranted in concluding that none of the other jurors had seen the photographs and thus a \u201cserious question of possible prejudice\u201d did not exist such as to require individual voir dire of the remaining jurors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 630 (1993). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, 316 </em>Mass. 790, 800 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>423 Mass. 356, 362-363, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996) (judge properly questioned single juror exposed to extraneous information to determine whether he shared knowledge with other jurors); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>417 Mass. 1, 5 (1994) (weight given to judge\u2019s discretionary conclusion that juror need not be dismissed). The defendant has not demonstrated that individual questioning would have furnished a different result than the collective questioning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, supra </em>at 303. We conclude that the judge acted within her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">5. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>In addition to the arguments raised by the defendant, we have reviewed the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and we conclude that a reduction in the verdict or a new trial is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">New Hampshire has never distinguished its probable cause standard under its State Constitution from the Federal standard. <em>State </em>v. Chaloux, 130 N.H. 809, 812 (1988). Accordingly, if the defendant\u2019s arrest was lawful under the Federal Constitution, then the requirements of the New Hampshire Constitution are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The defendant argues that the \u201creasonable ground\u201d exception does not apply to an arrest for extraterritorial crimes because, he contends, the \u201cFugitive from Justice Act\u201d would be \u201cswallow[ed] whole.\u201d He cites no support for this contention and we decline to accept it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">For convenience we adopt the terminology used by the parties and refer to the issue of the lack of criminal responsibility as a defense. Of course, when lack of criminal responsibility is raised by the evidence, it is the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to prove the absence of a mental disease or defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goudreau, </em>422 Mass. 731, 735 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The majority of States honor a competent defendant\u2019s choice to forgo a defense strategy that asserts, in any way, that he or she was not guilty of the crime charged by reason of insanity \u2014 even over defense counsel\u2019s objections. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marble, </em>940 F.2d 1543, 1547-1548 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (court must honor competent defendant\u2019s decision not to raise insanity defense); <em>People </em>v. <em>Geddes, </em>1 Cal. App. 4th 448, 453 (1991) (whether to assert defense based on insanity is a \u201cpersonal [decision]\u201d for competent defendant despite defense counsel\u2019s disagreement); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lowenfield, </em>495 So. 2d 1245, 1252 (La. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1153 (1986) (defense counsel must acquiesce to competent defendant\u2019s informed decision to forgo insanity defense); <em>Treece </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 Md. 665 (1988) (defense counsel must honor competent defendant\u2019s choice); <em>State </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>175 N.J. Super. 72, 82 (1980) (competent defendant permitted to forgo defense based on insanity); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, 99 </em>Wash. 2d 735, 742 (1983) (concluding respect for defendant\u2019s autonomy requires that individual competent defendant determine whether to assert plea). The minority position holds that, where there is a conflict between a competent defendant and defense counsel, the decision to assert or to reject the insanity defense rests with defense counsel, as a matter of defense strategy. <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>266 Ill. App. 3d 947, 956-957 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 834 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">We note the defendant\u2019s argument that a higher degree of competence should be required before the defendant may make a valid waiver of the insanity defense. The defendant argues for the application of the standard used for determining whether a criminal defendant can waive certain constitutional rights, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L\u2019Abbe, </em>421 Mass. 262 (1995), that would require the Commonwealth to prove that he \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and intelligently\u201d waived the insanity defense. We need not address this issue here where there is an adequate demonstration on the record that the defendant\u2019s decision was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. We note that some courts have rejected the same argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodland, </em>945 P.2d 665, 668-669 (Utah 1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davignon, </em>152 Vt. 209, 219 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
