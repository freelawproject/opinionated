L. c. 208, 209, 209A, and 209C. The portion of Senate No. 2021, \u00a7 3, which leads to the question asked of us, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">\u201cA probate and family court\u2019s finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a pattern or serious incident of abuse has occurred shall create a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interests of the child to be placed in sole custody, shared legal custody, or shared physical custody with the abusive parent. Said presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that such custody award is in the best interests of the child. For the purposes of this section, \u2018an abusive parent\u2019 shall mean a parent who has committed a pattern of abuse or serious incident of abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Under the due process clause, the \u201cgovernment may only deprive a person of life or of an interest in liberty or property by due process of law.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1229 (1996). Thus, the Justices must answer whether the establishment of a rebuttable presumption in custody disputes and the resulting shift in the burden of proof deprives the chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>lenged parent of a liberty interest or property interest, and, if so, whether the requirements of due process have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court and the Supreme Court of the United States have recognized that parents have a fundamental interest in their relationships with their children that is constitutionally protected. See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982); <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 617 (1985), citing <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1, 13 (1981); <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587 (1981). This interest is one of the \u201cliberty\u201d interests protected by art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., </em>379 Mass. 1, 3 (1979), citing <em>Quilloin </em>v. <em>Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246 (1978). However, parents\u2019 interests in their relationships with their children are not absolute, because \u201c[t]he overriding principle in determining [the rights of a parent to custody] must be the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 691 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">There is a growing national awareness that children who witness or experience domestic violence suffer deep and profound harms. See, e.g., <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590, 599 (1996); Fields, The Impact of Spouse Abuse on Children and Its Relevance in Custody and Visitation Decisions in New York State, 3 Cornell J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 221, 222-234 (1994); Cahn, Civil Images of Battered Women: The Impact of Domestic Violence on Child Custody Decisions, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1041, 1055-1058 (1991). To better protect children, many States have adopted legislation making it more difficult for an abusive parent to obtain custody of a child in a divorce proceeding. See generally Comment, Protecting New York\u2019s Children: An Argument for the Creation of a Rebuttable Presumption Against Awarding a Spouse Abuser Custody of a Child, 60 Alb. L. Rev. 1345 (1997). Eleven States have adopted statutes creating presumptions similar to the one contained in Senate No. 2021.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It appears that this court is the first to advise on the constitutionality of such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>In custody disputes between parents there is no constitutional or statutory entitlement to any particular form of custody. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beals, </em>405 Mass. 550, 554 (1989) (both parents have equal rights to custody of their children); <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 709 (1985) (neither State nor Federal Constitution favors one custodial arrangement over another); G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. A parent seeking custody must simply present evidence of facts which demonstrate why such an award of custody serves the child\u2019s best interests. If the other parent wishes to obtain custody, that parent must present evidence to show why he or she should be awarded custody instead. The judge weighs the evidence presented and makes a determination as to which parent can best satisfy the child\u2019s welfare and happiness. See, e.g., <em>Rolde </em>v. <em>Rolde, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); <em>Bahceli </em>v. <em>Bahceli, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 446 (1980); <em>Angelone </em>v. <em>Angelone, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 728 (1980). Evidence of domestic violence is only one factor of many considered by a judge in making custody determinations.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Senate No. 2021 would change the weight that domestic violence is given in custody determinations. Instead of simply being a factor considered by the judge, it could be a determinative factor. If one parent proves by a preponderance of evidence that the other has engaged in a pattern or incident of serious abuse, then a presumption arises that it is not in the child\u2019s best interests to be in the custody of the challenged parent. The chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>lenged parent then has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that despite evidence of abuse, it is in the child\u2019s best interests to be in his or her custody. Thus, once a parent\u2019s abusive conduct is proved, the burden of proof is shifted to the challenged parent to prove that an award of custody to him or her is in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In determining whether the presumption and shifting of burden survive constitutional due process, the question is not whether the State may restrict parents\u2019 liberty interests in relating with their children, but rather, what standard of proof is constitutionally required for the State to do so. Senate No. 2021 would establish the presumption after proof by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Whether this standard survives constitutional muster depends on the value society places on the affected individual\u2019s liberty, the significance of the deprivation or restriction, society\u2019s interest in avoiding erroneous deprivations or restrictions to that liberty, and the value society places on the State\u2019s interest. See <em>Santosky, supra </em>at 755-756. Both the Supreme Judicial Court and the Supreme Court of the United States have utilized the analysis contained in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319 (1976), to balance these interests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, </em>408 Mass. 52, 58-59 (1990); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 274-277 (1982). This requires consideration of three distinct factors: (1) \u201cthe private interest that will be affected by the official action\u201d; (2) \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra </em>at 335. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 59; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 112, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982). We examine each of the factors to determine whether the presumption created by Senate No. 2021 meets the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">1. <em>Private interests. </em>First we must identify the private interests. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra. </em>Creating a presumption that custody in a parent is not in the best interests of a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>implicates the interest of the parent in his or her relationship with the child, as well as a child\u2019s interest in the relationship with his or her family. See <em>Santosky, supra </em>at 755-756; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra. </em>Because the presumption attaches only after the other parent proves by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d that a pattern or incident of serious abuse has occurred, the presumption also implicates the child\u2019s right to be free from abusive or neglectful behavior. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Although parents have a fundamental, constitutionally protected interest in their relationships with their children, attainment of the children\u2019s best interest may involve some limitation on the liberties of one or the other of the parents. For example, in <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>426 Mass. 238, 248 (1997), the court concluded that a parent\u2019s right to practice religion must be restricted when necessary to promote a child\u2019s best interests. See <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 233 (1981). In addition, if there is abuse or neglect, the State may require a partial or complete severance of the parent-child relationship to protect a minor child from serious physical or emotional harm. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, supra </em>at 587-588. Nevertheless, parents\u2019 interests in relating with their children are extremely important, and before the State may permanently deprive any parent of that interest, it should generally be required to meet a standard of proof higher than a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra </em>at 764-766; <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">As the court recognized in <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 61-62, a child\u2019s interest to be with his or her parents fluctuates with the child\u2019s interest to be free from abuse and neglect. When there is evidence of abuse or neglect of a family member, a child\u2019s interest in relating to his or her family diminishes. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 766 (1983). To allow a child to experience or witness domestic violence \u201cis a violation of the most basic human right, the most basic condition of civilized society: the right to live in physical security, free from the fear that brute force will determine the conditions of one\u2019s daily life.\u201d <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra </em>at 595. Therefore, the child\u2019s interest in being free from such abuse outweighs any interest a child has in family integrity. Because a child\u2019s interest in being free from the effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>domestic violence is extremely significant, proof by a preponderance of the evidence appears to be a sufficient standard to allow the rebuttable presumption to attach in custody disputes between parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">2. <em>Risk of error. </em>Next we must consider the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interests through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra </em>at 335; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 62-63. The greater the risk of erroneous deprivation, the more important it is to consider additional procedural safeguards such as a more demanding standard of proof. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra </em>at 764-766.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">A preponderance of evidence standard creates a greater risk of an erroneous deprivation of custody than a higher standard of proof. However, the presumption created by Senate No. 2021 \u201cmay be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that [a custody award to the challenged parent] is in the best interests of the child.\u201d In <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 64, the court concluded that the preponderance standard was sufficient for purposes of restricting a parent\u2019s right to custody, in part, because \u201cfurther proceedings regarding the particular situation [would] be held.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The protection afforded by Senate No. 2021 is even greater, because the challenged parent has an opportunity immediately to overcome the presumption based on a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Another issue of concern is that one parent may make false allegations of abuse to gain an advantage in custody proceedings. The risk of the success of such conduct is greater with a preponderance of the evidence standard than with a stricter standard of proof. However, parents acting in such a manner are clearly not acting in their child\u2019s best interests. Therefore, parents who make false allegations of abuse run the great risk that, they will lose custody of their children. Cf. <em>Duro </em>v. <em>Duro, </em>392 Mass. 574 (1984). See C.P. Kindregan, Jr. &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 47.12, at 366-367 &amp; n.13 (2d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>While it is trae that a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard creates a greater risk of an erroneous deprivation of custody than a stricter standard, any errors which arise can be discovered and corrected through the challenged parent\u2019s rebuttal. Because the risk of error is minimal, proving abuse by a preponderance of the evidence prior to the rebuttable presumption arising in custody disputes between parents is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">3. <em>The State\u2019s interest. </em>The final factor we must consider is the State\u2019s interest in the rebuttable presumption, and the burdens that a more demanding standard of proof would create for the State. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra </em>at 335; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra </em>at 65. The State, as parens patriae, has a \u201ccompelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\u201d <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). See <em>Adoption of Brooke, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 680, 684 (1997). It is thought by some that it is not in the best interests of a child to be in the custody of a perpetrator of domestic violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the State has a significant interest in protecting a child from residing with a parent who has a history of committing acts of domestic violence, unless it is shown to be in a child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">A standard of proof stricter than the preponderance of the evidence would be inconsistent with promoting the State\u2019s interest. The burden of a stricter standard of proof would fall entirely on the parent alleging abuse. But see <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra </em>(burden of stricter standard falls entirely on State). A victim of domestic violence may not have the resources necessary to meet a higher standard of proof. One who commits domestic violence often controls a spouse by threatening to obtain custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>if the spouse attempts to leave the relationship, to report abuse to the police, or otherwise to defend him or herself. See Comment, Protecting New York\u2019s Children: An Argument for the Creation of a Rebuttable Presumption Against Awarding a Spouse Abuser Custody of a Child, 60 Alb. L. Rev. 1345, 1358 (1997); Note, Domestic Violence and Custody Litigation: The Need for Statutory Reform, 13 Hofstra L. Rev. 407, 426 (1985) (victims of abuse are generally economically dependent on abusers and will often be threatened with custody litigation by abusers if they leave). Because the purpose of Senate No. 2021 is to prevent children from witnessing or experiencing domestic violence, a standard of proof greater than a preponderance of evidence would prevent many victims of abuse from proving the existence of domestic violence at custody proceedings, and a greater number of children could end up in the custody of a perpetrator of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In balancing the interests involved, the logical conclusion is that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard prescribed by Senate No. 2021 satisfies the requirements of due process under the State and Federal Constitutions. The risk of error is greatly outweighed by children\u2019s interest in being free of abuse and neglect, and the State\u2019s interest in promoting the welfare of its children. Moreover, because Senate No. 2021 only relates to custody disputes between parents, the risk of error is being shared by two individuals with equal interests. The State\u2019s interest is promoted only indirectly \u2014 through an award of custody to nonabusive parents. Therefore, the Justices conclude in response to the Senate\u2019s question, that the rebuttable presumption and resulting shift in the burden of proof established by Senate No. 2021 would not, if enacted into law, contravene that portion of art. 10 which provides that \u201c[e]ach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing laws,\u201d or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The answer to the question is, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The foregoing answer and opinion are submitted by the Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>Justice and the Associate Justices subscribing hereto on the 11th day of March, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Herbert P.

Comment, Protecting New York\u2019s Children: An Argument for the Creation of a Rebuttable Presumption Against Awarding a Spouse Abuser Custody of a Child, 60 Alb. L. Rev. 1345, 1367 (1997). Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Stales make no mention of a standard for the presumption to attach, some require only credible evidence, and others require a preponderance of the evidence standard. To rebut the presumption, some States require the abusive parent to participate in special programs that address the underlying issues (e.g., anger management or programs for sexual offenders), and some require clear and convincing evidence that custody with the abusive parent is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>See Colo.
