Despite emergency treatment, Matthew\u2019s condition deteriorated, and he died on February 9, 1997. On March 5, 1997, a Middlesex County grand jury returned an indictment against the defendant, Louise Woodward, for the murder of Matthew. She subsequently was ordered held without bail. Woodward had worked as an au pair for the Happen family since November, 1996. Matthew was in Woodward\u2019s sole care from the morning of February 4, on the departure of Matthew\u2019s mother for work, until he was taken to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Trial on the murder charge against Woodward commenced on October 6, 1997. After a three-week trial, the judge gave the jury instructions on murder in the first and second degrees. At Woodward\u2019s request and over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the judge did not instruct the jury on manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 30, 1997, the jury returned a guilty verdict of murder in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>second degree. On the following day, the judge imposed the statutorily mandated term of life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On November 10, 1997, after hearing argument on Woodward\u2019s motion for postjudgment relief, the judge reduced the jury\u2019s verdict from murder to involuntary manslaughter, acting pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. R 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), and vacated the life sentence. He denied Woodward\u2019s request for a required finding of not guilty or for a new trial. In a hearing that same afternoon after release of his memorandum and order reducing the verdict and vacating Woodward\u2019s sentence, the judge imposed a sentence of 279 days for Woodward\u2019s manslaughter conviction, that sentence being deemed served by Woodward while incarcerated awaiting trial and while awaiting action on her postconviction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The Commonwealth and Woodward filed cross appeals. The Commonwealth then sought relief before a single justice, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 <em>3.* </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The single justice reserved and reported the case without decision to the full court, and ordered the parties\u2019 respective cross appeals be consolidated with that reservation and report and entered in this court. The Commonwealth here seeks reinstatement of the jury\u2019s verdict of murder in the second degree. In the alternative, the Commonwealth asks that we exercise our general superintendence power, G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and resentence Woodward ourselves or remand the case to the Superior Court for reconsideration of Woodward\u2019s rule 25 (b) (2) motion or for resentencing by another judge. Woodward appeals from the judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the indictment and his denial of her motion for a required finding of not guilty. She also raises a number of other claimed trial errors, but waives them if we should uphold the judge\u2019s reduction of the verdict from murder to involuntary manslaughter, and the sentence he imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>I. The Commonwealth\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge abused his discretion in reducing the jury\u2019s verdict from murder to a manslaughter conviction. It points out that he should not have declined the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a manslaughter instruction. It argues that these errors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in combination, impaired the integrity of the justice system and require that, pursuant to our extraordinary power of superintendence over the lower courts, we vacate the judge\u2019s postverdict order and restore the jury\u2019s verdict of murder in the second degree and the resulting mandated life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">1. <em>The jury instructions. </em>The Commonwealth presented evidence that the cause of Matthew\u2019s death was severe head trauma inflicted on February 4, 1997, while he was in the sole custody of Woodward.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought jury instructions on murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> murder in the second degree, and on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Woodward objected to the last request, and asked that the jury be limited to considering the offense of murder. The judge acceded to her request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This was error. We have stated repeatedly that, \u201c[wjhen the evidence permits a finding of a lesser included offense, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>judge must, upon request, instruct the jury on the possibility of conviction of the lesser crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>413 Mass. 707, 715 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 871 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>379 Mass. 557, 562 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 392 (1967). We have never limited this rule to requests made by the defendant, nor have we ever held that the Commonwealth is not entitled, evidence permitting, to such an instruction on request.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This issue has arisen on appeal most often in cases in which the defendant requested an instruction on a lesser included offense. In the only case of which we are aware concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a lesser included instruction, which presented the converse of the question here, we affirmed a judge\u2019s allowance of the request over the defendant\u2019s objection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>418 Mass. 130, 132-133 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 958, 962 (1994) (defendant does not have absolute right to make tactical decisions that determine which theories of criminal liability are submitted to jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 660 (1989) (test to determine if instruction on lesser included offense required does not depend on whether defendant or Commonwealth objects, but rather whether evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>such instruction). Here, a disputed element \u2014 malice \u2014 distinguishes murder, the greater offense, from manslaughter, the lesser offense, and an instruction should have been given. Consideration of lower court denials of prosecutors\u2019 requests for instructions on lesser included offenses would not reach us except in the unlikely procedural circumstances of this case, because the Commonwealth has no reason to appeal from a conviction, and is barred by double jeopardy principles from appealing from an acquittal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529, 532 (1981). Authorities elsewhere hold overwhelmingly that the prosecution has a right to jury instructions on lesser included offenses, on request, if the evidence so warrants, in spite of a defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As far as we are aware, no jurisdiction that has considered the issue has allowed a defendant to veto a lesser included offense instruction properly requested by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Our conclusion that the Commonwealth was entitled to a manslaughter instruction is fortified by the policy favoring instructing juries on lesser included offenses. The doctrine serves the public purpose of allowing the jury to convict of the offense established by the evidence, rather than forcing them to choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>between convicting the defendant of an offense not fully established by the evidence or acquitting, even though the defendant is guilty of some offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>426 Mass. 301, 305 (1997).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, it was peculiarly inappropriate for the judge to refuse to charge the jury on manslaughter when, as revealed by his subsequent order reducing the jury\u2019s verdict, in his view the evidence was not consonant with a conviction of murder. The jury, in reaching their verdict, surely must have concluded that the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the element of causation \u2014 that Woodward\u2019s acts caused Matthew\u2019s fatal injury. By refusing to accede to the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a manslaughter instruction, the judge impermissibly prevented the jury from considering a lesser degree of culpability for Woodward.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judge\u2019s error, however, did not prejudice the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Woodward in the final analysis. The Commonwealth concedes that the jury\u2019s verdict rendered the error harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 958, 962 (1994) (no prejudice where jury instructed, over defendant\u2019s objection, on involuntary manslaughter and defendant convicted of murder in the second degree). If the judge had honored the Commonwealth\u2019s request and the jury had received the manslaughter instruction but had declined to choose that option, the judge could still have reduced the jury\u2019s murder verdict under rule 25 (b) (2). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 552 (1981). Alternatively, had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>jury been given such a choice and returned a manslaughter verdict, the trial\u2019s outcome would have yielded the same conviction of Woodward as the judge\u2019s postverdict order.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">2. <em>Rule 25 (b) (2) reduction in verdict. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 11, provides in part that \u201cthe judge may on a renewed motion for a directed verdict of not guilty pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure set aside the verdict and order a new trial, or order the entry of a finding of guilty of any offense included in the offense charged in the indictment or complaint.\u201d Rule 25 (b) (2) incorporates this statutory authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The authority of the trial judge under rule 25 (b) (2) to reduce the verdict or grant a new trial in criminal cases is much like our authority to review so-called capital cases \u2014 convictions of murder in the first degree \u2014 under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 513 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 553 &amp; n.7 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The postconviction powers granted by the Legislature to the courts at both trial and appellate levels reflect the evolution of legislative policy promoting judicial responsibility to ensure that the result in every criminal case is consonant with justice. See <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 553-554 &amp; n.7; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>376 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 109 (1963).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is clear that the responsibility may be exercised by the trial judge, even if the evidence warrants the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201c[A] new trial or verdict reduction may be proper even when the evidence can legally support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, supra </em>at 512. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ghee, </em>414 Mass. 313, 321 (1993) (reduction in verdict not based on absence of evidence warranting jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>finding of deliberate premeditation but because more consonant with justice); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 319-321 (1982) (jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of murder warranted by evidence, but reduction to manslaughter upheld because more consonant with justice). The judge\u2019s option to reduce a verdict offers a means to rectify a disproportionate verdict, among other reasons, short of granting a new trial. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 556. The judge\u2019s power under rule 25 (b) (2), like our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, may be used to ameliorate injustice caused by the Commonwealth, defense counsel, the jury, the judge\u2019s own error, or, as may have occurred in this case, the interaction of several causes. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 188-189 (1987) (judge\u2019s failure to instruct on intoxication because defendant did not so request and such instruction was inconsistent with defense strategy was nonetheless, in light of evidence on intoxication, appropriate justification for judge to reduce verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Because such broad postconviction authority is vested in the trial judge, we have counseled that a judge should use this power sparingly, <em>Keough, supra </em>at 321, and trial judges have in fact used their rule 25 (b) (2) power infrequently. Since 1979, the Commonwealth has appealed verdict reductions in only ten cases, of which seven were affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We see no evidence of any generalized abuse of the power vested in trial judges since the rule\u2019s adoption. Nor do we see any other reason to modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>case law that we have developed since 1979 following legislative authorization of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In convictions of murder in the first degree, we are authorized to review a whole case, including the evidence. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. In a noncapital case such as this, we do not conduct an independent analysis when a trial judge reduces a verdict to a lesser offense. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 557.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our review of a trial judge\u2019s exercise of his authority under rule 25 (b) (2) is more constrained: \u201cIn assessing a trial judge\u2019s decision to reduce a verdict under [that rule], \u2018we consider only whether the judge abused his discretion or committed an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, supra </em>at 188, quoting <em>Gaulden, supra. </em>\u201cWe defer to the trial judge because he has the advantage of face to face evaluation of the witnesses and the evidence at trial. He is in a far better position than we are to make the judgment required by the rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>399 Mass. 191, 192 (1987), citing <em>Gaulden, supra. </em>We. have made it clear that under rule 25 (b) (2), a judge may review all the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s version of the facts, in deciding whether the verdict comports with justice, even when the evidence warranted the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Ghee, supra </em>at 321-322; <em>Keough, supra </em>at 319. Indeed, \u201cthe judge is not foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>from considering the defendant\u2019s testimony . . . and, if he believes it, relying on it.\u201d <em>Keough, supra </em>at 321. The Commonwealth\u2019s complaint in this case, that the judge \u201csubstituted\u201d his view of the evidence for that of the jury, is no reason to overrule his decision to reduce the verdict. See <em>Ghee, supra </em>at 321 (Commonwealth\u2019s argument that judge erred in reducing verdict where there was evidence supporting verdict of murder in first degree characterized as \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cmiss[ing] the point\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We do expect a judge to state the reasons for a reduction in verdict. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 556. In this case, the judge has done so. After \u201c[vjiewing the evidence broadly,\u201d in accordance with his accurate understanding of rule 25 (b) (2) powers, the judge gave as his first reason for the reduction that \u201cthe circumstances in which [Woodward] acted were characterized by confusion, inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some anger, but not malice (in the legal sense) supporting a conviction for second degree murder.\u201d See <em>Keough, supra </em>at 320 (affirming judge\u2019s reduction to manslaughter where judge found \u201cthat the circumstances in which the defendant acted were characterized by fear, confusion, and anger, and that the necessary element of malice for second degree murder was absent\u201d). We detect no error of law with regard to malice in this conclusion. A fine line distinguishes murder based on the third prong of malice from the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe difference between the elements of the third prong of malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and . . . involuntary manslaughter lies in the degree of risk of physical harm that a reasonable person would recognize was created by particular conduct, based on what the defendant knew. The risk for the purposes of the third prong of malice is that there was a plain and strong likelihood of death. . . . The risk that will satisfy the standard for . . . involuntary manslaughter \u2018involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 303-304 n.14 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Although evidence of a single blow to a child of tender years may be sufficient to support a jury finding of malice, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 426 (1981), such an inference is not <em>necessarily </em>required by evidence even of repeated blows to a young child. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, ante </em>392, 397-398 (1998). In all the reported murder and manslaughter convictions in Massachusetts involving the battery of young children there was compelling evidence of multiple injuries from repeated instances of caretaker abuse, not death caused by a single fatal blow. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 720-721, 723-726 (1991) (manslaughter conviction reversed on erroneous admission of \u201cprofile\u201d testimony); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>395 Mass. 568, 573-575 (1985) (murder in the first degree affirmed).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commonwealth did not claim that Woodward had ever abused or injured Matthew prior to the fatal injury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Where there was no evidence in this case of repeated caretaker abuse, the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the jury verdict of murder was not proportionate with convictions in other cases, including those cases resulting in convictions of manslaughter rather than murder. See <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 556 (whether jury verdict is \u201cmarkedly inconsistent\u201d with verdicts returned in similar cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>is appropriate consideration in deciding rule 25 [b] [2] motion).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">This jury, of course, were given no option to find a lesser degree of culpability than malice sufficient to support murder. \u201c[W]e have applied \u00a7 33E to reduce verdicts (or order new trials) when judges have omitted to charge on critical themes that might have affected juries and brought about different verdicts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. King, 374 Mass. 501, 508 (1978). This judge did not charge on an issue that might have brought a different verdict. To correct his own error, he could conclude that a verdict of manslaughter was more \u201cconsonant with justice\u201d than letting the murder verdict stand. <em>Keough, supra </em>at 320, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>375 Mass. 409, 416 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The judge suggested an alternative basis for reaching a manslaughter conviction, one that credited Woodward\u2019s experts, in part, on the causation of Matthew\u2019s injury. Under this view of reconciling the conflicting evidence on causation, Matthew had a preexisting skull fracture and blood clot, and Woodward handled Matthew \u201croughly,\u201d which caused the clot to \u201cre-bleed,\u201d leading to his death. Weighing the evidence in such a way would permit the jury, had they been given the option, to find that Woodward committed a battery, fatal because of Matthew\u2019s condition at the time, but not because of a severe blow by Woodward, and thus without malice sufficient for murder. We need not concur with this or any other view of the evidence on causation in order to defer to the judge\u2019s discretion so to weigh the evidence and reach his decision that the evidence as a whole \u201ccomported more closely\u201d with manslaughter than with murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Keough, supra </em>at 320, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>375 Mass. 409, 416 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Finally, we comment on the Commonwealth\u2019s criticism of the judge for overstepping his role. This criticism depends on, but goes beyond, the Commonwealth\u2019s more specific objections to the judge\u2019s refusal of the manslaughter instruction and his verdict reduction. Those actions, in combination, appear to the prosecution to have manipulated the trial\u2019s outcome and marginalized the jury, all to Woodward\u2019s benefit. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument is not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Jurors bring the unique perspective of laypersons, representing the wider community\u2019s judgment of a defendant\u2019s degree of culpability, if any, for her actions. \u201cThe importance that our system attaches to trial by jury derives from the special confidence we repose in a \u2018body of one\u2019s peers to determine guilt or innocence as a safeguard against arbitrary law enforcement.\u2019 <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 87 (1970). It is this safeguarding function, preferring the commonsense judgment of a jury as a bulwark \u2018against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge,\u2019 that lies at the core of our dedication to the principles of jury determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 373-374 (1972), quoting <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 156 (1968). The integrity of the process by which we determine guilt may be jeopardized if the special confidence that the public bestows on a jury\u2019s verdict is undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We do not penalize the defendant for the error by the judge in this trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 188 (1987). We uphold this judge\u2019s reduction in verdict because, from our reading of the transcript and our review of all other reported murder and manslaughter convictions involving the battery of young children, we conclude that the judge acted within his discretion in determining that a conviction of manslaughter was more consonant with justice than a conviction of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>II. The Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Woodward argues eight issues, only two of which need concern us: if we affirm the judge\u2019s verdict reduction and sentence, she waives all claims that seek a new trial, the appropriate relief were we to agree with Woodward on any of her other six claims of error.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We address and reject her claims seeking dismissal of the indictment or a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">1. <em>The loss or suppression of evidence. </em>Woodward requests the \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d of dismissing the indictment, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 314 (1984), due to the claimed failure of the Commonwealth to provide her access to potentially exculpatory evidence, and due to the loss of potentially exculpatory tissue obtained during the autopsy by the medical examiner. Woodward\u2019s defense relied substantially on a theory that Matthew suffered from a previous head injury, incurred some weeks prior to his death, that began to bleed again on the fateful day of his hospitalization.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The unavailable physical evidence that may have proved useful to this theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>includes a clot of blood (fatal subdural hematoma)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>; the skull fracture<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>; two sections of dura<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>; and subgaleal (scalp) tissue.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Our cases concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose or preserve exculpatory evidence have not considered the special circumstances attendant on a defendant\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>access to, and the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility for preserving, physical evidence from a homicide victim\u2019s body. We review briefly the circumstances of Woodward\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Dr. Gerald Feigin conducted an autopsy on February 10, 1997. The body was sent to Worcester for further radiological testing on February 11, and was released to Matthew\u2019s family on February 13. On February 11, Woodward filed a motion in the Newton Division of the District Court Department for an \u201cindependent,\u201d second autopsy by her medical experts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That motion was denied. A second, contemporaneous motion that \u201call evidence in the possession, custody, or control of the Commonwealth concerning this case be preserved and that no further scientific testing be performed without first notifying [the defendant]\u201d was allowed in part by the judge; he ordered the Commonwealth to preserve all evidence acquired by the medical examiner, but declined to prohibit further testing without notice to Woodward.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Woodward challenges the motion denying a second autopsy. She also contends that the Commonwealth suppressed exculpatory evidence when the Commonwealth did not disclose to her the existence of a fracture in Matthew\u2019s skull in a sufficiently timely way to enable Woodward\u2019s expert to investigate the age of the fracture. We first address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 4, authorizes the medical examiner to take jurisdiction of a body and perform an autopsy when he is of the opinion that a death was \u201cdue to violence.\u201d After investigation or examination by the medical examiner\u2019s office, \u201cthe body shall be released to the person with the proper legal authority to receive it, including the surviving spouse, the next of kin, or any friend of the deceased, who shall have priority in the order named.\u201d G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 13. While we do not interpret this statute to prohibit in all circumstances a request such as the defendant\u2019s, the statute\u2019s silence on this issue certainly does not support any statutorily based right of a defendant to have access to a victim\u2019s body for an independent autopsy. Rather, the statute\u2019s explicit acknowledgment of a legal right of others to the body after the medical examiner completes his duties indicates that whatever due process right a defendant may claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>must be balanced against statutory, as well as common-law and constitutional, rights to the body of a victim\u2019s immediate family.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Another consideration also constrains a defendant\u2019s unlimited access for purposes of a second autopsy. Autopsy procedures are inherently destructive, making second autopsies to some extent impracticable. The medical examiner, statutorily independent of law enforcement agencies, is charged with the responsibility of developing objective information as to a cause of death, and must, on request, provide a defendant charged in a death with a copy of the autopsy report. G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 7. We conclude that given these considerations, a defendant should show cause and specific need in a motion for access to a victim\u2019s body. Here, the defendant\u2019s written motion on its face did not articulate a specific need for the second autopsy. At the hearing, on questioning from the judge, Woodward did not claim that there was anything wrong with the autopsy performed by the medical examiner.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> She did argue that a second autopsy was needed to give her adequate time to prepare her defense and allow an expert to prepare testimony.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Offsetting these concerns, the judge appropriately acknowledged the interests of Matthew\u2019s family. Unlike most physical evidence, neither the courts nor the parties, without substantial reasons, may hold a homicide victim\u2019s body for a prolonged period of time. Given the lack of specificity in Woodward\u2019s articulated need for the second autopsy, it was not error for the judge to deny Woodward\u2019s autopsy request.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Woodward also contends that the Commonwealth should</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>have disclosed to her the existence of a skull fracture before Matthew\u2019s body was released for burial. Woodward\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing on missing tissue is silent on the skull fracture and she did not press at oral argument for relief on her contention that release of the skull for burial after completion of the autopsy constituted prejudicial loss or destruction of evidence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Unlike her claim on the lost dura tissue, she did not seek preclusion of Commonwealth testimony on the skull fracture, much less the drastic remedy of exhumation that she now proposes to us. Woodward has not established her claim of prosecutorial misconduct in the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to inform her of the skull fracture until her murder arraignment hearing on February 13, 1997. There is nothing that we can detect to suggest that the Commonwealth had considered what forensic pathology evidence was critical for either the prosecution or the defense before the arraignment. In any event, we need not resolve this issue where it was not \u201cfairly raised\u201d below. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>409 Mass. 675, 678-679 (1991), and cases cited. These same considerations apply to her claims concerning the failure of Dr. Feigin to preserve any of the tissu\u00e9 evidencing hemorrhage in the scalp close to the fracture site: they were not \u201cfairly raised\u201d below.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Woodward also claims relief from the loss of potentially exculpatory evidence obtained during the autopsy. We focus on the \u201cmissing\u201d sections of dura.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> When Dr. Jan Leestma, an expert for Woodward, examined the dura, he discovered that sections of the dura were missing. The judge held a pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>hearing on this issue.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Dr. DeGirolami, the Commonwealth\u2019s neuropathologist, testified that he had not been informed by the medical examiner\u2019s office or anyone else of the physical evidence preservation order. Following this hearing, the judge made a finding that the tissue had been lost, but that the loss was not an act committed in bad faith in an attempt to suppress evidence. He ruled that the loss did not justify dismissal of the case because it was not \u201cso critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 Mass. 309, 311 (1991), quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Young-blood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 61 (Stevens, J, concurring). We find no error in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to preserve exculpatory evidence \u201cgrows out of [its] duty to disclose \u2018evidence favorable to an accused upon request . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sasville, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 19 (1993), quoting <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1984). A defendant is entitled to relief \u201cfor the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to preserve [evidence] if [she] establishes a \u2018reasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than a fertile imagination,\u2019 that access to the [evidence] would have produced evidence favorable to [her] cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>392 Mass. 1, 12 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Michener, </em>25 Or. App. 523, 532 (1976). We have no doubt that Woodward met the threshold showing that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the missing evidence would be favorable to her.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201c[W]hen potentially exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed, a balancing test is employed to determine the appropriateness and extent of remedial action. The courts must weigh the culpability of the Commonwealth, the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant. . . . Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>test does not require the Commonwealth to prove good faith or earnest efforts to preserve the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 755 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>416 Mass. 707 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willie, </em>400 Mass. 427, 432 (1987). On the first prong of this test, evaluation of the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability for loss of potentially exculpatory evidence, had Dr. DeGirolami been made aware of the judicial order on evidence preservation, he could have ensured conscientious compliance to the extent feasible, in one way or another. Dr. DeGirolami is not at fault for any loss. But the failure to communicate to Dr. DeGirolami the importance of preserving tissue obtained from the body, in light of the very specific court order,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> is a failure of duty amounting to negligence by the medical examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We recognize that the prosecutor\u2019s responsibility for the negligence of the medical examiner\u2019s office is more attenuated than its responsibility for loss or suppression of evidence by law enforcement personnel.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to disclose information is limited to that in the possession of the prosecutor or police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>396 Mass. 590, 596 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 675 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>388 Mass. 483 (1983). But \u201c[t]he prosecuting attorney\u2019s obligations . . . extend to material and information in the possession or control of members of his staff and of any others who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and who either regularly report or with reference to the particular case have reported to his office.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 261-262 n.8 (1980), quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial 2.1(d) (Approved Draft 1970). The medical examiner is such a person. The Legislature contemplated coordination of efforts between the medical examiner and the district attorney in investigation of deaths where criminal violence appears to have taken place. See G. L. c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 5. Particularly in light of the court order, the medical examiner, a Commonwealth agent, was accountable for preserving the dura tissue samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>On the second prong of the test -\u2014 materiality of the lost evidence \u2014 we conclude that the missing right side section of dura was material to Woodward\u2019s theory of the cause of Matthew\u2019s death. As for the third prong of the test \u2014 the prejudice to the defendant from the loss of evidence \u2014 we are not persuaded that the degree of prejudice is so great as to warrant dismissal of the indictment. The jury heard an abundance of evidentiary detail on, and medical opinion endorsing, Woodward\u2019s theory from Dr. Leestma, based on his examination of sections of dura covering areas other than that over the fatal hematoma. The jury also heard from Woodward\u2019s other expert medical witnesses, relying on a significant amount of other medical and autopsy data, who gave opinions endorsing Woodward\u2019s theory of the cause of death. The lost right side section of dura was an important piece of potentially exculpatory evidence, but may well have been cumulative of other forensic evidence marshaled by Woodward\u2019s experts. The loss of evidence in this case was not so overwhelmingly prejudicial as in other cases in which lost evidence was uniquely critical. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, supra </em>at 311 (police officer\u2019s writing of victim\u2019s description of assailant lost); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, supra </em>at 752-753 (numerous items lost from crime scene, victim\u2019s autopsy, and victim\u2019s vehicle); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gliniewicz, </em>398 Mass. 744, 748 (1986) (pieces of boots, showing minute traces of blood linking defendant to murder, destroyed during serological testing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sasville, supra </em>at 18, 29 (fetal tissue from rape complainant\u2019s abortion, available for genetic marker testing as evidence of identity of rapist, destroyed at Commonwealth\u2019s direction). Of these cases, we affirmed dismissal of an indictment in <em>Henderson, supra </em>at 310. The Appeals Court in <em>Sasville, </em>ruling that the culpability of the Commonwealth \u201camounted to a rare case of gross negligence and, in fact, comes perilously close to supporting an inference of bad faith,\u201d reversed the judgment below and ordered the indictment dismissed. <em>Sasville, supra </em>at 24, 29. In <em>Olszewski, supra </em>at 750, and in <em>Gliniewicz, supra </em>at 745, we did not order dismissal of the indictments, but remanded for new trials. Neither the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability nor the prejudice to the defendant is as great here as in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We agree with the judge that the loss of the dura evidence did not justify dismissal of the indictment against Woodward. \u201cAbsent egregious misconduct or at least a serious threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>prejudice, the remedy of dismissal infringes too severely on the public interest in bringing guilty persons to justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). In light of Woodward\u2019s request that we not remand for retrial, we need not reach the question whether the judge\u2019s failure to exclude testimony presented by the Commonwealth relevant to the missing dura tissue would be ground for reversing the manslaughter conviction and remanding for retrial. For similar reasons we conclude that the medical examiner\u2019s negligence in failing to produce in a timely way the two closer, more sharply focused photographs of the skull fracture and the prejudice from their belated availability to Woodward were not so great as to justify dismissing the indictment. In response to the admittedly belated delivery of the photographs to Woodward, she requested only that she be allowed to recall two of her experts, relief that the judge granted in part.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Her expert testified that the photographs provided important confirming evidence that the skull fracture was weeks old. In his ruling on Woodward\u2019s posttrial motion, the judge noted that this testimony was \u201cthe last word on the photographs and the conclusions to be drawn from them,\u201d and correctly determined that Woodward had not been prejudiced by the late disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">2. <em>Conclusiveness of scientific evidence on healing. </em>Woodward also asks that we reverse her conviction and remand for a required finding of not guilty. We consider this request in two ways: as a request for review of the judge\u2019s denial of her motion for a required finding of not guilty and, as Woodward urged in oral argument, a claim that her expert\u2019s testimony at trial \u2014 evidence of healing processes<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u2014 unrebutted by the Commonwealth, conclusively establishes that Matthew\u2019s fatal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>injury occurred weeks before the day of his hospitalization and precludes a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Our standard of review on motions for a required finding of not guilty is, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \u201cwhether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cordle, 412 Mass. 172, 175 (1992). As the judge pointed out, to reach a guilty verdict the jury had to conclude that the Commonwealth had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and, considering Woodward\u2019s defense, \u201cspumed as not worthy of belief, professional opinions emanating from a corps of highly-qualified, authoritative experts, [but] such dismissal is unquestionably within the jury\u2019s province.\u201d The Commonwealth presented its own qualified experts, including many of the treating physicians, who concluded that Matthew\u2019s fatal injury was caused on the day of his hospitalization. The Commonwealth also effectively cross-examined Woodward\u2019s medical experts. Viewing this evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the judge did not err in denying Woodward\u2019s motion. See <em>Cordle, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-679 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 129 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Woodward also presses us to take judicial notice of the validity of and conclusive proof inferred from Dr. Leestma\u2019s \u201ccrucial finding of periosteum dislodged from the fracture in the dura.\u201d This finding \u201calone,\u201d she argues, \u201cproved\u201d that the skull fracture was weeks old.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Woodward did not ask the judge to take judicial notice of this \u201cconclusive\u201d scientific evidence. She did, however, argue that the judge consider this issue as grounds for her postverdict motion for a required finding of not guilty. Because the claim for judicial notice was not seasonably raised below, we need not reach it here. We decline, in any event, either on review of the judge\u2019s denial of a required finding of not guilty, or based on taking judicial notice ourselves of scientific evidence of the age of Matthew\u2019s head injury,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> to set aside Woodward\u2019s conviction. She cites us no other similar case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in which a lower court judge, much less an appellate court, has so credited such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">III. The Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Because we decline to grant the principal relief requested by the Commonwealth \u25a0\u2014 reinstatement of the jury verdict \u2014 we consider the Commonwealth\u2019s request that we set aside the sentence imposed, and resentence Woodward ourselves or remand the case to the Superior Court for resentencing by another judge. The Commonwealth seeks to avail itself of these remedies under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, our general superintendence power. The relief requested has no precedent. It is settled law that the task of imposing the sentence on a defendant convicted of a crime rests with a judge in the trial court. It is not our role to enter an order modifying or adjusting a sentence. If a sentence is unlawful, we set aside the imposed sentence and remand the case to the trial judge for appropriate resentencing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>390 Mass. 797, 804 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 81-82 (1974). The Commonwealth, in its request for one form of alternative relief \u2014 that we take it upon ourselves to resentence Woodward \u2014 provides no reason why we should depart from this well-settled principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">As a second form of alternative relief, the Commonwealth asks that we remand the case for resentencing of Woodward by another judge in the Superior Court. That relief is also not available to the Commonwealth for multiple reasons that the dissent ignores. To begin with, our review of criminal sentences is limited. \u201cWe recognize that it is not within the power of this court to review an otherwise lawful sentence. This authority is delegated to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 81 (lawful sentence is one \u201cwhich is within the limits of the applicable statutory provisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Our review of a defendant\u2019s sentence at the request of the Commonwealth is exceedingly rare.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We have allowed such appeals and remanded for resentencing <em>only </em>in the procedural circumstances when a judge has granted a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing motion, pursuant to Mass. R. Crina. R 29, 378 Mass. 899 (1979), to revise or revoke a sentence originally imposed, and the Commonwealth has sought reimposition of the original sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>424 Mass. 377, 379-380 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>422 Mass. 546, 547 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>415 Mass. 112, 115 (1993).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We have found statutory authority for Commonwealth appeals in that Une of cases by broadening our construction of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E (appeals by Commonwealth). <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 113-115. That statute, section 28E, until amended by St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 45, and construed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529, 534 (1981) (upholding Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal from a postverdict finding of not guilty pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 [b] [1], 378 Mass. 896 [1979]), and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 550 (1981) (upholding Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal from verdict reduction pursuant to rule 25 [b] [2]), had been interpreted to authorize the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals only from pretrial motions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>375 Mass. 409, 413 (1978). In <em>Therrien, supra </em>at 535, we sounded a note of caution that double jeopardy principles require that the allowance of certain post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>trial defense motions \u201cmust be treated as terminating the criminal prosecution without any right to appeal.\u201d General Laws c. 278,-\u00a7 28E, of course, provides no basis on which the Commonwealth can appeal from a sentence that has not been revised or revoked at the request of a defendant, and there is no rule of criminal procedure that permits the Commonwealth to take such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We may not vacate a sentence such as we have here, that was within statutory limits, because it appears too lenient or too harsh.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We do not vacate a sentence unless we have been able to identify clear legal error in the sentence, and certainly not because of a \u201csense of unease that permeated the proceedings.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 691. When asked to remand cases to increase defendants\u2019 sentences, our jurisprudence confines us to cases of clear and identifiable error in the sentence itself, for the most substantial reason \u2014 our fundamental common-law traditions and constitutional principles of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Under the common law, as recognized by our cases for more than one century, a trial judge, and a trial judge only, could increase a defendant\u2019s sentence if, and only if, \u201cno action had been taken under the original sentences, such as delivering [the defendants] to the house of correction to commence their terms,\u201d in other words, \u201cso long as it remained unexecuted . . . .\u201d <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>342 Mass. 119, 121, 123 (1961) (clarifying common-law rule to allow <em>reduction </em>of a defendant\u2019s sentence after execution), relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>2 Allen 144, 147 (1861).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> A common-law rule is not absolute, and this rule has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>qualified by statutory developments.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529, 532 (1981); <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 255-256 (1942). It nonetheless has been important in constitutional interpretation of double jeopardy principles.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In Federal criminal cases, constitutional double jeopardy principles limit the prosecution\u2019s right to appeal sentences to those cases explicitly authorized by statute; such statutes limit the scope of and narrowly focus such prosecution appeals. <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 136 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, 437 </em>U.S. 82, 84-85 (1978). States risk offending the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, see <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 795-796 (1969), if State appellate courts, absent explicit and properly limited statutory authority, review otherwise lawful sentences appealed by prosecutors. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Goldhammer, </em>474 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>U.S. 28, 30-31 (1985); <em>DiFrancesco, supra </em>at 138-139. \u201cIt is clear from <em>DiFrancesco </em>and <em>Goldhammer </em>that when a sentence is increased in a second proceeding \u2018the application of the double jeopardy clause . . . turns on the extent and legitimacy of a defendant\u2019s expectation of finality in that sentence. If a defendant has a legitimate expectation of finality, then an increase in that sentence is prohibited ....\u2019\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 394 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fogel, </em>829 F.2d 77, 87 (D.C. Cir. 1987). <em>DiFrancesco, supra, </em>makes clear that the \u201cextent\u201d of a defendant\u2019s expectation of finality is limited only when a statute specifically authorizes prosecution appeals of sentences. Our authority under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, contains no explicit statutory authority to review sentences at the request of the Commonwealth, and no other statute otherwise authorizes review in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The \u201clegitimacy\u201d of a defendant\u2019s expectation of finality in a sentence is, of course, undercut when a sentence is unlawful. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s characterization, the Commonwealth makes no claim that the sentence imposed on Woodward is unlawful. The Commonwealth concedes that the sentence imposed falls within the broad range of punishment established by statute for a manslaughter conviction. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13. Pressed several times at oral argument, the Commonwealth refused, perhaps out of respect for our jurisprudence on sentencing, to argue for consideration of the lawfulness of the sentence on any ground independent from its claim of error on the judge\u2019s postverdict reduction of Woodward\u2019s crime to manslaughter. In the procedural posture of this appeal, the only legitimate way to arrive at an increase in Woodward\u2019s sentence is to conclude that error prejudicially infected the judge\u2019s decision to reduce the verdict, reinstate the original conviction of murder in the second degree, and remand the case to the Superior Court for imposition of the statutorily mandated sentence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But, the dissent finds no error in the judge\u2019s postverdict reduction of Woodward\u2019s crime to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The dissent suggests that the sentence should be reconsidered because it is \u201ctainted by legal error.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 694. Remanding on such a basis to increase a sentence would mark a dramatic departure from our case law and the constitutional principles relevant to increasing sentences on the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. We have never vacated a sentence for the procedural \u201ctaints\u201d identified by the dissent: an expedited sentencing hearing and the possible resulting unavailability of the victim\u2019s family to provide a <em>second </em>set of victim impact statements, time constraints on yet further prosecution argument, or the failure of the record to reflect factors and sentencing goals considered by the judge in deciding Woodward\u2019s sentence. Sentencing proceedings not infrequently have some or all of these features, as the dissent recognizes. <em>Post </em>at 692 n.2. Here, the Commonwealth acceded to the hearing as scheduled, as the dissent also recognizes, did not ask for a continuance for its own sake or in order for Matthew\u2019s family to be in attendance,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and articulated sufficient reasons for the sentence that it recommended. The Commonwealth\u2019s time to prepare for argument on sentencing was not limited to the hours between the morning release of the judge\u2019s order reducing the verdict and the sentencing hearing scheduled for that afternoon. It had ample opportunity to prepare during the six-day interim between the hearing on the posttrial motion and the release of the judge\u2019s order, when the only remaining matter to be addressed was resentencing, in the event that the Commonwealth lost on Woodward\u2019s posttrial motion. Nor can one conclude from the expedited sentencing hearing that the judge had failed to deliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ate fully his sentencing decision in light of the abundant information available to him concerning the defendant and the victim\u2019s family before and during the course of this most amply explored case. We also do not draw any adverse conclusion from the sparseness of the record of the sentencing decision: we do not require a judge to give reasons for a sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banker, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 979 (1986). None of the alleged flaws in the sentencing proceeding vitiates the sentence singly. Only by the addition of something ineffable to the sum of these alleged flaws does the dissent suggest impropriety of the sentence, but that ineffable something is not identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The dissent also intimates that, because Woodward asked that the jury not receive a manslaughter instruction, the sentence for manslaughter imposed by the judge is inappropriate. We do not limit, a judge\u2019s postverdict discretion to correct injustice because it may have been brought about due to a defendant\u2019s trial strategy, unsuccessful in hindsight. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, 399 </em>Mass. 171, 188-189 (1987) (failure of defendant to request intoxication instruction because it was inconsistent with trial strategy did not preclude verdict reduction, in light of evidence of intoxication); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 82 (1974) (failure of defendant to except to judge\u2019s charge to jury does not preclude court from vacating sentence imposed for crime not committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Finally, we have criticized the judge for his error in acceding to Woodward\u2019s request not to give a manslaughter instruction. His ruling did have a basis in our cases, for we have declined to penalize defendants who adopt an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d strategy.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> His ruling does not suggest, nor does the dissent imply, that the judge committed a legal error purposefully to favor Woodward. There is no complaint about his day-to-day handling of this lengthy and complex trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s only argument that conceivably could be interpreted as grounds for revisiting Woodward\u2019s sentence is that, in reducing Woodward\u2019s verdict and sentence, the judge must have found that Woodward had committed \u201cno crime,\u201d and that the judge \u201cconverted\u201d her conviction of murder to an \u201cacquittal.\u201d That interpretation of the judge\u2019s actions is not convincing. We have noted that the judge on a rule 25 (b) (2)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>motion need not draw the same conclusions from the evidence as did the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 319-320 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 555 (1981). But this judge, in reducing this jury\u2019s verdict to manslaughter, must have accepted the jury\u2019s finding that Woodward\u2019s actions caused Matthew Happen\u2019s death; he had the option to, but did not, order the entry of a finding of not guilty. Mass. R. Crim. R 25 (b)' (2). Having had the opportunity to view all the witnesses face-to-face, including Woodward who testified, he concluded that Woodward was guilty of a most serious crime \u2014 for manslaughter is such a crime. We do not view the judgment against Woodward as a light matter. She stands guilty of causing an infant\u2019s violent death. The outcome of this criminal trial most assuredly was not an \u201cacquittal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The dissent claims that this case is exceptional. It is not. Judges do reduce jury verdicts to some lesser degree of crime. The law permits them to do so. Judges regularly sentence defendants to time served. The law permits them to do it. What would be exceptional is the disposition urged by the dissent. Whatever the scope of our powers, it does not allow us to act on the basis of impressions and characterizations that have no correlate in acknowledged rules or doctrines. It is the essence of the rule of law that exceptions that burden defendants not be made unless justified by some rule or principle that we would be willing to follow in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Because the sentence imposed by the judge is lawful, we decline to remand the case for consideration of an increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence. The conviction of manslaughter, together with the sentence imposed, shall stand. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, relief and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition are remanded to the county court for entry of an order denying the relief sought by each. The actions of the Superior Court judge in reducing the conviction of the defendant and sentencing her to the time deemed served are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-14\">On October 27, 1997, before the case was sent to the jury, the Commonwealth challenged pursuant to G.

In the alternative, the Commonwealth sought to vacate the posttrial order and sentence, and a new ruling on Woodward\u2019s motion to reduce the jury verdict or an order remanding Woodward\u2019s motion to reduce the jury verdict to the Superior Court for a hearing and determination by another judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Commonwealth may not now, postconviction, challenge the judge\u2019s jury instructions.

The Commonwealth did not appeal from the single justice\u2019s order denying relief. See S.J.C. Rule 2:21, 421 Mass. 1303 (1995). We therefore address here the Commonwealth\u2019s claimed error in the jury instructions only on the grounds of the Commonwealth\u2019s over-all argument that the judge abused his discretion in refusing an instruction on manslaughter and then reducing Woodward\u2019s conviction to manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The Commonwealth presented evidence, contested by Woodward, that the head injury resulted from a contemporaneous combination of violent shaking of the child\u2019s body and a forceful slamming of his head against a fixed, hard object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> \u201cMurder committed with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought, or with extreme atrocity or cruelty, or in the commission or attempted commission of a crime punishable with death or imprisonment for life [felony-murder] is murder in the first degree.

If a lesser included offense is not supported by the evidence, the judge should refuse to give such an instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 660 (1989). A judge may also enter a finding of not guilty, if the Commonwealth has presented insufficient evidence to support the offense charged in the indictment. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). Because the judge has the power to control what charges go to the jury, the risk to a defendant of a \u201ccompromise\u201d verdict is minimized and any potential abuse from prosecutors \u201covercharging\u201d defendants is checked. Here, the judge considered whether the Commonwealth inappropriately prosecuted the case on a theory of murder in the first degree, and concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence in this case sufficed, however thinly, to support an indictment alleging extreme cruelty [or] atrocity,\u201d and that the medical evidence permitted \u201cthe prosecution consistently [to] urge[] first-degree murder\u201d at trial.

X-ray images of the skull fracture were taken before, but not after, Matthew\u2019s death. One of Woodward\u2019s medical experts, Dr. Michael Baden, testified that X-rays of the fracture taken after death would have revealed any healing processes evidencing the age of injury more clearly than X-rays taken before Matthew\u2019s death. In addition, photographs were taken of the skull fracture. Although some of these photographs were available to Woodward during discovery, the medical examiner\u2019s office produced eighteen additional photographs late in the trial on Friday, October 24, 1997, shortly before the final day of testimony on Monday, October 27, 1997. Two of these photographs were sharply focused close-ups of the fracture and showed its edges more clearly than other previously produced evidence. The judge allowed Dr. Baden, one of two available expert witnesses for Woodward, to return and testify concerning these photographs.

Dr. Baden, Woodward\u2019s expert, concluded from preoperative and postoperative CAT scans that the hemorrhage was an artifact of the surgery to save Matthew\u2019s life and was not present when Matthew was admitted to the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Woodward proposed that her expert examine the body \u201cunder the auspices of the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office,\u201d and did not seek to remove the body to another location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The District Court judge who ruled on these early pretrial motions is not the Superior Court judge who tried the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">To the extent that Woodward asks us to consider the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition to her motion for a second autopsy as equivalent to suppression of exculpatory evidence, her argument lacks merit. Moreover, we do not share Woodward\u2019s characterization of the Commonwealth\u2019s position at the hearing as \u201cgroundless arguments,\u201d \u201cprejudicial conduct,\u201d and \u201cobstructionist tactics.\u201d Our duty in reviewing a preliminary ruling such as this is not to review the Commonwealth\u2019s argument for evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, but to review whether the judge acted properly in denying Woodward\u2019s autopsy request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Woodward does not claim here that her failure to conduct a second autopsy delayed her trial preparation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">In hindsight, the optimal balancing and reconciliation of each party\u2019s interests could have been accomplished by allowing Woodward\u2019s expert to be present at the autopsy, had she requested such relief. She did not. At Woodward\u2019s arraignment for assault and battery on February 6, 1997, she was informed that Matthew was in critical condition with a massive brain injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and was likely to die. Woodward made no request to have a witness present at an anticipated autopsy at that time or in the next few days as hope for Matthew\u2019s survival dimmed and was extinguished. Represented by counsel, Woodward knew or should have known that an autopsy would be ordered in a death in these circumstances and that it was likely to take place expeditiously in the aftermath of death. Nor did she ask, on February 11, to have a representative present at any continuing testing by the medical examiner. We see no reason why a judge may not order an opportunity for autopsy participation by a person charged in a homicide in an appropriate case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Nor did Woodward claim before or during the trial that the release for burial of the scalp tissue constituted prejudicial loss of evidence by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The dura, with the brain, was preserved after autopsy and not released to the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Woodward also had alleged that some brain tissue was missing. After hearing, the judge concluded that Woodward had not established that brain tissue had been lost or destroyed, but rather that missing brain tissue could be attributed to natural deterioration over time and from ordinary handling. Woodward does not challenge that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">For example, Dr. Leestma testified that the missing left side section of the dura was of \u201cminimal\u201d importance for purposes of his analysis, but that the right side section was \u201cthe bullseye of the medical problem that was going on.\u201d Dr. Leestma further testified that the slide from the right side section of the dura, provided by the Commonwealth from Dr. DeGirolami\u2019s work, was prepared in a way that was difficult to interpret.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">At the pretrial hearing on the missing tissue, the chief medical examiner, Dr. Richard Evans, admitted that he had been made aware of the court order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">We agree with the judge that there was no evidence of bad faith by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Contrary to Woodward\u2019s argument, the judge\u2019s decision to allow only one expert witness of Woodward\u2019s choice to return to the stand and testify on the photographs was not prejudicial. It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to limit potentially cumulative testimony on the same matter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 495 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Dr. Leestma, a leading forensic neuropathologist and the author of an authoritative text on forensic neuropathology, produced magnified microscopic photographic images of a specimen from the epidural surface of the dura, that side of the dura facing the interior of the skull, and testified to detecting \u201costeoblast\u201d cells in the periosteum taken from a sample of the dura that he concluded came from the site of the fracture. He testified that these were signs of healing that marked the age of the skull fracture as \u201cweeks\u201d old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Because both prosecution and defense experts agreed that the fatal subdural hematoma and the fractured skull were caused by the same event, proof that the skull fracture was weeks old is, Woodward argues, an \u201coutcome-determinative issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Woodward relies here all but exclusively on the testimony of Dr. Leestma who produced the magnified microscopic photographic images of specimens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of the dura. His testimony on cross-examination is not entirely clear, although one interpretation could be that he did not know the precise location from which he had taken the critical dura samples and that the bone material he observed (excluding \u201cvital reaction\u201d) could have been an artifact of the autopsy and therefore come from a location other than from the site of the skull fracture. This ambiguity is sufficient in itself for us to reject Woodward\u2019s request that we give conclusive weight to Dr. Leestma\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b706-5\">More frequently, but still only in rare circumstances, have we reviewed sentences when a defendant on appeal claims that the sentence is unlawful, a question that we have interpreted narrowly. Our review has been limited to the constitutionality of a sentence, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, </em>401 Mass. 237, 240 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 910-913 (1976); sentences imposed for crimes of which the defendant was not convicted, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 93 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>370 Mass. 217, 223-225 (1976); and increased sentences following retrial wherein a judge failed to articulate reasons to overcome a presumption of vindictiveness against the defendant for successfully exercising his right to appeal error in a first trial, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass. 815, 819-820 (1995). We have never reviewed a sentence, even at the request of a defendant, where the claim rests on some alleged legal error at trial, to say nothing of a sentence \u201ctainted by legal error.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The difference in the procedural circumstances of those cases and this one is critical: those defendants had initiated review in the trial court of the originally imposed sentences, and the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals arose only in response to the defendants\u2019 success in gaining reduced sentences. In this case, review of the sentence has not been initiated by Woodward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We have observed that a judge \u201chas considerable latitude within the framework of the applicable statute to determine the appropriate individualized sentence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 92 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>2 Allen 144, 147 (1861), we said, \u201cUntil something was done to carry the sentence into execution, by subjecting the prisoner to the warrant in the hands of the officer, no right or privilege to which he was entitled was taken away or invaded, by revoking the sentence first pronounced, and substituting in its stead the one under which he now stands charged.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>122 Mass. 317, 323 (1877). Later, we acknowledged that \u201cfrom early times the importance of the fact that a sentence has not been executed in whole or in part has been recognized in cases where the power of the court to amend or set aside and impose a new sentence has been involved.\u201d <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 256 (1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">See, e.g., G.

See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 134 (1980) (\u201cour Double Jeopardy Clause was drafted with the common-law protections in mind. . . .

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 550 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529, 531 (1981). There is, of course, another way that Woodward\u2019s sentence could be increased \u2014 if a second trial were held. Had we ordered a new trial, Woodward could have received a more severe sentence on a second conviction, see <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 721-722 (1969), although we have limited the basis on which a defendant may receive an increased sentence on retrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass. 815, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>819-822 (1995) (requiring that judge articulate reasons for an increased sentence on retrial, based on information not before the first sentencing judge). Woodward, given our resolution of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, does not seek a new trial. Were we to increase her sentence, as advocated by the dissent, we would also have to reach the merits of Woodward\u2019s other claimed errors. One or more of these claimed errors may have required a retrial, an outcome that, it appears, neither the Commonwealth nor the dissenting Justices believe would be in the interest of any party or the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The dissent makes much of a potential violation of rights of Matthew\u2019s family, citing G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7 3. The point was never argued by the Commonwealth. In any event, our reading of the exchange on this point between the judge and the prosecutor indicates that the judge was open to receiving at that time or later any additional statements that the Happens may have wanted to submit, and that the prosecutor was fully empowered to represent, as he did, the Happens\u2019 willingness to rely on their earlier victim impact statements for purposes of Woodward\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">See note 6, <em>supra, </em>for discussion of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>419 Mass. 716, 725 n.8 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>407 Mass. 731, 737 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>35 Mass.

I conclude that we should vacate the sentence imposed and have Woodward resentenced by another Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Court judge. This case presents circumstances unique to our rule 25 (b) (2) jurisprudence. Mass. R. Crim. R 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). In no other case has the trial judge denied a request by the Commonwealth for an obviously necessary lesser included offense instruction at the request of the defendant, and subsequently reduced a verdict returned by the jury on the greater offense to the lesser offense which the jury had been precluded from considering. The court correctly points out that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct on manslaughter was error. The judge improperly acquiesced in Woodward\u2019s counseled position that such an instruction should not be given, and he did so in reliance on case law that did not support that position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This error created the basis for the judge\u2019s subsequent reduction of Woodward\u2019s conviction to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">What further sets this case apart from most, if not all, others is that this chain of events was set in motion by Woodward, who, after examination in open court, and with the assistance and advice of her lawyers, knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the choices that would be given to the jury. Woodward pressed for those choices despite having full knowledge that her strategic decision might be rejected by the jury. Woodward\u2019s tactics, with the judge\u2019s approbation, transformed the trial from a search for the truth to a high stakes game of chance. In a phrase, Woodward brought the result on herself. There is much force in the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s actions appear \u201cto have manipulated the trial\u2019s outcome and marginalized the jury, all to Woodward\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 672. To their credit, the jury steeled themselves to their duty and returned a verdict finding Woodward guilty of the unlawful and intentional killing of an eight month old child.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The judge\u2019s error created a deep structural flaw in the trial, resulting in a sense of unease that permeated the proceedings that followed, and which was exacerbated by the nature of the sentencing proceedings following the verdict reduction. It is this singular series of events from which the Commonwealth\u2019s concerns about the propriety of Woodward\u2019s sentence arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">As the court states, <em>ante </em>at 687, the Commonwealth concedes that the sentence imposed falls within the range of punishment prescribed in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13, for a manslaughter conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Contrary to the court\u2019s reading of the record, however, the Commonwealth indeed argues that the sentence imposed on Woodward is nonetheless unlawful, basing its claim on the sentence being \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the judge\u2019s \u201cunlawful reduction in verdict.\u201d While the court concludes that, despite the instruction error, the judge acted within his discretion on Woodward\u2019s rule 25 (b) (2) motion in reducing the verdict to manslaughter, there are significant concerns raised by the sentencing procedures employed in this case, and by the particular sentence imposed, that the sentence should be considered independently from the verdict reduction. The Commonwealth also urges our review of the sentence pursuant to our authority under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, \u201cto set aside a sentence imposed contrary to law.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>422 Mass. 546, 547 (1996) (affirming single justice of this court who vacated an improper sentence, stating \u201c[i]t is well within this court\u2019s general superintendence power to correct a sentence that has been imposed contrary to law\u201d). Thus, the legality of Woodward\u2019s sentence was adequately raised by the Commonwealth, and the concerns now addressed are inherent in its request that this court review the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In view of the procedural posture of this case \u2014 the uniqueness of which the judge was well aware \u2014 I am particularly troubled by the dispatch with which the judge scheduled the sentencing hearing on the same afternoon that he released his postverdict order reducing Woodward\u2019s conviction, and by the cursory hearing that he then conducted, which was followed almost immediately by the time-served sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">My review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing suggests that the Commonwealth was not adequately prepared on such short notice to make a forceful argument on the appropriate sentence for Woodward\u2019s manslaughter conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The short notice also prevented Matthew\u2019s parents from attending the hearing. While the Commonwealth noted this fact, it acceded to the judge\u2019s suggestion that he consider the victim impact statements the Happens had made previously. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>procedures contravene the pertinent provisions of G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7 3, that family members are entitled to be present at all court proceedings related to the offense committed against the victim, \u00a7 3 <em>{t\u00ed), </em>and to be heard through an oral and written victim impact statement at sentencing about the effects of the crime on them, and as to a recommended sentence, \u00a7 3 (p). I question whether the statute permitted the judge to proceed so expeditiously with sentencing where the record does not reflect whether the Happens chose not to be present at the hearing, or because he provided so little notice of the hearing (despite having said at the conclusion of the postverdict motions hearing that he would provide \u201cample notice\u201d if further proceedings were required), they were effectively precluded from attending. As a result, not only might the judge\u2019s expediency have deprived the Happens of their statutory right, but the judge did not have the benefit of their thoughts in determining Woodward\u2019s sentence on the manslaughter conviction, which may well have differed from those expressed in their earlier statements. In any event, the haste with which the sentencing hearing was conducted, followed by the hurried disposition at the conclusion of the hearing, left little time for the judge to give proper consideration to the Happens\u2019 earlier victim impact statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Moreover, it is not apparent from the record of the sentencing hearing what factors and characteristics the judge considered in deciding Woodward\u2019s sentence. We have said that \u201c[the] sentence should reflect the judge\u2019s careful assessment of several goals: punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 92 (1993). The transcript shows, in this regard, that the judge merely stated that \u201c[t]he same considerations that informed my decision to lower the verdict apply here,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is in my judgment time to bring the judicial part of this extraordinary matter to a compassionate conclusion. Taking all of the circumstances into account . . . .\u201d These statements, combined with the cursory quality of the hearing and the haste in sentencing, suggest a rush to end the judicial proceedings and a failure to assess carefully all of the goals of sentencing in Woodward\u2019s case. In his memorandum reducing the verdict, the judge does not address the sentencing goals recognized in <em>Goodwin, </em>nor does he consider imposing on Woodward any appropriate terms of probation, despite his own conclusion that she was responsible for the death of a young child who was entrusted to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In addition, the judge states in his memorandum that he \u201cmay not, however, take into account the feelings of those [who Matthew\u2019s] death has affected.\u201d While this is an appropriate statement for purposes of reducing the verdict, it nonetheless further suggests he may have failed properly to consider for purposes of sentencing the impact of Woodward\u2019s crime on Matthew\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The Commonwealth argues in its brief that \u201c[t]he combination of the judge\u2019s actions created the appearance, and must have given the public the distinct impression, that the [judge] was manipulating the outcome of the trial and engineering an acquittal.\u201d We have said that, \u201c[b]ecause the role of the sentencing court is, by nature, \u2018judgmental,\u2019 ... a judge \u2018must maintain a stance of scrupulous impartiality and not permit [himself or herself] to become identified with the interests of either the prosecutor or the defense counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>390 Mass. 797, 809 (1984), quoting Commentary, HI ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, standard 18-6.9, at 496 (2d ed. Supp. 1982). We also have said that criminal proceedings must have \u201cthe appearance of fairness and impartiality necessary to our judicial system. \u2018[Jjustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>367 Mass. 569, 572 (1975), quoting <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954). Here, it appears that the judge identified himself with Woodward\u2019s cause, compromising the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity and impartiality of our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The combination of these circumstances leads me to conclude that Woodward\u2019s sentence is tainted by legal error and thus was not lawfully imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cjustice [would] best be served if [Woodward were] sentenced again,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>369 Mass. 608, 610 (1976), by another judge, \u201cbased solely on relevant criteria of sentencing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra </em>at 810-811 n.15. A new sentencing judge, after appropriate study, reflection, and an opportunity for the parties to be heard, might impose the same period of incarceration as was imposed by the judge here, or might increase Woodward\u2019s penalty. I would recommend that a judge, in resentencing Woodward, consider imposing a suitable period of probation that makes her subject to appropriate conditions, including the following two special conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>First, as a felon convicted of a grave act of child abuse, Woodward should not in the future be entrusted with the care of the children of others, whether for remuneration or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Second, Woodward and her representatives or assignees should be prohibited from engaging in any activity generating any profit or financial benefit relating to the publication or dissemination by any form of media of facts or circumstances relating to her crime, her experience in the judicial system, or anything else associated with the tragic event for which she stands convicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996) (upholding a similar special condition of probation with respect to Katherine A. Power, a felon convicted of manslaughter, whose story drew national media attention).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">These measures comprise an appropriate remedy that would rectify any harm caused by the legal error, engender confidence in the fairness and impartiality of our judicial system, maintain the dignity and integrity of our courts, and bring rightful closure to this difficult case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Woodward\u2019s additional argument that a manslaughter instruction would have been prejudicial because it might have invited a compromise verdict is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In his written memorandum reducing Woodward\u2019s verdict, released on the morning of November 10, 1997, the judge directed that she be brought before the court a few hours later, \u201cthen and there to receive her sentence\u201d on the manslaughter conviction. Judges, of course, can sentence a defendant on the same day as his or her conviction, and this often occurs. However, it is assumed that judges do so with the informed consent of the parties, and after having considered all factors relevant to a proper disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Thus, there is no need to consider the exercise of our authority pursuant to G.L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
