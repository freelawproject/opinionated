(Lily) appeals from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board). We granted its application for direct appellate review. The board affirmed the denial by the board of assessors of Medford (assessors) of Lily\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>application for abatement of a 1994 motor vehicle excise imposed on a Ford truck. Lily complains that the assessors improperly valued the vehicle, which it purchased in 1994 for approximately $53,660, when they used the truck\u2019s list price of $84,332 (rather than its sale price) in calculating the excise. We conclude that the board correctly determined that G. L. c. 60A, \u00a7 1, directed the assessors to impose the challenged excise. We reject Lily\u2019s claim that the assessment of the excise violated its constitutional rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Registry of Motor Vehicles calculates the value of all motor vehicles registered in Massachusetts for the purpose of determining motor vehicle excises. It applies the statutory percentage, prescribed by \u00a7 1, to the manufacturer\u2019s list price for vehicles of the same make, type, model, and year of manufacture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In its decision the board in effect granted that the fair market value of Lily\u2019s truck was less than the list price. It noted, but did not explicitly find, that the evidence showed that a purchaser of a single truck always paid less than the manufacturer\u2019s list price. Few trucks are sold as \u201cstandard models\u201d because they are customized to meet a purchaser\u2019s specifications. Lily\u2019s truck had at least fifteen \u201cupgraded\u201d items according to its specifications. The board ruled, nevertheless, that the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) and the assessors could properly value the truck by applying the statutory percentage to the manufacturer\u2019s list price. It ruled that the procedure currently followed \u201cresults in an automated, efficient, and equitable process of assessing the excise on all motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth.\u201d It rejected both Lily\u2019s view of the statute\u2019s requirements and Lily\u2019s constitutional challenges to the statute as construed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">1. Section 1 of G. L. c. 60A provides, with exceptions not here relevant, that, in each calendar year, an excise shall be assessed and levied on every motor vehicle, registered under G. L. c. 90, for the privilege of registration \u201cmeasured by the value thereof, as hereinafter defined and determined, at the rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of [$25] per thousand of valuation.\u201d The crucial language in \u00a7 1 for the purposes of this appeal is the \u201chereinafter defined and determined\u201d language which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cFor the purpose of this excise the value of each such motor vehicle or trailer shall be deemed to be the value, as determined by the commissioner, of motor vehicles or trailers of the same make, type, model, and year of manufacture as designated by the manufacturer, but not in excess of the following percentages of the list price established by the manufacturer for the year of manufacture, namely: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">In the year preceding the designated year of manu-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">facture............................50%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">In the year of manufacture................90%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">In the second year......................60%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">In the third year......................40%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">In the fourth year......................25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">In the fifth and succeeding years...........10%\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">Section 1 of G. L. c. 60A is explicit in stating that the value of a vehicle is to be deemed the value determined by the commissioner of all vehicles of the same make, type, model, and year of manufacture as designated by the manufacturer. The amount may not be greater than a stated percentage of the list price established by the manufacturer. The statutory object is not to value the vehicle but rather to value collectively all vehicles in the same classification (make, type, model, age) based on the manufacturer\u2019s fist price.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">The third paragraph of \u00a7 1 provides that nothing in \u00a7 1 should be construed to prevent a board of assessors or the commissioner \u201cfrom granting an abatement in any case in which the valuation aforesaid is in their or his opinion excessive.\u201d Lily does not argue that the assessors abused their discretion, as opposed to committing an error of law, in not acting in its favor pursuant to the quoted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">Considering the impact of the percentage limitations of \u00a7 1 over the fife of a vehicle, it is doubtful that excises determined under \u00a7 1, or \u201cthe valuation aforesaid,\" would be excessive and thus require assessors to grant an abatement to track owners in Lily\u2019s position. The record shows, for example, that a truck is likely to be worth more than twenty-five per cent of its list price in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fourth year and more than ten per cent of its list price in its fifth and some subsequent years. Section 1 nevertheless limits assessed values by those percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In arguing that \u00a7 1 requires that the excise be based on a vehicle\u2019s fair cash value, Lily relies on language in the <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>250 Mass. 591, 599-600 (1925), in which the Justices answered a broad question concerning the constitutionality of a bill that proposed an excise on motor vehicles. The Justices said that problems (unidentified ones) might arise, if the motor vehicle maker\u2019s current list price, proposed to be used for determining the excise, was not \u201cequivalent to the cost price\u201d and substantially so for \u201call makes of motor vehicles.\u201d That statement presumably refers to possible constitutional infirmities in such a provision, based on positions taken by the United States Supreme Court at that time. We shall consider Lily\u2019s constitutional claims, but we find no reason based on the 1925 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>and the Legislature\u2019s reaction to that opinion, not to read G. L. c. 60A, \u00a7 1, as we have. Section 1 calls for a collective valuation, not an individualized one. Section 1 does not compel the commissioner to use some measure other than the manufacturer\u2019s list price in determining the value of a classification of vehicles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">2. Lily\u2019s constitutional challenges to the application of G. L. c. 60A, \u00a7 1, as construed in this opinion, lack merit. The use of a truck\u2019s list price to calculate an excise is not an irrebuttable presumption that violates due process. See <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 767-768, 785 (1975); <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 900 (1980). The law in this respect has changed to Lily\u2019s disadvantage since <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>250 Mass. 591 (1925). See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 16-34, at 1622-1624 (2d ed. 1988). Moreover, using a rough approximation to calculate the excise is not wholly arbitrary. The excise concerns the right to use highways, and not directly the value of the vehicle, as would be the case of a property tax. The use of a list price to calculate the excise has not been shown to be excessive, especially given that, in the later years of a truck\u2019s life, the statutory plan of assessment uses an amount that is less than the fair market value of the vehicle. In such circumstances, no due process of law violation exists. See <em>Pittsburgh </em>v. <em>Alco Parking Corp., </em>417 U.S. 369, 373 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>363 U.S. 194, 201 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Lily has not shown that there is no rational basis for calculating the excise as the statute prescribes. Administrative convenience can provide a sufficient basis for a particular means of calculation. <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>301 U.S. 495, 511 (1937). There is no violation, therefore, of equal protection of the laws. See <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979); <em>Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>358 U.S. 522, 527 (1959); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>405 Mass. 352, 358 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1055 (1990); <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>370 Mass. 781, 785 (1976); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>360 Mass. 724, 728-729 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u201cThe only limitation upon the Legislature\u2019s use of its excise taxing power is that the tax be reasonable.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 607, 612 (1981). See <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>406 Mass. 195, 198 (1989); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724, 727 (1949). Fair approximations of the value of the privilege for which an excise is imposed (here the use of the highways) are sufficient. <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 236 (1982). <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Lily\u2019s argument based on art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights adds nothing to its due process of law contentions that we have already rejected. See <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 577, 589-590 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">3. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Lily\u2019s request for declaratory relief is misplaced in an appeal from the Appellate Tax Board. Our decision on the merits of the appeal substantially provides a declaration of rights on Lily\u2019s request for declaratory relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The Registry of Motor Vehicles, following the methodology established by the commissioner, sends the bills for excises owed to local tax collectors who, in turn, send them to the owners of registered vehicles.
