The defendant was indicted on a charge of murder in the first degree and, in circumstances that we shall describe, ultimately found guilty by a jury in April, 1968. Thirty years later, the defendant makes three requests: that we reevaluate the judge\u2019s charge on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>reasonable doubt in light of changes in the law since his conviction; that we consider whether the jurors were coerced into reaching their decision because the judge gave a premature and unrequested charge like the one given in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-3 (1851); and that we consider whether the defendant received effective assistance of counsel. We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We need not recite the facts as the jury could have found them, for we have done so previously. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 169-171 (1970) <em>(Smith II). </em>Suffice it to say that the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the facts was powerful, and on his direct appeal the defendant did not contend that there was error in the denial of his motions that requested directed verdicts of not guilty \u201con the evidence generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. Rather, the critical issue for the jury was the mental capacity of the defendant as bearing on his criminal responsibility, as we had then recently elaborated the meaning of that concept in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 553-555 (1967). <em>Smith II, supra </em>at 177. We recite in greater detail the procedural history of this case to place the defendant\u2019s present claims in their appropriate context.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On March 21, 1966, a Plymouth County jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree, and he was sentenced to death. On appeal, we reversed the judgment, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>353 Mass. 487 (1968) <em>(Smith I), </em>because of our restatement of the law of insanity as affecting criminal responsibility, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, supra, </em>decided after the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant was tried a second time. On April 26, 1968, a jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and this time recommended that the death sentence not be imposed. The defendant received the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On the defendant\u2019s appeal after his second trial, we held that there had been no error at the trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Smith II, supra. </em>In accordance with our statutory obligation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we conducted a plenary review of the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>determined that the verdict was consistent with the interests of justice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In 1990, the defendant filed, pro se, his first motion for a new trial since his appeal was heard,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and requested that counsel be appointed to represent him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel was appointed, but took no action and ultimately withdrew. His present counsel was appointed in December, 1995, and, on February 16, 1996, filed a substitute motion for a new trial, raising the three claims we described above. Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court denied the motion on February 3, 1997. On March 19, 1997, a single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, allowed an appeal \u201con the issues of the reasonable doubt instructions given by the trial judge and the alleged ineffectiveness of his trial and appellate counsel with the trial judge\u2019s use of the <em>Tuery </em>charge (as it was then called) with embellishment after the jury had been deliberating for a relatively short period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">1. <em>Instructions on reasonable doubt. </em>At the second trial, two psychiatrists testified that the defendant was not sane when he committed the murder, while the Commonwealth presented no rebuttal expert testimony on the question of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. The defendant claims that in these circumstances the evidence of his sanity was far from overwhelming. It is in that context that he asks us to review the instructions on reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The defendant did not object to the instructions on reasonable doubt at his trial or on appeal. We consider first whether he may do so now. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>405 Mass. 598 (1989), we considered a postappeal, collateral attack by a defendant convicted of a capital crime<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on jury instructions to which he had not objected at his trial or on appeal. We said that where a defendant \u201cdid not have a \u2018genuine opportunity\u2019 to raise his constitutional claim on those occasions,\u201d the defendant is \u201centitled to raise [the] issue for the first time in a motion for new trial under Mass. R. Crim. R 30.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600 n.2, quoting <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 251 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burkett, </em>396 Mass. 509, 512 (1986). Here, the motion judge (who was not the trial judge) did not explicitly consider whether the defendant had waived this claim. He noted that the defendant \u201crelies primarily upon developments in the relevant law which have transpired since the time of his trial in 1968,\u201d and concluded that the defendant could claim the benefit of the \u201cnew rules\u201d because they involved a \u201cbedrock procedural element\u201d that could be challenged in the light of recent developments in the law. Addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, he denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in turn, provides in a capital case that \u201c[i]f any motion is filed in the superior court after re-script [from this court], no appeal shall lie from the decision of that court upon such motion unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice of the supreme judicial court on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>397 Mass. 705, 708 (1986) (relevant inquiry under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, is whether legal basis for defendant\u2019s argument is new and substantial at time of direct appeal). The single justice concluded that the \u201cissue pertaining to the reasonable doubt instructions is new and substantial,\u201d and allowed the appeal on that issue. The Commonwealth, nevertheless, argues here that the defendant\u2019s claim was waived because the law on reasonable doubt instructions was \u201csufficiently developed at the time of [the defendant\u2019s] direct appeal to put him on notice that there was a potential appellate issue.\u201d We address that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The defendant argues that the instructions on reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>were deficient in two respects. First, he claims that an instruction similar to the one used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304 (1926), that we have since criticized, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 296 (1984), reduced the Commonwealth\u2019s quantum of proof below the standard required by the United States Constitution. See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 363-364 (1970). The Commonwealth does not argue, nor could it, that the basis for this part of the defendant\u2019s claim was sufficiently established at the time of his direct appeal: for at least a decade after the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, the challenged language continued to be cited with approval. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 217, 233 (1979). That argument is \u201cnew.\u201d Second, the defendant claims that \u201creasonable doubt\u201d was impermissibly defined as \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d without appropriate further explanation. Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gerald, </em>356 Mass. 386, 390 (1969), the Commonwealth says it is this argument that was open to the defendant on direct appeal. We disagree. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 342-343 (1995), a postappeal collateral attack on reasonable doubt instructions in a capital case, we said that \u201ccase law regarding the constitutionality of the phrase \u2018moral certainty\u2019 in a reasonable doubt instruction developed after the date of the defendant\u2019s original appeal,\u201d and that it was therefore proper to consider the defendant\u2019s challenges to the reasonable doubt instructions. In <em>Pinckney, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in 1973, three years after the direct appeal in this case. Our ruling in <em>Pinckney </em>disposes of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument. As both claims of the defendant are \u201cnew,\u201d waiver is no longer a consideration, and it is appropriate for us to consider the defendant\u2019s challenges to the reasonable doubt instructions. See <em>Sires, supra </em>at 600; <em>Ambers, supra </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We review the instructions on reasonable doubt to determine whether \u201ca reasonable juror could have used the instruction incorrectly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 688 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant first challenges the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt: First, I will tell you what it isn\u2019t. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not proof beyond all doubt. It is not proof to an absolute certainty. It is not proof to a mathematical certainty. Crimes by their very nature are usually committed in some dark, secluded area. And if we ever imposed upon the Commonwealth the awesome burden of proving that beyond all doubt this defendant committed the crime, we\u2019d live in a greater jungle than we live in today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The challenged language, similar to the instruction we approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, supra</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is defective, he says, because it encouraged the jury to accept a less than constitutionally required level of proof from the Commonwealth so that the task of convicting criminals would be made easier. Recently we have criticized the language \u201cas warning the jury of holding the prosecution to too high a standard of proof.\u201d <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 348. But where a <em>Madeiros-type </em>charge has been given, we look to see whether the potentially harmful effect is balanced by some other aspect of the instructions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 296 (1984) (effect of <em>Madeiros </em>charge \u201cwas balanced in part by the statement that \u2018[a] verdict of guilty cannot be based upon a mere prejudice, presumption, speculation, or suspicion,\u2019 and by the judge\u2019s emphasis throughout his charge that the jury\u2019s verdict must be based on the evidence presented at trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 148, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982) (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice in case arising under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, where judge instructed jury five times that \u201cthe Commonwealth had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crimes\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carballo, </em>381 Mass. 227, 229 (1980) (no cause for reversal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, where defendant took no exception to charge, and where judge charged in detail on presumption of innocence, repeatedly charged that Commonwealth bore the burden of proof, and defined reasonable doubt in terms of moral certainty). The charge in this case is less objectionable than the charges given in these other cases where, despite a <em>Madeiros-inspired </em>instruction, we affirmed the convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all doubt, nor beyond a whimsical or fanciful doubt, nor proof beyond the possibility of innocence. ... If an unreasonable doubt or a mere possibility of innocence were sufficient to prevent a conviction, practically every criminal would be set free to prey upon the community. Such a rule would be wholly impractical, and would break down the forces of law and order, and make the lawless supreme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The judge instructed here that it was \u201cimportant in the administration of justice . . . that no innocent person be convicted,\u201d and told the jury that this was a \u201cmost serious\u201d case, and one \u201cthat will weigh on your conscience for, I daresay, the greater part of your life.\u201d He said that the jurors were bound by \u201cthe duty of impartiality,\u201d especially because the defendant was on trial \u201cfor his life,\u201d and that the defendant was presumed innocent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge repeatedly instructed the jurors that they must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, and specifically that \u201cat the time the accused committed the unlawful act he was mentally capable of knowing what he was doing.\u201d The jury were told to \u201c[djecide this case according to the facts and according to the law as given to you, not with a feeling of hostility towards the defendant or any feeling of prejudice or anything of that nature.\u201d Because the judge made clear that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and because the warning was balanced by his statement that a guilty verdict could not be based on prejudice, there was no reversible error in the instructions on the basis of the first claim of the defendant. See <em>Sheline, supra </em>at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant next argues that the judge improperly defined \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as \u201cproof to a moral certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant attacks the instructions in two respects. First, he says, the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>explained in terms of the Commonwealth\u2019s high burden of proof, and second, the definition of the term was confusing, and conveyed only a general theme that the jury were to be morally correct to convict the defendant. We recognize, as has the United States Supreme Court, that if the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d is used in isolation without explanation, it does not convey the high degree of certainty required for conviction. See <em>Victor </em>v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 16 (1994) (reversal required if term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d is used without explanation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>424 Mass. 698, 702-703 (1997) (on direct appeal, new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>trial required because only explanation of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d was reference to certainty required for important personal decisions). But cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 571 (1994) , cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995) (\u201cmoral certainty\u201d used in isolation \u201cmight\u201d amount to an erroneous instruction on reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Commonwealth concedes that the paragraph immediately following the first use of the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d might have been confusing. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>There the judge gave the jury no guidance on the degree of certainty required for the Commonwealth to meet its burden. But the question remains whether the judge, in some other respect, gave content to the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d sufficient to inform the jury of the high degree of certainty they must possess in order to convict the defendant. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341 (1995) , the instructions on reasonable doubt used the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d three times, the first two in isolation and the third followed by language that \u201cproperly impressed upon the jury the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. We nevertheless found the instructions objectionable because of \u201cnumerous inconsistencies that permeated the charge on the definition of reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>id., </em>and because the judge \u201cclearly misstated the law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 348, when he used language based on the charge in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304 (1926). We concluded in that case that these errors, in conjunction, led to the conclusion \u201cthat the instruction failed to convey accurately to the jury the meaning of reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">We have already concluded that, unlike the case in <em>Pinckney, supra, </em>the judge did not convey the incorrect standard of proof when he used language based on the <em>Madeiros </em>charge; here there was no \u201cclear misstate[ment]\u201d of the law. Further, in this case, like <em>Pinckney, </em>the judge used the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d several times, but here there were not the \u201cnumerous inconsistencies\u201d throughout the remainder of the charge that plagued the definition of reasonable doubt in <em>Pinckney. </em>Because those errors are not present here, we look to the charge as a whole to determine whether it appropriately made clear to the jurors that \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is a high standard of proof. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>426 Mass. 313, 318 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">In this case the standard was met. The judge instructed that to find the defendant guilty, the evidence had \u201cto produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>moral certainty of guilty and to <em>exclude any other reasonable </em>hypothesis\u201d before the jury concluded that \u201cthe accused, and no one else, committed the offense charged\u201d (emphasis added). Before he used the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d to define reasonable doubt, the judge contrasted the requisite level of proof with an absolute or mathematical certainty. \u201cThe juxtaposition suggests that the requisite level of confidence was, indeed, substantial, though not proof beyond <em>all </em>doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Gilday </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>59 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1175 (1996), citing <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 347. The judge emphasized that the jurors were on \u201ca search for the truth,\u201d and they were to determine where the truth lay \u201cso that you can always say to yourself you are satisfied you returned a verdict according to your conscience.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Limone, </em>410 Mass. 364, 369-370 (1991). Finally, before the jury retired to deliberate a second time, the judge further instructed that the defendant was presumed to be innocent, that the law imposed on the Commonwealth the burden to establish \u201cevery part of\u201d the case, and that, if \u201cin any part\u201d of the case the jury were left in doubt, \u201cthe defendant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, and must be acquitted.\u201d While the instructions could have been more eloquent, and the concept of reasonable doubt explained more fully, viewed as a whole, we conclude that the instructions \u201ccorrectly conveyed to the jury the level of proof required to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 572 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">2. <em>The </em>Tuey <em>charge and ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that his right to due process under both the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution was violated when the judge prematurely delivered the instruction described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-3 (1851).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The instruction was given at 6:17 p.m., after ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>proximately four or five hours of deliberations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jury retired at 6:26 p.m., and at 6:38 p.m. the jury returned a verdict of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>of murder in the first degree, and recommended that the death penalty not be imposed. At trial, the defendant did not object to the charge, nor did he raise the issue on direct appeal. The defendant makes no claim here \u2014 and none commands our attention \u2014 that he did not have a \u201cgenuine opportunity\u201d to raise this issue on those occasions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>405 Mass. 598, 600 n.2 (1989). The motion judge addressed the claim on the merits, but the single justice concluded that this alleged error in the charge was \u201cfairly obvious so that it cannot be said to be \u2018new.\u2019 \u201d We agree. This issue was waived. The appeal on this point was not allowed by the single justice, and ought not to have been argued by the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendant also argues that the lawyer who served as his trial and appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he did not object to the <em>Tuey </em>charge. It was on this basis, and this alone, that the single justice allowed the defendant to raise the issue of the <em>Tuey </em>charge. Where we have given a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree full review pursuant to the obligations imposed by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u201cour special powers of review under \u00a7 33E are no longer applicable. Any claim of ineffectiveness of counsel presented in a subsequent appeal from the [disposition] of a motion for a new trial, authorized by a single justice of this court, would not be tested under the \u00a7 33E standard but on the applicable constitutional standards, State and Federal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 775 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 n.l (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>423 Mass. 17, 20 (1996). A defendant must show that there was \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Haley, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Even if incompetency is found, the defendant must also show that he has likely been deprived of an \u201cotherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Haley, supra. </em>See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 n.3 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Was the lawyer incompetent when he failed to object to the <em>Tuey </em>charge? <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 97-101 (1973), decided five years after the defendant\u2019s second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>trial, was the first occasion in which we criticized a charge to the jury such as the one given in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1 (1851), and there was no reason why counsel should have anticipated our criticism of such a charge. Certainly, the issue was not obvious to us when we conducted our plenary review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in 1970. We cannot conclude counsel was necessarily incompetent when he raised no objection to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Nor are we persuaded that, even by the legal standards developed after the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, the charge was so coercive that the failure of counsel to have objected was behavior that fell \u201cbelow that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 779 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>375 Mass. 472, 492 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, supra </em>at 98. In <em>Rodriquez, </em>for example, we criticized the use of a <em>Tuey </em>charge as tending to coerce the jury to reach a verdict. We noted two main criticisms of the charge: first, its misstatement of the fact that the \u201ccase must at some time be decided,\u201d and second, because it asks \u201cthe members of the tentative minority to reconsider their position in the light of the views of the tentative majority, but does not invite the majority members to reciprocate toward the minority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. Here, after delivering the charge, the judge informed the jury that he \u201ccertainly\u201d did not want to \u201cconvey the impression upon you that you must reach a verdict,\u201d and explicitly told the jury that there are times when jurors have \u201cnot been able to agree.\u201d This avoided the first concern that we later addressed in <em>Rodriquez </em>\u2014 telling the jury that the \u201ccase must at some time be decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99. That the instruction was given after five \u2014 or even four \u2014 hours of deliberation is also not determinative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 779 (1992) (no error where <em>Tuey </em>charge given after approximately four hours of deliberation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 638 (1968) (same). The defendant argues that the instruction must have been coercive (and his lawyer incompetent for not perceiving that threat), because the jury returned with a guilty verdict of murder in the first degree a mere twelve minutes after the charge. That conclusion is not warranted. See <em>Lowenfield </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 235, 240 (1988) (where jury returned verdict sentencing petitioner to death thirty minutes after charge and where defense counsel did not object, \u201cthe potential for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>coercion . . . was not apparent to one on the spot\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brunelle, </em>361 Mass. 6, 12 (1972) (no error where jury returned with verdict of guilty ten minutes after <em>Tuey </em>charge). The judge told the jury that, if they were \u201cfar away from a verdict,\u201d the court officers would make arrangements for food to be brought to the jury room. We do not think that the lawyer\u2019s failure to object was any indication of incompetence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>375 Mass. 472, 492 (1978) (no jury coercion where judge refused defendant\u2019s requests to allow jurors to go home, sent jury back for continued deliberations at 11:15 p.m., and jury returned guilty verdict twenty minutes later).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">No explanation illuminates why the judge decided to give a <em>Tuey </em>charge in the early part of the evening of the first day of deliberations. There is nothing in this record to indicate where the jury stood at the time they received the instruction. See <em>Haley, supra </em>at 779-780. We noted in <em>Haley, supra </em>at 779, that \u201c[a] trial judge has discretion in deciding when to give the charge.\u201d We have concluded that the charge given here was not inherently coercive. We cannot rule out the possibility that trial counsel had a strategic reason for not objecting to the charge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cTrial tactics which, from the vantage point of hindsight, can be seen to have failed do not amount to ineffective assistance unless \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when undertaken.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sielicki, </em>391 Mass. 377, 379 (1984). In failing to challenge the <em>Tuey </em>charge at trial and on appeal, counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.

But in conferring together, you ought to pay proper respect to each other\u2019s opinions, and listen, with a disposition to be convinced, to each other\u2019s arguments. And, on the one hand, if much the larger number of your panel are for a conviction, a dissenting juror should consider whether a doubt in his own mind is a reasonable one, which makes no impression upon the minds of so many men, equally honest, equally intelligent with himself, and who have heard the same evidence, with the same attention, with an equal desire to arrive at the truth, and under the sanction of the same oath. And, on the other hand, if a majority are for acquittal, the minority ought seriously to ask themselves whether they may not reasonably and ought not to doubt the correctness of a judgment, which is not concurred in by most of those with whom they are associated; and distrust the weight or sufficiency of that evidence which fails to carry conviction to the minds of their fellows.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judge also charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to convey the impression upon you that you must reach a verdict.
