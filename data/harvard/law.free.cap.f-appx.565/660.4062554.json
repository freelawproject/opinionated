(Bobrick) appeals a district court judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ment, entered after a bench trial, in this Lanham Act action against American Specialties, Inc. (ASI). Bobrick alleged that ASI infringed its registered trademark and unregistered trade dress by manufacturing and selling a washroom accessory line, called \u201cRoval,\u201d that closely resembles Bobrick\u2019s \u201cContura Series.\u201d The district court found that the registered trademark and alleged trade dress were functional and hence invalid. Bobrick also appeals the district court\u2019s order awarding it attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for ASI\u2019s discovery misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact after a bench trial for clear error. <em>Oswalt v. Resolute Indus., Inc., </em>642 F.3d 856, 859 (9th Cir.2011). We review the district court\u2019s imposition of discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Leon v. IDX Sys. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 951, 957-58 (9th Cir.2006). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">1. The district court properly placed the burden on ASI to establish that Bobrick\u2019s registered trade dress was functional and on Bobrick to establish that its alleged unregistered trade dress was nonfunctional. The district court then properly identified and evaluated the factors enumerated in <em>Disc Golf Ass\u2019n v. Champion Discs, Inc., </em>158 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir.1998), and concluded that both Bobrick\u2019s registered trademark and alleged unregistered trade dress were functional. These factual findings of functionality were supported by ample evidence, including expert testimony presented by ASI and an advertisement from Bobrick documenting the functionality of the product. The district court correctly viewed the Bobrick product design as a whole, and did not base its determination merely on the conclusion that the component parts of the Contura Series were functional. <em>See Secalt S.A. v. Wuxi Shenxi Constr. Mach. Co., </em>668 F.3d 677, 683 (9th Cir.2012); <em>Clicks Billiards Inc. v. Sixshooters Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1259 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing monetary sanctions rather than a default judgment and refusing to draw adverse inferences as a result of ASI\u2019s discovery violations. Nor, given the district court\u2019s detailed explanation for the attorney\u2019s fee award and the considerable discretion afforded to the district court in determining fees and costs, <em>see Lahiri v. Universal Music &amp; Video Distrib. Corp., </em>606 F.3d 1216, 1222-23 (9th Cir.2010), has Bobrick established that the district court abused its discretion by substantially reducing the requested fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. Because we conclude that Bobrick's trademark and alleged trade dress are invalid, we need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative conclusions that Bobrick failed to establish either secondary meaning or likelihood of confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">. Bobrick\u2019s motion to strike portions of ASI\u2019s supplemental excerpts of record is granted in part and denied in part. The full deposition transcripts lodged but not filed in the district court are stricken. To the extent that excerpts of the deposition transcripts were filed with the court and considered, however, those excerpts are properly part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
