The district court denied the motion because Clark\u2019s sentence was based on his career offender status, not on drug quantity. Clark moved for reconsideration, and the district court denied relief. Clark then filed a second motion for reconsideration, which the district court also denied. Clark appeals from this order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">A district court lacks authority to grant a motion to reconsider its ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d 233, 234 (4th Cir.2010). Under <em>Goodwyn, </em>Clark had only one opportunity to seek, through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the benefit of the amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 235-36. Once the district court ruled on Clark\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, it lacked authority to grant subsequent relief \u2014 either by way of a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or a motion for reconsideration of the initial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Clark\u2019s motion. We deny the motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
