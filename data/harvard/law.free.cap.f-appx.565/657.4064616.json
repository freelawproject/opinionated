We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-24\">First, Dahlberg argues that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that he personally inflicted great bodily injury on Sergeant Kelly. As to this issue, the California Court of Appeal ruled, as a matter of state law, that the evidence was \u201csufficient to support a finding that [Dahlberg] both personally inflicted and proximately caused Sergeant Kelly\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>People v. Dahlberg, </em>No. F058563, 2010 WL 4721346, at *11 (Cal.Ct.App. Nov. 22, 2010). In reaching that conclusion, the state court relied on California law, stating that \u201c \u2018[m]ore than one person may be found to have directly participated in inflicting a single injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., quoting People v. Guzman, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 761, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 885, 887 (2000). This conclusion is binding on us. <em>See Bradshaw v. Richey, </em>546 U.S. 74, 76, 126 S.Ct. 602, 163 L.Ed.2d 407 (2005) (per curiam) (explaining that \u201ca state court\u2019s interpretation of state law ... binds a federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sitting in habeas corpus\u201d); <em>Medley v. Runnels, </em>506 F.3d 857, 862 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (following <em>Bradshaw </em>and explaining that a \u201cfederal court [on habeas review] may not overturn a conviction [even if] the state court misinterprets state law\u201d). In light of Dahlberg\u2019s participation in parking the van, his sufficiency-of-evidence challenge fails under the standard set by <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Second, Dahlberg argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense when it precluded him from offering evidence and argument that a superseding cause absolved him of responsibility for the injuries to Sergeant Kelly. As to this issue, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the trial court had \u201ccorrectly concluded that, as a matter of [state] law, [Sergeant Kelly\u2019s] conduct did not constitute a superseding cause of the accident that injured him.\u201d <em>Dahlberg, </em>2010 WL 4721346, at *4. The state court based this conclusion on California law, holding that if an \u201c \u2018intervening cause is a normal and reasonably foreseeable result of [the] defendant\u2019s original act[,] the intervening act is \u2018dependent\u2019 and not a superseding cause, and will not relieve [the] defendant of liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6, <em>quoting People v. Cervantes, </em>26 Cal.4th 860, 111 Cal.Rptr.2d 148, 29 P.3d 225, 233 (2001). Because Dahlberg had not \u201cargue[d] or presented] any authority supporting the conclusion that Sergeant Kelly\u2019s conduct in this case was so extraordinary and unforeseeable it could reasonably be deemed ... [a] superseding cause of the accident,\u201d and because he \u201cmade no offer of proof of any evidence that was legally sufficient to show a superseding cause,\u201d the California Court of Appeal held that the trial court had not erred as to this issue. <em>Id. </em>at *4-7. As with Dahlberg\u2019s prior claim, the state court\u2019s interpretation of state law \u2014 in this case, state law defining a \u201csuperseding cause\u201d\u2014 is binding on us in habeas. <em>Bradshaw, </em>546 U.S. at 76, 126 S.Ct. 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Finally, Dahlberg argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it excluded evidence that no money was found in Dahlberg\u2019s van when its contents were inventoried. As to this issue, the California Court of Appeal ruled that there was \u201cno competent evidence establishing that there had ever been any money in the van in the first place,\u201d which meant that the trial court had \u201cproperly excluded as ... irrelevant\u201d testimony from a proffered witness that \u201cno money was found in the van.\u201d <em>Dahlberg, </em>2010 WL 4721346, at *8. Dahlberg fails to meet his burden of showing that this ruling was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See, e.g., Kemp v. Ryan, </em>638 F.3d 1245, 1261 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
