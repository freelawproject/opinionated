The city has declined to grant zoning variances that Sheikh needs for his proposed residence, and he suspects that the zoning ordinance is being used as cover for unlawful discrimination based on his race, religion, and national origin. Sheikh filed two lawsuits, one against neighborhood residents who opposed his building plans, and the other against the county, the city, and city officials. Both suits claim violations of federal and state law. The suit against the neighbors was assigned to Judge Dow, who dismissed it for failure to state a claim. The other suit was assigned to Judge Der-Yeghiayan, who dismissed some claims on the complaint and the remainder at summary judgment. We have consolidated Sheikh\u2019s appeals for decision, and we affirm both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">Except as noted, the following facts are not disputed. Sheikh bought four adjoining lots in 2006. He wants to build a house to share with his wife and two adult children. Each lot is 140' by 60' for a total area of 33,600 square feet, but Illinois has a right-of-way that spans a portion of the lots and effectively reduces their total size by more than a third. The city had cautioned Sheikh before his purchase that, although the four lots together are big enough to accommodate a home of 6,156 square feet, no single lot is big enough for a residence of any size. The city noted that Sheikh would need a minimum of one zoning variance and its approval to combine the lots. And, the city added, \u201ctopographic information and review by an engineer would be needed to confirm the buildability of the lots\u201d because they \u201cmay be located in a regulated floodplain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-17\">Sheikh bought the lots anyway and soon faced neighborhood opposition in addition to zoning hurdles. The zoning ordinance\u2019s \u201ccontiguous lot requirement\u201d prevents him from consolidating his lots unless he also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>buys and joins a fifth (because all five lots, at some earlier time, were jointly owned). The city council could grant a variance for undue hardship, but Sheikh would still have another problem: His combined parcels constitute a \u201ccorner\u201d lot, which, given the state\u2019s right-of-way and the zoning ordinance\u2019s setback provisions, will force him to compress his house into a skinny, pie-shaped area. Variances from the setback requirements are handled by the city\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals (which we will just call the zoning board since there is no other board that deals with zoning issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Sheikh could not reach a deal with the owners of the fifth lot, so in January 2009 he requested a hardship variance from the city council. The council instructed the zoning board to conduct a public hearing and make a recommendation, and Sheikh also asked the zoning board to grant setback variances. The zoning board first met informally with Sheikh and then convened the public hearing, which was continued several times at Sheikh\u2019s request so that he could address neighborhood concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Sheikh did not wait for the zoning board\u2019s decision. In January 2011 he filed the first of these lawsuits claiming that the defendants, all neighborhood residents, had voiced opposition to his building plans because of their animus to his race, religion, and national origin. Judge Dow dismissed Sheikh\u2019s first amended complaint but invited him to seek leave to file another. Sheikh submitted a new version claiming violations of the Fair Housing Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604, 3617, civil rights statutes, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-83, 1985(3), and Illinois law, but Judge Dow denied leave to amend after concluding that this proposed complaint fails to state any federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Meanwhile, in March 2011, the zoning board recommended that the city council approve a variance for undue hardship. But the board refused to alter the setback requirements after Sheikh had rejected its hint that he should seek another postponement and further modify his plans. The following month, the city council considered the zoning board\u2019s recommendation to grant Sheikh a hardship variance. A city attorney, Steven Elrod, reported that (unbeknownst to the zoning board) Sheikh had bought tax liens for the fifth lot and the redemption period had expired months ago. Because Sheikh likely could acquire that lot after all, the city council temporarily tabled the variance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Sheikh then sued Lake County and the city defendants. He claimed that the county had committed mail fraud and thus violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, by misrepresenting the suitability of the lots he purchased. He also claimed that the city and its officials had discriminated against him in violation of federal law, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-83, 3604, 3617, and likewise violated state law. Judge Der-Yeghiayan dismissed the RICO claim and many others, and afterward Sheikh sought leave to amend his complaint by dropping his RICO claim and instead alleging only that Lake County\u2019s misrepresentations about the size of his lots had violated state law. But Sheikh did not submit a proposed amended complaint, nor did he specify what state law was breached by the county\u2019s statements. After a hearing, Judge Der-Yeghiayan denied leave to amend with the explanation that supplemental jurisdiction over the new claim would be absent. The court later granted summary judgment for the city defendants on the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">On appeal Sheikh has abandoned his RICO claim by not challenging its dismissal. <em>See Brumfield v. City of Chicago, </em>735 F.3d 619, 625 (7th Cir.2013). He contends, though, that Judge Der-Yeghiayan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>should have allowed him to filed an amended complaint against the county substituting for the RICO claim a state-law claim for misrepresenting the size of his lots. Sheikh argues that the district court would have had supplemental jurisdiction over this claim, but we decline to address that argument. Sheikh\u2019s failure to submit a proposed amended complaint is enough reason to uphold the denial of leave to amend. <em>See Arlin-Golf, LLC v. Village of Arlington Heights, </em>631 F.3d 818, 823 (7th Cir.2011); <em>Hecker v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>556 F.3d 575, 590-91 (7th Cir.2009). We need not say more about Lake County.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">We turn next to Highland Park and its officials, who prevailed at summary judgment. We review that decision de novo, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to Sheikh. <em>See Ramos v. City of Chicago, </em>716 F.3d 1013, 1014 (7th Cir.2013). Sheikh contends that plenty of evidence suggests collusion by the city defendants with neighborhood residents bent on keeping him from building a home because of his race, religion, or national origin. We do not see it. Sheikh asserts that his claims are supported by e-mails and other interactions between city officials and the neighbors, yet there is nothing inherently suspicious about city officials communicating with their constituents, whatever the medium. And Sheikh points to nothing (nor do we see anything) in the e-mails suggesting unlawful discrimination behind the actions of the city officials \u2014 or, indeed, of the neighbors. Sheikh also believes that there is evidence to support a disparate-impact theory, <em>see Bloch v. Frischholz, </em>587 F.3d 771, 784 (7th Cir.2009); <em>East-Miller v. Lake Cnty. Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>421 F.3d 558, 563 (7th Cir.2005), and along these lines asserts that all comparable variance applications were granted. But this assertion must be backed by evidence that the other applications involved properties and variance requests that are \u201cidentical or directly comparable in all material respects.\u201d <em>LaBella Winnetka, Inc. v. Village of Winnetka, </em>628 F.3d 937, 942 (7th Cir.2010); <em>see also Harvey v. Town of Merrillville, </em>649 F.3d 526, 531-32 (7th Cir.2011) (finding no evidence to support allegation that residents were similarly situated). We cannot draw that conclusion based on this record. There simply is not enough evidence for a jury reasonably to find unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Sheikh also argues that Judge Der-Yeghiayan should not have dismissed a defamation claim against Elrod, the city attorney who reported that Sheikh had bought tax liens on the extra lot. That claim was dismissed on the pleadings, so we review the ruling de novo and construe the complaint in Sheikh\u2019s favor. <em>See Carmody v. Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of III, </em>747 F.3d 470, 471-72 (7th Cir.2014). Though Elrod spoke at a city council hearing, Sheikh argues that the lawyer cannot claim privilege because, on Sheikh\u2019s view, Elrod\u2019s goal was to scuttle his variance request. But setting aside that Sheikh <em>did </em>buy the tax liens, this argument gets him nowhere, for in Illinois the immunity applicable to statements made as part of legislative proceedings is absolute. <em>See Krueger v. Lewis, </em>359 Ill.App.3d 515, 295 Ill.Dec. 876, 834 N.E.2d 457, 464-65 (2005); <em>Joseph v. Collis, </em>272 Ill.App.3d 200, 208 Ill.Dec. 604, 649 N.E.2d 964, 972 (1995); <em>Baravati v. Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross, Inc., </em>28 F.3d 704, 707-08 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">All that remains is the separate lawsuit before Judge Dow against the neighborhood residents. Judge Dow concluded that the allegations in Sheikh\u2019s proposed, second amended complaint do not state plausible federal claims, and for that reason denied Sheikh\u2019s motion to amend. We review that decision only for abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>cretion. <em>See Stanard v. Nygren, </em>658 F.3d 792, 796-97 (7th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">There was no abuse of discretion, but we are puzzled that the neighborhood residents have taken us down the long road to this conclusion. Sheikh sued them because they had voiced opposition to the variances he wanted from the city council and zoning board, yet the neighbors have never mentioned the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, which would seem a significant hurdle for Sheikh. That doctrine \u201cprotects litigation, lobbying, and speech ... as an application of the first amendment\u2019s speech and petitioning clauses.\u201d <em>New West, L.P. v. City of Joliet, </em>491 F.3d 717, 722 (7th Cir.2007); <em>see also BE &amp; K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, </em>536 U.S. 516, 525, 122 S.Ct. 2390, 153 L.Ed.2d 499 (2002); <em>United Mine Workers v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 669-70, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); <em>E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 135-36, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961). Immunity under <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>applies \u201cregardless of intent or purpose.\u201d <em>Pennington, </em>381 U.S. at 670, 85 S.Ct. 1585. Although the doctrine does not apply to sham lobbying efforts, <em>see BE &amp; K Constr., </em>536 U.S. at 525-26, 122 S.Ct. 2390, that exception is irrelevant to the neighbors\u2019 zoning arguments, for the city took the lobbying seriously (and, as we already have concluded, there is no evidence that the city or its officials unlawfully discriminated against Sheikh).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In any event, as we have said, Judge Dow did not abuse his discretion because he rightly concluded that the allegations in Sheikh\u2019s proposed complaint do not state a plausible federal claim. We tackle first Sheikh\u2019s arguments related to the Fair Housing Act; he argues that his proposed complaint states a claim under \u00a7 3617, which prohibits interference with rights protected by the Fair Housing Act. We accept at this stage that Sheikh\u2019s allegations are true. The neighbors opposed his building plans and showed up in large numbers at public meetings. (Though Sheikh calls the defendants an \u201cAlliance,\u201d he does not allege that they actually were members of a neighborhood organization.) At least one person from all 37 households attended, says Sheikh, and the meetings were at times heated. Sheikh asserts that he was defamed at the hearing by (unattributed) accusations that he \u201cis after a fast buck,\u201d that \u201call he is looking for was a high-end address,\u201d and that \u201che was looking for a quick profit.\u201d He also says that the neighbors \u201ccast a shadow over\u201d his title to the property by calling his property \u201cun-buildable.\u201d Along these lines, he specifically complains that one neighbor, Joel Kagan, \u201cslandered and encumbered\u201d his title by asserting that the property is prone to flooding. Another neighbor, Oded Orbach, \u201cdisparaged the subject property\u201d by calling it \u201ca big large gutter\u201d covering an underground river.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The real impetus for this opposition, according to Sheikh, is his race, religion, and national origin, not his plans for building on the property. He reports that the neighbors made comments over the course of the dispute that reflected discriminatory views. Orbach once told him that the subdivision is \u201call white\u201d and that he did not think Sheikh would \u201cfit in.\u201d The neighbors sometimes referred to Sheikh and his family at meetings as \u201cyou people,\u201d and Hedy Barrocal suggested he move somewhere else, closer to his \u201cpeople.\u201d At one meeting, David Rabin displayed pictures of narrow houses in poor countries, sarcastically suggesting that the pictures supported the conclusion that a narrow house should be enough for Sheikh. Another time, some of the neighbors (he does not specify who) expressed worry that Sheikh would allow more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>one family to live in his house. (His two adult children will live in the house with him and his wife.) These neighbors talked about other areas in which one \u201ccolored family\u201d moving in was a prelude to being \u201cflooded by them\u201d and about how some single-family homes rented by \u201clatinos and blacks\u201d ended up housing multiple families. Sheikh also alleges that Kagan said something threatening about the house burning down if it is built. (Though accepting as true that Kagan said something threatening, Judge Dow noted that the allegations are fuzzy. Sheikh\u2019s appellate brief hardly clarifies matters; he maintains that, whatever Kagan said, it was threatening, but he explains that he \u201ccan merely speculate on that threat\u201d since only Kagan knows \u201chis true intent.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">These statements, if made, are troubling. We certainly do not condone them, and they make this case closer than the neighbors\u2019 conclusory brief might suggest. (In their appellate brief the neighborhood residents do not specifically address any of the statements Sheikh attributes to them.) But the Fair Housing Act does not reach \u201cisolated acts of discrimination by other private property owners.\u201d <em>Bloch, </em>587 F.3d at 780; <em>see also Halprin v. Prairie Homes of Dearborn Park, </em>388 F.3d 327, 330 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]e do not want, and we do not think Congress wanted, to convert every quarrel among neighbors in which a racial or religious slur is hurled into a federal case.\u201d). And, ultimately, that is the most we plausibly can glean from Sheikh\u2019s allegations. By his account, residents from 37 different households opposed his plans during a zoning dispute lasting for five years. Only twice during that time did anyone speak explicitly about race \u2014 Orbach once commented on the \u201call white\u201d neighborhood (though Sheikh does not say when Orbach made the comment, where he made it, or whether anyone else was aware of it), and another time unidentified neighbors engaged in racially tinged conversation about perceived problems in other neighborhoods. Some additional, though less explicit, statements also plausibly relate to race, religion, or national origin: Rabin\u2019s sarcastic comments about narrow houses in poor countries, unidentified neighbors calling Sheikh and his family \u201cyou people,\u201d and Barrocal\u2019s suggestion that he move closer to his \u201cpeople.\u201d But taken together, these allegations would establish only that different neighbors at different times made shameful statements, not that any individual neighbor (or the neighbors as a group) interfered with Sheikh\u2019s rights under the Fair Housing Act. <em>See Bloch, </em>587 F.3d at 783; <em>Halprin, </em>388 F.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Our conclusion is not altered by the allegation that Kagan said something threatening about Sheikh\u2019s house being burned. Sheikh\u2019s only attempt at connecting that threat to discriminatory intent is the allegation that Kagan, at a city council meeting, had declared: \u201cI don\u2019t want you here, I don\u2019t want you in my sub-division. We told you many times, why don\u2019t you listen[?]\u201d This statement does not plausibly allege discriminatory intent and, in any event, does not even appear to be what Kagan said. Sheikh\u2019s rendition of the statement was different in his first amended complaint, in which he alleged: \u201cOne member of the Alliance, Joel Kagen [sic] openly said during the Board hearings, T told you I don\u2019t want you there\u2019, (in the village of woods subdivision) and then went on to state that I have told you many time [sic], I think you don\u2019t understand that T don\u2019t want that house built.\u2019 \u201d Yet another version appears in Sheikh\u2019s appellate brief, which asserts that Kagan stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want that house built in this neighborhood.\u201d And all of these variations differ from the transcript that Sheikh made part of the record in the lawsuit against the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>defendants. According to the transcript, Kagan told Sheikh: \u201cYou are not listening. You have sat here every meeting and never listened to a word that anybody in this room says other than your own agenda. I don\u2019t want the house. I don\u2019t want you living there. I don\u2019t want the house. But I am telling you, if you listen to what these people are telling you, talk to [your lawyer], get a different architect that works with the City, and you will have a chance of having a home in Highland Park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Sheikh\u2019s failure to allege more than isolated acts of discrimination also dooms his attempt to state claims under \u00a7 1982 and \u00a7 1985(3), provisions that likewise target racially motivated interference (and conspiracies to interfere) with Sheikh\u2019s rights. <em>See Bloch, </em>587 F.3d 771 n. 5; <em>Gallagher v. Magner, </em>619 F.3d 823, 839 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Sheikh\u2019s remaining contentions also fail. First, claims under \u00a7 1983 must be brought against state actors, <em>see American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999); <em>Reynolds v. Jamison, </em>488 F.3d 756, 764 (7th Cir.2007), but Sheikh alleges, at most, that the neighbors knew the city officials well and lobbied hard against the variances (and that some city officials shared their views on zoning requirements). Successful lobbying, though, does not turn the neighbors into state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Second, \u00a7 1981 requires plausible allegations of a contract (or a proposed contract), <em>see Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>546 U.S. 470, 479-80, 126 S.Ct. 1246, 163 L.Ed.2d 1069 (2006); <em>Gonzalez v. Ingersoll Mill. Mach. Co., </em>133 F.3d 1025, 1034 (7th Cir.1998), but Sheikh does not plausibly allege that a contract was (or was about to be) in play. He attempts to make up for this shortcoming by saying in his appellate brief that \u201c[i]t is a common practice of the Zoning Boards, that a lot of times, the developers or the home owners enter into contracts with the Zoning Boards.\u201d Yet this follow-up explanation is also inadequate; it does not say that there actually was a proposed contract here or even that the city makes it \u201ca common practice\u201d to enter into zoning contracts with homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">One final issue: The neighbors ask, at the end of their response brief, that we \u201cconsider awarding [them] their attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d under 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 1988. The entire litigation was frivolous, they say, and was intended to \u201csilence\u201d their zoning objections, so they want to recoup all fees reasonably incurred during the litigation or, at least, during this appeal. But they cannot get fees for litigating in the district court because they failed to file a motion for fees before Judge Dow. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(B) (providing that party requesting attorney\u2019s fees has 14 days from entry of judgment to file motion); <em>Bender v. Freed, </em>436 F.3d 747, 750 (7th Cir.2006) (ruling that motion for fees filed after 14-day deadline was untimely). As for appellate fees, apart from asserting that the lawsuit is entirely frivolous \u2014 an overreach in any event \u2014 the neighbors have not attempted to explain why they ought to recoup anything. <em>See Fox v. Vice, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2205, 2215, 180 L.Ed.2d 45 (2011) (\u201cSection 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim.\u201d). And to top it off, their inadequate request comes at the end of a conclusory brief that does little to elucidate the issues before us \u2014 failing even to specifically address the troubling statements that Sheikh alleges or to discuss the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
