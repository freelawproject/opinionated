He insists that his within-guidelines prison term is excessive because, he asserts, the district court erroneously concluded that he intended to commit harm with the devices. But the court\u2019s finding is supported by evidence introduced at sentencing by the government, plus the court adequately considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and explained its reasons for imposing the sentence. We thus affirm Stanton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">In March 2013 authorities received an anonymous letter warning that Stanton (who was 18 years old at the time) was building bombs at his house in Lebanon, Illinois. The following month authorities searched the house and discovered various bomb-making materials. Stanton was charged with violating \u00a7 5861(d), and he pleaded guilty in August 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">At the sentencing hearing in December 2013, the district court calculated a total offense level of 19, which includes upward adjustments of 2 levels because the offense involved a destructive device, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(3)(B), and 2 more levels because the number of devices was at least 3 but fewer than 8, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A), less 3 levels for accepting responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. After taking into account Stanton\u2019s criminal history category of I, the district court calculated an imprisonment range of 30 to 37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">In advocating a within-guidelines sentence, the government called an FBI agent to testify at sentencing about the anonymous letter and the items discovered at Stanton\u2019s house. The letter, sent by a resident of Lebanon, describes Stanton as a \u201cmentally disturbed teenager\u201d who had \u201cbooby-trapped\u201d his bedroom, and flaunted \u201chand grenade\u201d type objects on his front lawn. The writer asked police to intervene to \u201cprevent a potential violent crime\u201d like the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">According to the agent, authorities searched Stanton\u2019s home with his father\u2019s permission while Stanton was at school. The agent testified that authorities had found in Stanton\u2019s bedroom instructions on utilizing nails in making explosive devices plus, in the basement, a number of rusty nails. The search also had unearthed documents that discussed \u201cSpecific Ideas of Where and How to Hide Things From Your Parents\u201d and \u201cThe Ten Commandments of Revenge.\u201d Another document lists essential items for an \u201canarchy bag,\u201d including bombs made from empty C02 cartridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">Authorities discovered in Stanton\u2019s house several notebooks filled with sketches and handwritten notes. Although Stanton did not tell investigators that he wrote what is in the notebooks, his attorney conceded the point. Writings in one notebook explain how to \u201csend a ear to hell\u201d using \u201cC02 bombs\u201d and gasoline-soaked rags stuffed into the exhaust pipe. That same notebook includes instructions on making \u201cmailbox bombs,\u201d exploding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>light bulbs, fertilizer bombs, Molotov cocktails, napalm, bottle bombs, \u201cnail grenades,\u201d and \u201ctennis ball bombs.\u201d Many of these handwritten instructions include pointers on maximizing the shrapnel and other means of harming people with homemade bombs. Authorities also discovered a handgun and ammunition in the basement, a large machete in Stanton\u2019s bedroom, and elsewhere in the house, empty C02 cartridges, gunpowder, fuses, metal shavings, and two Molotov cocktails.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">According to the FBI agent, another of Stanton\u2019s notebooks, which is titled \u201cDeath Attack,\u201d includes this handwritten note: \u2018You stabbed me in the back, wearing my dog like a pelt. I didn\u2019t want to say this but I\u2019m going to kill you anyway.\u201d In a third notebook Stanton had sketched swastikas and written homophobic, antiSemitic, and other hateful language.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In the presentence investigation report, the probation officer recounts the events after Stanton\u2019s house was searched. The authorities placed Stanton\u2019s high school on lockdown after discovering the explosive devices at his house but found nothing more on campus. Stanton was transported to the police station, and during an interview he described himself as a \u201cmad man.\u201d Stanton admitted making C02 bombs, napalm, and Molotov cocktails and detonating the explosive devices outside his house. He also conceded interacting with white supremacist organizations from age 15 until he was 18. Six of Stanton\u2019s classmates confirmed that he had made bombs, sometimes in ways intended to increase the shrapnel. They noted Stanton\u2019s dislike for minority groups but opined that he had not intended to hurt anyone. Stanton\u2019s father reported to authorities that his son and his friends often played video games, shot firearms, and dismantled ammunition to make bombs. Stanton\u2019s former step-mother told authorities that he had gotten \u201cout of control with his racist beliefs\u201d after meeting a former member of a white supremacist organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The probation officer also related that, according to a classmate, Stanton had warned repeatedly in the fall of 2012 that he \u201cwould kill O\u2019Fallon High School students.\u201d Although Stanton never disclosed a specific plan, he had bragged that his part-time job as a school janitor gave him access to the school\u2019s ventilation system and roof. The student had reported Stanton\u2019s statements to the school counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">After defense counsel had conceded the accuracy of the presentence report and the government had highlighted the items discovered at Stanton\u2019s house, the government argued for a prison sentence of 33 months. Although Stanton had not harmed anyone, the prosecutor asserted that his intent to do so was evident from the record. Stanton\u2019s attorney countered that the defendant should be sentenced to time served plus supervised release or probation. The lawyer disputed that Stanton had intended harm and claimed instead that the defendant had become obsessed with the fantasy warfare video games he played with his friends and had tried to replicate devices seen in those games. And though acknowledging Stanton\u2019s description of himself as a \u201cmad man,\u201d his attorney opined that Stanton had meant he was \u201cintensely enthusiastic about his interests and hobbies.\u201d Stanton\u2019s attorney also asserted that the notebook containing racial epithets was four years old, and that, \u201cbecause of his stage of life,\u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to make good decisions was not fully developed when he committed his offense, although his ability will improve with age.\u201d His attorney insisted that Stanton does not exhibit the typical personality traits associated with criminal behavior; he enjoyed a stable relationship with his father, worked two part-time jobs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and planned to marry his girlfriend, who recently had given birth to their child. But nothing the lawyer said to explain Stanton\u2019s bomb-making activities is supported by evidence, not even testimony from the defendant. Stanton did speak at sentencing and said he regretted his actions, but he did not offer a motive or corroborate anything his lawyer had said in his sentencing memorandum or in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Before announcing Stanton\u2019s sentence the district court discussed the nature and circumstances of the offense. The judge highlighted evidence that Stanton possessed instructions for making destructive devices and using them against people, harbored hatred for minority groups, and had unrestricted access to his high school through his janitorial position. That evidence, the court reasoned, allowed a reasonable inference that Stanton \u201cplanned to do something destructive with these materials rather than simply blowing them up to watch them.\u201d The district court concluded that Stanton had intended to cause harm with the destructive devices and sentenced him to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release with a special condition mandating mental-health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On appeal Stanton first contends that the district court committed clear error in finding that he intended to commit harm with his homemade devices. Stanton asserts that the only reasonable inference from the entirety of the evidence is that he possessed the destructive devices for recreational purposes. The district court\u2019s conclusion rests on speculation, Stanton insists, because his father and former stepmother had told authorities that he and his friends regularly played video games and participated in military-style exercises, and his friends had opined that Stanton did not intend harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">But district courts have \u201c \u2018discretion to draw conclusions about the testimony given and evidence introduced at sentencing,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Holliday, </em>672 F.3d 462, 475 (7th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>628 F.3d 394, 400 (7th Cir.2010)), and we reverse only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made,\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>737 F.3d 1121, 1142 (7th Cir.2013) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. CruzRea, </em>626 F.3d 929, 938 (7th Cir.2010). The government presented sufficient evidence at sentencing to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Stanton intended harm. Although authorities did not uncover a specific plot to harm others, Stanton\u2019s notebooks describe how to use the destructive devices against individuals. In one notebook Stanton explains how to build a bomb with a tennis ball and adds, \u201c[W]hen you see a geek walking down the street, give it a good throw, he will have a blast.\u201d In that same notebook Stanton explains how to fill a light bulb with napalm and recommends inserting it \u201cinto a socket frequently used by the victim\u201d so that when he \u201cflips the switch, he will be in for a big surprise.\u201d None of this sounds \u201crecreational,\u201d and yet Stanton did not testify at sentencing or offer any other evidence concerning his motivation for making destructive devices or his handwritten ideas for what to do with those devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Stanton\u2019s notebooks reflect that he harbored hatred toward several minority groups. He not only referred to these groups in derogatory terms but also wrote about causing them harm. And though Stanton\u2019s attorney insisted in the district court, and repeats to us, that Stanton\u2019s hateful thoughts of hurting minorities had been written several years earlier, Stanton himself did not back up his lawyer\u2019s claim about the age of his disparaging writings. Again, what is missing is <em>evidence. See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>United States v. Vidal, </em>705 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir.2013) (explaining that sentencing courts need not respond to arguments in mitigation which lack factual basis); <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>694 F.3d 908, 914 (7th Cir.2012) (explaining that attorney\u2019s representations are not evidence); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>533 F.3d 574, 578 (7th Cir.2008) (same). Moreover, counsel sidestepped that Stanton kept the notebook, which undercut the lawyer\u2019s implication that the defendant had matured and moved beyond his offensive beliefs. Indeed, Stanton\u2019s former step-mother confirmed that he was \u201cout of control with his racist beliefs,\u201d and Stanton himself admitted that he still was interacting with white supremacist organizations at 18 (his age at the time of his arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Stanton also contends that no matter what he intended to do with his destructive devices, his 30-month prison term exceeds what\u2019s necessary to serve the sentencing goals under \u00a7 3553(a). But this within-guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable, <em>see United States v. Cheek, </em>740 F.3d 440, 455 (7th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Diekemper, </em>604 F.3d 345, 355 (7th Cir.2010), and the district court adequately connected the sentence to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district judge noted the serious nature of Stanton\u2019s offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and concluded that the defendant intended to use his homemade bombs to inflict harm. Discussing the need to protect the public, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(c), the district judge stated, \u201cI simply can\u2019t in good conscience leave this young man on the street at this point.\u201d And the judge noted that 30 months was appropriate to send a \u201cloud and clear message\u201d to Stanton so that he could \u201cunderstand the seriousness of all of his actions.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
