Oct. 25, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). When the BIA considers relevant evidence of country conditions in evaluating a motion to reopen, we review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-19\">An alien may file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Deshati\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely because it was filed more than three years after the agency\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), there is no time limitation for filing a motion to reopen if it is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>discovered or presented at the previous proceeding,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). We find no error in the BIA\u2019s determination that Deshati failed to demonstrate materially changed country conditions excusing the untimely filing of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As an initial matter, because the BIA explicitly considered the evidence submitted with Deshati\u2019s motion, and compared it with the evidence in the record at the time of his hearing, the record does not compellingly suggest that the BIA failed to adequately consider the full record and Deshati\u2019s due process claim is without merit. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dept, of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336-38 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Matter ofSY-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 253 (B.I.A.2007) (\u201cIn determining whether evidence accompanying a motion to reopen demonstrates a material change in country conditions that would justify reopening, [the BIA] compare[s] the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below.\u201d). Furthermore, the BIA reasonably concluded that the country conditions evidence Deshati submitted failed to demonstrate materially changed country conditions because that evidence demonstrated continued political violence in Albania, and did not indicate that conditions had materially worsened since Deshati\u2019s 2007 hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 171-72; <em>Matter of S-YG-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 253. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Deshati\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this peti-</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">tion is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
