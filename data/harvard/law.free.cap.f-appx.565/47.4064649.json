Jan. 29, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). An alien seeking to reopen proceedings is required to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered and may file only one such motion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Chen\u2019s 2012 motion was untimely and number barred because he filed two prior motions to reopen and his order of removal became final in 2007. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B). Chen contends, however, that his recent conversion to Christianity in the United States and worsened treatment of Christians in China constitute materially changed conditions excusing his motion from the applicable time and number limitations. He also argues that the attorney who filed his second motion to reopen rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reopening due to Chen\u2019s failure to support his motion with an application for relief. The applicable regulation makes clear that an appropriate application for relief is mandatory, not permissive. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\u201d); <em>Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, </em>639 F.3d 751, 757 (7th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Chen\u2019s contention that the BIA erred by requiring evidence of changed conditions in his home province of Fujian is misplaced because he bore the burden of supporting his motion with \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). <em>Cf. Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 148-49, 160-62 (2d Cir.2008) (stating that where enforcement of a policy varies, it is the applicant\u2019s burden to show a well-founded fear of persecution in his locality in China). Chen does not <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Lastly, the BIA did not err by declining to address Chen\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Ineffective assistance of counsel may toll the 90-day time limitation on motions to reopen if the movant has exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d in pursuing his claim throughout the entire period sought to be tolled. <em>See Rashid v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 127, 130-31 (2d Cir.2008). However, Chen\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, even if credited, could not furnish a basis for tolling the 90-day time limitation because his attorney\u2019s allegedly deficient representation did not commence until 2009 \u2014 well after the 90-day period had expired. Chen\u2019s assertion that the BIA erred by declining to reopen his proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>is also misplaced because his motion did not request <em>sua sponte </em>reopening, which, in any event, we generally lack jurisdiction to review. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007) (recognizing that issue exhaustion is a mandatory, although not jurisdictional, requirement); <em>see also Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 518 (holding that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s \u201centirely discretionary\u201d decision to decline to reopen proceedings <em>sua </em>sponte).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
