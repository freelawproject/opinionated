Leftridge, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint and denying his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Leftridge v. Matthews, </em>No. 1:11-cv-03499ELH (D.Md. filed Sept. 30, 2013, entered Oct. 1, 2013; filed Oct. 10, 2013, entered Oct. 11, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions \u00e1re adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"APL\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
