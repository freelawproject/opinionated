Mr. Lazaro\u2019s case returns to us after we remanded it to Board for a decision on the merits. <em>Lazaro v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>666 F.3d 1316, 1321 (Fed.Cir.2012). On remand, the Board found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA or the agency) properly considered all of the appellant\u2019s experience under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.302(d) and correctly determined that he was not qualified for the position he sought. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">On August 10, 2009, Mr. Lazaro, a preference eligible veteran, applied for an Information Technology (IT) specialist position with the Miami VA Healthcare System. The vacancy announcement for this position described its \u201cqualification requirements\u201d as \u201c[o]ne (1) year [of] spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>cialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in [the] Federal Service.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Joint Appendix (R.A.) 63. The announcement also stipulated that certain levels of education could be substituted for this year of \u201cspecialized experience,\u201d namely, a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree, or three full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214(b), Mr. Lazaro was eligible for certain veterans\u2019 preferences. Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application stated that he had six months of experience as a medical coder at the GS-7 level with collateral duties as an assistant Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His application also specified that he had fifty-three credits of relevant educational experience. Finally, in the \u201cOther Qualifications\u201d section of his application, Mr. Lazaro indicated that he had experience as a \u201cComputer Repair Tech[nician]\u201d and had received \u201cvarious incentive awards.\u201d R.A. 32. The Human Resources Specialist who reviewed Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application concluded that his experiences and education level fell short of the full year of specialized experience at the GS-9 level, or the educational equivalent thereof, necessary for the IT Specialist position. Accordingly, on September 2, 2009, Mr. Lazaro was informed by letter that he was not considered for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">On August 30, 2010, after exhausting his rights before the Department of Labor, Mr. Lazaro filed an appeal with the Board, asserting that the VA violated 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214(b) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.302(d) when it did not select him for the position of IT specialist. The Administrative Judge (AJ) concluded that the Board lacked authority to review the merits of the agency\u2019s non-selection of Mr. Lazaro. The Board affirmed, and Mr. Lazaro appealed to this court. Reversing, we explained that \u201c[t]here is simply no way to analyze whether a veteran\u2019s preference rights were violated without examining the grounds upon which the veteran\u2019s non-selection was predicated.\u201d <em>Lazaro, </em>666 F.3d at 1320. We then remanded Mr. Lazaro\u2019s case to the Board for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">On remand, the Board allowed the parties to submit supplemental evidence and argument regarding the propriety of the agency\u2019s determination. The government submitted an additional declaration from the Human Resources Specialist that reviewed Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application, and Mr. Lazaro submitted additional documentation of his qualifications for the position at issue \u2014 documentation which he did not include in his original application. On November 15, 2012, after reviewing the additional information presented, the Board denied Mr. Lazaro\u2019s petition for review. The Board concluded that the declaration of the Human Recourses Specialist was credible, and \u201cany asserted prior experience that the appellant raised for the first time on appeal\u201d was \u201cirrelevant because the appellant did not include it in his application for the position.\u201d R.A. 10. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Lazaro filed an appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Lazaro\u2019s petition unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">As we explained in our previous decision, the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, Pub.L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, gives preference eligible veterans certain advantages when seeking federal employment. <em>Lazaro, </em>666 F.3d at 1318 (citing <em>Mitchell v. Cohen, </em>333 U.S. 411, 418-19, 68 S.Ct. 518, 92 L.Ed. 774 (1948)). In particular, agencies must comply with special statutes and regulations when determining whether a particular veteran is qualified for a given position. <em>See Kirkendall v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>573 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed.Cir.2009); <em>Phillips v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>110 M.S.P.R. 184, 189 (2008). For example, when experience is a factor in determining qualification for a posted position, a preference eligible veteran is entitled to be credited for all of his valuable experience, including experience gained \u201cin religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.302(d); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3311(2) (\u201cIn examinations for the competitive service in which experience is an element of qualification, a preference eligible is entitled to credit ... for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor.\u201d). If an agency hiring decision violates these rights, preference eligible veterans may secure relief by filing a claim challenging the agency\u2019s decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">In this case, only one qualification is at issue: whether Mr. Lazaro possesses \u201c[o]ne (1) year [of] specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in [the] Federal Service [or the educational equivalent thereof].\u201d R.A. 63. Mr. Lazaro continues to argue that the VA did not comply with 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.302(d) in determining his qualifications, and therefore violated his opportunity to compete for the IT Specialist position under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">During the remand proceedings, the agency submitted an additional declaration from the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application and accompanying documents, John Mon-dragon. The declaration averred that Mr. Mondragon fully reviewed Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application, including Mr. Lazaro\u2019s six months of experience as a medical coder, his experience as an assistant ADPAC, his various awards, and his experience as a Medical Specialist in the Army. Mr. Mon-dragon also examined Mr. Lazaro\u2019s educational achievements, including his certification of completion for a VA Learning University (VALU) Course for Basic Networking and 53 hours of study at Miami Dade College. Despite these achievements, Mr. Mondragon ultimately concluded that Mr. Lazaro was \u201cunable to substitute education ... for experience.\u201d R.A. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The Board found that Mr. Mondragon\u2019s declaration constituted a \u201cdetailed and persuasive explanation as to why he found the appellant not qualified for the position.\u201d R.A. 9. Relying on Mr. Mondragon\u2019s statement as well as other evidence, the Board held that the agency properly \u201ccredited and considered all of the valuable experience reflected in the appellant\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>plication for the position,\u201d R.A. 9, and \u201cproperly determined, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.302(d), that [Mr. Lazaro] was not qualified for the position.\u201d R.A. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Mr. Lazaro has not submitted any evidence contradicting these findings. The Board\u2019s finding that the declaration is credible and indicates that the agency considered all of Mr. Lazaro\u2019s relevant experience in accordance with \u00a7 302.302(d) is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Mr. Lazaro also argues that the Board erroneously rejected as irrelevant evidence of Mr. Lazaro\u2019s qualifications that he failed to submit with his original job application but presented to the Board on appeal. Specifically, Mr. Lazaro contends that the Board should have considered a certificate for 600 hours of work experience as a microcomputer technician that he presented on appeal to the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government argues that this document should not be considered because Mr. Lazaro failed to submit it with his application for the position at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Mr. Lazaro asserts that he did not submit the certificate documenting his 600 hours of work as a microcomputer technician with his application because the government form he completed to apply for the IT Specialist position, Form 612, instructed him not to send documentation unless requested. Form 612 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">Other Qualification: Job-related training courses (give title and year). Job-related skills (other languages, computer software/hardware, tools, machinery, typing speed, etc.). Job-related honors, awards, and special accomplishments (publication, membership in professional/honor societies, leadership activities, public speaking and performance awards). <em>Give dates, but do not send documents unless requested.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">R.A. 32 (emphasis added). Based on these directions, Lazaro simply wrote \u201cComputer Repair Tech., Basic Networking, Various Incentive Awards,\u201d R.A. 32, in the space directly below these instructions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He now contends that he \u201cwas never afforded the opportunity to submit all of his additional supporting documents because he was following the instructions stated on Form 612[ ] Section G \u2018Do not send your documentation unless requested.\u2019\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Neither the agency nor the Board is required to consider work experience that the veteran did not describe in accordance with the agency\u2019s instructions in his application. Form 612 provided Mr. Lazaro with sufficient opportunity to describe his 600 hours of work as a computer technician and, indeed, expressly requested that he list the dates of such experience. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>spite these instructions, Mr. Lazaro failed to communicate the nature and length of his work experience in a way that would enable an official reviewing his application to evaluate it. Although Form 612 requests that the applicant not send documentation unless requested, this instruction does not excuse the appellant\u2019s failure to provide an adequate description of his relevant experiences and the corresponding dates. The agency\u2019s decision not to hire Mr. Lazaro must be evaluated based on the information he provided to the agency. The government was not required to investigate Mr. Lazaro\u2019s perfunctory and dateless description of his \u201cother qualifications.\u201d R.A. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Finally, Mr. Lazaro appears to contest the qualifications of the veteran who eventually received the IT Specialist position. The qualifications of the veteran whom the agency hired are irrelevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\">. Mr. Lazaro\u2019s assistant ADPAC position does not appear to have possessed a specific GS level designation, but he contends that this position carried a designation equivalent to the GS-9 level. According to the Human Resources Specialist that reviewed Mr. Lazaro\u2019s application, \"there is no grade level requirement for a service\u2019s designated ADPAC, nor are the duties classified at any particular grade level.\u201d R.A. 28. Nevertheless, Mr. Lazaro contends that other services, such as the Fiscal Service, do designate a GS level for their ADPACs: \"appellant submits two promotion announcements of Fiscal Systems Analyst[s], showing that in the Fiscal Service they designate ADPAC[s] at the GS-9 level.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 15. Mr. Lazaro has not submitted further evidence that his particular ADPAC position was designated at the GS-9 level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. Mr. Lazaro also argues that the Board should consider documents relating to qualifications Mr. Lazaro received after he applied for the position at issue as well as documents he submitted for the first time in the present appeal. Documents relating to qualifications Mr. Lazaro received after his application for the IT Specialist position are irrelevant evidence. Documents that were not submitted to the Board during the remand, but instead submitted directly to this court on appeal, are also irrelevant. <em>See Turman-Kent v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>657 F.3d 1280, 1283 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\"Because those items were not presented to the Board, they are not part of the record on appeal and are not properly before us.\u201d); <em>Mueller v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>76 F.3d 1198, 1201-02 (Fed.Cir.1996) (\"Because we are limited to reviewing decisions of the Board based on the record before the deciding official, we decline to base our judgment on evidence that was not part of the record before the administrative judge.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\">.
