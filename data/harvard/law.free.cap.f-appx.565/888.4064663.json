The district court held that James T. lacked standing because he was not the sole owner of the patent and his co-owner did not join the suit. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">James T. is the inventor of U.S. Patent No. 5,806,566, which is directed to a \u201cstorm drainage conduit plug and sealing band therefor.\u201d U.S. Patent No. 5,806,566 (\u2019566 patent) [54] (title). The invention is essentially an elastic plug that fits into the open end of a storm drainage conduit or sewer pipe. The patent explains that such a plug is often necessary to prevent dirt and debris from entering the pipe opening during installation at a construction site. James T. is the inventor of several patents in this area, including at least three granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and one granted by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">At the time James T. obtained the \u2019566 patent, he was married to a woman named Mary Louisa Taylor (Mary T.). The marriage began in 1987 and lasted until 2011. The end of the marriage was marked by a contentious divorce in which the parties disputed many issues, including property ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">As part of its final judgment dissolving the marriage, the Florida circuit court ordered an equitable distribution of marital property. Under Florida law, divorce courts have authority to divide marital assets unequally if the court determines that an unequal distribution is warranted by certain equitable considerations. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 61.075(1). Assets acquired by either spouse during the marriage are presumed to be marital assets subject to equitable distribution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 61.075(6)(a)(1)(a), (8). These may include patents. <em>See Gulbrandsen v. Gulbrandsen, </em>22 So.3d 640, 644 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (\u201c[A] patent is personal property that may be the subject of equitable distribution when the inventor and his or her spouse dissolve their marriage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">The circuit court found that the Taylors\u2019 main assets were the pipe plug patents, which were marital property subject to equitable distribution. Based on its assessment of the equities, the court ordered that proceeds \u201cfrom the production of the patents\u201d be split unequally, with 60% go<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ing to Mary T. and 40% to James T.J.A. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">On April 9, 2012, James T. filed this suit against Taylor Made Plastics, Inc. (Taylor Made), alleging infringement of the \u2019566 patent. The complaint alleged that James T. \u201cowned the patent throughout the period of the defendant\u2019s infringing acts and still owns the patent.\u201d J.A. 22. Taylor Made moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that James T. lacked standing because Mary T. was a coowner of the \u2019566 patent by virtue of the divorce, and she had not joined the suit. The district court dismissed the complaint on April 29, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">James T. appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which transferred the case to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). We review the dismissal for lack of standing de novo. <em>Fieldturf Inc. v. Sw. Recreational Indus., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1266, 1268 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The long-established rule is that a suit for patent infringement must join all co-owners of the patent as plaintiffs. <em>Waterman v. Mackenzie, </em>138 U.S. 252, 255, 11 S.Ct. 334, 34 L.Ed. 923 (1891). If any co-owner should refuse to join as a co-plaintiff, the suit must be dismissed for lack of standing. <em>Id.; see also Ethicon, Inc. v. U. S. Surgical Corp., </em>135 F.3d 1456, 1468 (Fed.Cir.1998). But a party is not co-owner of a patent for standing purposes merely because he or she holds an equitable interest in the patent. <em>Arachnid, Inc. v. Merit Indus., Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1574, 1578-82 (Fed.Cir.1991). Rather, a co-owner must hold legal title to the patent. <em>Id. </em>at 1579 (citing <em>Crown Die &amp; Tool Co. v. Nye Tool &amp; Mach. Works, </em>261 U.S. 24, 40-41, 43 S.Ct. 254, 67 L.Ed. 516 (1923)). Legal title vests initially in the inventor, and passes to others only through assignment or other effective legal transfer. <em>Id. </em>at 1578 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Before the district court, James T. argued that Mary T. was not the owner of legal title to the \u2019566 patent, but he does not press that argument on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, James T. argues in his brief that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint because Mary T. either (1) joined the suit as a co-plaintiff by participating in mediation or (2) waived participation in the suit by entering an agreement with James T. These arguments need not be discussed in detail, as they are stated only in a cursory fashion without any supporting facts. It is enough to note that James T. has the burden of establishing standing, <em>Sicom Sys., Ltd. v. Agilent Techs., Inc., </em>427 F.3d 971, 976 (Cir.2005), and that he has failed to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. In fact, James T.\u2019s appellate brief appears to concede that Mary T. is a co-owner of the patent. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 1 (\"Please rule on the Lower Court\u2019s ruling and confirm that by virtue of the lower Court James Taylor and Mary Louisa Taylor are the owners of said patent mentioned in lawsuit.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
