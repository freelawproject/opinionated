He appeals the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing crack offenses and based on the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) of 2010, which amended the statutory penalties under \u00a7 841(b), and which the Supreme Court held applied retroactively to defendants sentenced after the effective date of the FSA in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Citing <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), Warner argues that although he pleaded guilty to a specific sentence of 144 months of imprisonment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), he may seek a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-25\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, 572 </em>F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with guideline interpretations reviewed de novo, and findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, 587 </em>F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant is hot eligible for a reduction if a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment, (n. 1(A)). Warner was determined to be a career offender, and his guideline range was based on the career offender guidelines. We have held that \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court held that defendants who were sentenced pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were not categorically precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2692-95. However, even if Warner is not categorically barred from a sentence reduction because of his Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, nothing in <em>Freeman </em>concerns defendants sentenced as career offenders or alters our holding in <em>Anderson. </em>Warner\u2019s reduced sentence remained based on his career offender status. <em>See United States v. Battle, </em>504 Fed.Appx. 326, 327 (5th Cir.2012) (affirming denial of \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion because defendant\u2019s sentence resulting from a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement remained based on his career offender status).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In addition, Warner seeks to reduce his sentence based on <em>Dorsey </em>and the lower statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums held to apply to those sentenced after the effective date of the FSA. Warner was sentenced after the effective date of the FSA. However, even if his career offender guideline range had been based on the post-FSA statutory sentencing range, his sentence of 144 months under the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement would still have been based, to the extent it could be said to be based on the guidelines, on the career offender guidelines. Warner would still be ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. Warner\u2019s arguments about comparable percentage-based reductions under \u00a7 1B1.10 are not relevant because he is not eligible for a reduction as a result of an amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Although Warner seeks a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on a new statutory sentencing range, he cites no authority which would authorize the district court to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on that basis. Nothing in <em>Dorsey </em>changes our precedent that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not plenary re-sentencings. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>716 F.3d 180, 181-82 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 439, 187 L.Ed.2d 295 (2013). Section \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s application is limited to sentences \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825-26, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Warner\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
