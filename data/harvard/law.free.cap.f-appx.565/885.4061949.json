Miller appeals a final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirming a decision by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cboard\u201d) denying referral for an extra-schedular rating for otitis media. <em>See Miller v. Shinseki, </em>No. 11-1291, 2012 WL 3711922 (Vet.App. Aug. 29, 2012) <em>(\u201cVeterans Court Decision </em>\u201d). We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-24\">The scope of our review of decisions from the Veterans Court is limited by statute. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. We have jurisdiction to review such decisions with respect to a \u201cchallenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(c). We are precluded, however, from reviewing factual determinations or the application of law to fact \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that an appeal ... presents a constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>see Conway v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-25\">On appeal, Miller argues that he is entitled to referral for an extra-schedular rat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ing for chronic otitis media for the period from May 28, 1999 to April 18, 2001. He contends that the board misinterpreted this court\u2019s decision in <em>Roberson v. Principi, </em>251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2001), when it determined that referral for an extraschedular rating was unwarranted. In Miller\u2019s view, <em>Roberson </em>required the board to consider his entitlement to an extra-schedular rating under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.321(b)(1), even though he did not specifically request such a rating. The board, however, did in fact consider whether Miller was entitled to referral for an extraschedular rating for chronic otitis media. A. 25. It noted that \u201c[i]n exceptional cases, where schedular evaluations are found to be inadequate, the [Regional Office] or Board may refer a claim\u201d for consideration, pursuant to section 3.321(b)(1), for evaluation for an extra-schedular rating. A. 24. The board determined, however, that Miller\u2019s \u201csymptomatology and limitation of functioning [were] reasonably contemplated by the rating schedule\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence that his otitis media ha[d] independently caused marked interference with his employment ... beyond that contemplated by his assigned 10 percent schedular rating.\u201d A. 25. The board\u2019s conclusion that the rating schedule adequately addressed Miller\u2019s disability and that his chronic otitis media did not cause marked interference with his ability to maintain employment is a factual determination which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>See Bastien v. Shinseki, </em>599 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2010) (emphasizing that this court lacks authority to review the board\u2019s \u201cevaluation and weighing of evidence\u201d); <em>see also Madden v. Gober, </em>125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed.Cir.1997) (explaining that the board has \u201cauthority to discount the weight and probity of evidence in the light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Miller also asserts that the board failed to comply with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(d)(1) by \u201cignoring]\u201d evidence supporting his claim of unemployability in the period between May 28, 1999 and April 18, 2001. Simply because the board did not discuss every piece of evidence in the record, however, does not establish that it did not consider such evidence in determining that Miller\u2019s chronic otitis media \u2014 which was the only condition for which he had been granted service connection prior to April 2001 \u2014 did not cause a marked interference with employment. <em>See Gonzales v. West, </em>218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201c[A]bsent specific evidence indicating otherwise, all evidence contained in the record at the time of the [Regional Office\u2019s] determination of the service connection must be presumed to have been reviewed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and no further proof of such review is needed.\u201d). While the board\u2019s decision does not specifically discuss all of the evidence presented by Miller, \u201c[t]here is a presumption that [the Department of Veterans Affairs] considered all of the evidence of record,\u201d and the mere failure by the board to discuss a particular piece of evidence is insufficient to rebut that presumption. <em>Newhouse v. Nicholson, </em>497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Miller further contends that the Veterans Court misinterpreted section 3.321(b)(1) when it failed to recognize that \u201cmarked interference with employment\u201d and \u201cfrequent periods of hospitalization\u201d are two separate factors that can independently support referral for an extraschedular rating. Examination of the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, however, makes clear that the court did not interpret, or otherwise elaborate upon the meaning of, section 3.321(b)(1). Nothing in the court\u2019s opinion suggests that \u201cmarked interference with employment\u201d and \u201cfrequent periods of hospitalization\u201d are not separate factors that can independently support re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ferral for an extra-schedular rating. To the contrary, the Veterans Court specifically stated that \u201c[i]f the [Regional Office] or Board determines first that the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the claimant\u2019s level of disability and symptomatology, and next that the disability picture exhibits other related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the case must be referred to an authorized official to determine whether, to accord justice, an extra-schedular rating is warranted.\u201d <em>Veterans Court Decision, </em>2012 WL 3711922, at *2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Miller\u2019s appeal \u2014 although framed as a challenge to legal determinations made by the board and the Veterans Court \u2014 in reality presents only challenges to factual determinations and the application of settled law to the facts of his case. Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
