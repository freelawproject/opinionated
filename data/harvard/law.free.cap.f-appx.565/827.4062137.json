Bain argues that the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing to prove his claim that his trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance rendered his guilty plea involuntary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Two standards of review govern this appeal. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of an evidentiary hearing for a motion to vacate. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). And we review <em>de novo </em>the mixed question of law and fact whether counsel was ineffective. <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>504 F.3d 1203, 1206 n. 4 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"AD_\">A movant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the district court \u201c[u]nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). If the movant alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, the district court should order an evidentiary hearing. <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-15. But a district court need not hold an evidentiary hearing where the movant\u2019s allegations \u201care affirmatively contradicted by the record, or the claims are patently frivolous ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715. The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity,\u201d and \u201c[t]he subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1629, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bain an evidentiary hearing to prove that his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance rendered his guilty plea involuntary. Before accepting Bain\u2019s plea, the district court conducted a thorough plea colloquy during which Bain, under oath, admitted his guilt of the offense and expressed his satisfaction with the advice of his counsel. On collateral review, the district court was entitled to presume that Bain\u2019s earlier sworn statements during the plea hearing were true. During his plea hearing, Bain admitted that counsel discussed his plea agreement with him and that he understood that he faced a harsher punishment if he rejected the plea offer. And Bain\u2019s later testimony \u2014 that defense counsel advised him that a jury would have difficulty believing his assertion of lack of knowledge \u2014 confirmed that his plea was both knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
