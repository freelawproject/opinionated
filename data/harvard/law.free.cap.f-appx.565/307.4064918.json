The 240-month sentence was an upward departure from the original advisory Sentencing Guidelines range (130-162 months), but less than the statutory maximum (960 months). The sentencing court based this departure on the underrepresentation of Dupre\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">Dupre contends the court abused its discretion in denying his sentence-reduction motion because it described incorrectly both the percentage increase of the upward departure and the applicable statutory maximum, and failed to consider his post-sentence efforts at rehabilitation alongside his prison disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">The district court\u2019s decision on a sentence-reduction motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; its application of the advisory Guidelines, <em>de novo. United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may reduce a term of imprisonment \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d. 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). Application notes to the Guidelines policy statement direct courts to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as public safety consequences, and state: \u201cThe court may consider post-sentencing conduct ... in determining ... [w]hether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. (1)(B)(i)-(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-24\">In its order denying the sentence reduction, the court described the original sentence as \u201cthe statutory maximum\u201d and \u201cnow reflecting] an upward departure of 59%\u201d. The court then noted: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s disciplinary record while incarcerat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ed indicates that the defendant is likely to commit further crimes and does not warrant a reduction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The district court\u2019s erroneous description of the statutory maximum and the extent of the upward departure played no part in its decision to deny the instant motion. Although the court found Dupre was eligible for a sentence reduction, it clearly stated it was declining to grant one because of his extensive prison disciplinary record. The court did not abuse its discretion by finding that record outweighed Dupre\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation and denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on this basis. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Simmons, </em>482 Fed.Appx. 927 (5th Cir.2012) (affirming denial based on single, serious prison disciplinary offense) (citing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
