For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard in reviewing factual findings. <em>See United States v. Lilly, </em>536 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir.2008). We also exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s conclusions as to a defendant\u2019s procedural default. <em>Hodge v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>554 F.3d 372, 377 (3d Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s invocation of the concurrent sentence doctrine for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lampley, </em>573 F.2d 783, 788 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">A prisoner in custody under a sentence of a federal court \u201cclaiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States\u201d may move to \u201cvacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Parkin argues on appeal that (1) the indictment, evidence, and jury instructions exclusively presented a theory of mail fraud based on deprivation of honest services through concealment and self-dealing; and (2) the evidence used in support of the invalid mail fraud counts \u201cspilled over\u201d to negatively impact the extortion count.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">As a threshold matter, we acknowledge that as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), the Government\u2019s concealed conflict of interest theory and jury instructions based on that theory constituted \u201cclear and obvious\u201d legal error. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>621 F.3d 312, 323 (3d Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>665 F.3d 560, 567 (3d Cir.2012) (noting that the jury\u2019s verdict could be \u201cdefective\u201d where the jury was instructed that it could convict for depravation of honest services under a conflict of interest theory). However, as a general rule, where a defendant has failed to raise a claim on direct review, the claim may be raised in habeas only if the defendant can demonstrate either cause and prejudice, or actual innocence. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Thus, we will focus on whether the district court erred in dismissing Parkin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion due to an incurable procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">A. Procedural Default</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In order to obtain collateral review on a procedurally defaulted claim, a habeas petitioner must show either (1) cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice, or (2) that s/he is actually innocent. <em>See Bousley, </em>523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (1998); <em>Hodge, </em>554 F.3d at 378-79. Parkin does not claim to be actually innocent of attempted extortion. He can therefore only cure his procedural default by establishing \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d \u2014 i.e., that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts\u201d to raise the claim. <em>United States v. Pelullo, </em>399 F.3d 197, 223 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(quoting McCleskey v. Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991)); <em>Hodge, </em>554 F.3d at 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Parkin claims that he could not have reasonably been expected to raise a <em>Skilling </em>based argument until the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Skilling, </em>overturning \u201c\u2018a longstanding and widespread practice ... which a near-unanimous body of lower court authority has expressly approved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reed v. Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 17, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 551, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982). Thus, he argues that there is no procedural bar to raising that claim now. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901 (where \u201ca constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>reasonably available to counsel, a defendant has cause for his failure to raise the claim\u201d).) We do not think that is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Futility \u201ccannot constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.\u201d <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (internal quotation marks omitted). The claim raised in <em>Skilling </em>was not novel at the time of Parkin\u2019s appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 622, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (the \u201creasonably available\u201d inquiry focuses on whether the claim was \u201cnovel,\u201d <em>not </em>whether the claim departed from \u201csettled law\u201d). Indeed, prior to Parkin\u2019s trial and appeal, many defendants, including Andrew Skilling himself, had argued that \u00a7 1346 was unconstitutionally vague. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hausmann, </em>345 F.3d 952, 958 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>354 F.3d 124, 126 (2d Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201c[w]e agreed to rehear this case in banc in order to consider whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 ... is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d); <em>United States v. Welch, </em>327 F.3d 1081, 1109 n. 29 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Panarella, </em>277 F.3d 678, 698-99 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Ryan v. United States, </em>645 F.3d 913, 917 (7th Cir.2011) (\u201cIf Ryan\u2019s lawyers had done what Skilling\u2019s lawyers did, the controlling decision today might be Ryan rather than Skilling.\u201d), vacated on other grounds, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2099, 182 L.Ed.2d 866 (2012); <em>Jennings v. United States, </em>696 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir.2012) (\u201cJennings could have at any time raised the same legal issue that had been raised in <em>Skilling </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Parkin\u2019s assertion, that the <em>Skilling </em>challenge was not reasonably available to counsel, is fatally undermined by the plethora of cases raising that very claim. <em>See Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 134, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982) (where the foundation of a claim \u201cis available, and other defense counsel have perceived and litigated that claim, the demands of comity and finality counsel against labeling alleged unawareness of the objection as cause for a procedural default.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Parkin has thus shown neither actual innocence of attempted extortion nor that there was cause and prejudice for failing to raise a constitutional-vagueness challenge to \u00a7 1346 (which would have encompassed the prejudicial spillover argument). Accordingly, Parkin procedurally defaulted his challenge to Count 13, and the district court correctly denied his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">B. The Concurrent Sentence Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Under the concurrent sentence doctrine, a court has \u201cdiscretion to avoid resolution of legal issues affecting less than all counts in an indictment if at least one will survive and sentences on all counts are concurrent.\u201d <em>United States v. McKie, </em>112 F.3d 626, 628 n. 4 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. American Investors of Pittsburgh, Inc., </em>879 F.2d 1087, 1100 (3d Cir.1989) (citing <em>United States v. Lampley, </em>573 F.2d 783 (3d Cir.1978)). Since \u201cthe defendant remains sentenced in any event, reviewing the concurrently sentenced counts is of no utility. The practice is eminently practical and preserves judicial resources for more pressing needs.\u201d <em>Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>805 F.2d 1125, 1128 (3d Cir.1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">On habeas review, we presume that a wrongful conviction carries continued collateral consequences, and we therefore agree that this appeal is not moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 8-12, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Kendrick v. Dist. Atty. of Cnty. of Philadelphia, </em>488 F.3d 217, 220 (3d Cir.2007). We would normally be reluctant to affirm the district court\u2019s application of the concurrent sentence doctrine under the circumstances here because an aggregate sentence could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>encompass a wrongful conviction. <em>See United States v. Pollen, </em>978 F.2d 78, 83 n. 10 (3d Cir.1992); <em>Kendrick, </em>488 F.3d at 219 (rejecting district court\u2019s reliance on the concurrent sentence doctrine where defendant received \u201can aggregate sentence of fifteen to thirty years imprisonment, that ... encompassed the invalid ... conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">However, Parkin was convicted of attempted extortion under a separate statute that is in no way implicated by the Court\u2019s subsequent ruling in <em>Skilling. </em>While Parkin\u2019s honest services convictions may have been based upon conduct that the Court subsequently held did not violate \u00a7 1346, his conviction for attempted extortion under \u00a7 1951(a) is not undermined by that decision. <em>See McKie, </em>112 F.3d at 628; <em>Jones, </em>805 F.2d at 1128 n. 4 (habeas challenge which would affect only one of two concurrent counts need not be reached under concurrent sentence doctrine: \u201cthe concurrent sentence doctrine ... may appropriately be applied when the alleged error is associated only with counts for which concurrent sentences are imposed and the other sentences are unassailable.\u201d); <em>Cheeks v. Gaetz, </em>571 F.3d 680, 684-85 (7th Cir.2009) (noting that the concurrent sentence doctrine \u201callows appellate courts to decline to review a conviction carrying a concurrent sentence when one \u2018concurrent\u2019 conviction has been found valid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Parkin\u2019s conviction for attempted extortion resulted in a 90-month sentence which ran concurrently with his 60-month sentence for mail fraud. We therefore cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by invoking the concurrent sentence doctrine and not reaching the merits of his Skilling-based claims for relief. <em>See Jones, </em>805 F.2d at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Parkin\u2019s motion to vacate sentence under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">McKEE, Chief Judge, concurring., 12-4081.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">I agree that, based on the facts of this case, we cannot say that the district court erred by disposing of the matter as it did. Parkin was convicted of honest services mail fraud based on undisclosed self-dealing \u2014 a theory no longer recognized as a valid basis for an honest services mail fraud conviction. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2929-34. As we noted on direct appeal, Parkin\u2019s convictions stemmed from his participation in a scheme to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">defraud the citizens of Mercer County of their right to honest services by using his official position to obtain contracts for CJW &amp; R in order to protect and advance his own financial interests; by attempting to obtain an ownership interest in CJW &amp; R; and by <em>concealing material information concerning his financial interests </em>in CJW &amp; R from other government officials and the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-11\"><em>Parkin, </em>319 Fed.Appx. at 105 (emphasis added). Nowhere in our opinion did we mention the terms \u201cbribe\u201d or \u201ckickback.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">The Government did not allege at trial that Parkin accepted bribes or engaged in a kickback scheme, nor did the Government\u2019s proposed jury instructions on the honest services mail fraud make any mention of bribery or kickbacks. SA 392. As the Government now concedes, its \u201carguments to the jury focused primarily on the now-discredited failure to disclose theory of honest services mail fraud.\u201d Gov. Br. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">A habeas petitioner may establish that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>against him by showing that \u201cin light of all the evidence it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, <em>quoting Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327-28, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Wright v. Vaughn, </em>473 F.3d 85, 92 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Although the Government now claims that the evidence introduced at trial \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d demonstrates that Parkin engaged in bribery and kickbacks, <em>see, e.g., </em>SA 931-32, SA 939, the Government is clearly trying to shoehorn a conflict-of-interest theory into the <em>post-Skilling </em>bribery-and-kickback framework. <em>See Riley, </em>621 F.3d at 324 (\u201cwhere the fraudulent act is the non-disclosure of a conflict of interest, it would demean the judicial process to attempt to put the genie back in the bottle by essentially rewriting the charge to the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Government indicted Parkin for 12 counts of conduct that is no longer criminalized. Although the Government now takes pains to avoid the force of <em>Skilling, </em>candor should compel the Government to forthrightly concede that its prosecutorial theory, and trial focus, rested on a now-discredited legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">During trial, Parkin\u2019s counsel raised a concern that, although the trial had focused on honest services mail fraud, the prosecutor was attempting to suggest that the jury could convict Parkin for bribery. The court dismissed that concern saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think that they were saying that ... somebody came and offered the defendant some money or benefits.\u201d 30T125-5 to 10. The prosecutor affirmed that he was not trying to convince the jury that: \u201c[y]ou know, somebody came and offered the defendant some money or benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Assistant United States Attorney then clarified the point for the court: \u201cWhat\u2019s being taken here is the public\u2019s right, the government\u2019s right, and the Mercer County Improvement Authority\u2019s honest services. Whether or not he got a benefit, or obtained any money or anything else <em>just doesn\u2019t have any place in this.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. At 7 (citing 28T71-14 to 20) (italics added). As the saying goes, \u201cthat was then, this is. now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Now the Government comes before us and argues that the mail fraud theory at trial encompassed bribery and kickbacks. The Government argues: \u201c[t]he Government did not use the word \u2018bribery\u2019 or \u2018kickback\u2019 in the indictment, nor did it use those particular words when presenting its closing argument to the jury. But that does not mean that the Government did not prove that Parkin engaged in conduct that constituted bribery or kickbacks.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 56. The argument continues: \u201cThe facts proven at trial demonstrate that Parkin solicited bribes and kickbacks, and thus Parkin cannot bear the burden of demonstrating \u2018actual innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Bribery has thus undergone a metamorphosis that has transformed it from a prosecutorial theory that \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have any place in this,\u201d to the lynchpin of the Government\u2019s argument on appeal. I understand why the Government adopted this adversarial bait and switch after <em>Skilling. </em>However, the argument could have\u2014 and should have \u2014 been made in a less disingenuous and more candid manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Although I agree with, and fully join the analysis in the <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion of my colleagues, I feel compelled to write separately to ensure that the \u201cnow you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d approach to advocacy adopted by the Government in this case does not pass without comment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\">.
