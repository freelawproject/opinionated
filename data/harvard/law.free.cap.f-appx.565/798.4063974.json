Rostan now appeals from a district court order directing Fidelity Investments to pay money from Rostan\u2019s Fidelity accounts into a restitution fund to satisfy the outstanding restitution order, including accrued interest. After careful review, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Rostan\u2019s motion to quash and granting the government\u2019s application for a writ of garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Rostan was originally sentenced in March 2000. At the sentencing hearing, the district court ordered Rostan to pay restitution in the amount of $20,710.83, but the judgment form did not specify a payment schedule. Although the transcript of the sentencing hearing has since been misplaced, the minutes from that hearing reflect that the district court made the restitution \u201cpayable immediately.\u201d This Court affirmed that judgment \u2014 including the restitution order \u2014 on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Rostan, </em>No. 00-13005, 275 F.3d 1086, slip op. at 5 (11th Cir. Nov. 1, 2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">On March 6, 2007, the district court amended the original judgment form. The amended judgment indicated that, \u201c[h]aving assessed [Rostan\u2019s] ability to pay,\u201d restitution in the amount of $20,710.83 was \u201cdue immediately.\u201d As we have noted, this payment schedule is consistent with that reflected in the minutes of the original sentencing hearing. The amended judgment form did not purport to alter any findings the district court made regarding Rostan\u2019s interest payment obligations. Indeed, the amended judgment clearly contemplates payment of interest by noting that restitution payments shall be applied to the principal before the accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-17\">In March 2012, the government filed an application for writ of garnishment upon Fidelity pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205. According to the government, Rostan had paid only $775.00 towards the restitution judgment, and the balance of the principal and interest remained due. Fidelity answered, noting that it maintained two accounts for Rostan \u201cwith a net worth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>excess of the [restitution] judgment.\u201d Rostan raised several objections to garnishment, including that he had not been notified until the 2007 amended judgment that restitution was payable immediately, that the original judgment included only restitution and made no mention of interest, and that the district court failed to consider his financial resources when it ordered immediate payment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied Rostan\u2019s objections and motion to quash, directing Fidelity to pay $85,069.69 in principal and interest out of Rostan\u2019s accounts. Rostan now appeals this order, arguing that (1) neither the sentencing hearing nor the 2000 judgment form addressed the interest payments or the schedule of payments, (2) the 2007 judgment form does not address interest, and (3) the district court failed to evaluate his financial conditions before ordering immediate restitution payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">This Court has not addressed the standard of review that applies to a district court\u2019s garnishment order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But where, as here, a defendant-debtor\u2019s challenge to a garnishment order is based on a challenge to the propriety of the underlying restitution order, the garnishment order would be appropriate under any standard of review so long as the underlying restitution order is appropriate. And because the time to appeal the substance of the 2000 restitution order has long passed, in this appeal we consider only the propriety of the garnishment order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). As a result, we will affirm the district court\u2019s order that Rostan pay interest as of the date restitution was ordered so long as it adheres to the original restitution order. <em>See United States v. Sloan, </em>505 F.3d 685, 696-97 (7th Cir.2007) (upholding garnishment order which was consistent with a valid restitution order that the defendant had not timely challenged).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Rostan argues that the garnishment order does not adhere to the original restitution order because (1) neither the 2000 nor the 2007 judgment made mention of any obligation to pay interest and (2) the 2000 restitution order did not require immediate payment. Both challenges are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">When a district court orders a defendant to pay restitution in excess of $2,500, the obligation that he pay interest is triggered by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(f)(1) (\u201cThe defendant <em>shall </em>pay interest on any fine or restitution of more than $2,500, unless the fine is paid in full before the fifteenth day after the date of the judgment.\u201d (emphasis added)). There is no requirement that the judgment form express the default requirement that the defendant pay interest on the restitution ordered. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3612(b)(1). And given the district court\u2019s silence on the matter, it is clear that the court did not exercise its discretion in 2000 to waive or limit the interest requirements. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3612(f)(3) (\u201cIf the court determines that the defendant does not have the ability to pay interest under this subsection, the court <em>may </em>\u2014 (A) waive the requirement for interest; (B) limit the total of interest payable to a specific dollar amount; or (C) limit the length of the period during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>interest accrues.\u201d (emphasis added)). We therefore conclude that Rostan\u2019s original sentence included, by operation of law, a requirement that he pay the statutorily required interest on the restitution ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Rostan\u2019s argument that his original sentence did not explicitly require immediate payment is also unavailing, for two reasons. First, it was made clear in the minutes of the sentencing hearing that that the restitution order was \u201cpayable immediately.\u201d This notation from the hearing controls to the extent there is any irreconcilable discrepancy between the orally imposed sentence and the written judgment order. <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990). But in any event, given the statutory default payment schedules, there is no discrepancy between the judgment form and the oral sentence. The default payment schedule for all orders of restitution requires a defendant to make immediate payment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(1) (\u201cA person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments.\u201d). The restitution order is only required to include a payment schedule \u201cif other than immediate payment is permitted under section 3572(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3612(b)(1)(D). Given the district court\u2019s oral order regarding the payment schedule, and in light of the omission of any alternative payment schedule, the default payment schedule applied to the 2000 restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The 2007 amendment to the judgment form did nothing to alter the original restitution order\u2019s requirement that Rostan pay interest pursuant to \u00a7 3612(f). Rostan is right that the 2007 amended judgment form is, like the 2000 sentencing hearing and judgment form, silent on the issue of interest payments. But as we\u2019ve said, the interest payments are automatically triggered regardless of whether they are explicitly reflected in the sentence. And although Rostan argues otherwise, the 2007 amendment did nothing to substantively change the schedule of payments, either. The 2007 amendment merely corrected a clerical omission in the written order, making explicit the payment schedule in light of the orally imposed sentence and the statutory default payment rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">For these reasons,- Rostan\u2019s restitution order is, and always has been, an order to pay the restitution principal as well as statutory interest from the date of the judgment. The garnishment order simply enforced these terms, the propriety of which Rostan cannot challenge anew at this late stage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). On this record, the district court made no error in issuing a garnishment order that faithfully adhered to the requirements of the restitution order. <em>See Sloan, </em>505 F.3d at 696-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">To the extent Rostan challenges the district court\u2019s decision not to modify the accrued interest when it ordered garnishment, that argument is also without merit. It is true that the district court \u201cmay\u201d modify the interest payment requirement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(f)(3). Again, given the timing of this appeal, Rostan cannot now challenge the district court\u2019s failure to modify his interest payment obligations when it issued the original restitution order or the 2007 amendment. To the extent that we interpret Rostan\u2019s 2012 ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>jections to the application for a writ of garnishment as a petition for relief from the previously imposed interest obligations, the district court had no basis to modify the mandatory \u00a7 3612(f)(1) interest payments in 2012. There is no question that in 2012, Rostan did have the ability to pay the interest required by \u00a7 3612(f)(1). Section 3612(f)(3) permits modification of the mandatory interest payment only where the defendant \u201cdoes not have the ability\u201d to pay it. Therefore, the district court was without authority to modify Rostan\u2019s interest payment obligations in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order granting the government\u2019s application for a writ of garnishment and denying Rostan\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">. Rostan raised several other objections to the garnishment order, but they are abandoned on appeal because they are not raised in his initial brief. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\">. As best we can tell, only the Fifth Circuit has explicitly defined the applicable standard of review in a published opinion, holding that a garnishment order is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>613 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">. For this reason, we do not consider Rostan\u2019s argument that the original restitution order failed to take into account his financial conditions as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
