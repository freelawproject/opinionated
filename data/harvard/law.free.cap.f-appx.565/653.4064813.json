We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-24\">1. Smith argues that the trial court violated <em>Bruton </em>when it admitted an out-of-court statement by his non-testifying co-defendant, Mark Taffolla, which directly implicated Smith. <em>See Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). <em>Bruton, </em>however, applies to statements that violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620. In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause only bars \u201ctestimonial\u201d out-of-court statements. Although <em>Crawford </em>did not establish a singular definition of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the Court explained that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The disputed statement \u2014 an account of the crime Taffolla gave to his girlfriend in a motel room \u2014 was clearly not testimonial. Given that <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>core holding relies on the Confrontation Clause, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to, [nor did it] involve[ ] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">2. We decline to expand the Certificate of Appealability to incorporate Smith\u2019s additional, related argument that admission of Taffolla\u2019s statement violated his due process rights. Smith has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2); 9th Cir. R. 22-1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
