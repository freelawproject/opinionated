Apr. 15, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. We review the agency\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-14\">An alien may file one motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Singh\u2019s 2013 motion was untimely and number barred because he filed four motions to reopen since he was ordered removed in 2003. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the time limitation does not apply to a motion to rescind if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the consequences for failing to appear at his hearing, as stated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h). The limitations may also be equitably tolled upon a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir.2000). The BIA reasonably found that neither exception applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-15\">Singh first argues that his Notice to Appear misrepresented the consequences of fading to appear because it stated that, in his absence, an <em>in absentia </em>removal order \u201cmay,\u201d rather than \u201cshall,\u201d be entered. To the contrary, the NTA was accurate. Failure to appear despite proper notice \u201cshall\u201d result in an <em>in absentia </em>removal order, but only if the Government establishes notice and removability. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5). Singh also asserts that the Notice was deficient because it failed to mention the procedures for rescinding an <em>in absentia </em>order, as set forth in the last three subsections of \u00a7 1229a(b)(5). However, the statute requires notice only of the consequences of failing to appear, not the procedure to reverse the resulting order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a)(1)(G)(ii). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Singh\u2019s motion to rescind was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The BIA also reasonably declined to equitably toll the time limitation imposed on Singh\u2019s motion. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a movant must establish that the alleged ineffective assistance occurred within the scope of an existing attorney-client relationship and that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his claim. <em>See Rashid v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Piranej v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 137, 144-45 (2d Cir.2008). Contrary to Singh\u2019s contention that his former counsel represented him throughout his proceedings, the BIA reasonably found that their relationship encompassed only the filing of Singh\u2019s first motion to reopen and the appeal from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Even assuming, as the BIA did, that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance, the BIA reasonably found that Singh should have discovered the lack of notice in 2003, when he was ordered removed <em>in absentia. </em>The purported issue also became apparent in 2005, when the BIA denied his second motion to reopen. Given Singh\u2019s delay between discovering his attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance and filing his motion to reopen, the BIA reasonably found that he failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim. <em>See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA </em>508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cA petitioner who waits two years or longer to take steps to reopen a proceedings ha[d] failed to demonstrate due diligence.\u201d). The BIA therefore did not abuse its discretion in declining to equitably toll the motion and denying it as untimely. <em>See Rashid, </em>533 F.3d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
