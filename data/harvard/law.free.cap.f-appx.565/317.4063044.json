At his revocation hearing, the district court ordered Mark to participate in drug treatment. He asserts the subsequent written judgment improperly added a special condition that he submit to drug testing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>part of the drug-treatment program, thereby broadening the drug-treatment condition announced at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Because Mark could not have objected at the revocation hearing to the condition imposed in the subsequent judgment, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cThe key determination is whether the discrepancy between the oral pronouncement and the written judgment is a conflict or merely an ambiguity that can be resolved by reviewing the rest of the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Mireles, </em>471 F.3d 551, 558 (5th Cir.2006). A conflict arises if the written judgment differs from the orally pronounced sentence by either adding a special condition or broadening a condition. <em>See id.; Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d at 936. Where there is a conflict, the district court is required to reform the judgment by deleting the special condition not pronounced orally. <em>Mireles, </em>471 F.3d at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Drug testing is both a special condition and a mandatory condition of Mark\u2019s supervised release. The <em>mandatory condition, </em>which he does not challenge, requires him to \u201csubmit to one drug test within 15 days of release from imprisonment and <em>at least </em>two periodic drug tests thereafter, as directed by the probation officer\u201d. (Emphasis added.) In announcing the special condition, the district court ordered Mark to \u201cparticipate in a program approved by the United States Probation Office for the treatment of narcotic, drug, or alcohol dependency\u201d. The written judgment mandated the drug-treatment program \u201cinclude testing for the detection of substance use or abuse\u201d. Because drug testing is generally a component of drug-treatment programs and a properly imposed mandatory condition of Mark\u2019s supervised release, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of this requirement, in the context of the special condition that he participate in drug treatment, did not add a new condition or broaden the special condition pronounced orally. <em>See, e.g., Mireles, </em>471 F.3d at 558-59; <em>United States v. Gray, </em>No. 13-10242, 2013 WL 6247433 (5th Cir. 4 Dec. 2013) (unpublished), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 13-8996 (U.S. 4 Mar. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
