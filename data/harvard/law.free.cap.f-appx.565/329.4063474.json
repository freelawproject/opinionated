He was sentenced to a bottom-of-the-guidelines sentence of 30 months to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">Hernandez argues that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded to allow the district court to conform the written judgment to its oral pronouncement by removing the special conditions of supervised release requiring mandatory drug testing. The Government in its motion to modify the written judgment agrees that the written judgment should be amended to conform with the oral pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-23\">The record supports the parties\u2019 assertion that there is a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment in that the district court in its oral pronouncement stated that it was waiving the mandatory drug-testing requirement and the written judgment included that requirement. The Government\u2019s motion to modify the written judgment is GRANTED in part and its alternative motion for extension of time to file appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED as unnecessary. The sentence is VACATED in part and the case is REMANDED to the district court so that it can modify the written judgment to conform with the oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>United States v.
