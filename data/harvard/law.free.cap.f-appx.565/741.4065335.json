PHILLIPS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">After a nine-month investigation, law enforcement arrested Juan Manuel Cortez-Diaz with about two pounds of pure methamphetamine in his car and, soon after, seized about seven more pounds at his stash house. The evidence at trial showed that Cortez-Diaz ran a multi-state methamphetamine distribution network centered in Kansas City, Kansas, and based on this evidence the jury convicted him of various drug possession and distribution crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The weight and purity of the methamphetamine, combined with leadership-role and drug-house enhancements, led to an advisory guideline sentence of life imprisonment \u2014 which the district court imposed. Cortez-Diaz now challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of that sentence. We conclude that the district court committed no error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Special Agent Matt Hall of Homeland Security Investigations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (HSI) began in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>vestigating Cortez-Diaz after a confidential informant (CI) reported that Cortez-Diaz had recently arrived in Kansas City from California to set up a drug-distribution network.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On August 9, 2010, the CI bought methamphetamine from Cortez-Diaz at a local market. After providing the Cl with $2,600 in buy-money, Agent Hall watched from a safe distance as Cortez-Diaz opened his trunk and the two men completed the exchange. Following routine controlled-buy procedures, the agents recovered the two ounces of purchased methamphetamine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">On September 22, 2010, the Cl introduced Agent Hall to Cortez-Diaz, who was accompanied by Alfredo Soto-Contreras. Agent Hall was acting in an undercover role as a driver for a parcel delivery company. After being introduced, Agent Hall complained to Cortez-Diaz about the poor quality of methamphetamine that Cortez-Diaz had sold the Cl on August 9. Cortez-Diaz apologized, explaining that that methamphetamine hadn\u2019t come from his usual supplier. He promised to make it up the next time Agent Hall bought methamphetamine from him or Soto-Contreras. During this same meeting, Agent Hall asked if he could transport drug money for Cortez-Diaz as part of his parcel service job. Agent Hall claimed that he already \u201cran money\u201d for narcotics distributors and could do so all the way to California. Agent Hall testified that Cortez-Diaz expressed interest in the plan but needed to clear it with his bosses.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">On October 6, 2010, Agent Hall and the Cl met with Cortez-Diaz and another associate, Martin Gonzalez. This meeting was set to continue discussing the possibility of Agent Hall\u2019s transporting drug money for Cortez-Diaz. Agent Hall arrived in a company van to make the story believable. Cortez-Diaz raised the possibility of using the van to take money to Oklahoma and to bring back more methamphetamine. During the meeting, Cortez-Diaz handed Agent Hall a shard of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Agent Hall understood that Cortez-Diaz was proving to him that he could obtain high-quality drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">On October 22, 2010, Agent Hall and the Cl were again set to meet with Cortez-Diaz. Instead, Cortez-Diaz sent two other men, Martin Gonzalez and Alfredo Soto-Contreras, to explain that he couldn\u2019t make the meeting but to reset it for that afternoon. Later, Cortez-Diaz came with Oscar Sotello and apologized for missing the earlier meeting. He attributed his delay to law enforcement\u2019s possibly having seized a load of his organization\u2019s methamphetamine. Cortez-Diaz again expressed interest in using the parcel delivery company to run drug money to other cities but delayed making a final decision. Cortez-Diaz then showed Agent Hall an ounce of \u201cgood\u201d methamphetamine and named a price \u2014 $1,300 for the ounce, or $18,500 for a pound. Agent Hall held the bagged methamphetamine and could see that it was very pure. Because he had no buy-funds, however, he declined to purchase and made an excuse that he couldn\u2019t be carrying methamphetamine in the company van.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">On December 8, 2010, Agent Hall and the Cl met again with Cortez-Diaz about transporting drug money and also to buy methamphetamine. At this meeting, Cortez-Diaz told Agent Hall that he\u2019d found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>another \u201csource\u201d that would \u201cdrive the loads back and forth\u201d but that \u201cthey\u201d were still deciding whether to use Agent Hall\u2019s delivery company locally. R. vol. II, at 300-01. Cortez-Diaz handed Agent Hall an ounce of pure-looking methamphetamine, and Agent Hall handed him $1,300.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although Agent Hall tried to arrange another meeting with Cortez-Diaz, it never happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In late April 2011, HSI agents learned from a court-authorized wiretap that a man named Juan Razo may have been working as Cortez-Diaz\u2019s driver, taking drug money from Kansas City to California. In a series of monitored calls from May 13 to May 16, Razo told Cortez-Diaz that he was bringing nine cans or buckets of paint to Kansas City. The agents believed the \u201ccans\u201d or \u201cbuckets\u201d referred to kilograms or pounds of methamphetamine. From the call, they knew that about half the total load was destined for an unknown person, \u201cGuerillo.\u201d During the calls, Cortez-Diaz directed Razo \u2014 he told him when to leave, some details about a stash house, that he could provide Razo with a place to sleep in Kansas City, and that he could avoid police detection by turning off his cell phone and using cruise control.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On May 16, 2011, once Razo arrived in Kansas City, he met with Cortez-Diaz at a flea market. HSI witnessed this meeting through covert surveillance of Cortez-Diaz. Cortez-Diaz then drove Razo to the stash house on Washington Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas. They stayed there about five minutes before Cortez-Diaz took Razo back to the flea market and returned to his apartment. Later that evening, Cortez-Diaz returned to the flea market, picked up Razo, and the two men returned to the stash house.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">While at the house, Cortez-Diaz received a call from \u201cMiguel\u201d and arranged to sell him a pound of methamphetamine. Soon after the call, HSI agents saw Cortez-Diaz walk to the end of the driveway, pick up and empty a shoebox from a trash pile, and return inside. A few minutes later, Cortez-Diaz left the stash house, put the shoebox inside the trunk of a car, and drove away. HSI called local police to have them stop Cortez-Diaz, which they did after seeing him commit a traffic violation. During the stop, Cortez-Diaz consented to a search of the car. Inside the trunk, the officers found nearly two pounds (891.9 grams) of methamphetamine in the shoebox; its purity was 99.7%.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">HSI agents obtained a search warrant for the stash house. Inside they found Razo, over five and half pounds (2,583 grams) of methamphetamine (99.1% pure) in one container, another pound (488.3 grams) of methamphetamine (99.5% pure) in a second container, a digital scale, and drug-packaging material. There was no furniture, and it appeared that no one lived at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">After his arrest, Razo waived his right to remain silent and spoke with the agents. He said that he\u2019d made six trips for a named drug organization, transporting methamphetamine and cash. Consistent with the recorded calls, he said that in April 2011 he\u2019d previously delivered a load of methamphetamine to Kansas City as organized by Cortez-Diaz and Martin Gonzalez. Razo explained that he then returned to Kansas City to collect $80,000 in methamphetamine sales proceeds. He also told the agents that Martin Gonzalez had loaded the $80,000 into his vehicle. For the current trip, he said half of the drugs had gone to Cortez-Diaz and the other half had gone to another person. Razo told the agents that seven pounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>methamphetamine remained in the stash house from the nine pounds he had delivered to Cortez-Diaz (who was arrested with the other two pounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">A grand jury indicted Cortez-Diaz on five counts of methamphetamine trafficking. The jury convicted on all counts. On its special verdict form, the jury specifically found that Cortez-Diaz had possessed both the methamphetamine seized in the stash house and in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Before sentencing, the United States Probation Office for the District of Kansas prepared a Presentenee Investigation Report (PSR). The PSR detailed the factual background of the offenses and incorporated Razo\u2019s post-arrest statements. It included a base offense level of 88 given Cortez-Diaz\u2019s responsibility for 7.07 kilograms (over fifteen pounds) of methamphetamine \u2014 the sum total of all the actual methamphetamine involved in Cortez-Diaz\u2019s relevant conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The PSR recommended a two-level enhancement for maintaining a stash house and a four-level enhancement for Cortez-Diaz\u2019s leadership of a criminal activity with five or more participants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12), \u00a7 3B1.1(a) (2012). Because the sentencing table has a maximum total offense level of 43, however, the PSR\u2019s total offense level was reduced to that number. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table, cmt. n. 2. At total offense level 43, the Guidelines provide an advisory sentencing range of life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Cortez-Diaz argued that he shouldn\u2019t be found responsible for the methamphetamine seized from the stash house. He also objected to the PSR\u2019s recommended enhancements for maintaining a stash house and for his leadership role. He requested a downward variance based on mitigating factors such as his age, familial situation, and lack of criminal history.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After hearing argument, the district court imposed the recommended base offense level of 38 and six additional levels for the two disputed enhancements. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the requested downward variance, the district court ultimately imposed the recommended Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">\u201cOn appeal, the district court\u2019s sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2080, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013). Sentencing review proceeds in two steps. First, we address whether the court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>mitted procedural error. <em>United States v. Lente, </em>647 F.3d 1021, 1030 (10th Cir.2011). This step includes reviewing the court\u2019s Guidelines calculation \u2014 in that process, legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and the factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1055 (10th Cir.2006) (per curiam). When reviewing the application of sentencing enhancements, \u201cwe view the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Mozee, </em>405 F.3d 1082, 1088 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Second, we address substantive reasonableness, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence must fall within the range of permissible choice. <em>United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1053 (10th Cir.2007). We may assume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, but we aren\u2019t required to do so. <em>Peugh, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2080.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">1. Procedural Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Procedural error \u201crelates to the method by which the sentence is calculated.\u201d <em>Lente, </em>647 F.3d at 1030 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court recognizes at least five types of procedural error: (1) improperly calculating the Guidelines range; (2) adhering to the Guidelines as though they are mandatory; (3) failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; (4) basing a sentence on clearly erroneous facts; and (5) failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Although a sentence must be adequately explained, within-Guidelines sentences require only a general statement of the court\u2019s reasons and don\u2019t need explicit references to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to every rejected argument for leniency. <em>Id. </em>at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Cortez-Diaz first claims the district court miscalculated his sentence by including within his relevant conduct too much actual methamphetamine and by applying two enhancements \u2014 one for maintaining a stash house and another for his aggravating role in the offense (as a leader). In addition, he argues that the district court procedurally erred by inadequately explaining the basis for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\"><em>Drug Quantity. </em>In a jointly undertaken criminal activity involving controlled substances, a defendant is responsible for all drugs with which he was directly involved or that were reasonably foreseeable within the scope of the joint-criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A)-(B); <em>see id. </em>at cmt. n. 2. Cortez-Diaz concedes that he was directly involved with the drugs found in his car but thinks it was error for the district court to include the stash-house methamphetamine in calculating his base offense level. He claims \u201cthe evidence at trial did not prove by a preponderance that [he] actually or constructively possessed [the] packages of methamphetamine\u201d found in the house. Appellant\u2019s Br. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">This argument rests upon two mistaken premises \u2014 first, that a defendant is only accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 for controlled substances he <em>possesses, </em>and second, that for relevant conduct purposes this possession must be proved by the government at trial. In fact, as stated above, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 applies whenever a defendant is directly involved with the drugs in question \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t possess them. And in evaluating this involvement, a district court isn\u2019t limited to trial evidence. Instead, <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>information may be considered [at sentencing], so long as it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u00a7 6A1.3 cmt. (emphasis added); <em>see United States v. Ruby, </em>706 F.3d 1221, 1227 (10th Cir.2013) (\u201c[A]t a sentencing hearing the court can have access to any relevant information.... Sentencing courts historically rely on a wide array of information relevant to the individualized needs of the offender, including hearsay evidence....\u201d). Accordingly, the district court was free to consider any reliable relevant information in assessing Cortez-Diaz\u2019s connection to the drugs at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In this case, the district court relied on evidence presented at trial as well as in the PSR in concluding that Cortez-Diaz was accountable for the stash-house drugs. We find no error as this conclusion was well supported. After all, the jury found by special verdict that Cortez-Diaz possessed the methamphetamine in the house. Regardless of whether actual possession is dispositive under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A), it is certainly strong evidence of direct involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Yet the district court didn\u2019t just rely on the jury\u2019s special verdict, but instead found that trial evidence linked Cortez-Diaz to the stash house. The court pointed out that Cortez-Diaz discussed the house on the phone with Razo. From the intercepted calls, we know that it is indeed true that Cortez-Diaz gave Razo directions to the house before Razo arrived in Kansas City. We also can glean from the calls that Cortez-Diaz offered to arrange for someone in his organization to meet Razo when he arrived and take him to the stash house.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, the court noted Cortez-Diaz\u2019s presence at the stash house on two occasions. As HSI observed, Cortez-Diaz twice took Razo to the stash house where the methamphetamine was later found and went inside with him. And, before leaving the house with the shoebox, we know from the calls that Cortez-Diaz arranged a methamphetamine sale from the house. All of these facts support Cortez-Diaz\u2019s connection to the stash house and, by extension, his direct involvement with the methamphetamine found there. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Cortez-Diaz doesn\u2019t address this strong evidence against him, but he does argue that the district court erred in relying on the single unsupported PSR statement that \u201cCortez and Razo both pulled bags from the trunk of the vehicle\u201d before entering the stash house. R. vol. III, at 10. This was just one point the court made in reaching its ultimate conclusion that Cortez-Diaz was accountable for the stash-house drugs. But even so, a court is entitled to rely on uncontested facts within the PSR. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A). Since Cortez-Diaz never contested the accuracy of this specific fact, or any specific fact, the district court was free to accept it as uncontroverted and consider it during sentencing. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>737 F.3d 1278, 1285-86 (10th Cir.2013) (\u201cRule 32(i)(3)(B) applies only if facts in the PSR are disputed by specific objection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">In addition, even had Cortez-Diaz neither carried the methamphetamine into the house nor aided and abetted Razo in doing so, his relevant conduct would still include that methamphetamine. The district court also based its finding on the fact that Cortez-Diaz and Razo worked together, a finding that was well supported by the wiretap conversations. Indeed, since Cortez-Diaz and Razo were engaged in \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B), Cortez-Diaz was responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts of Razo in furtherance of those activities. Here, this included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Razo\u2019s bringing Cortez-Diaz nine pounds of methamphetamine from California under their express understanding and agreement. Accordingly, even had Razo been arrested before meeting up with Cortez-Diaz, Cortez-Diaz\u2019s relevant conduct would still have included the entire nine pounds. In sum, the district court didn\u2019t err in concluding that Cortez-Diaz was responsible for the seven pounds of methamphetamine at the stash house based on the aforementioned information.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><em>Stash house. </em>The Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement for \u201cmain-tainting] a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12). To determine whether the defendant \u201cmaintained\u201d the stash house, the Guidelines commentary instructs courts to consider \u201c(A) whether the defendant held a possessory interest in (e.g., owned or rented) the premises and (B) the extent to which the defendant controlled access to, or activities at, the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2D 1.1 cmt. n. 17. Among the qualifying uses of the maintained premises are distributing a controlled substance or storing the controlled substance there to distribute it elsewhere. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Cortez-Diaz contends that the government failed to show he maintained a stash house. He claims that his brief presence at the house and his vague phone calls with Razo are insufficient to support the enhancement. By his characterization, he was just a casual visitor to the stash house with no substantial connection to it. See <em>United States v. Flores-Olague, </em>717 F.3d 526, 532 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201c[A]lthough ownership is not dispositive of whether a defendant maintains a stash house, the statute contemplates a defendant who is more than a casual visitor.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Cortez-Diaz was anything but a casual visitor. After all, as the district court recognized, he left the house with a shoebox containing 891.9 grams of methamphetamine. Further, trial evidence supported the district court\u2019s finding that Cortez-Diaz controlled access to the stash house. As the district court observed, Cortez-Diaz \u201cdirected Juan Razo to go to the house, to lock himself in, and wait for [him].\u201d R. vol. II, at 785. Cortez-Diaz then twice took Razo to and from the house. The court also found it significant that the house had no furniture. Indeed, its only noted contents were seven pounds of methamphetamine, drug packaging materials, a digital scale, and Razo\u2019s luggage. All told, this information is more than enough to establish that Cortez-Diaz maintained the house to store or distribute a controlled substance. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 17. Again, we see no error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\"><em>Organizer or leader of criminal activity with five or more participants. </em>A district court may impose a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). To apply this enhancement, therefore, the district court needed to find two things: first, that Cortez-Diaz was a leader or organizer; and, second, that five or more people were participants in the criminal activity. <em>United States v. Egbert, </em>562 F.3d 1092, 1103 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">To decide whether the defendant was a leader or organizer, the Guidelines commentary instructs us to consider various factors: decision-making authority, participation in the offense, recruitment of accomplices, claiming a larger share of the crime proceeds, the amount of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>activity, and the amount of control exercised over others. U.S. S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4. To qualify as a leader, the defendant must exercise authority over at least one of the participants. <em>Egbert, </em>562 F.3d at 1103. A participant must be criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but the person need not be charged or convicted. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1; <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>529 F.3d 1290, 1303 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cA participant, in turn, must be criminally responsible for the commission of the offense even if he or she was not charged or convicted.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In this case, the district court found that Cortez-Diaz was a leader of a particular methamphetamine ring in Kansas City. Cortez-Diaz disputes that he qualified as a leader and that five or more people participated in the criminal activity. He challenges his leadership role, saying that the trial evidence doesn\u2019t prove by a preponderance that he controlled Razo, recruited accomplices, or claimed a larger share of the proceeds. Additionally, Cortez-Diaz claims that trial evidence only supports a finding that Razo was a participant in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Again, Cortez-Diaz mistakenly assumes that trial evidence is needed to support Guidelines enhancements. Yet as stated, the trial court is free to look outside the trial record for reliable evidence. <em>See Ruby, </em>706 F.3d at 1227. Here for instance, the district court was free to consider Razo\u2019s post-arrest statements in the PSR, even though Razo didn\u2019t testify at trial. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>550 F.3d 1292, 1296 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201c[H]earsay statements may be considered at sentencing if they bear some minimal indicia of reliability.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Regardless, the trial evidence also supported the district court\u2019s finding that Cortez-Diaz \u201chad access to and control over large amounts of drug proceeds, which would indicate ... a leadership position.\u201d R. vol. II, at 787. Agent Hall testified that Cortez-Diaz discussed and expressed interest in his offer to transport large amounts of Cortez-Diaz\u2019s drug proceeds on three separate occasions. The taped phone calls also showed that Cortez-Diaz controlled the shipment of proceeds and drugs from California and the subsequent sale of those drugs. After all, Cortez-Diaz told Razo when to begin his trip; he met him at an agreed location and took him to the stash house; and he left the house alone with two of the nine pounds of methamphetamine to sell after taking a call from a buyer. Agent Hall also testified that he believed Cortez-Diaz was a high-level drug dealer based on the nearly pure methamphetamine he supplied, his knowledge of seized drug shipments, and an analysis of his phone records. In fact, Agent Hall testified that Cortez-Diaz was a regional cell head of a methamphetamine distribution network.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Further, the district court found that Cortez-Diaz directed Razo\u2019s activities. Indeed, the trial evidence shows that Cortez-Diaz told Razo when to sleep, how to drive while carrying the shipment, and how to avoid police tracking by turning off his cellphone. Additionally, the PSR specifically states that \u201cRazo was given directions by Cortez[-Diaz].\u201d R. vol. III, at 11. Also, Cortez-Diaz had control over Martin Gonzalez and Alfredo Soto Contreras, as shown by his sending them to meet with Agent Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The district court\u2019s finding that there were at least five other participants in the criminal activity is also well supported. At trial, the government\u2019s evidence implicated Alfredo Soto-Contreras, Martin Gonzalez, \u201cMiguel,\u201d \u201cGuerillo,\u201d and Juan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Razo \u2014 five different individuals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, Alfredo Soto-Contreras accompanied Cortez-Diaz to meet with the undercover agent. At that meeting, they discussed transporting drug proceeds. Later, Cortez-Diaz sent Soto-Contreras to meet with the undercover agent when Cortez-Diaz was running late. Second, Martin Gonzalez also accompanied Soto-Contreras to meet with the undercover agent. And the PSR included Razo\u2019s statement that Martin had loaded the $80,000 in drug proceeds into Razo\u2019s vehicle. Third, \u201cMiguel\u201d arranged to purchase a pound of methamphetamine from Cortez-Diaz by phone. During the call, they discussed the quantity, quality, and price of the drugs. Fourth, \u201cGuerillo\u201d was to receive nine pounds of methamphetamine from Razo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Fifth, and finally, Cortez-Diaz concedes that Razo was a participant. That makes five participants in addition to Cortez-Diaz. <em>See United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[W]hen determining the number of participants, the defendant is considered to be one of the five.\u201d). And even though all of these participants weren\u2019t prosecuted, their knowing involvement in a criminal activity meets the standard for criminal responsibility as a participant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1 (\u201cA \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d). Considering this evidence, the district court didn\u2019t clearly err by finding Cortez-Diaz was a leader of criminal activity involving five or more participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\"><em>Failure to adequately explain the sentence. </em>\u201cWhen a district court imposes a within-Guidelines sentence, the court must provide only a general statement of its reasons, and need not explicitly refer to either the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors or respond to every argument for leniency that it rejects in arriving at a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Lente, </em>647 F.3d at 1034 (internal quotation marks omitted). Cortez-Diaz argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence and how it conformed to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although he claims this is a substantive issue, we treat sentence explanation challenges as procedural. <em>United States v. Wilken, </em>498 F.3d 1160, 1174 (10th Cir.2007). And because he didn\u2019t object to the explanation below, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Here, the district court expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the sentencing guidelines. As discussed above, the court also found and articulated several reasons for the base offense level and the enhancements imposed \u2014 all of which were supported by trial evidence or uncontested PSR statements. The district court further addressed Cortez-Diaz\u2019s request for a downward variance but denied the request based on the facts of the case, the PSR, and applicable law. In the end, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>triet court arrived at a within-Guidelines sentence, and we see no error, let alone plain error, in its explanation of how it got there.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">2. Substantive Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">To determine a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness we consider its length given the case\u2019s circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>723 F.3d 1226, 1233 (10th Cir.2013). Cortez-Diaz attacks the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on two related grounds. First, he claims that his within-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable given the facts of this case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Second, he argues that the Guidelines are driven by misguided policy that overemphasizes the quantity of methamphetamine in setting the base offense level.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">First, we may presume that within-Guidelines sentences are reasonable \u2014 and we do so here. <em>Peugh, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2080. Despite Cortez-Diaz\u2019s arguments in favor of leniency, which the district court addressed, the court ultimately concluded that the specifics of the crime weighed in favor of the Guidelines recommendation. Considering our deferential standard on review and the well-supported facts found by the district court regarding the amount of drugs involved, the use of the stash house, and Cortez-Diaz\u2019s leadership role, we find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Second, there is no doubt that a life sentence is a hefty penalty. But that is the Guidelines recommendation based on the policy that the Sentencing Commission saw fit to incorporate. Despite Cortez-Diaz\u2019s objection, \u201ca sentence is not rendered unreasonable merely because of a district court\u2019s refusal to deviate from the advisory guideline range based on disagreements with the policies underlying a particular Guideline provision.\u201d <em>Wilken, </em>498 F.3d at 1172 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court was well within its discretion to rely on the Guidelines recommendation here, notwithstanding Cortez-Diaz\u2019s challenges to the policies underlying that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">We conclude that the sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable and therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

The jury convicted Cortez-Diaz on five separate violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1): (1) distributing more than five grams of methamphetamine (Count one, August 9, 2010); (2) distributing methamphetamine (Count two, October 6, 2010); (3) possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine (Count three, October 22, 2010); (4) distributing more than five grams of methamphetamine (Count four, December 8, 2010); and (5) possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of methamphetamine (Count five, May 16, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-19\">.

This amount far exceeded the \"more than 1.5 kilograms\u201d required to reach a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Because this resulted in the maximum base offense level of 38, the district court had no need to include as relevant conduct Razo\u2019s earlier methamphetamine delivery to Cortez-Diaz, the one yielding $80,000 in proceeds. But had it mattered, this methamphetamine would also have counted as part of the base offense level calculus. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">. Although the PSR also included a two-level enhancement because Cortez-Diaz knew the methamphetamine had been imported unlawfully, the district court didn't impose this enhancement after the government conceded it wouldn't affect the applicable total offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-19\">. Indeed, Cortez-Diaz had no countable criminal history points and just one listed arrest\u2014 on May 17, 2011, he was arrested in Kansas City, Kansas, for possession of opiates/opium/narcotic drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b767-20\">. We focus only on the life sentence imposed for Count five as the sentences for the other four counts are for lesser terms of years to be served concurrently and don\u2019t affect our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">. Because HSI only had visual surveillance on Cortez-Diaz on May 16, 2011, the record is unclear on when or how the methamphetamine was unloaded at the stash house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b772-4\">.

Even though \"Miguel's\u201d and \"Guerillo's\u201d last names were unknown, the district court properly considered them as participants. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1182-83 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court properly considered individuals not identified by name (lower-level drug dealers) as participants for a leadership enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\">. \"Plain error occurs where there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Wilken, </em>498 F.3d at 1174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">. The government asks us to review the policy argument for plain error because Cortez-Diaz failed to object at sentencing. Although we would affirm the district court under either standard of review, we think Cortez-Diaz, although opaquely, raised this objection below allowing us to review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">. Cortez-Diaz faults the district court for its \"blind reliance\" on the quantity of drugs. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 40. Even excluding the stash-house drugs, however, Cortez-Diaz\u2019s base offense level still would be 36. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). With the two enhancements, his total offense level would be 42, resulting in an advisory sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court's sentence would thus still fall within the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
