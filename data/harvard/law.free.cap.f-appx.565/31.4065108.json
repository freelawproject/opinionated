Norton appeals from the dismissal of her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against defendants Dennis Breslin, Kathleen Gerbing, Lt. R. Bourgelais, and Felix Ezekwe, M.D., sued in their individual capacities for unlawful retaliation in violation of the First Amendment while Norton was an employee of the New York State Department of Correctional Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She alleges that the retaliation was based on her complaints of race-based discrimination, under-staffing, forced-overtime, and violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) Pub.L. 104-191, 110 Stat.1936 (codified in scattered sections of 18, 26, 29, &amp; 42 U.S.C.). We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint under Fed. R. of Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Norton. <em>See Fahs Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Gray, </em>725 F.3d 289, 290 (2d Cir.2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of the underlying proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">\u201cRegardless of the factual context, we have required a plaintiff alleging retaliation to establish speech protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Weintraub v. Bd. of Educ., </em>593 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). For speech by a public employee to be protected by the First Amendment, the employee must be \u201cspeaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Ross v. Breslin, </em>693 F.3d 300, 305 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Whether speech \u201caddresses a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court to decide.\u201d <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d 184, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). To answer this question, \u201cwe evaluate whether the speech relates to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, and whether the speech was calculated to redress personal grievances or whether it had a broader public purpose.\u201d <em>Hoyt v. Andreucci, </em>433 F.3d 320, 330 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted). \u201c[Mjere employee grievances do not qualify as matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no categorical approach, however, \u201cthat places all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>speech aimed at redressing personal grievances in the employment context beyond the scope of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Huth v. Haslun, </em>598 F.3d 70, 74 (2d Cir.2010). Rather, \u201c[w]hether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Ganim, </em>342 F.3d 105, 112 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Norton, who is African-American, complained that she was denied advancement in favor of a white employee with less seniority, and that specific white employees were treated better than she was. This is a quintessential employee grievance that may well be protected by the Equal Protection Clause, <em>see Ciambriello v. Cnty. of Nassau, </em>292 F.3d 307, 316 (2d Cir.2002), but not by the First Amendment. To be sure, a complaint of \u201csystem-wide discrimination\u201d can raise a public concern, but where the complaint is \u201cpersonal in nature and generally related to [the employee\u2019s] own situation,\u201d it is unprotected by the First Amendment. <em>Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., </em>4 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Washington v. County of Rockland, </em>373 F.3d 310 (2d Cir.2004), on which Norton relies, warrants no different conclusion. There, we identified a public concern in an alleged practice or policy of selectively subjecting African-Americans to disciplinary proceedings on account of their race, even though victims\u2019 complaints also stated personal grievances. <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 320. Here, however, Norton\u2019s complaints of personal discrimination are not connected to any broader policy or practice and, thus, do not raise a public concern of systemic discrimination. Like the district court, we conclude that her complaints are not First Amendment protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Nor does Norton allege that she complained about general HIPAA violations; rather she alleges that she reminded defendants of HIPAA disclosure protections when they asked her to give information concerning her own off-duty provision of health care to her mother and other patients. Nothing in this alleged statement reached beyond a \u201cgeneralized public interest in the fair or proper treatment of public employees,\u201d which we have said is \u201cnot enough\u201d to trigger First Amendment protection. <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d at 190. Indeed, Norton admits that she was complaining of \u201cpersonal violations of her and/or her mother\u2019s medical and health information.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 19-20. Nevertheless, she argues that, because she complained about more general HI-PAA violations while working at a different facility, the court should infer that her HIPAA complaint here at issue concerned general patient confidentiality as well as her own. Precedent is to the contrary. \u201c[Retaliation against the airing of generally personal grievances is not brought within the protection of the First Amendment by the mere fact that one or two of a public employee\u2019s comments could be construed broadly to implicate matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d at 190 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Finally, while Norton\u2019s alleged complaints of forced overtime and under-staffing might implicate concerns for staff and patient safety, read in context, it is apparent that their primary focus is Norton\u2019s own work situation. <em>See Jackler v. Byrne, </em>658 F.3d 225, 236 (2d Cir.2011). Specifically, Norton complained of being forced to work overtime during, and immediately after, nine 16-hour days over a two-week period. Similarly, she com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>plained of understaffing within days of informing her employer that she intended to file grievances related to her schedule. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in Norton\u2019s favor, these complaints assert primarily personal grievances. <em>See Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d at 190; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 15 (admitting mixed motivations in that \u201cshe was concurrently concerned for her own well-being\u201d when complaining about staffing).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">That conclusion is only reinforced by the non-public form of Norton\u2019s complaints. \u201cNothing in the complaint suggests that [she] made a single public statement or ever intended to make such a statement.\u201d <em>Fahs Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Gray, </em>725 F.3d at 291 (noting form of speech was \u201cexclusively nonpublic\u201d where plaintiff \u201cavailed itself of a dispute resolution mechanism entirely internal to [the Department of Transportation]\u201d). Norton communicated her staffing concerns only to her supervisor, and her overtime concerns only to management and the New York State Department of Labor, with which she also filed a separate complaint for overtime pay. In light of the context and form of her complaints, we conclude, as the district court did, that they did not address a matter of public concern and were therefore unprotected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We have considered the remainder of Norton\u2019s arguments and consider them to be without merit. The order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-11\">. The district court also dismissed Norton\u2019s claims against defendants in their official capacities because state officials in their official capacity are not \"persons\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>accord Reynolds v. Barrett, </em>685 F.3d 193, 204 (2d Cir.2012). Norton does not challenge this conclusion, and we therefore treat these official capacity claims as abandoned on appeal. <em>See Lederman v. N.Y. City Dep\u2019t of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>731 F.3d 199, 203 n. 1 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
