Hunter (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment and dismissing his discrimination and retaliation claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and his claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. We AFFIRM for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">1. Appellant fails to argue or brief any alleged error in the disposition of his race-based claims in the district court. Accordingly, any such claims are waived on appeal. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">2. Appellant\u2019s arguments that the court below erred in dismissing his retaliation claims and that he was terminated for protected activity fail both because he has not shown a causal connection between his allegedly protected activity and his termination, and because even assuming the same, he has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the asserted reason for his termination was pretextual. <em>See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 557-58 (5th Cir.2007). The Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, which were approved and adopted by the district court, provide the essential and more detailed rationale for rejecting Appellant\u2019s claims on appeal. No additional writing is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
