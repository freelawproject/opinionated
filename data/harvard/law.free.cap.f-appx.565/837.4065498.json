Masilotti\u2019s petition sought relief from the district court\u2019s 2007 forfeiture order entered in Masilotti\u2019s underlying criminal proceedings. The district court dismissed the petition because, <em>inter alia, </em>Masilotti waived his right to challenge the forfeiture in his plea agreement. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">On January 11, 2007, Masilotti pled guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and tax fraud. Pursuant to the written plea agreement, Masilotti also agreed to forfeit certain assets listed in the plea agreement, including $9.5 million, various parcels of land, and Masilotti\u2019s interests in a corporation, a land trust, a bank account and several certificates of deposit. As a result, on the same day as the plea hearing, the district court entered a preliminary forfeiture order and later entered a final forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">In 2013, Masilotti filed the instant petition, arguing that the forfeiture subsequently was voided by <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), which held that the honest services fraud statutes reach only schemes to defraud the public that involve bribes or kickbacks. <em>See Skilling, </em>561 U.S. at 407-09, 130 S.Ct. at 2931. The problem for Masilotti is that his written plea agreement contained a waiver not only of his right to appeal the forfeiture order, but also of his right to bring any other challenge to the forfeiture in any judicial or administrative proceeding. Specifically, in his written plea agreement, Masilotti agreed to waive certain \u201crights as to assets subject to forfeiture,\u201d including, <em>inter </em>alia: (1) \u201call constitutional, legal and equitable defenses to the forfeiture of the assets in any judicial or administrative proceeding\u201d; and (2) \u201cto appeal any order of forfeiture entered\u201d by the district court pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The district court found that Masilotti knowingly waived any right to challenge the forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1347 (11th Cir.1993) (explaining that we will enforce an appeal waiver in a plea agreement that was made knowingly and voluntarily). On appeal, Masilotti does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that an issue not \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d raised on appeal is deemed abandoned). Further, Masilotti\u2019s petition asserts a legal defense to the forfeiture of the assets listed in his plea agreement. Thus, we agree with the district court that Masilotti\u2019s petition is barred by the forfeiture waiver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Masilotti argues that his petition falls outside the scope of the forfeiture waiver because the waiver applied only to those assets that were \u201csubject to forfeiture,\u201d and, after <em>Skilling, </em>the assets are not properly subject to forfeiture. Masilotti\u2019s argument lacks merit for several reasons. First, such an interpretation of the forfeiture waiver would be inconsistent with the other terms of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting an interpretation of an appeal waiver that would be inconsistent with other terms of the plea agreement). The plea agreement contained a list of assets that Masilotti agreed were \u201csubject to forfeiture\u201d and were \u201cproperty constituting, or derived from the proceeds of\u2019 the charged honest services fraud. Masilotti agreed to waive any right to bring future judicial challenges to the forfeiture of those listed assets on \u201cconstitutional, legal and equitable\u201d grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Second, such a broad waiver applies to the <em>Skilling </em>argument Masilotti now raises in this petition. See <em>United States v. Howie, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1169 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that a waiver is enforceable even if it waives \u201cdifficult or debatable legal issues\u201d or \u201cblatant error\u201d). Although Masilotti argues that the forfeiture waiver cannot bar a challenge based on a subsequent development in the law, this Court has repeatedly upheld broad appeal waivers as long as they are knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a broad sentence-appeal waiver included any grounds of appeal based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>131 F.3d 1005, 1009 (11th Cir.1997) (refusing to allow appeal of issues disputed at sentencing, but not exempted from the sentence-appeal waiver). We agree with the district court, and the other circuits that addressed the issue, that a knowing and voluntary waiver is valid and enforceable against claims based on subsequent changes in the law unless a provision in the plea agreement states otherwise. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lockwood, </em>416 F.3d 604, 607-08 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number><em>ed States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 213 (3d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 170 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>406 F.3d 135, 137 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>400 F.3d 459, 463 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Killgo, </em>397 F.3d 628, 629 n. 2 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We reject Masilotti\u2019s alternative argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that his claim falls outside the scope of the forfeiture waiver because the plea agreement mistakenly referenced 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d)(1), which authorizes the forfeiture of firearms and ammunition, along with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461, the general forfeiture statute. In the district court, Masilotti \u201cassume[d] without admitting\u201d that the reference to \u00a7 924(d)(1) was a scrivener\u2019s error and that the parties intended to reference 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C), which authorizes the forfeiture of real and personal property traceable to the offense. Masilotti then argued that, after <em>Skilling, </em>the assets were not \u201csubject to forfeiture\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C). Masilotti did not argue in the district court, as he does here, that he \u201cagreed to forfeit only guns and ammunition,\u201d of which he had none.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Section 981(a)(1)(C) was the specific forfeiture statute cited in Masilotti\u2019s information and in the district court\u2019s preliminary and final forfeiture orders. Furthermore, the plea agreement\u2019s list of assets subject to forfeiture consisted of real and personal property, not firearms or ammunition. Under the circumstances, we readily conclude that the cite to \u00a7 924(d)(1) in the plea agreement is merely a scrivener\u2019s error and does not negate the express terms of the plea agreement that listed real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">For these reasons, the district court properly dismissed Masilotti\u2019s petition as barred by the forfeiture waiver in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the scope of an appeal waiver. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066, 1068-69 (11th Cir.2008) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>whether the defendant\u2019s admittedly knowing and voluntary sentence-appeal waiver included an exception for an untimely restitution order).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. We note that in 2010, Masilotti filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition attacking both his conviction and the forfeiture order based on <em>Skilling. </em>The petition was denied because: (1) at least one of Masilotti\u2019s honest services fraud schemes, the Diocese transaction, involved bribes or kickbacks; and (2) Masilotti pled guilty to a dual-object conspiracy and the other object \u2014 to impede the Internal Revenue Service in the collection of personal income taxes \u2014 was unaffected by <em>Skilling. </em>Thus, the \u00a7 2241 court concluded that Masilotti\u2019s conviction and the forfeiture order remained valid. Masilotti did not appeal that ruling. In dismissing the instant petition, the district court alternatively concluded that Masilotti was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating the validity of the forfeiture. Given that the district court properly dismissed Masilotti's petition pursuant to the forfeiture waiver, we do not address this alternative ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
