STRANCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">This is an interlocutory review of a preliminary injunction that stops Defendant The Wine Group (\u201cTWG\u201d), a California-based national wine supplier, from terminating distributorship agreements with the Plaintiffs, two franchisees who are the exclusive distributors of certain TWG products in several Ohio counties. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that the factors collectively weigh in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Like many other states, Ohio has a three-tier system for distributing alcoholic beverages: Manufacturers supply products to distributors, who in turn supply products to retailers for sale to the public. Ohio Alcoholic Beverages Franchise Act (\u201cFranchise Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 1333.82, <em>et seq.; see Granholm v. Heald, </em>544 U.S. 460, 466-68, 125 S.Ct. 1885, 161 L.Ed.2d 796 (2005) (reviewing three-tier model). Manufacturers must contract with distributors through a franchise agreement. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 1333.83. Distributors are granted exclusive rights to distribute specific brands within their territories, creating localized monopolies over specific products. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4301.241.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">TWG is the third largest wine manufacturer in the United States. Its best known brands include Franzia, Paul Mas-son, Almad\u00e9n, and Inglenook. For the past several decades it has distributed some, but not all, of its wine products under exclusive franchise agreements for various Ohio counties with Tri-County Wholesale Distributors, Inc. and the Bellas Company d/b/a Iron City Distributing (collectively \u201cWine Distributors\u201d). TWG distributes other wine products through other distributors in the counties serviced by the Wine Distributors. Similarly, the Wine Distributors distribute wines (and other products) from other manufacturers besides TWG. TWG\u2019s wines constitute twenty percent and seven percent of wine sales made by Tri-County and Iron City, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">On July 2, 2010, TWG sent the Wine Distributors separate notices that it was terminating their franchises under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1333.84 and 1333.85, effective September 6, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Termination Notices explained that \u201cTWG has concluded that it is in the best interest of the company to consolidate all brands owned, licensed and/or imported by TWG and distributed by Tri-County Distributing with one distributor in the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Ohio.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Terminating the Wine Distributors\u2019 franchises was \u201cpart of an on-going nationwide plan of reorganization of TWG\u2019s distribution network in order to more effectively and efficiently manage\u201d certain product lines in Ohio and nationally. In particular, the Termination Notices referred to Ohio\u2019s mandatory mark-up pricing system. That system requires wine distributors to mark up products by no less than thirty-three percent, guaranteeing significant profit margins to distributors and placing the burden on manufacturers to remain price-competitive. Ohio Admin. Code 4301:1-1-03(C)(2)(b). Reducing distribution redundancies, the Termination Notices explained, provides \u201cthe best opportunity for TWG to reduce costs and thereby maintain and possibly reduce prices to the great benefit of consumers in the State of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Termination Notices described specific factors contributing to TWG\u2019s termination decision, including shipping to four distribution outlets rather than twelve, an enhanced focus on a single distributor\u2019s sales team, better use of its sole Ohio sales representative, the elimination of redundant brand presentations among multiple distributors, consolidated pricing negotiations, diminished overhead in handling customer service and invoicing among multiple distributors, and increased focus and coordination of statewide brands and priorities. In effect, TWG said that it could reduce its costs by dealing with only one Ohio distributor and could increase sales because that distributor had better experience with major retail chains.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">After receipt of the Termination Notices, the Wine Distributors filed a diversity action requesting declaratory and permanent injunctive relief under the theory that TWG\u2019s proposed action would violate the Franchise Act. They also filed motions for a preliminary injunction to enjoin TWG from terminating the franchise agreements during the pendency of the action. The district court granted the Wine Distributors\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that TWG was unlikely to satisfy the \u201cjust cause\u201d termination requirement of the Franchise Act, the Wine Distributors adequately demonstrated irreparable harm, no party would be in a worse position by maintaining the status quo, and the public interest would be benefitted by an injunction. <em>Tri-Cnty. Wholesale Distribs., Inc. v. The Wine Grp., Inc., </em>No. 2:10-cv-693, 2010 WL 3522973, at *8 (S.D.Ohio Sept. 2, 2010). TWG filed this interlocutory appeal on the basis that the district court erred in its findings and abused its discretion in weighing those findings in favor of granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"An7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">When considering an appeal concerning a preliminary injunction, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions, including whether the movant is likely to succeed on the merits, de novo. <em>Certified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., </em>511 F.3d 535, 541 (6th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s ultimate determination as to whether the four preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief is reviewed under a \u201chighly deferential\u201d abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Leary v. Daeschner, </em>228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir.2000)). \u201cThe district court\u2019s determination will be disturbed only if the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applied the governing law, or used an erroneous legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hamilton\u2019s Bogarts, Inc. v. Michigan, </em>501 F.3d 644, 649 (6th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">B. Injunctive Relief under the Ohio Alcoholic Beverage Franchise Act</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As a threshold matter, TWG asks this Court to find that the Franchise Act forbids entry of a preliminary injunction and allows only monetary damages for a violation. We agree with the district court that the Franchise Act does not prohibit a court from issuing a preliminary injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The Franchise Act contemplates suits for \u201cdamages or other <em>relief.\u201d </em>Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 1333.87 (emphasis added). Moreover, numerous courts have issued injunctions preserving the rights of distributors under the Franchise Act until the merits could be fully litigated, a fact that presumably has not escaped the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s notice. <em>See, e.g., InBev USA LLC v. Hill Distrib. Co., </em>No. 2:05-cv-298 [2005 WL 6013027] (S.D.Ohio Mar. 31, 2005) (granting temporary restraining order); <em>Esber Beverage Co. v. Labatt USA Operating Co., </em>No. 2009CV03142 (Stark Cty. Ohio Com. Pl. Dec. 1, 2009) (granting preliminary injunction).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\"><em>Tri-Cnty., </em>2010 WL 3522973, at *2. The Ohio Court of Appeals quoted this very language and wrote: \u201cWe agree. Based upon the language of R.C. 1333.87, we find the trial court did not err in granting injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Esber Bev. Co. v. Heineken USA, Inc., </em>No. 2011CA00033, 2011 WL 5626592, at *5 (Ohio Ct.App. Nov. 14, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">C. Preliminary Injunction Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u201cThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.\u201d <em>Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 542 (quoting <em>Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981)). Given this limited purpose, a party seeking a preliminary injunction \u201cis not required to prove his case in full\u201d under the same procedures and evidentiary requirements that would apply at a trial on the merits. <em>Id. </em>(same). Courts consider four factors when deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction under Federal Rule of Procedure 65:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">(1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">(2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">(3) whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">(4) whether the public interest would be served by the issuance of the injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-15\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tumblebus Inc. v. Cranmer, </em>399 F.3d 754, 760 (6th Cir.2005)). \u201cThese four considerations are \u2018factors to be balanced, not prerequisites that must be met.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones v. City of Monroe, </em>341 F.3d 474, 476 (6th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">For the first factor, we ask whether the Wine Distributors have a strong likelihood of success on the merits under the Franchise Act. We apply Ohio law when considering this question. <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 541. Because the Ohio Supreme Court has not squarely answered the questions presented here, we must \u201cpredict how it would rule, by looking to \u2018all available data,\u2019 including state appellate decisions.\u201d <em>Penton Media, Inc. v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., </em>245 Fed.Appx. 495, 499 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Bovee v. Coo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>pers &amp; Lybrand C.P.A., </em>272 F.3d 356, 361 (6th Cir.2001)). We should not disregard decisions of the Ohio appellate courts unless \u201cwe are presented with persuasive data that the [Supreme Court of Ohio] would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Medlen v. Estate of Meyers, </em>273 Fed.Appx. 464, 470 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Thrifty Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., </em>249 F.3d 450, 454 (6th Cir.2001)); <em>see McFadden v. Cleveland State Univ., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 54, 896 N.E.2d 672, 676 (2008) (quoting Ohio Sup.Ct. R. Rep. Op. 4(B) (\u201cAll court of appeals opinions ... may be cited as legal authority and weighted as deemed appropriate by the courts.\u201d)); <em>cf. Morrison v. B. Braun Med. Inc., </em>663 F.3d 251, 257 n. 1 (6th Cir.2011) (noting that decisions of the Michigan intermediate courts are binding authority under Michigan law).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Franchise Act prohibits manufacturers from terminating a franchise \u201cfor other than just cause.\u201d Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 1333.85. The Franchise Act does not define \u201cjust cause.\u201d Both sides of this dispute cite to cases that they argue support their positions. The Wine Distributors point us to <em>Dayton Heidelberg Distributing Co. v. Vintners International Co. of New York, </em>in which the court held that \u201cjust cause must mean something more than a manufacturer\u2019s unilateral determination that it could make more money if a franchise were terminated.\u201d No. C-3-87-436, 1991 WL 1119912, at *8 (S.D.Ohio Apr. 8, 1991); <em>see also Tri-Cnty. Distrib., Inc. v. Brown Forman Bev. Co., </em>No. 91 C.A. 225, 1993 WL 150297, at *3 (Ohio Ct.App. May 4, 1993) (holding that termination of distributorship for reasons not related to distributor\u2019s performance lacked just cause). TWG relies chiefly on <em>Superior Beverage Co. v. Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>which held that just cause \u201conly requires bare business judgment\u201d and that wrongdoing is sufficient, but not necessary, to meet this standard. Nos. 1:05 CV 0834, 4:05 CV 0868, 2007 WL 2756912, at *6 (N.D.Ohio Sept. 20, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">We disagree with TWG\u2019s argument that these competing cases, which the district court observed to be \u201cirreconcilable,\u201d <em>must </em>preclude a determination that the Wine Distributors are likely to succeed on the merits. In the absence of a definitive determination by the Ohio Supreme Court, our task is to predict how that court would rule in this case. <em>In re Dow Corning Corp., </em>419 F.3d 543, 549 (6th Cir.2005). Sometimes this task is difficult, but here it appears to be easy: The Ohio Court of Appeals recently issued a decision in a ease between TWG and another recipient of the Termination Notice in which the court expressly held that the district court\u2019s order in this case, \u201cand its reliance upon <em>Vintners, </em>is more persuasive than <em>Schieffelin.\u201d Esber Bev. Co. v. Wine Grp., Inc., </em>No. 2011CA00179, 2012 WL 983194, at *5 (Ohio Ct.App. March 19, 2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While this interlocutory appeal of a preliminary injunction requires us to merely predict whether the Wine Distributors are likely to succeed on the merits, <em>Esber </em>was an appeal of a declaratory judgment in which the merits were actually reached. <em>Id. </em>at *1. The <em>Esber </em>court concluded: \u201c[U]nder the analysis and reasoning in <em>The Wine Group </em>and <em>Vintners </em>as to the meaning of just case, reasonable minds can only conclude that TWG\u2019s business reasons for terminating the franchise were not just cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We find no persuasive reasons why the Ohio Supreme Court would reach a different result. The plain language of the Franchise Act states that \u201cjust cause\u201d may not be constituted by \u201c[a] unilateral altera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tion of the franchise by a manufacturer for a reason <em>unrelated to any breach </em>of the franchise or violation of [two statutes].\u201d Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 1383.85(B)(3) (emphasis added). As the district court observed, <em>\u201cVintners </em>gives effect to \u00a7 1333.85(B)(3), whereas <em>Schieffelin </em>does not.\u201d <em>Tri-Cnty., </em>2010 WL 3522973, at *4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, TWG, relying heavily on <em>Schieffelin, </em>makes no attempt to account for this provision. Looking directly at the Franchise Act, we have little trouble concluding that the Wine Distributors have a strong likelihood of success on the merits because the Termination Notices do not suggest any breach or statutory violation but rather appear to implicate precisely the type of conduct implicated by \u00a7 1333.85(B)(3). <em>See Vintners, </em>1991 WL 1119912, at *9 (\u201c[S]ubsection (B)(3) prohibits importers from terminating distributorships simply for purposes of restructuring an existing franchising network, as Vintners did here, absent a breach of duty by the franchisee.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Although TWG cautions us from an \u201cunnecessary ... review of the merits,\u201d <em>Christian Schmidt Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., </em>753 F.2d 1354, 1356 (6th Cir.1985), the factor at issue contemplates a weighing of the parties\u2019 chances at trial by inquiring as to the <em>likelihood </em>of success, rather than its mere possibility. Sometimes this consideration will yield a clear answer even if one court has reached the opposite conclusion. <em>See Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 543-50 (reversing district court\u2019s assessment of this factor after finding non-compete covenant was unambiguous under state law). In fact, this Court has affirmed the issuance of a preliminary injunction based <em>only </em>on this factor upon concluding that the moving party had a \u201cnear certainty\u201d of success on the merits. <em>Mascio v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Sys. of Ohio, </em>160 F.3d 310, 315 (6th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although we conclude that the Wine Distributors appear to have a near certainty of success on the merits due to <em>Esber </em>and the deference which the district court must provide, we will continue to assess the remaining factors. We also note that, despite these assessments, our conclusions of law are not binding at trial on the merits. <em>Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 542 (quoting <em>Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. at 395, 101 5. Ct. 1830).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">2. Irreparable Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">In the second factor of the preliminary injunction analysis we consider whether the Wine Distributors would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction. Such harm must be \u201clikely,\u201d not just possible. <em>Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>555 U.S. 7, 22, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). \u201cA plaintiffs harm from the denial of a preliminary injunction is irreparable if it is not fully compensable by monetary damages.\u201d <em>Cer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>tified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 550 (quoting <em>Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Gov't, </em>305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir.2002)). \u201cHowever, an injury is not fully compensable by money damages if the nature of the plaintiffs loss would make the damages difficult to calculate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Basicomputer Corp. v. Scott, </em>973 F.2d 507, 511 (6th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The district court found the Wine Distributors demonstrated irreparable harm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7n\">TWG\u2019s products comprise a significant portion of Plaintiffs\u2019 sales. Moreover, Plaintiffs have promoted and distributed TWG\u2019s beverages for decades. It is therefore reasonable to infer that Plaintiffs have acquired substantial good will in connection with their distribution of TWG\u2019s products, which include, in TWG\u2019s own words, \u201cseveral unique, high velocity wines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Tri-Cnty., </em>2010 WL 3522973, at *8. We find no error in this analysis. The loss of a product which is \u201cunique\u201d \u2014 a classification effectively conceded by TWG in its Termination Notices \u2014 can cause a drop in customer goodwill. <em>See Ross-Simons of Warwick v. Baccarat, Inc., </em>102 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Tom Doherty </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Saban Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 27, 37 (2d Cir.1995). \u201c[T]his court has recognized that a loss of business goodwill may constitute irreparable harm because of the difficulty in calculating damages.\u201d <em>Langley v. Prudential Mortg. Capital Co., LLC, </em>554 F.3d 647, 649 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Basicomputer Corp., </em>973 F.2d at 512). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the Wine Distributors will likely suffer an irreparable injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">3. Substantial Harm to Others</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The third factor we must consider is whether substantial harm to others will occur if the injunction is granted. The district court weighed this factor in favor of the Wine Distributors because, although a preliminary injunction would \u201cdeny or at least delay the benefits TWG hopes to reap as a result of the ... consolidation plan,\u201d it would only maintain the status quo and would not place TWG, or any other party, \u201cin a worse position than they were in before the injunction.\u201d <em>Tri-Cnty., </em>2010 WL 3522973, at *8. TWG does not challenge this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">4. Public Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The final factor is whether the public interest would be served by granting injunctive relief. The district court found that this factor supported an injunction as well because \u201cgiving effect\u201d to Ohio laws and \u201cpreserving jobs\u201d benefits the public. <em>Id. </em>It gave less weight, but did not completely dismiss, TWG\u2019s position that the lower costs made possible by its proposal would benefit consumers: \u201cGiven the unique nature of alcoholic beverages, which are a blessing to many, but a curse to more than a few, the Court feels less strongly that knocking a quarter off the price of MD 20/20 would provide a measurable benefit to the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">TWG challenges this conclusion. But there is no dispute that the statute the distributors seek to enforce is one that the Ohio legislature passed through the ordinary democratic process. The Franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Act therefore represents the legislature\u2019s judgment that enforcement of the statute is in the public interest. <em>See Golden Gate Rest. Ass\u2019n v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, </em>512 F.3d 1112, 1127 (9th Cir.2008); 11A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2948.4 (2d. ed. 2012) (\u201cThe public interest may be declared in the form of a statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Courts in Ohio have recognized that the Franchise Act was directly intended to create the very results which TWG now claims to be against the public interest. <em>See Esber Bev. Co., </em>2012 WL 983194, at *4 (noting that the possibility of a manufacturer getting \u201clocked into an unprofitable situation\u201d has been determined by the Ohio legislature to be \u201ca business risk which must be assumed by all manufacturers of alcoholic beverages which avail themselves of the rights and privileges of marketing their wares in Ohio\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Bev. Distribs., Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., </em>803 F.Supp.2d 765, 777-78 (S.D.Ohio 2011) (\u201cThe just cause requirement for terminating a franchise agreement is intended to protect the franchisee from this type of arbitrary and potentially coercive act.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We will not second-guess the legislature here because TWG makes no argument that the statute is unconstitutional or even that the statute undermines the public interest. <em>See F.D.I.C. v. Jeff Miller Stables, </em>573 F.3d 289, 301 (6th Cir.2009) (\u201c[O]ur role is to apply Ohio\u2019s resolution of this public policy question, not to second guess the determination.\u201d). The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that it is in the public interest to enforce the Franchise Act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">D. Balancing the Preliminary Injunction Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Upon finding that all of the factors supported the Wine Distributors, the district court naturally concluded that the factors collectively weighed in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. <em>Tri-Cnty., </em>2010 WL 3522973, at *8. Similarly, we hold the court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the factors in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. <em>See Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">E. Sealed Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Having reviewed the analysis of Section IV of the dissent, we are inclined to agree that the parties\u2019 stipulated protective order was overly broad and improperly entered. Because the matter was not fully presented to this court, we remand the issue for consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-12\">. Termination letters were also sent to Glazer's Distributors of Ohio, Inc., and the Hammer Company, both Ohio distributors that appeared as plaintiffs in the action below. Those letters contained identical termination explanations, but included additional grievances specific to the underlying business relationships.

The letters differ only in the distributor recipients designated. For convenience, we refer to the Tri-County Termination Notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. The Wine Distributors submitted this decision to the Court in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter after oral arguments were held. TWG has not responded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-5\">. The district court also noted that the cases relied upon in <em>Schieffelin </em>do not support its conclusion \"because all of the decisions involved some manner of deficient performance by the distributor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">. Having reached this result, we need not reach the question of whether TWG's proposed termination would also violate \u00a7 1333.85(B)(2), which provides that \"restructuring, other than in bankruptcy proceedings, of a manufacturer\u2019s business organization\u201d is also not just.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-12\">. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, we see no indication in <em>Mascio </em>that (1) the likelihood of success was the only factor challenged on appeal or (2) that district courts are not required to consider each factor correctly. In any event, our holding does review all four factors and then balances them in making the determination that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. Even if we agreed with the dissent\u2019s well-reasoned conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in finding irreparable injury, this would not end the inquiry. As the dissent recognizes, the four factors are not preconditions and the \"district court\u2019s ultimate determination as to whether the four preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief\u201d is a different inquiry that must be independently reviewed under a \"highly deferential\u201d abuse of discretion standard. <em>Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b506-12\">Judge JAMES S. GWIN, Northern</author>\n<p id=\"AZv\">District of Ohio (concurring and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">I agree with much of Judge Stranch\u2019s reasoning. First, the majority correctly finds that Ohio law allows the issuance of equitable relief in these beverage distributor cases. Second, Judge Stranch is correct that plaintiffs show a strong likelihood of success on their Franchise Act claim that TWG\u2019s desire to streamline its Ohio distribution structure does not amount to just cause for terminating the franchises. Nevertheless, I disagree that the Wine Distributors have shown sufficient evidence of irreparable injury. Because I believe that injunctions should be disfavored, especially where there has been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>discovery or development of the evidence, and the district court\u2019s clearly erroneous finding of irreparable harm left it unable properly to balance the four requisite preliminary injunction factors, I would find the district court abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Deploying \u201cone of the most drastic tools in the arsenal of judicial remedies,\u201d <em>Hanson Trust PLC v. SCM Corp., </em>774 F.2d 47, 60 (2d Cir.1985), the district court determined that the Wine Distributors were likely to suffer irreparable injury from the loss of TWG product lines before the district court could hold a trial on the merits. The district court found irreparable injury likely without saying which products would, if lost, trigger irreparable injury during the pendency of the litigation, without examining whether the distributors could substitute other franchised products, and without any persuasive explanation why money damages could not remedy any improper franchise cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Under certain conditions, and upon specific evidentiary showings, a movant distributor can prove that a particular product, in a particular market, is so fundamental to her business that the lost product would cause irreparable damage to her customers\u2019 goodwill. <em>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., </em>102 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1996). Yet here, nothing supports such a finding. The district court should have required the Wine Distributors to show \u201cboth certain and immediate, rather than speculative or theoretical\u201d harm. <em>Mich. Coalition of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, </em>945 F.2d 150, 154 (6th Cir.1991). They did not, and the district court should not have issued the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The district court based its finding of irreparable injury on an idle boast in TWG\u2019s termination letter that several of its product lines are \u201cunique.\u201d However, as the term is generally used, it would be difficult to find less \u201cunique\u201d products than the commodity brands commonly associated with TWG, wines whose principal identifying feature is that grocers and wine stores sell them in cardboard boxes with taps to facilitate longtime storage. Though uniqueness, even of TWG\u2019s cardboard-clad brands, might have been credibly asserted with appropriate evidence demonstrating some unique endowment with consumer goodwill, no such showing was made here. No particular brands that might exercise some unique or outsized and incalculable influence in the marketplace were even identified. By excusing the perfunctory, speculative nature of the Wine Distributors\u2019 irreparable injury arguments, the majority minimizes the necessary showing of irreparable injury. Because a district court abuses its discretion when it imposes a pre-trial injunction based on a clearly wrong determination of irreparable harm, I would vacate the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Given the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s adoption of special-interest legislation guaranteeing distributors outsized profits at the consumers\u2019 expense, the majority correctly finds that the wine distributors showed a likelihood of success on their claim that TWG ended their franchises without just cause. Still, the mere likelihood of success does not warrant a preliminary injunction. \u201cA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the movant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.\u201d <em>Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Gov\u2019t, </em>305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir.2002). In deciding whether to jump into a dispute before any discovery has occurred, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>should grant preliminary injunctive relief only if equitable relief is necessary to stave off irreparable harm \u201cpending final hearing.\u201d <em>Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., </em>309 U.S. 310, 316, 60 S.Ct. 517, 84 L.Ed. 774 (1940). Courts should first decide whether interim relief is necessary lest ultimate relief would become moot. Under circumstances such as these, particularly where a party has demanded a jury trial, a district court must \u201cact with caution and restraint.\u201d <em>Day v. Video Connection, </em>602 F.Supp. 100, 103 (N.D.Ohio 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The district court, however, did not exercise caution or restraint. The affidavits supporting the Wine Distributors\u2019 motions for preliminary injunctions were vague and conclusory. Although they bore the burden to prove certain and immediate harm, the Wine Distributors referred only to \u201ccertain TWG brands\u201d and provided no evidence that ending the franchise on these particular products might have amounted to irreparable injury. Their affidavits refer to \u201cthe TWG brands at issue\u201d and, in nearly identical and equally conclusory language, prophesy \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury to [their] business and reputation[s] that cannot be compensated by money damages.\u201d Despite these doomsday pronouncements, the motions and the affidavits left the district court without any facts upon which it could plausibly find anything but a speculative threat of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Irreparable harm can result from franchise cancellations where a particular product has an outsized impact on a distributor\u2019s business model and the distributor shows that the loss of that product line will erode customer goodwill and cause incalculable injury. <em>Baccarat, </em>102 F.3d at 19. Still, this does not excuse a movant from its burden to give testable evidence that the particular product exercises that unique influence, <em>id., </em>or that any associated goodwill will be lost in the absence. <em>Tom Doherty Associates, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 27, 38 (2d Cir.1995) (distinguishing unquantifiable harm from merely speculative harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The Wine Distributors could have carried their burden in two ways. First, they could have offered specific evidence that particular TWG products were unique in ways that would affect the sale of other products that the Wine Distributors distributed. After showing that the loss of some franchise would directly affect other sales, the Wine Distributors could have argued that the associated lost sales of other products were unquantifiable and would cause irreparable injury pending trial unless the parties\u2019 franchise relationship was frozen. Alternatively, the Wine Distributors could show irreparable harm by showing that they had imbued the franchised products with the franchisee\u2019s goodwill, and that goodwill would be forfeited to their successor distributor to the Wine Distributors\u2019 irreparable detriment. The Wine Distributors made no such showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The majority correctly acknowledges that the loss of a unique product \u201ccan cause a drop in customer goodwill.\u201d But \u201cthe plaintiffs showing must possess some substance; a preliminary injunction is not warranted by a tenuous or overly speculative forecast of anticipated harm.\u201d <em>Baccarat, </em>102 F.3d at 19. The district court, however, based its irreparable harm determination on some unproven uniqueness of brands that the distributors never even identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Although TWG boasted in its termination letters that several of its high-velocity wines are \u201cunique,\u201d the plaintiff distributors offered no evidence to show which brands were involved or that they are unique in ways that implicate \u2014 let alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>demonstrably jeopardize \u2014 customer goodwill. \u201cThe fact that a bottle or type of wine is unique does not mean that the loss of the right to sell that wine causes unmeasurable harm.\u201d <em>Excello Wine Co. v. Monsieur Henri Wines, Ltd., </em>474 F.Supp. 203, 210 (S.D.Ohio 1979) (expressing skepticism that any franchise termination would impair any relationships with retailers). Nor does the fact that a unique product might enjoy a prominent national reputation establish that the loss of the product would cause irreparable injury. <em>Caral Corp. v. Taylor Wine Co., </em>No. C-1-80-215, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17753, at *15 (S.D.Ohio July 15, 1980) (\u201cIf that were so, no franchise in any field involving a well known product could ever be terminated without an irreparable damage question and that simply cannot be so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">To show irreparable injury, a movant must present evidence that a product is unique in ways that involve customer goodwill and threaten irreparable harm. When compared with the evidence here, the irreparable-injury finding in <em>Baccarat </em>enjoyed overflowing evidentiary support. Still, the First Circuit considered irreparable injury a \u201cclose question.\u201d In contrast to this case, the <em>Baccarat </em>franchisee showed evidence that the Baccarat crystal brand was an integral component of the movant\u2019s business model, that customers relied on the availability of the Baccarat brand instead of other comparable products, and that the line served as \u201ca beacon to attract potential customers.\u201d <em>Baccarat, </em>102 F.3d at 19. Baccarat, in short, carried its burden to show evidence necessary to support the potential loss of consumer goodwill and the threat of irreparable injury-</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Wine Distributors offered no such evidence. First, nothing suggests that any of the TWG products are not fungible within the market for high-velocity wines. For the deprivation of a supposedly \u201cunique\u201d product to threaten irreparable harm, a movant must make some meaningful showing that another comparable product cannot seamlessly replace the jeopardized brand. <em>Baccarat, </em>102 F.3d at 19 (\u201cRoss-Simons could not simply replace the Baccarat line with some other brand.\u201d); <em>Hill Distrib. Co. v. St. Killian Imp. Co., Inc., </em>No. 2:11-CV-706, 2011 WL 3957255, at *5 (S.D.Ohio Sept. 7, 2011) (\u201cThere is not currently a brand available that could fill the void.\u201d). The characterization of unspecified products as unique \u201cdoes not end our inquiry\u201d because the inability to obtain a particular product \u201cdoes not of itself show that \u2018nothing can answer the justice of the case but the performance of the contract <em>in specie </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>A.L.K. Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., </em>440 F.2d 761, 764 (3d Cir.1971). Trademarked items may be unique, but to the customer may also be wholly fungible with a competitor\u2019s similar item.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Nonetheless, on fungibility, the Wine Distributors say only that within the distribution industry (which they do not further illuminate) \u201cit is very unlikely that [the Wine Distributors] would be able to find a comparable wine product to distribute in place of the TWG brands.\u201d Certainty and imminence this is not; conclusory speculation this very much is. There is simply no evidence to suggest that the \u201ccertain TWG wines\u201d to which the Wine Distributors vaguely refer, however trivially unique they may be, cannot be replaced by equally quaffable alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Moreover, courts must analyze irreparable injury stemming from terminated product lines within particular markets and as to particular products. <em>Baccarat, </em>102 F.3d at 21. Consumer goodwill is not simply sales volume, but whether consumer goodwill is implicated turns on the role and significance of a particular brand with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>in a distributor\u2019s portfolio. <em>Compare Dayton Heidelberg v. Vineyard Brands, </em>108 F.Supp.2d 859 (S.D.Ohio 2000) (loss of specific brands did not cause irreparable injury from lost customer goodwill despite testimony suggested that customers had come to expect the brands\u2019 availability because the wines were an insignificant portion of total sales and other brands could replace those wines), <em>with Esber Bev. Co. v. Labatt USA Op. Co., </em>No. 2009CV03142 (Ohio Ct. Com.Pl. Dec. 1, 2009) (finding irreparable injury threatened by loss of beer supplier\u2019s line that accounted for 90% of a distributor\u2019s products). Where a product is without unusual significance, \u201cit is doubtful that any relationships with retail outlets would be impaired.\u201d <em>Excello, </em>474 F.Supp. at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Wine Distributors failed to show that the elusive TWG products play a significant enough role in their portfolio to implicate customer goodwill or threaten irreparable injury. Though the district court found that TWG products were a significant portion of the Wine Distributors\u2019 sales, that finding is clearly incorrect because the evidence only establishes that the TWG products comprise a significant portion of its customers\u2019 total <em>wine </em>sales. It does nothing to illuminate the significance of TWG products within the Wine Distributors\u2019 portfolios for the purposes of customer goodwill; wine may be only a small portion of their customers\u2019 orders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was insufficient evidence to suggest that particular TWG products play a sufficiently pivotal role in the Wine Distributors\u2019 portfolios, or in their customers\u2019 expectations and purchasing decisions, to threaten irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Another way that the Wine Distributors could have shown irreparable injury from the loss of customer goodwill would have been to show that their promotional efforts added to the products at issue. Customer goodwill reflects the value-addition that a <em>distributor </em>gives the product, and a distributor\u2019s investment in good relations with grocers, convenience stores, off-licenses, and bars could result in greater sales of the franchise products. However, this goodwill is separate and distinct from the goodwill otherwise associated with the product itself. Budweiser will sell huge amounts of beer no matter who distributes it. Likely, distributors have only marginal impact on the product quantities sold. As a result, it is not clear that the terminated distributors will lose any significant goodwill that the district court could not otherwise compensate with a legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Nonetheless, the Wine Distributors could have shown a threat to their earned goodwill \u2014 as distinct from that inherent in their products \u2014 by showing that they sell greater quantities of the products than comparably-situated distributors sell in other areas. If the Wine Distributors had shown that they sell more of the franchised products they could plausibly argue that this relative success would flow to the new franchisee. They could have shown that their efforts resulted in goodwill-enhanced wine sales that the replacement distributor would irreparably capture. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>For example, if the Wine Distributors had achieved a 5% market share for the franchise products within their territories while similarly situated franchisees had only achieved 2% market share in other regions, the Distributors could suggest that they would lose this goodwill to their replacement franchisee. There is precedent for this type of showing. <em>Vineyard Brands, </em>108 F.Supp.2d at 864 (defendant winemaker established sub-par performance by its distributors at an evidentiary hearing on motion for a preliminary injunction). But the plaintiff distributors made no such showing here. Instead, the district court inferred that the Wine Distributors\u2019 history of distributing unidentified TWG products, including \u201cseveral unique, high-velocity wines\u201d engenders consumer goodwill that the termination would irreparably damage. Yet without any evidentiary support, that inference was speculative and inappropriate in any proper determination of irreparable harm. <em>Griepentrog, </em>945 F.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Ohio\u2019s elected representatives have enacted and regularly reinforced a protectionist distribution statute, guaranteeing healthy profit margins and nearly irrevocable local monopolies to in-state distributors. Against this legislative solicitude for distributors, the district court could find that the Wine Distributors made a substantial showing of a likelihood of success on the merits by showing The Wine Group cancelled them without \u201cjust cause.\u201d <em>Esber Bev. Corp. v. Wine Grp., Inc., </em>No. 2011CA00179, 2012 WL 983194 (Ohio Ct.App. March 19, 2012). Nevertheless, in the absence of sufficient evidence that preliminary relief was necessary to stave off irreparable harm, the district court should not have given injunctive relief until the case was fully presented. <em>E.g., InBev USA, LLC v. Hill Dist. Co., </em>No. 2:05-CV-298, ECF Doc. 60, at 2 (S.D.Ohio Sept. 7, 2006) (awarding permanent injunction enjoining a brewer from terminating or altering franchise with distributor following summary judgment for distributor).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">By erring in finding irreparable harm, the district court abused its discretion in imposing a preliminary injunction. The four factors are not preconditions, and we deferentially review a district court\u2019s balancing of correctly determined factors for abuse of discretion. <em>Certified Restoration, </em>511 F.3d at 541. However, an error of law or fact on the individual factors themselves is abuse of discretion. <em>See Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go, Ltd., </em>370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s discretion is not unbridled and \u201c[ajbuse occurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.\u201d) (quoting <em>Indep. Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Regardless how certain that a movant is likely to succeed on the merits, we must weigh that determination against a correct evaluation of the threat of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The majority reads <em>Mascio </em>for the proposition that this court can affirm a preliminary injunction on the basis the first factor alone, but that is only necessarily true where, as in <em>Mascio, </em>the likelihood of success was the only factor challenged on appeal. I do not read <em>Mascio </em>to end a district court\u2019s obligation to consider the second factor correctly, or to establish that a reviewing court does not properly disturb a district court\u2019s balancing of factors \u201cwhere the district court relied upon clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ly incorrect findings of fact.\u201d <em>Mascio, </em>160 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally and on a largely unargued point, the district court should not have sealed pleadings and exhibits without making constitutionally required findings to justify concealing court documents from the public. The public holds a qualified constitutional right of access to court documents that extends well beyond judicial opinions. The First Amendment access right extends to court dockets, records, pleadings, and exhibits, and establishes a presumption of public access that can only be overcome by specific, on-the-record findings that the public\u2019s interest in access to information is overcome by specific and compelling showings of harm. <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 13-14, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986); <em>see also In re Application of Nat\u2019l Broad. Co., </em>828 F.2d 340, 345 (6th Cir.1987) (district court made inadequately specific findings that compelling interests favored closure). The right attaches to civil proceedings, <em>Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 681, 695-96 (6th Cir.2002), and constitutional standards apply not only to courtroom proceedings, but to dockets, pleadings, and documents attached to pleadings. <em>See Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, </em>380 F.3d 83, 92 (2d Cir.2004); <em>In re New York Times Co., </em>828 F.2d 110, 114 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The sealing and protective orders issued here make none of the required findings. TWG moved to file its brief in opposition under seal, saying only that \u201c[cjertain documents attached as exhibits to and discussed in TWG\u2019s Brief are stamped \u2018Confidential\u2019 \u201d The next day a magistrate judge entered a four-line Order finding simply that \u201cthe motion sets forth good cause\u201d and sealing the brief and exhibits. Simultaneously, the parties filed a joint proposed protective order providing that they will file self-designated confidential documents under seal. That proposed order was entered by a magistrate judge three days later, and the Wine Distributors promptly filed their reply, and several exhibits, under seal. The district court accomplished this without any specific findings of harm, without any balancing of the public\u2019s interest against the parties\u2019, and with no evident attempt at narrow tailoring. By way of showing the overbreadth of the sealed documents, it should suffice to note that among them is an Ohio trial court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The protective order is unconstitutionally overbroad and abdicates the court\u2019s responsibility to preserve the public\u2019s access right, which it effectively \u201cturn[ed] over to the parties.\u201d <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust Co., </em>78 F.3d 219, 227 (6th Cir.1996) (vacating protective order). Beyond vacating the preliminary injunction, I would vacate the parties\u2019 stipulated protective order and permit the parties to move the district court for appropriate redactions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b510-5\">.
