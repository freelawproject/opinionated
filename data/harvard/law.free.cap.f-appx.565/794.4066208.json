Because Jones\u2019s complaint was incomprehensible and failed to allege facts establishing the District Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the District Court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend. Jones filed an amended complaint, which did not cure the pleading deficiencies of the original complaint. Bank of America moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)\u2019s \u201cshort and plain statement of the grounds for the court\u2019s [subject matter] jurisdiction,\u201d and the court granted the motion with leave to amend. In its order, the court informed Jones that, if he filed a second amended complaint, the complaint would have to contain allegations establishing \u201cdiversity\u201d jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, specifically, an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000, or federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, that is, a \u201ccause of action arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d Record, Vol. 1 at Tab 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-19\">Jones filed a second amended complaint. Bank of America and Champion Mortgage Company each moved to dismiss it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The District Court assumed that the parties were diverse for purposes of diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332, but concluded that the second amended complaint\u2019s allegations failed to establish an amount in controversy that exceeded $75,000, as \u00a7 1332 requires. Citing <em>\u201cSan Fran. Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm., </em>483 U.S. 522, 542, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>L.Ed.2d 427 (1987) (the fundamental inquiry is whether there is a \u2018governmental actor to whom the prohibitions of the Constitution apply\u2019),\u201d the court found nothing in Jones\u2019s allegations indicating governmental involvement in his purported injury, so the second amended complaint failed to establish \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction. The District Court therefore dismissed the second amended complaint, without prejudice, under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Record, Vol. 1 at Tab 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Jones, still proceeding <em>pro se </em>appeals the dismissal. He concedes that his second amended complaint fails to establish diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332. Jones does not concede that the second amended complaint fails to establish federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, but we hold that it does; it fails to allege governmental involvement in his alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
