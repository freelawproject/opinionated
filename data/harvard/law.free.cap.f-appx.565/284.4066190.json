Because Fajardo did not object to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, Fajardo has the burden of demonstrating er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ror that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Fajardo maintains that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to provide adequate deterrence, protect the public, or effectuate any of the other sentencing goals outlined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He further maintains that the district court\u2019s erroneous imposition of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1b)(5)(B) four-level enhancement for brandishing a weapon during the offense contributed to the substantively unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Fajardo challenged the finding that he brandished a weapon in the district court, he concedes that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to make such finding based on information contained in the presentence report. Fajardo also argues that the district court failed to consider the significant hardship his sentence would have on his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The district court\u2019s comments during sentencing reflect that it properly made an individualized assessment of the facts in the case by considering the mitigating arguments of counsel and the 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, the within-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d 209, 214 (2013). Fajardo has not rebutted the presumption because he has not shown that the district court failed to consider a significant factor, considered an improper factor, or committed a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>Fajardo therefore has not demonstrated that the district court committed clear or obvious error in imposing the 70-month sentence. <em>See Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d at 214. Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. Fajardo\u2019s total offense level was 21 (including four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B)), and his sentencing guideline range was 70-87 months. Fajardo does not contest the calculation of the guideline range, or the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, acknowledging instead that we have upheld \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B) enhancements in similar circumstances as the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
