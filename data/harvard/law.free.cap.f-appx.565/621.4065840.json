Pierce appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, upholding the denial of her application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-18\">1. The ALJ articulated germane reasons for giving little weight to the opinion of Pierce\u2019s counselor, Timothy Dove. <em>See Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir.2012). The ALJ adopted the opinion of the medical expert because she was the only acceptable medical source who reviewed Pierce\u2019s entire medical record. The ALJ permissibly rejected Dove\u2019s opinion because it was inconsistent with Dove\u2019s treatment notes and care plan and because its extreme characterization of Pierce\u2019s limitations was not supported by the medical record. <em>See id. </em>at 1112; <em>Turner v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>613 F.3d 1217, 1224 (9th Cir.2010). Pierce\u2019s inability to afford alternative mental health treatment does not invalidate this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-19\">2. The ALJ did not give sufficiently specific, clear and convincing reasons for discrediting Pierce\u2019s testimony regarding the number of days she is debilitated by depression or a manic episode. <em>See Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 883 (9th Cir.2006). Her testimony that she is debilitated several days per month would, if credited, establish that she is disabled. The ALJ apparently rejected this testimony because it was not supported by the medical record, but an ALJ may not disregard a claimant\u2019s testimony on this basis when the testimony concerns the severity of symptoms that her underlying impairment could reasonably be expected to cause. <em>See id. </em>at 883-84. The other reasons the ALJ offered also were not sufficiently specific to Pierce\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of this symptom. <em>See Vasquez v. Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 586, 591-92 (9th Cir.2009). We decline to apply the \u201ccredit-as-true\u201d rule in this case and reverse and remand with instructions to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>mand to the agency for further determinations on an open record regarding how often Pierce is debilitated by depression or a manic episode. <em>See Connett v. Barnhart, </em>340 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.2003). The ALJ may take more evidence if it would be useful, but is not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">3. The remainder of the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
