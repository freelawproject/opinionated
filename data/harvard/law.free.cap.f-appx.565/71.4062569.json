Because no substantial question is raised by the appeal, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. We may affirm a district court for any reason supported by the record. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">Olopade filed a document in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, seeking a declaration that he is a United States national.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court entered an order informing Olopade that the action was not proper under \u00a7 2241 because he was not seeking release from custody,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thus the filing would be construed as a complaint seeking declaratory relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. After granting Olopade\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauper-is, the Court screened the complaint and determined that it should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Olopade timely appealed the District Court\u2019s order. The Government moved to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment; Olopade has filed a response in opposition to summary action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">When a District Court grants a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, it should screen the complaint to determine whether it states a claim upon which relief may be granted. If the complaint fails to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>claim, the Court should dismiss it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). While we normally require a court to give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend, a complaint may be dismissed without allowing such an opportunity if amendment would be futile. <em>Day v. Florida, </em>563 Fed.Appx. 878, 880, 2014 WL 1610458 (3d Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Here, the District Court determined that Olopade\u2019s claim for a judicial declaration of citizenship was not properly before it, as the statute governing such claims prohibits a person from bringing such a claim \u201cif the issue of such person\u2019s status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with any removal proceeding ..., or (2) is in issue in any such removal proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a). Olopade raised his claim of U.S. citizenship in his removal proceedings, but the Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals rejected his claim. Dist. Ct. Op. at 2 (citing <em>In re: Anthony Olopade, </em>2010 WL 4035443 (BIA Sept. 21, 2010)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Rios-Valenzuela v. DHS, </em>506 F.3d 393, 399 (5th Cir.2007), the Court declined to read \u00a7 1503\u2019s \u201cexception as forever hanging an albatross around the neck of those who first raise citizenship as a defense in a removal proceeding.\u201d Rather, the Court determined that if \u201ca citizenship claim finds <em>its genesis </em>outside of the context of removal proceedings, the exception is no bar to jurisdiction; thus, for example, once removal proceedings have run their full course and terminated, any future citizenship claim would not arise in those removal proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added, footnotes omitted). <em>Id. </em>Although Olopade\u2019s removal proceedings have terminated, the genesis of Olopade\u2019s citizenship claim was a defense he raised to a removal order. <em>See In re: Anthony Olopade, </em>2010 WL 4035443 (BIA Sept. 21, 2010); <em>see also Rios-Valenzuela, </em>506 F.3d at 398-99 (jurisdictional bar applies where the particular citizenship claim \u201carose\u201d in removal proceeding, even if those proceedings have ended; if person loses in removal proceedings, appropriate means for judicial review is through petition for review).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">As noted, the District Court determined that Olopade\u2019s action was not proper as a \u00a7 2241 petition. But persons have long enjoyed the right to have their citizenship claims determined in habeas proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Ng Fung Ho v. White, </em>259 U.S. 276, 285, 42 S.Ct. 492, 66 L.Ed. 938 (1922); <em>Bagot v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 252, 255 (3d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the REAL ID Act stripped federal courts of habeas jurisdiction over petitions for review of removal orders, <em>see Kumarasamy v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 169, 172 n. 5 (3d Cir.2006), the Act did not specifically preclude habeas review over claims of citizenship raised outside of the context of a challenge to a removal order. <em>Cf. Flores-Torres v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 708, 712 n. 6 (9th Cir.2008) (noting that \u00a7 1252(b)(9) \u201cdoes not provide a \u2018clear statement\u2019 foreclosing habeas review\u201d of a challenge to immigration detention based on pre-final-removal-order claim of citizenship); <em>Verde-Rodriguez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>734 F.3d 198, 206-07 (3d Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>2013) (REAL ID Act does not foreclose habeas jurisdiction to challenge something other than a final order of removal); <em>see generally INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (explicit direction from Congress required before courts will construe statutes as limiting habeas relief). We need not determine whether the District Court retained habeas jurisdiction to consider Olopade\u2019s claim, however, as the petition was properly dismissed as being without merit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In his complaint (or habeas petition), Olopade claimed that he had registered for the selective service, and that he had applied for citizenship. He argued that \u201che is a United States Citizen because he completed all that was required him to do to become a United States Citizen, except the ceremonial swearing of the proceeding where he would have been given his certificate of Citizenship.\u201d Complaint at 3. In <em>Salim v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 307, 310 (3d Cir.2003), we held that a person cannot be declared a national based on a citizenship application; rather, \u201cfor one ... who is a citizen of another country, nothing less than citizenship will show \u2018permanent allegiance to the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(22)). We cited with approval <em>Perdomo-Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 964, 969 (9th Cir.2003), which held that a person can only become a national through birth or through <em>completing </em>the naturalization process. <em>Salim, </em>350 F.3d at 309. Olopade, by his own admission, never completed the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Olopade cited two cases in his complaint in support of his contention that he should be declared a U.S. citizen: <em>In re: Petition of Tubig in Behalf of Tubig, </em>559 F.Supp. 2, 4 (N.D.Cal.1981), and <em>Harriott v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.Supp.2d 538, 545 (E.D.Pa.2003). He stated that the courts in those cases \u201cgranted the petitioners [sic] request and declared them Citizenships [sic] based on the agency\u2019s delay in processing their Citizenship applieation[s].\u201d Complaint at 4-5. We are not bound by the decisions of district courts, but in any event, the cases are inapposite. First, both cases involved a person seeking to derive citizenship from a parent; a process that happens by operation of law if the parent has completed certain steps before the child\u2019s 18th birthday; <em>ie., </em>unlike Olopade\u2019s situation, the person seeking citizenship did not personally have to do anything. Second, both cases granted relief based on equitable estoppel, holding that the agency\u2019s delay was equivalent to affirmative misconduct. <em>Tubig, </em>559 F.Supp. at 3-4; <em>Harriott, </em>277 F.Supp.2d at 544; <em>but see Mustanich v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1084, 1089 (9th Cir.2008) (interpreting <em>INS v. Pangilinan, </em>486 U.S. 875, 108 S.Ct. 2210, 100 L.Ed.2d 882 (1988), as precluding establishment of citizenship by estoppel where statutory requirements for naturalization have not been satisfied). Olopade\u2019s complaint did not allege any delay on the part of the agency. Instead, he complained about representations by the Department of Homeland Security that he believes influenced the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings. Olopade\u2019s allegations suggest negligence, at best, and not affirmative misconduct on the part of the Government. <em>Mudric v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>469 F.3d 94, 99 (3d Cir.2006) (petitioner \u201cmust establish (1) a misrepresentation; (2) upon which he reasonably relied; (3) to his detriment; and (4) affirmative misconduct\u201d to establish equitable estoppel claim against Government in immigration context).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Because the declaratory judgment matter was not properly before the District Court, and because there was no merit in a habeas claim that Olopade might bring, the District Court properly dismissed the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>plaint. For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-13\">. A \"national\u201d is \"(A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(22).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\">. We need not decide whether the District Court should have considered the claim in the context of a habeas proceeding, because Olopade\u2019s claims are without merit, as explained herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-21\">. We also have the benefit of Olopade\u2019s document titled, \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Appellant's Opening Brief.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. The District Court also noted that Olopade had unsuccessfully raised the same claims in an action filed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. <em>See Olopade v. Ashcroft, </em>Civ. No. 4:04-cv-0035 (N.D.Ohio Apr. 5, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. We take judicial notice that Olopade has had such judicial review. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit considered and rejected his citizenship claim raised in his petition for review. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 04-2706 (1st Cir. July 7, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">. Olopade is in custody pursuant to a criminal conviction, but the fact that he is subject to a final removal order may suffice to meet the \"in custody\u201d requirements for habeas jurisdiction. <em>Jordon v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>424 F.3d 320, 324 n. 6 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
