Doty, died on or about October 25, 2013, after the appeal was filed. We grant the motion of her appointed personal representative, Loretta Gail Cole, to be substituted as Plaintiff-Appellant in this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 43(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AQI\">JOHN C. PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">After the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDHS) terminated her Medicaid benefits, Theta L. Doty sought administrative review of the termination decision. While her administrative appeal to the Chief Administrative Officer of OKDHS was pending, she filed this civil rights suit in federal court against the defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to restore her benefits. Before the civil rights suit was tried or any affirmative relief granted to Ms. Doty, the Chief Administrative Officer of OKDHS decided the administrative proceeding in her favor, awarding her full retroactive and ongoing benefits. Over Ms. Doty\u2019s objection, the district court then dismissed the federal action as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">Ms. Doty\u2019s attorneys subsequently applied in the district court for an award of $26,010 in attorney\u2019s fees, representing work performed on her behalf in federal court. She sought these fees as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b)(providing that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs ... \u201d). The district court denied her application for fees, concluding that she was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to fees within the meaning of \u00a7 1988. She appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cWhether a litigant qualifies as a \u2018prevailing party\u201d under a fee-shifting statute such as \u00a7 1988 is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Kansas Judicial Watch v. Stout, </em>653 F.3d 1230, 1235 (10th Cir.2011). Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the applicable law under this standard of review, we conclude the district court properly denied Ms. Doty\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
