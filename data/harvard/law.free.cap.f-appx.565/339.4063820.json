The district court varied or der parted upward from the guidelines imprisonment range in sentencing Kinabrew to a 72-month term of imprisonment. Kinabrew contends that the sentence was predicated improperly on the erroneous and unsupported finding that the sentences imposed for eight of her prior convictions were unusually lenient. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for procedural error and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">The record reflects that, in varying from the guidelines imprisonment range, the district court was concerned with the persistence and escalating level of Kinabrew\u2019s criminality. It expressly considered the statutory sentencing factors of punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This court \u201cowes deference to the district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Kinabrew cannot show that the district court abused its discretion in varying upward from the guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
