We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">To the extent that Wynder challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>that challenge is without merit. \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Steginsky v. Xcelera Inc., </em>741 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir.2014). This Court has recognized on several occasions, even prior to Wynder\u2019s initiation of this action, that individuals are not liable in Title VII cases. <em>See Sassaman v. Gamache, </em>566 F.3d 307, 315 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201cindividuals are not subject to liability under Title VII\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Gierlinger v. Gleason, </em>160 F.3d 858, 867 (2d Cir.1998). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Wynder\u2019s Title VII claim against defendants here, who are all individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">Wynder next argues that the district court should have granted his motion to file a fourth amended complaint to add New York State as a defendant with respect to his Title VII claim. \u201cThe standard for reviewing the denial of a motion to amend a complaint is abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that leave to amend should be freely granted when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., </em>445 F.3d 161, 177 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[L]eave to amend a pleading may <em>only </em>be given when factors such as undue delay or undue prejudice to the opposing party are absent.\u201d <em>SCS Commc\u2019n, Inc. v. Herrick Co., </em>360 F.3d 329, 345 (2d Cir.2004). Here, Wynder has offered no persuasive reason why he waited almost three years after the dismissal of his Title VII claim to move to amend his complaint to add New York State as a proper defendant. Nor does Wynder explain why he failed to add New York State as a defendant during the first occasions on which he amended his complaint. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend his complaint a fourth time.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">Plaintiff also argues that the district court\u2019s decision imposing sanctions on Wynder\u2019s counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 should be reversed. \u201c[W]e review the sanctions order for abuse of discretion, to ensure that the district court\u2019s sanctions are not based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>of the evidence.\u201d <em>Enmon v. Prospect Capital Corp., </em>675 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To impose sanctions under Section 1927, \u201ca court must find clear evidence that (1) the offending party\u2019s claims were entirely without color, and (2) the claims were brought in bad faith \u2014 that is, motivated by improper purposes such as harassment or delay.\u201d <em>Eisemann v. Greene, </em>204 F.3d 393, 396 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions in this case: Wynder\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to file a fourth amended complaint was wholly meritless, and the district court made sufficient findings to support a conclusion that the filing of that motion must have been in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">With respect to the district court\u2019s decision granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Wynder raises two main issues: (1) that his claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and his equal protection claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 should have survived summary judgment; and (2) that a decision of the State of New York Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) should have been given preclusive effect in this case. As to Wynder\u2019s claims under Sections 1981 and 1983, his brief fails to comply with the requirements set forth in Rule 28(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Rule 28.1 of the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Accordingly, with respect to those claims, we decline to \u201cform an argument for [the appellant], by looking into the record to document the \u2018facts\u2019 ... and then examining various combinations of these facts in the light of the legal doctrines he ... mentions.\u201d <em>Sioson v. Knights of Columbus, </em>303 F.3d 458, 460 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We will address plaintiffs argument about the potential preclusive effect of the Board\u2019s decision because his brief sets forth the relevant issues, albeit in a cursory manner. Our standard of review of such issues is de novo. <em>See Matusick v. Erie Cnty. Water Auth., </em>757 F.3d 31, 44-45, 2014 WL 700718, at *8 (2d Cir. Feb. 25, 2014). \u201c[I]n order to have preclusive effect over a subsequent fact-finding or legal analysis, a prior administrative determination must have resolved the identical issue, and the issue must have been actually and finally decided in the prior adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, *9. Because Wynder does not state which claims or issues in this case should be subject to the preclusive effect of the Board\u2019s decision, we will assume that his argument relates to his claims under Sections 1981 and 1983. With respect to each of those claims, plaintiff must prove that defendants acted with discriminatory intent. <em>See Reynolds v. Barrett, </em>685 F.3d 193, 201 (2d Cir.2012). The Board did not conclude that any of the individual defendants in this case acted with discriminatory racial animus. Accordingly, the issue in this case with regard to plaintiffs claims under Sections 1981 and 1983 was not decided by the Board and, therefore, the Board\u2019s decision need not be afforded preclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We have considered the remainder of Wynder\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the orders and judgment of the district court hereby are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
