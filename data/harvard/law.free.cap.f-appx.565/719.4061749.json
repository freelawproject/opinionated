GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">After his conviction for aggravated battery under state law was affirmed on direct appeal, Leo Duran filed a habeas petition in state court. In it Mr. Duran argued that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial because his lawyer failed to raise any argument about his sanity or mental health. Though Mr. Duran asked for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded one wasn\u2019t necessary and dismissed his petition. The New Mexico Supreme Court declined to review the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">Mr. Duran then renewed his complaint in federal court, filing a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). For its part, the district court granted Mr. Duran\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing but ultimately denied relief. The bases for its decision are detailed extensively in a 26-page magistrate judge\u2019s report and a 24-page opinion by the district judge. Though Mr. Duran sought and obtained a certificate of appealability to appeal, at the end of the day we can find no lawful basis to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">Federal courts generally cannot overturn a state court decision that denies habeas relief after an \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d unless \u201cthe adjudication of the claim \u2014 (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>law ... [or] (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Of course, a state court\u2019s disposition of a claim warrants such deference only if it \u201cadjudicated\u201d the petitioner\u2019s claim \u201con the merits.\u201d Otherwise, our review is typically de novo. <em>See Hain v. Gibson, </em>287 F.3d 1224, 1229 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We note all this because the parties wrangle extensively over the standard of review they wish us to apply to this case. Mr. Duran says we should review his Sixth Amendment claim de novo because it was never adjudicated on the merits by the state trial court. It wasn\u2019t adjudicated on the merits, he says, because the state trial court refused his request for an evidentiary hearing and failed to consider an important piece of evidence \u2014 a psychologist\u2019s report written by Dr. Richard Fink suggesting that Mr. Duran was not on antipsychotic medication at the time of the assault, \u201cmight meet the minimum standards for an insanity defense,\u201d and \u201cmight not have been able to form specific intent,\u201d though the report also went on to find Mr. Duran competent to stand trial. In support of his arguments for de novo review, Mr. Duran points us to <em>Wilson v. Workman, </em>577 F.3d 1284 (10th Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">New Mexico, meanwhile, insists the state trial court <em>did </em>consider Dr. Fink\u2019s report. At the same time, the State disputes the idea that an \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d depends on whether an evidentiary hearing is held or whether a state court happens to consider this or that piece of evidence. In support of its arguments for a more deferential standard of review, New Mexico points us to <em>Lott v. Trammell, </em>705 F.3d 1167, 1211-14 (10th Cir.2013), as well as <em>Johnson v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1088, 185 L.Ed.2d 105 (2013) and <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). <em>See also Wilson v. Trammell, </em>706 F.3d 1286 (10th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Ultimately, however, the parties\u2019 dispute over the standard of review doesn\u2019t make a difference. Even if we review Mr. Duran\u2019s claim de novo and consider all the evidence he amassed in the federal evidentiary hearing, he still cannot prevail. The magistrate judge\u2019s and the district court\u2019s extensive opinions already do much to explain why this is so, leaving us here to offer only a couple supplementary points.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">To establish a Sixth Amendment claim, a petitioner must overcome a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Absent such a showing, \u201cit cannot be said that the conviction ... resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">And that leads to our first point. Counsel\u2019s performance in the state aggravated battery trial may not have been ideal, but neither can we say it amounted to a breakdown of the adversary process. Mr. Duran notes that his trial counsel candidly admitted at the federal evidentiary hearing that he might not have read the report from Dr. Fink that he (counsel) had commissioned. And it is this, Mr. Duran says, that amounts to deficient performance: in his view, counsel should have spent more time and effort investigating a potential mental health defense. The problem is, the extensive record prepared by the district court reveals a good many facts that support counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue a mental health defense in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Here is a sample of those facts. As it turns out, the public defender in Mr. Duran\u2019s state court aggravated battery case was <em>already </em>familiar with Mr. Duran thanks to his representation of Mr. Duran in other cases where he had <em>already </em>investigated Mr. Duran\u2019s mental health. Indeed, the same lawyer had only recently persuaded the government to accept in another case a plea of guilty but mentally ill. Meanwhile, counsel had found that definitive psychological evaluations of Mr. Duran had \u201calways come back competent.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And after carefully reviewing the facts associated with this new charge, the lawyer found that it provided a poor candidate for a mental health defense \u2014 and worried that such a defense could alienate jurors. He came to this conclusion because he thought the facts here showed pretty clearly that the attack was deliberate and calculated. The facts showed that Mr. Duran and another inmate were in court for arraignment where Mr. Duran learned the other man faced charges of sexually assaulting a child. Later, after the pair were transported to a jail facility, Mr. Duran punched the other man once in the face, telling him \u201c[tjhat\u2019s what happens to baby molesters.\u201d The whole episode was captured on videotape. Finally, counsel explained that he thought these facts suggested a different much more promising line of defense \u2014 an argument that a single punch doesn\u2019t rise to the level of \u201caggravated\u201d battery under New Mexico law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In light of this fuller view of the facts, we cannot say Mr. Duran\u2019s counsel lacked reasonable grounds for declining to investigate an insanity or mental health defense in this case. Mr. Duran\u2019s lawyer made his decision based on past familiarity with the defendant\u2019s mental health history. He made it based on a reasoned judgment that contesting Mr. Duran\u2019s sanity or ability to form specific intent wasn\u2019t likely to succeed given the particular facts of the case and could backfire with jurors. He made it based on an assessment, too, that other more promising lines of investigation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Sixth Amendment does not require an attorney to investigate every possible avenue of research to the ends of the Earth. Instead, it requires an attorney \u201cto make a reasonable investigation in preparing his defense,\u201d and that \u201cinclud[es] reasonably deciding when to cut off further investigation.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Roper, </em>460 F.3d 1026, 1034 (8th Cir.2006); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052. That\u2019s what happened here. Defense counsel made a reasoned judgment about the most promising lines of avenue he should pursue in an effort to secure an acquittal. Like any such tactical judgment, this one might be questioned in hindsight but that does not mean it is necessarily unreasoned or unreasonable. <em>See generally United States v. Ringer, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 820, 822 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Mr. Duran replies by directing us to <em>Bouchillon v. Collins, </em>907 F.2d 589 (5th Cir.1990). But that case stands for the proposition that an attorney can\u2019t abandon his client\u2019s only plausible defense if he conducts no investigation whatsoever into that line of argument, especially when he is on notice it might be a fruitful one and he has little reason to think it would fail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 597. Here, by contrast, Mr. Duran\u2019s attorney was aware of his client\u2019s mental problems and the evidence he could have used to prove them. Further, counsel didn\u2019t abandon what he thought was his client\u2019s only viable defense; he believed he had another, better argument and that a mental health defense could prove counterproductive given the facts of the case at hand. Simply put, <em>Bouchillon </em>bears no meaningful resemblance to our case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">That takes us to our second observation. To succeed on a Sixth Amendment claim a petitioner must show not only deficient performance. He must also show that but for that deficient performance a reasonable probability exists that the result of his trial would\u2019ve been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052. And that requirement too poses a problem for Mr. Duran. Mr. Duran says his lawyer should\u2019ve investigated further a possible insanity or mental health defense. Yet it was his burden at the federal evidentiary hearing to show what a proper investigation would have yielded and how it was reasonably probable to have made a difference at his trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, </em>900 F.2d 1462, 1472-73 (10th Cir.1990) (\u201c[T]he defendant bears the burden of proving that his counsel\u2019s performance was ... prejudicial within the meaning of <em>Strickland\u201d). </em>This he has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Before this court Mr. Duran has not attempted to show what a \u201cproper\u201d investigation into his mental health would\u2019ve yielded besides Dr. Fink\u2019s report. Put differently, the <em>only </em>thing Mr. Duran argues an adequate investigation would\u2019ve yielded is a thorough review by trial counsel of Dr. Fink\u2019s report. Yet that report indicated Mr. Duran <em>was </em>competent and only <em>might </em>have a mental health defense\u2014 what Mr. Duran\u2019s state court counsel not unreasonably described as a \u201cwishywashy\u201d conclusion. Missing here is any evidence that a proper investigation would have yielded more than Dr. Fink\u2019s equivocations, let alone an expert willing to testify that Mr. Duran <em>was </em>insane or unable to form the requisite mens rea for the crime with which he was charged. Given that omission, we cannot say Mr. Duran has carried his burden of establishing a reasonable probability that the outcome of his battery trial would have been different even if counsel had studied Dr. Fink\u2019s report in depth. <em>See United States v. Rushin, </em>642 F.3d 1299, 1310 (10th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\">. We recognize, of course, that competence and sanity are different things, and that a defendant who is found competent to stand trial may also have been insane (or unable to form specific intent) at the time he committed the crime. <em>See Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 448-49, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992). At the same time, the two are no doubt related, as a defendant\u2019s ability to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and assist his attorney may speak to his overall mental health.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
