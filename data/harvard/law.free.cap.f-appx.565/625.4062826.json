Reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2007), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">Rivera-Jimenez argues that the BIA abused its discretion in conducting an independent analysis of Rivera-Jimenez\u2019s social group claim. This argument is without merit. The BIA is permitted to review de novo questions of law in appeals from the decision of an IJ. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); <em>Brezilien v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 403, 412 n. 3 (9th Cir.2009). Where the BIA conducts a de novo review, \u201c[a]ny error committed by the IJ will be rendered harmless by the Board\u2019s application of the correct legal standard.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995). Here, the BIA acted well within its authority to review Rivera-Jimenez\u2019s social group claim de novo and did not abuse its discretion in denying Rivera-Jimenez\u2019s motion to reconsider on this ground,</p>\n<p id=\"b647-23\">Rivera-Jimenez also argues for the first time on appeal that the IJ and BIA erred in failing to review his claim of past persecution from the perspective of a child, as required by <em>Hernandez-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir.2007). Although Rivera-Jimenez was a minor when he was allegedly persecuted, he failed to raise this argument before the BIA when he filed his motion to reconsider. Accordingly, Rivera-Jimenez has not exhausted this legal claim and the court is without jurisdiction to review it. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010) (holding there is no jurisdiction to review legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>claims not presented by the petitioner before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
