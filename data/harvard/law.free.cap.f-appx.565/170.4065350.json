Underwood was originally drawn into the purview of the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) because her husband, Travis Harrell, was the subject of an investigation by its child protective services. Following an ex parte proceeding accom-</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">panied by a series of concededly sloppy paperwork, DHHR removed Underwood\u2019s children from her physical custody without court ratification or the setting of a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eventually, after Underwood conceded medical neglect and was unable to demonstrate improvement during a probationary period, the Circuit Court of Berkeley County, West Virginia terminated her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-20\">Underwood then filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that DHHR had committed serious procedural improprieties while handling her case. The circuit court found cause to believe that DHHR had indeed violated Underwood\u2019s due process rights \u201cwhen custody of the Infants was removed from her without court notification and without setting a date for a preliminary hearing[.]\u201d J.A. 138. Notwithstanding this finding, however, the court denied Underwood\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It found that during the subsequently-imposed improvement period, Underwood had not demonstrated sufficient progress to justify a return of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">Underwood timely appealed and filed a writ of habeas corpus for the return of her children in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Building off the circuit court\u2019s holding, she argued that DHHR had violated her federal due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and under West Virginia law. According to Underwood, the entirety of the flawed termination proceedings, including her concession of medical neglect, flowed from the improvident removal of her children, such that the DHHR actions poisoned the ultimate termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>On September 26, 2011, the state supreme court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s order and denied Underwood\u2019s petition. The judgment rested primarily on the court\u2019s differing interpretation of the events that transpired during Underwood\u2019s court appearances, Specifically, the court held that DHHR had never relinquished legal custody of Underwood\u2019s children (rather, only physical custody had been restored) and that Underwood had waived certain process rights. It concluded that \u201cthe record shows that petitioner\u2019s due process rights were not violated ... despite the circuit court\u2019s finding [otherwise].\u201d J.A. 455B. Underwood\u2019s parental rights having been terminated, DHHR subsequently arranged for the legal adoption of the children, which, as we were advised by counsel at oral argument, has been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Underwood\u2019s instant lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of West Virginia on July 25, 2011, alleges the same nucleus of facts litigated in the state courts. Her amended complaint contained seven counts, including Count III, which alleges claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that Appellees deprived Underwood of due process, and Count V-A, which alleges that the West Virginia Abuse and Neglect Statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Underwood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment. After several rounds of briefing, the district court granted DHHR\u2019s motion and denied Underwood\u2019s motion. <em>Underwood v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Serv., </em>No. 11-00506, 2013 WL 2319253 (S.D.W.Va. May 28, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and having carefully reviewed the briefs, record, and applicable law, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis as set forth in its well-reasoned memorandum. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-15\">.
