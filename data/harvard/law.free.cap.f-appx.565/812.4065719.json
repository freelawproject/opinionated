After the alleged crime, Smith got into an SUV with five other people, including the driver, Corey Ward. Bunn fired two shots at the SUV as it was exiting the parking lot. These shots struck and killed Corey Ward. According to Bunn, he was in fear for his life when he shot Ward. John Arnold and Monesia Youngblood, individually and as co-administrators of the Estate of Corey Ward (Appellees) brought a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, alleging Bunn fired his gun at Ward\u2019s vehicle when it had already passed Bunn and the vehicle was not a danger or threat to Bunn, or his partner, Mulkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">After thorough review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Bunn is not entitled to qualified immunity. \u201cQualified immunity does not apply where the facts show that the official violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights and where the law clearly established those rights at the time of the alleged misconduct.\u201d <em>Morton v. Kirkwood, </em>707 F.3d 1276, 1281 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">We analyze this claim \u201cunder the Fourth Amendment\u2019s objective reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Terrell v. Smith, </em>668 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.2012) (quotations omitted). Viewing the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>light most favorable to the Appellees, as we must at this stage of the proceedings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see Morton, </em>707 F.3d at 1280, Bunn was beside the SUV at the time of the shooting, the vehicle was not being driven at a high rate of speed, was not accelerating or heading toward any person either prior to or during the shooting, and was not being used as a deadly weapon. <em>See Terrell, </em>668 F.3d at 1255. An objectively reasonable officer would not have used deadly force under these circumstances, and therefore Bunn\u2019s actions violated Ward\u2019s clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. <em>See Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (holding a police officer can use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing non-violent felony suspect only when the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious harm to the police officer or others); <em>Morton, </em>707 F.3d at 1282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity to Bunn.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-15\">. Although the City of Atlanta also appeals the district court's denial of qualified immunity to Bunn, as a municipality sued in its official capacity it has no right to immediate interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity as it cannot assert such a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-16\">. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Bunn is not entitled to official immunity under Georgia law on the basis of its well-reasoned discussion of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-22\">. \"We review a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds de novo.\u201d <em>Morton v. Kirkwood, </em>707 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">. \"We acknowledge that the facts, as accepted at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings, may not be the actual facts of the case.\u201d <em>Morton, </em>707 F.3d at 1280 (quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
