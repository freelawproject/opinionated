Isaacs was convicted on one count of engaging in the business of producing and selling obscene matter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466(a), one count of transportation of obscene matter for sale or distribution, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465, one count of transportation of obscene matter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462(a), and two counts of mailing obscene matter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In determining whether a work is obscene, a jury must consider \u201cwhether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\u201d <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (quoting <em>Kois v. Wisconsin, </em>408 U.S. 229, 230, 92 S.Ct. 2245, 33 L.Ed.2d 312 (1972) (per curiam)). Prior to closing argument, the district court adopted the parties\u2019 proposed jury instruction defining an \u201cappeal to \u2018prurient\u2019 interest\u201d in part as \u201can appeal to a morbid, degrading, and unhealthy interest in sex.\u201d In response to a question posed by the jury, the district court observed that the instruction was erroneous because it listed the adjectives \u201cmorbid,\u201d \u201cdegrading,\u201d and \u201cunhealthy\u201d conjunctively rather than disjunctively. <em>See Polykoff v. Collins, </em>816 F.2d 1326, 1336-37 (9th Cir.1987) (upholding against an overbreadth challenge an instruction to the jury under an Arizona obscenity statute that incorporated the federal definition of \u201cprurient interest\u201d and holding that the jury should consider the terms \u201cunhealthy,\u201d \u201cwholesome,\u201d \u201cmorbid,\u201d \u201cdegrading,\u201d and \u201cshameful\u201d \u201cin the alternate\u201d and did not need to conclude that all applied (citing <em>State v. Bartanen, </em>121 Ariz. 454, 591 P.2d 546, 550 (1979))). Accordingly, the district court revised its instruction to read \u201cmorbid, degrading, or unhealthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">On appeal, Isaacs argues that the alteration of the jury instruction undermined the credibility of his lawyer, because his lawyer had referred to the original instruction during closing argument. \u201cUnder the law of this circuit, the necessity, extent and character of additional instructions are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. McIver, </em>186 F.3d 1119, 1130 (9th Cir.1999) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Pineda-Moreno, </em>688 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.2012). Here, defense counsel himself used both conjunctive and disjunctive formulations in referring to the instruction during his argument, so it is unclear how the revision might have implied to the jury that Isaacs misled it as to the applicable law. Further, both before the district court and on appeal, Isaacs has argued only that the district court should have affirmed to the jury that the erroneous instruction was correct; however, this proposed remedy disregards the district court\u2019s \u201cobligation, when a jury requests clarification on an issue, to \u2018clear away the confusion with concrete accuracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130 (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. McCall, </em>592 F.2d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam)). The district court did not abuse its discretion in correcting its statement of the law to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Isaacs also argues that the district court erred in sustaining objections by the government during his closing argument, which were made on the ground that Isaacs was referring to facts not in evidence. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s limitation on a closing argument is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lazarenko, </em>564 F.3d 1026, 1043 (9th Cir.2009). Many of these objections were made in response to Isaacs\u2019 references to matters of popular knowledge. Even so, \u201c[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring counsel to confine his remarks to the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Spillone, </em>879 F.2d 514, 518 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Isaacs further challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of his proposed opinion testimony. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s determinations as to both expert and lay opinion testimony. <em>United States v. Redlightning, </em>624 F.3d 1090, 1110 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Nationwide Transp. Fin. v. Cass Info. Sys., Inc., </em>523 F.3d 1051, 1057-58 (9th Cir.2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Isaacs\u2019 proposed expert testimony about artistic value, because its \u201capplication of the expert-testimony standard was logical, plausible, and supported by inferences that may be drawn from the record.\u201d <em>Redlightning, </em>624 F.3d at 1111 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 702; <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)). Isaacs is likewise unable to show that the district court abused its discretion by limiting his lay testimony where, as here, he makes no showing that the excluded testimony would have been \u201chelpful ... to determining\u201d whether the works were obscene. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Finally, Isaacs argues that the district court should not have permitted an FBI agent to sit with a computer at government counsel\u2019s table and perform searches of publicly available information during voir dire. Isaacs concedes that his claim has no basis in existing law, and we see no reason to conclude that the district court\u2019s actions during voir dire constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>298 F.3d 906, 910 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The final judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
