He now appeals, claiming that the Government breached the plea agreement when it moved for an upward departure or variance from Hughey\u2019s Guidelines range based on under-representation of his criminal history. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">Hughey concedes that the Government did not expressly agree not to request an upward departure and, contrary to Hughey\u2019s assertion, no such promise was implied in the plea agreement. We therefore conclude that Hughey has not met his burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a breach occurred. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
