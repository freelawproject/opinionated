As a result of Guddh\u2019s discovery abuses and violation of court orders, the district court imposed a severe sanction \u2014 striking all of Guddh\u2019s pleadings in the case. After doing so, the district court granted SUSTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability for the defamatory comments. Subsequently, the district court also granted SUSTA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the amount of damages, holding Guddh and his co-defendant Juyasis Mata, liable <em>in solido </em>for $158,942 to SUSTA, and $50,000 to each individual plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Guddh and Mata were also enjoined from republishing the statements. Because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing these severe sanctions and that summary judgment was proper, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In 2010, Guddh contacted SUSTA seeking assistance for one of Guddh\u2019s businesses. SUSTA denied Guddh\u2019s request citing his company\u2019s lack of operating history. Following this denial, a series of offensive comments were made about SUSTA on several websites; these comments included unflattering allegations about SUSTA\u2019s professional activities and comments that impugned the character of high-level SUSTA employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">In June 2010, SUSTA filed this lawsuit. Because SUSTA had not yet discovered who posted the offending comments, the original lawsuit named \u201cJohn Does 1-12\u201d as defendants. SUSTA later discovered that the statements originated from an IP address associated with Guddh and received permission to amend its complaint to name Guddh as a defendant. Guddh\u2019s inclusion touched off a tortured discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">First, the court sanctioned Guddh for failure to respond to discovery requests. The court then granted a several-weeks-long stay because Guddh indicated that he would be in India during that period. After the stay was lifted, the court ordered Guddh to pay SUSTA attorneys\u2019 fees of $2,475 for Guddh\u2019s failure to respond to the discovery requests. Guddh has yet to pay this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Because Guddh remained in India, SUS-TA agreed to conduct his deposition via telephone. During the deposition, Guddh was (at the very least) evasive. Acting <em>pro se, </em>Guddh refused to answer routine questions such as where he attended college, refused to answer relevant questions on the grounds that they were \u201coverly broad,\u201d and claimed that information such as his home address and whether he had sold a business were \u201cprivileged.\u201d SUSTA suspended the deposition and filed a motion to compel Guddh to appear for an in-person deposition in the hope that the magistrate judge could monitor the deposition. The court granted this motion, and Guddh was ordered to appear for an in-person deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tion. He failed to appear as ordered. Guddh then requested permission to attend a pre-trial conference via telephone rather than in person as required by the court\u2019s scheduling order. This request was denied, and the court made clear to Guddh that any failure to appear in person could result in sanctions \u201cincluding, but not limited to, sua sponte dismissal of the suit, assessment of costs and attorney fees, default, or other appropriate sanctions.\u201d To make the matter more clear, the court issued another order explicitly directing Guddh to appear in person at the pre-trial conference. Guddh failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As a result of these transgressions, the court sanctioned Guddh by striking all of his pleadings. The court then granted SUSTA\u2019s motions for summary judgment on liability and on damages. The court entered a final judgment ordering Guddh to pay each individual plaintiff $50,000 for harm to their reputation and emotional distress, and $158,942 to SUSTA for costs that SUSTA incurred in repairing the damage caused by the statements. Guddh now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Guddh\u2019s main contention on appeal is that the district court erred in imposing a sanction as severe as striking all of his pleadings. A district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Conner, </em>20 F.3d 1376, 1380 (5th Cir.1994). Where an imposed sanction is severe, we must conduct a \u201cparticularly scrupulous\u201d review. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 749 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Rule 37 \u201cauthorizes a district court to strike pleadings of ... a party that fails to comply with a discovery order.\u201d <em>U.S. for the Use of M-CO Constr., Inc. v. Shipco Gen., Inc., </em>814 F.2d 1011, 1013 (5th Cir.1987). A district court order must provide a sufficient basis for the review of its decision, but the court \u201cneed not provide specific factual findings in every sanction order.\u201d <em>Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>3 F.3d 931, 936 (5th Cir.1993). \u201c[T]he degree and extent to which a specific explanation must be contained in the record will vary accordingly with the particular circumstances of the case, including the severity of the violation, the significance of the sanctions, and the effect of the award.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Capital Sec. Servs., Inc., </em>836 F.2d 866, 883 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc). In the Rule 11 sanction context, we have emphasized \u201cthe importance of an adequate record for appellate review in those cases in which the violation is not apparent on the record and the basis and justification for the trial judge\u2019s Rule 11 decision is not readily discernible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In deciding on which sanction to impose, \u201cthe district court should carefully choose sanctions that foster the appropriate purpose of the rule, depending on the parties, the violation, and the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Topalian, </em>3 F.3d at 936 (citing <em>Thomas, </em>836 F.2d at 877).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking Guddh\u2019s pleadings. Although the striking of all pleadings is a serious sanction that requires an explicit factual basis from the district court, the district court order supplied a sufficient factual basis for the sanctions. The court had previously sanctioned Guddh for discovery abuses \u2014 a sanction Guddh has yet to pay \u2014 and Guddh still failed to abide by the court order and appear in person for his deposition and the pre-trial conference. After Guddh\u2019s first failure to appear (for his deposition), the court explicitly warned Guddh prior to the pre-trial conference that he must appear in person and that failing to do so would lead to the imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tion of severe sanctions \u201cincluding, but not limited to, sua sponte dismissal of the suit, assessment of costs and attorney fees, default, or other appropriate sanctions.\u201d Guddh once again failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We have upheld the striking of a party\u2019s pleadings based on discovery abuses in the past. <em>See, e.g., KeyBank Nat. Ass\u2019n v. Perkins Rowe Assocs., L.L.C., </em>539 Fed.Appx. 414, 417-20 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished) (affirming the district court\u2019s striking of defenses and counterclaims based on discovery abuses); <em>Plasticsource Workers Comm. v. Coburn, </em>283 Fed.Appx. 181, 184-85 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished) (same). Guddh abused the discovery process through his failure to respond to discovery requests or appear for depositions. In addition, he violated an explicit court order to appear for the pre-trial conference. These transgressions, combined with the district court\u2019s knowledge that earlier monetary sanctions had no curative effect, provide a substantial factual basis for striking Guddh\u2019s pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Guddh argues that the district court should not have imposed such a sanction in his case because his violation of the court\u2019s order was not willful. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>145 F.3d 335, 344 (5th Cir.1998) (requiring a showing of bad faith for dismissal of a suit to be authorized as a sanction). Guddh\u2019s argument is unavailing. In determining whether a violation is willful, the court may \u201crely on its complete understanding of the parties\u2019 motivations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court observed Guddh\u2019s discovery abuses, his evasive and obstructive behavior during his deposition, his failure to appear for an in-person deposition, and his failure to appear for a pre-trial conference in violation of the court\u2019s direct instructions and despite the court\u2019s warning that failure to appear would lead to sanctions including \u201csua sponte dismissal of the suit, assessment of costs and attorney fees, default, or other appropriate sanctions.\u201d From this pattern of behavior, there is no error in finding that Guddh\u2019s actions were willful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Guddh next argues that, even if the district court was correct in granting summary judgment to SUSTA on liability, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to SUSTA on the issue of damages. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Royal v. CCC &amp; R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., </em>736 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir.2013). \u201cUnder Louisiana law, the plaintiff must prove damages with reasonable certainty, but this merely means that the plaintiff must prove damages by a preponderance of the evidence as in other civil contexts.\u201d <em>Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S., Inc. v. Cajun Const. Servs., Inc., </em>45 F.3d 96, 101-02 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Here, SUSTA provided sufficient evidence of its damages to satisfy this burden. Both Hingle and Wiltz filed affidavits describing the effect the statements had on them. SUSTA provided documentation of expenditures that it undertook to combat the negative effect the statements had on its reputation. Additionally, the plaintiffs included affidavits from other individuals in the trade community that work with SUSTA. These affidavits further supported the claims that these defamatory comments cast SUSTA and its employees in a negative light. The district court did not err in granting summary</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>judgment to SUSTA on the amount of damages based on these submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Finally, Guddh argues that the district court erred in holding Guddh and Mata liable <em>in solido </em>instead of apportioning liability individually, which Guddh argues is required under Louisiana law. Again, Guddh\u2019s argument is misplaced. Guddh cites two articles of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure for support, but these procedural rules are not binding in federal court. <em>See DP Solutions, Inc. v. Rollins, Inc., </em>353 F.3d 421, 427 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cFederal courts apply state substantive law in diversity jurisdiction cases, but apply federal procedural law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Here, the district court, after striking Guddh\u2019s pleadings, held that Guddh and Mata were liable for conspiring to defame SUSTA and the individual plaintiffs. Based on this conspiracy, Guddh and Mata were properly held liable <em>in solido </em>based on Louisiana substantive law. <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Whitney Nat. Bank, </em>51 F.3d 553, 561 (5th Cir.1995) (recognizing that under Louisiana law, a party who conspires with another is liable <em>in </em>solido).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Because we hold that the district court did not err in striking Guddh\u2019s pleadings, in calculating the damage amount, or in holding Guddh and Mata hable <em>in solido </em>for that amount, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-14\">. Unless noted otherwise, we use SUSTA to refer to all of the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\">. Mata is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. Guddh also argues that summary judgment on liability was inappropriate because his pleadings raised several material issues of fact. Having decided that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking these pleadings, we need not reach this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
