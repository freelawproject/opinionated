Synopsys opposes. ATopTech replies. ATopTech also moves to stay district court proceedings. Synopsys opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">The petition arises out of a suit brought by Synopsys alleging, among other things, that ATopTech infringes Synopsys\u2019s patents related to electronic design automation (EDA). EDA software simplifies the design process by mapping the layout of a chip with cells (placement), connecting those cells (routing), and testing the chip.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-24\">The primary issue related to this petition is ATopTech\u2019s alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,507,941 (\u201cthe '941 patent\u201d). The '941 patent relates to methods for placement and routing. The '941 patent was originally issued to Magma Design Automation, Inc. (Magma) in 2003 and was acquired by Synopsys when Magma merged with Synopsys effective February 2012. Magma\u2019s major EDA product was known as Blast, and Synopsys continues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>sell the product under the name Talus. OMM represented Magma in the merger. OMM began to represent the alleged infringer, ATopTech, in the present suit in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Previously in 2004, OMM had also represented Magma when it was sued by Synopsys in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Synopsys alleged that Magma\u2019s Blast product infringed three EDA patents issued to Magma but which Synopsys alleged it owned. Two of those patents featured claims directed to routing.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">OMM also represented Magma when Magma was sued by Synopsys in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in 2005. The suit involved claims that Magma\u2019s products infringed three of Synopsys\u2019s patents. Magma counterclaimed to assert five of its own EDA patents against Synopsys, but Magma did not assert the '941 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In the instant case, Synopsys alleges that ATopTech infringes the '941 patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,237,127, and copyrights. Based on OMM\u2019s prior representation of Magma at a time when Magma owned the '941 patent and when Magma\u2019s products and other related patents were in litigation, Synopsys moved to disqualify OMM as counsel for ATopTech. Synopsys noted, inter alia, the relatedness of the previous representations of Magma in EDA infringement cases. Two of the OMM attorneys who entered appearances in the present action had also previously represented Magma. At that point, OMM announced it created a \u201cscreen\u201d to prevent disclosure of confidential information and asserted that its attorneys had not shared any confidential information. After a hearing, the district court granted the motion to disqualify OMM. ATopTech petitions this court for a writ of mandamus to overturn that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">\u201cThe remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Accordingly, \u201cthree conditions must be satisfied before it may issue.\u201d <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). The petitioner must show a \u201c \u2018clear and indisputable\u2019 \u201d right to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576 (quoting <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119). The petitioner must \u201clack adequate alternative means to obtain the relief\u2019 it seeks. <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989); <em>see Cheney, </em>542 U.S. at 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576; <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119. And \u201ceven if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Cheney, </em>542 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, whose law we apply here, has made clear that \u201cthe district court has the prime responsibility for controlling the conduct of lawyers practicing before it, and that an order disqualifying counsel will not be disturbed if the record reveals \u2018any sound\u2019 basis for the district court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, </em>658 F.2d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Gas-A-Tron of Arizona v. Union Oil Co. of California, </em>534 F.2d 1322, 1325 (9th Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The district court stated that if a substantial relationship was shown between the current and former representations, a conclusive presumption arises that confidential material information was transmitted to the attorneys. ATopTech does not disagree with this statement of Ninth Circuit law, but instead disputes that Synop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>sys made a showing of a substantial relationship. The district court found that Synopsys met this heavy burden because it made \u201ca sufficient showing that the '941 patent was discussed or the probability of it having been discussed.\u201d The district court also found that there was \u201ca relevant overlap in the products that were at issue in the former case and now will be at issue again,\u201d and stated that because of \u201cthe long relationship that [OMM] had with Magma and the thoroughness ... of [OMM\u2019s] work, in general,\u201d disqualification of OMM was appropriate. We determine that the district court had a sound basis for disqualifying OMM. Therefore, mandamus relief is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">(1) The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">(2) The motion for a stay is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
