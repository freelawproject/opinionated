For the reasons that follow, we deny Paramont\u2019s petition for review and affirm the award of benefits to Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Coleman has spent approximately 33.34 years employed in coal mining.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 9, 2009, Coleman filed a claim for benefits under the Act, which grants benefits to former miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. Benefits under the Act are awardable to miners who are totally disabled within the meaning of the Act due to pneumoconiosis, or to the survivors of miners who were totally disabled at the time of their deaths (for claims filed prior to January 1, 1982), or to the survivors of miners whose deaths were caused by pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>The District Director of the Division of Coal Mine Workers\u2019 Compensation of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cDistrict Director\u201d) awarded benefits to Coleman on August 3, 2010. Upon Paramont\u2019s request for a hearing, the file was transferred to an ALJ for a formal hearing to determine whether Coleman was eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">A hearing was held on June 11, 2011, in Abingdon, Virginia. In order to prove eligibility under the Act, Coleman had to show that he was totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis caused by his coal-mining employment. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901, 921; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.202-204, 725.202. Because more than one year had passed since the denial of his first claim, Coleman also had to establish that \u201cone of the applicable conditions of entitlement ... ha[d] changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(c). The Act provides an irrebuttable statutory presumption of total disability resulting from pneumoconiosis where the coal miner suffers from \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">After reviewing the medical evidence at the hearing, the ALJ determined that complicated pneumoconiosis arising out of Coleman\u2019s coal mine employment was established pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304 and 718.203(b), and found that he was entitled to invocation of the irrebuttable statutory presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis under \u00a7 411(c)(3) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3). The ALJ therefore determined that Coleman was entitled to benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Paramont appealed to the Board, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and order awarding benefits. Paramont timely appealed the Board\u2019s decision, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), as incorporated by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In reviewing a claim for benefits under the Act, our review of the Board\u2019s order is \u201climited.\u201d <em>Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>678 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2012). We review the decision \u201cto assess whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the ALJ and whether the legal conclusions of the [Board] and ALJ are rational and consistent with applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the ALJ is the trier of fact, we \u201cdefer to the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, as long as substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings, we \u201cmust sustain the ALJ\u2019s decision, even if [we] disagree with it.\u201d <em>Id, </em>We review questions of law <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">On appeal, although Paramont purports to raise several issues, it basically contends that the ALJ erred in finding the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis established pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 and, therefore, erred in finding that Coleman was entitled to the irrebuttable statutory presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis. Paramont specifically contends that the ALJ\u2019s analysis is legally flawed, and also raises a broad challenge to the ALJ\u2019s weighing of the conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Section 411(c)(3) of the Act, as implemented by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304, provides an irrebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis if the miner suffers from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">a chronic dust disease of the lung which (A) when diagnosed by chest [x-ray], yields one or more large opacities (greater than one centimeter in diameter) ..., (B) when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy, yields massive lesions in the lung, or (C) when diagnosis is made by other means, would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results described in clause (A) or (B) if diagnosis had been made in the manner prescribed in clause (A) or (B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304. The introduction of legally sufficient evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis does 5 not, however, automatically qualify a claimant for the irrebuttable presumption. Rather, the evidence must establish that the claimant has a \u201cchronic dust disease of the lung,\u201d commonly known as complicated pneumoconiosis. To make such a determination, the ALJ must examine all the evidence on the issue, i.e., evidence of simple and complicated pneumoconiosis, as well as evidence that pneumoconiosis is not present, resolve any conflict in the evidence, and make findings of fact. <em>See E. Assoc. Coal Corp. v. Dir., OWCP, 220 </em>F.3d 250, 256-59 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Our review of the record discloses that the ALJ\u2019s decision is in accordance with the law and supported by substantial evidence. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304(a), the ALJ found that the newly submitted x-ray of September 16, 2009 was read by Dr. Michael S. Alexander (\u201cDr. Alexander\u201d) and Dr. Kathleen A. DePonte (\u201cDr. DePonte\u201d), dually-qualified Board-certified radiologists and B readers, as positive for both simple pneumoconiosis and complicated pneumoconiosis, Category A. The ALJ noted that the x-ray was read as negative for pneumoconiosis by Dr. Jerome F. Wiot (\u201cDr. Wiot\u201d), an equally-qualified radiologist. However, the ALJ found that while Dr. William W. Scott (\u201cDr. Scott\u201d), an equally-qualified radiolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>gist, read the same x-ray as negative for both simple pneumoconiosis and complicated pneumoconiosis, he advised that a follow-up review of the enlarging mass in the upper-right lung be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Regarding another submitted x-ray of December 7, 2009, the ALJ found that Dr. DePonte read the x-ray as positive for both simple pneumoconiosis and complicated pneumoconiosis, Category A, while Dr. Wiot read the x-ray as negative. The ALJ further concluded that Drs. Alexander and DePonte attributed the complicated pneumoconiosis to coal mine employment and that there was no credible medical evidence of record indicating that \u201cthe large masses in [Coleman\u2019s] lungs are due to a process other than pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. 273); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304(a). Consequently, the ALJ found that the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis was established pursuant to \u00a7 718.304 overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The ALJ also weighed the new evidence with the evidence from Coleman\u2019s prior 1999 claim, including x-rays and a medical opinion. After crediting the more recent evidence, the ALJ determined that the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis was established pursuant to \u00a7 718.304 overall. The ALJ concluded, therefore, that Coleman was entitled to invocation of the \u00a7 411(c)(3) irrebuttable presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Paramont contends that the ALJ erred in finding that the x-ray evidence established complicated pneumoconiosis on the basis of the Category A classifications of Dr. Alexander and Dr. DePonte, without considering the fact that other x-ray readings did not identify Category A opacities. Additionally, Paramont contends that the ALJ erred in rejecting evidence that showed that the large mass seen on the x-ray evidence was not due to complicated pneumoconiosis, but was due to another disease process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Contrary to Paramont\u2019s arguments, however, the ALJ properly found complicated pneumoconiosis pursuant to \u00a7 718.304(a), based on the x-ray readings of Drs. Alexander and DePonte, who classified the opacities seen as Category A. The ALJ permissibly found that the other x-ray readings,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which either did not diagnose a large opacity, identify the size of the opacities seen, or address the existence of the large opacity observed by Drs. Alexander and DePonte, were insufficient to overcome the Category A classifications of Drs. Alexander and DePonte. <em>See E. </em>Assoc. <em>Coal Corp., </em>220 F.3d at 256; <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 756 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Moreover, the ALJ properly found that the evidence established that the large masses seen on the x-rays were due to complicated pneumoconiosis and not another disease process. Specifically, the ALJ permissibly rejected the opinions of Dr. James R. Castle (\u201cDr. Castle\u201d) and Dr. Gregory J. Fino (\u201cDr. Fino\u201d), who suggested a possible link between the large opacity seen on x-ray and sarcoidosis or healed granulomatous disease, as equivocal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ALJ, therefore, found that the opinions of Drs. Castle and Fino were insufficient to establish that the large opacities were not due to coal mine employment and, as to the \u201cpossible\u201d cause of the large opacity, were not credible as they were unsupported by any evidence in the record. (J.A. 274.) In contrast, the ALJ properly credited the findings of Drs. Alexander and DePonte, attributing Coleman\u2019s Category A opacity to coal mine employment, as the ALJ found that their findings were supported by the evidence in the record. The ALJ thus properly found that Coleman had established the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304, and accordingly, was entitled to invocation of the \u00a7 411(c)(3) irrebuttable presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Ultimately, we conclude that the record compels us to uphold the award of black lung benefits in this case. Although Paramont repeatedly contends that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the opinions of Drs. Alexander and DePonte, over those of Drs. Castle and Fino, constitutes reversible error, the record here contains conflicting medical opinions as to whether Coleman suffers from complicated pneumoconiosis. The ALJ\u2019s role, as fact-finder, was to resolve such conflicts. <em>See Harman, </em>678 F.3d at 316. This is precisely what the ALJ did, as she conscientiously \u2014 and repeatedly\u2014 weighed the expert opinions and resolved the conflicts in favor of Coleman. Even if we might have weighed the evidence at issue differently than the ALJ, on review, we defer to her evaluation of the appropriate weight to accord these conflicting medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Accordingly, we deny Paramont\u2019s petition for review and affirm the decision of the Board to uphold the ALJ\u2019s decision and order awarding benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">.
