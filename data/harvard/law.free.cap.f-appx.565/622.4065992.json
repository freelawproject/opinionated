Under California law, \u201c[t]he elements of a tortious claim of false imprisonment are: (1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person, (2) without lawful privilege, and (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief.\u201d <em>Easton v. Sutter Coast Hosp., </em>80 Cal.App.4th 485, 496, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 316 (2000). The Border Patrol agents had legal authority to refer Cortez to secondary inspection without any individualized suspicion. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 562, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976); <em>United States v. Preciado-Robles, </em>964 F.2d 882, 884 (9th Cir.1992). The trial court credited the agents\u2019 testimony that the duration of Cortez\u2019s detention at secondary inspection was a direct result of his own obstruction and failure to cooperate with their permissible follow-up questions, and that Cortez was released once he complied with their request to produce his law enforcement credentials. Cortez has failed to show that this credibility determination was clearly erroneous. <em>See Valenzuela v. Michel, </em>736 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">2. To make out a claim for assault/battery against the Border Patrol agents, Cortez must establish that they used unreasonable force to detain him. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 835a; <em>Edson v. City of Anaheim, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1272-73, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 614 (1998); Judicial Council of Cal., Civ. Jury Instr. \u00a7 1305. Because we find that Cortez\u2019s detention at secondary inspection was proper, we need not address his argument that the use of any force to effect that detention was per se unreasonable. Nor do we find the \u201c \u2018guided\u2019 extraction\u201d of Cortez from his vehicle or the assumption of a \u201cbladed stance\u201d by a nearby officer during this process to be unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
