Appellees have moved to dismiss this appeal as moot because the trustee has now sold the property to an independent third party. We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-19\">Pope failed to obtain injunctive relief before the trustee\u2019s sale of the property. Under Arizona law, she has now waived any defenses and objections to the sale. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 33-811(C) (defenses and objections to a trustee\u2019s sale are waived if they are not raised in an action resulting in injunctive relief before the sale); <em>BT Capital, LLC v. TD Serv. Co. of Ariz., </em>229 Ariz. 299, 275 P.3d 598, 600 (2012) (en banc) (\u201cWhere, as here, a trustee\u2019s sale is completed, a person subject to \u00a7 33-811(C) cannot later challenge the sale based on pre-sale defenses or objections.\u201d). In light of the foreclosure, the remedy Pope seeks in her first amended complaint is therefore moot. <em>See Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Baker, </em>22 F.3d 880, 896 (9th Cir.1994) (a case is moot when there is no longer a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-20\">The district court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is vacated. <em>See ACLU of Nev. v. Masto, </em>670 F.3d 1046, 1065 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b650-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
