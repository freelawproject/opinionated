Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In 2008, Reina pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On November 12, 2008, at the sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Reina to 151 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Reina appealed, and we affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 08-4591.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The District Court\u2019s Judgment and Commitment Order (the \u201cJudgment\u201d) provides that: \u201c[u]pon release from imprisonment, the defendant shall be on supervised release for a term of: three (3) years. The supervised release shall run consecutively to the sentence in Criminal Number 08-30.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2013, three years after the Judgment was affirmed, he filed his Petition, in which he asserts that the Judgment contains a clerical error. While not entirely clear, Reina appears to have asserted that the second sentence of the Supervised Release provision (\u201cThe supervised release shall run consecutively to the sentence in Criminal Number 08-30\u201d) should be omitted, as his sentence in Criminal Number 08-30 expires prior to his sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">On September 12, 2013, the District Court denied Reina\u2019s petition, noting that the transcript of the sentencing hearing confirms that the Judgment accurately reflects the sentence imposed. On October 9, 2013, Reina appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">As the 14-day period for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case is nonjurisdictional, <em>see Virgin Islands v. Martinez, </em>620 F.3d 321, 328-29 (3d Cir.2010), and as the Government has not objected, we turn to the merits of this appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 329; <em>see also United States v. Muhammud, </em>701 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir.2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and may affirm the District Court\u2019s order on any basis supported by the record. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">Rule 36 provides that \u201cthe court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment ... arising from oversight or omission.\u201d A clerical error \u201cmust not be one of judgment or even of misidentification, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>merely of recitation, of the sort that a clerk or amanuensis might commit, mechanical in nature.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Guevremont, </em>829 F.2d 423, 425 (3d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Dura-Wood Treating Co. v. Century Forest Indus., </em>694 F.2d 112, 114 (5th Cir.1982)). As we have explained, \u201cRule 36 is normally used to correct a written judgment of sentence to conform to the oral sentence pronounced by the judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>423 F.3d 271, 278 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In his Petition, Reina asserted that the sentence in question was unnecessary, due to his sentence in Criminal No. 08-30 expiring prior to the beginning of his supervised release in this case, and that therefore the sentence must have been added by the Clerk\u2019s Office. However, the District Judge, at the sentencing hearing, specifically stated that \u201c[u]pon release from imprisonment, defendant shall be placed on supervised release for a term of three years. The term of supervised release is to run consecutively to the sentence in Criminal Number 08-30.\u201d This language, with minor stylistic revisions, is the same language as that contained in the Judgment. In other words, no <em>clerical </em>error exists. Further, as Reina himself conceded, this inclusion of this language does not disturb his underlying sentence. Accordingly, the District Court properly found that the Judgment accurately reflects the sentence imposed. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As this appeal presents us with no substantial question, and we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3rd Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">. In 2000, Reina was deported after serving a 60-month sentence for distributing cocaine. He illegally reentered the United States thereafter, and was indicted in the District Court for violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). E.D. Pa.Crim. No. 08-cr-00030. Reina pleaded guilty to these charges in February 2008, and was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Reina appealed, and we affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment and sentence. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 08-2417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. Reina filed his notice of appeal 27 days after the District Court denied his petition. To be timely, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal in a criminal case must be filed in the District Court no later than 14 days after the challenged order is entered. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). In response to the Clerk's listing of this appeal for possible dismissal due to jurisdictional defect, Reina filed a letter stating that the delay was caused by his originally sending his appeal to the wrong address. We need not address whether this would be sufficient cause to excuse Reina\u2019s late filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-18\">. We have not established in this Circuit the standard for review of Rule 36 motions. Although there is some disagreement among the circuits, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Niemiec, </em>689 F.2d 688, 692 (7th Cir.1982) (abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Burd, </em>86 F.3d 285, 287 (2d Cir.1996) (de novo), we need not resolve that issue today because we would affirm under any available standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
