He returned to the United States unlawfully, and in December 2010 he was arrested for driving violations in Lowndes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>County, Georgia. In February 2011 the Government obtained a one-count indictment charging Don-Silva with willfully being in the United States unlawfully, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). He pled guilty in March 2011, and in June 2011 the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia sentenced him to time served plus three years\u2019 supervised release<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordered that he be turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. The Government requested supervised release \u201cas a fail safe mechanism\u201d \u2014 in case Don-Silva tried to return to the United States illegally. Among the conditions to his supervised release were (1) that he not reenter the United States, except by legal means, and (2) that he not commit another crime. Don-Silva was deported again following his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">He again re-entered the United States unlawfully, and in September 2012 he was arrested in Lowndes County for domestic battery and obstruction of a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly after the arrest, the District Court Probation Office petitioned the Middle District of Georgia to revoke his supervised release. Don-Silva admitted to violating the terms of his release, and the District Court revoked supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals this sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence for the reasons given below.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">When a defendant violates the terms of his supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) authorizes a court to revoke the release and impose a term of imprisonment. In deciding what term of imprisonment to impose, a district court must consider the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which are contained in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual, and certain sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 e.g., \u201cthe nature and circumstance of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and the need \u201cto protect the public,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C). The relevant \u201coffense\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d in a revocation case is the defendant\u2019s breach of the court\u2019s trust, committed in violating the terms of his release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro. cmt. 3(b). If the violation also constitutes an independent criminal offense (as in Don-Silva\u2019s case), the appropriate sentence for the underlying offense is reserved for the court with jurisdiction over that offense. <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding this general proposition, the Chapter 7 policy statements do \u201ctak[e] into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Chapter 7 contains recommended sentencing ranges for varying violations and criminal history categories; the sentencing range is intended to serve as a proxy for the defendant\u2019s breach of the court\u2019s trust, the seriousness of the violation, and the relevant \u00a7 8553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). In Don-Silva\u2019s case, the applicable \u00a7 7B1.4 range was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Don-Silva was on supervised release for a Class C felony, the maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of the terms of his release was two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">During the revocation hearing, the Government asked the court to sentence Don-Silva above the recommended range because \u201cwe don\u2019t believe that [the range] adequately accounts for the seriousness of this offense\u201d \u2014 to wit, \u201c[h]e\u2019s committed two new offenses since the last time he was convicted,\u201d \u201c[h]e has now committed a violent offense,\u201d and \u201che\u2019s reentered the United States again in direct contradiction to the orders of the Court the last time he was sentenced.\u201d Defense counsel urged the court to reach a sentence inside the \u00a7 7B1.4 range because Don-Silva\u2019s most recent convictions were misdemeanors and he only returned to the United States because his life was endangered in Mexico and because his children live in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The District Court imposed a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 twice the upper bound of the advisory range. It explained its reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">The Court has considered the sentencing guidelines and has taken them into account and has determined that the advisory guideline sentencing range upon revocation is three to nine months....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">The Court finds this range to be inadequate, and the Court orders that the term of supervised release be revoked and that the defendant be committed to the Bureau of Prisons for a period of 18 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">The sentence as imposed is an appropriate sentence in this case, complies with the factors that are to be considered as set forth at 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a) and adequately addresses the totality of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">When asked if there were any objections, defense counsel stated, for the record, that the court\u2019s sentence exceeded the advisory range and that such a sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">In this appeal, Don-Silva now contends that the District Court\u2019s sentence was procedurally flawed and is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">The Chapter 7 policy statements, including the recommended terms of imprisonment, are advisory and do not bind the court. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter 7 recommended guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798. This review includes two components: first, whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d in reaching its sentence and, second, whether the sentence was substantively unreasonable, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Significant procedural errors include clearly erroneous fact-finding, improper Sentencing Guidelines calculations, failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, or failure to explain a given sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). On this last point, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the sentencing judge to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d As the Supreme Court has explained the requirement, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Don-Silva argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s explanation of his 18-month sentence was insufficient under this standard and, relatedly, that the District Court did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 as evidenced by its failure to explain its application of those factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As he puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">The district court did not articulate a chain of reasoning connecting its decision to vary, the ultimate sentence it selected, and the offender before it; nor did it explain how its sentence was responsive to the sentencing factors or purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), none of which was specifically identified as playing a role in the sentencing decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Appellant Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">While the District Court\u2019s explanation was brief, there is no one-size-fits-all rule that requires a sentencing judge to march though a detailed recitation of its reasoning in every case. \u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.... The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Accordingly, we have held that a district court is not required to discuss on the record each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that led it to a particular result. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn acknowledgment the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. In the context of revocation hearings, \u201c[w]hen exceeding the recommended range, the court must normally indicate that it considered the Chapter 7 policy statements.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Here, the District Court announced that it had considered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the compet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ing arguments presented for and against a longer-than-recommended sentence were straightforward. The Government urged a weightier sentence to account for Don-Silva\u2019s blatant disregard for the District Court\u2019s earlier order and the fact that he committed two new crimes \u2014 one a violent crime. Don-Silva\u2019s response was that he had good reasons for re-entering the United States and that his crimes were only misdemeanors. These competing claims obviously implicate the need for a sentence to accommodate the defendant\u2019s breach of the court\u2019s trust and, to a lesser degree, the seriousness of the underlying conduct. While the \u00a7 7B1.4 recommended term of imprisonment approximated the sentence required to achieve these objectives, the court was tasked with tailoring Don-Silva\u2019s sentence in light of the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of his violations \u2014 taking into account the defendant\u2019s history and the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Short as it may be, given that the court was essentially asked to make a judgment based on simple facts and straightforward arguments, the District Court\u2019s explanation was sufficient to convey the basis for its decision \u2014 that the \u00a7 7B 1.4 range underestimated the seriousness of Don-Silva\u2019s supervised release violations. <em>Cf. Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468 (\u201c[G]iven the straightforward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the judge\u2019s statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient.\u201d). In hindsight, Don-Silva may disagree with the result the District Court reached \u2014 an issue we address in reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence \u2014 but we cannot say that the record here is so lacking as to prevent meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Likewise, we find no basis for Don-Silva\u2019s argument that the District Court did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court stated in the revocation hearing, \u201c[t]he sentence as imposed is an appropriate sentence in this case, complies with the factors that are to be considered as set forth at 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a) and adequately addresses the totality of the circumstances.\u201d As we have said, the sentencing judge has no obligation to give an itemized account of his consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Again, Don-Silva may disagree with the District Court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but he cannot claim that the District Court failed to consider those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">We now turn to his substantive unreasonableness claim. \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. In reviewing the District Court\u2019s weighing of these factors, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>may only vacate the court\u2019s sentence if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 8553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Where a district court sentences a defendant outside the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recommended range, the court of appeals \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Don-Silva violated the terms of his release by engaging in the very conduct that resulted in the imposition of the supervised release in the first place \u2014 entering the United States unlawfully \u2014 and in doing so acted in direct contradiction to the District Court\u2019s previous order. The District Court sentenced him within the two-year statutory maximum and, in reaching its decision, considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Don-Silva\u2019s only argument that the District Court abused its discretion in reaching an 18-month sentence is that the court did not give appropriate weight to the \u00a7 7B1.4 range or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that counseled against a longer sentence \u2014 to wit, that Don-Silva accepted responsibility for his violations, had good reasons for violating the terms of his release, and does not pose a risk to the public. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201cWe have consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. While the district court is required to consider the policy statements, it is not bound by them.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799 (citations omitted). And \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In light of the record before us, we cannot say that the court\u2019s 18-month sentence was \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The District Court\u2019s sentence is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">. The Sentencing Guidelines range for his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 violation was 6 to 12 months. At the time of his sentencing Don-Silva had been in custody of one form or another for approximately 6 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. In February 2013, Don-Silva pled guilty to battery and giving a false name to an officer. He was sentenced to time served plus probation and a fine, and he was then turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b875-11\">. For example, violations that constitute violent felonies or drug felonies result in greater advisory sentences, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a); a defendant's criminal history at the time of his original sentencing determines the length of the advisory sentence, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4; and if the violation was a misdemeanor that poses the risk of felonious conduct, the Sentencing Commission suggests an upward departure from the advisory sentence, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, cmt. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">. The revocation presentence investigation report found that Don-Silva\u2019s supervised release violations constituted \"Grade C Violations\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a). For a Grade C violation, the sentencing court may either revoke supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment or extend or modify the terms of the supervised release. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2). If the court decides to revoke release and impose a term of imprisonment, the recommended range for a Grade C violation and a criminal category history of I (Don-Silva\u2019s criminal history category at the time of his original sentence) is three to nine months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a). Neither the Government nor Don-Silva objected to this advisory range calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">. He did not raise either objection during the revocation hearing; had he done so, the District Court could have easily addressed the alleged shortcomings then and there. Ordinarily a party\u2019s failure to object at sentencing results in plain-error review of any new claims raised on appeal. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). We need not decide whether or how plain-error review would apply to Don-Silva's procedural claims because he cannot establish that the District Court committed an error\u2014 plain or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) directs a sentencing judge to consider the following \u00a7 3553(a) factors in revoking supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment: (1) \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d (2) the need for the sentence \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d (3) the need fol' the sentence \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d (4) the need for the sentence \"to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner,\u201d (5) the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, (6) \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d and (7) \"the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
