After careful review, we conclude that Winston\u2019s retaliatory discipline claim failed as a matter of law because Petty\u2019s disciplinary report provides some evidence that Winston actually violated prison rules. <em>Cf. Hartsfield v. </em>Nichols, 511 F.3d 826, 831 (8th Cir.2008) (report from correctional officer, even if disputed by inmate and supported by no other evidence, legally suffices as some evidence upon which to base prison disciplinary violation, if violation is found by impartial decisionmaker). We also conclude that Winston cannot create a genuine issue of material fact as to his hearing officer\u2019s impartiality based only on the allegation that Winston had previously filed grievances against the hearing officer. <em>See Meuir v. Greene Cnty. Jail Emps., </em>487 F.3d 1115, 1119 (8th Cir.2007) (in case of retaliatory discipline, merely alleging that act was retaliatory is insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">We thus affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Winston\u2019s pending motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\">. The Honorable J. Leon Holmes, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Beth Deere, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
