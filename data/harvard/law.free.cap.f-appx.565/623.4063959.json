White (the White Estate) seeks a \u201cwrit of mandate and/or prohibition, and request for emergency stay\u201d directing the district court to vacate its order denying White\u2019s motion to stay payments from the trust fund established in this case and to enter a new order granting his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The White Estate further requests a companion writ staying further payments from the trust pending completion of postjudgment discovery and adjudication of its motion to vacate the underlying judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The White Estate fails to demonstrate that the district court clearly erred by denying the motion for a stay of payments, and therefore the extraordinary remedy of mandamus is unwarranted. <em>See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Mont., </em>408 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that the absence of clear error is dispositive). In light of the investigation and reports from Special Master Garcia and Trustee Smith, the district court did not clearly err by concluding that the White Estate\u2019s new submissions were not convincing evidence of \u201can unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decision.\u201d <em>Latshaw v. Trainer Wortham &amp; Co., </em>452 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Abatti v. Comm\u2019r, </em>859 F.2d 115, 118 (9th Cir.1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the district court acted within its discretion in finding that the potential harm to the plaintiffs that would result from staying further payments outweighs the potential harm to the White Estate of maintaining the current distribution schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Even assuming clear error, mandamus is inappropriate because the district court\u2019s decision to deny a stay does not present an \u201coft repeated error or manifest ] a persistent disregard of the federal rules,\u201d nor does it \u201craise[ ] new and important problems or issues of first impression.\u201d <em>Perry v. Schwarzenegger, </em>591 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Bauman v. United States District Court, </em>557 F.2d 650, 654-55 (9th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The White Estate\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\">. After this petition was filed, Thomas White died, and the Estate of Thomas F. White was substituted in his place.
