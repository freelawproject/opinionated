The district court held that Continental Insurance Company had no duty to defend Field Service Industries in a lawsuit arising out of its installation of and subsequent repairs to engines in a marine vessel because the underlying claims fell within the contractual liability exclusions to the insurance policy. We affirm the judgment of the district court on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">On June 16, 2006, Plaintiffs-Appellants Misty and Robert Blanton, doing business as Field Service Industries (collectively \u201cFSI\u201d), installed two diesel engines into the <em>Betty L, </em>a motor vessel owned by J.A.M. Marine Services, L.L.C. (\u201cJ.A.M.\u201d). J.A.M. uses the <em>Betty L </em>to supply offshore drilling, shipping, and ocean vessels with lubricants and fuel via barge or tug deliveries. At the time of the installation, FSI was an authorized engine dealer for Alaska Diesel. Less than a year after installation of the engines on the <em>Betty L, </em>the engines experienced mechanical problems. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>May and June 2007, FSI performed diagnostic and repair work on both engines. According to J.A.M., FSI performed the initial diagnostic work and repairs in a substandard manner, necessitating additional repairs. One of the engines ultimately had to be replaced, rendering the <em>Betty L </em>out of service for over a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">J.A.M. brought suit in state court alleging negligence and breach of contract claims against Alaska Diesel, FSI, and FSI\u2019s owners, the Blantons and Robert R. Eisele, Jr. and Robert Peter Eisele (\u201cEiseles\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">FSI had a Marine Services Liability Policy with Continental Insurance Company (\u201cContinental\u201d) that included Commercial General Liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) coverage and Ship Repairer\u2019s Liability (\u201cSRL\u201d) coverage. The policy period was from August 15, 2006, to August 15, 2007, which is after the installation of the engines on the <em>Betty L, </em>but includes FSI\u2019s later repair work. After being served with J.A.M.\u2019s lawsuit, FSI sought a defense from Continental under the Policy, but Continental denied coverage. FSI responded by filing this breach of insurance contract action in state court, seeking a judgment that Continental owed a duty to defend FSI. Continental removed this action to federal court and joined the Eiseles.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The underlying lawsuit between J.A.M. and FSI settled, leaving only the issue of whether Continental had a duty to defend FSI. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Continental. The district court held Continental had no duty to defend FSI in the underlying action due to the presence of \u201ccontractual liability\u201d exclusions contained in both the CGL and SRL portions of the Policy. FSI appealed, arguing that the district court erred by holding that the contractual liability exclusions precluded coverage. Continental asserted that the district court did not err, and, even if it had, other exclusions contained in the Policy apply to FSI\u2019s claims. Additionally, Continental contends that if it owes a duty to defend the Blantons, that duty does not extend to the Eiseles.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">After FSI filed its appeal, we certified a similar question of Texas insurance law regarding contractual liability exclusions to the Supreme Court of Texas. <em>See Ewing Constr. Co. v. Amerisure Ins. Co., </em>690 F.3d 628, 633 (5th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We placed this case in abeyance pending the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s answer. On January 17, 2014, the Texas Supreme Court held that an insured\u2019s express agreement to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>construction in a good and workmanlike manner did not enlarge its obligations and was not an \u201c \u2018assumption of liability\u2019 within the meaning of the policy\u2019s contractual liability exclusion.\u201d <em>Ewing Const. Co., Inc. v. Amerisure Ins. Co. (\u201cEwing II\u201d), </em>420 S.W.3d 30, 36 (Tex.2014). Following the decision in <em>Ewing II, </em>Continental, in a letter brief to the court, conceded that the contractual liability provisions in the CGL and SRL do not apply to FSI\u2019s claims. However, Continental maintains that several other exclusions contained in both the CGL and SRL portions of the Policy preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This court reviews rulings on summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Int\u2019l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp., </em>665 F.3d 671, 679 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>This court may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment \u201cif it is sustainable on any legal ground in the record, and it may be affirmed on grounds rejected or not stated by the district court.\u201d <em>S &amp; W Enters., L.L.C. v. South-Trust Bank of Ala., NA, </em>315 F.3d 533, 537-38 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">III. Duty to Defend</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">On appeal, FSI alleges that it is entitled to a defense under the CGL and the SRL Policy provisions for the following allegations in J.A.M.\u2019s underlying petition: (1) loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>resulting from FSI\u2019s negligent installation of the engines; (2) loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>resulting from FSI\u2019s negligence in performing diagnostic work and/or repairs on the engines; (3) damage to J.A.M.\u2019s property resulting from FSI\u2019s negligent installation of the engines; and (4) damage to J.A.M.\u2019s property resulting from FSI\u2019s negligence in performing diagnostic work and repairs on the engines. Continental counters that CGL and SRL coverage pertains only to situations in which FSI\u2019s work causes damage to property not produced by or worked on by FSI, and since J.A.M.\u2019s underlying petition is based on damage to engines installed and repaired by FSI, there is no CGL or SRL coverage. Continental points to several exclusions to CGL and SRL coverage in support of its assertion that it owes no duty to defend. We consider each of the four claims in turn and explain how each falls within an exclusion to both the CGL and SRL portions of the Policy. Because we agree that the Policy does not cover these claims, we need not reach the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the application of the Policy to the Eiseles.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">A. Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">In this diversity action, Texas substantive law applies as interpreted by Texas state courts. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>664 F.3d 589, 593 (5th Cir.2011). Under Texas law, whether an insurance carrier owes a duty to defend under an insurance policy is a purely legal question. <em>Koenig v. First Am. Title Ins. Co. of Tex., </em>209 S.W.3d 870, 873 (Tex.App.Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). \u201cIn determining a duty to defend, we follow the eight-corners rule, also known as the complaint-allegation rule: \u2018an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by the third-party plaintiffs pleadings, considered in light of the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.\u2019\u201d <em>Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Nokia, Inc., </em>268 S.W.3d 487, 491 (Tex.2008) (quoting <em>GuideOne Elite Ins. Co. v. Fielder Rd. Baptist Church, </em>197 S.W.3d 305, 308 (Tex. 2006)). All doubts regarding the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>defend are resolved in favor of the duty. <em>King v. Dallas Fire Ins. Co., </em>85 S.W.3d 185, 187 (Tex.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u201cInitially, the insured has the burden of establishing coverage under the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Gilbert Tex. Const., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>327 S.W.3d 118, 124 (Tex.2010). If the insured proves that the claim is covered, the insurer must prove the loss is within an exclusion in order to avoid liability. <em>Id. </em>If the insurer establishes the applicability of an exclusion, the burden shifts back to the insured to prove coverage under an exception to the exclusion. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[o]nce coverage has been found for any portion of a suit, an insurer must defend the entire suit.\u201d <em>St. Paul Ins. Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>999 S.W.2d 881, 884 (Tex.App.Austin 1999, pet. denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In assessing the scope of coverage provided by an insurance policy, we interpret the policy as a written contract, according to settled rules of contract construction. <em>See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Crocker, </em>246 S.W.3d 603, 606 (Tex.2008). This includes giving the policy\u2019s terms their plain meaning. <em>Id. </em>A term of the policy is considered ambiguous when it is \u201csusceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>Lincoln Gen. Ins Co. v. Aisha\u2019s Learning Ctr., </em>468 F.3d 857, 859 (5th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). However, \u201can ambiguity does not exist simply because the parties interpret a policy differently. If a contract as written can be given a clear and definite legal meaning, then it is not ambiguous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>327 S.W.3d at 133 (citations omitted). When a term is subject to more than one reasonable construction, we interpret the term in favor of coverage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">B. Claims and Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">1. <em>Loss of use of the Betty L resulting from FSI\u2019s negligent installation of the engines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Claim One is based on J.A.M.\u2019s allegations that it lost the use of the <em>Betty L </em>from May 14 to 17, 2007, due to the failure of the port engine, which had been installed and placed into service by FSI ten months prior to its failure. J.A.M. also claimed that it lost the use of the vessel due to the failure of the starboard engine shortly thereafter. FSI alleges that this claim is covered by the CGL portion of the Policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Continental denies that there is coverage under Exclusion \u201cm.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">The CGL portion of the Policy states that Continental has \u201cno duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for ... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d Exclusion \u201cm\u201d specifically precludes coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACF\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cimpaired property\u201d or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">(1) A defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in \u201cyour product\u201d or \u201cyour work\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">(2) A delay or failure by you or anyone acting on your behalf to perform a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>contract or agreement in accordance with its terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">This exclusion does not apply to the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical injury to \u201cyour product\u201d or \u201cyour work\u201d after it has been put to its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The Policy provides relevant definitions that clarify the meaning of this exclusion. \u201cProperty damage\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u201cImpaired property\u201d means \u201ctangible property, other than \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019, that cannot be used or is less useful because ... [i]t incorporates \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 that is known or thought to be defective, deficient, inadequate or dangerous[.]\u201d Further, the Policy defines \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201c[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and ... Materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\u201d \u201cYour product\u201d pertains to \u201c[a]ny goods or products, other than real property, manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by ... You[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Thus, in light of these definitions, Exclusion \u201cm\u201d to the CGL portion of the Policy precludes coverage for the loss of use to tangible property that cannot be used because it incorporates FSI\u2019s defective product or work. However, this exclusion does not apply if the loss of use arises out of a sudden or accidental injury to FSI\u2019s product or work. Here, Claim One appears to fall within Exclusion \u201cm\u201d since J.A.M. alleged that the loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>was due to FSI\u2019s substandard installation of the engines. However, FSI challenges the application of this exclusion, invoking the exception for sudden and accidental damage. Continental counters that nothing in J.A.M.\u2019s pleadings indicate that the loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>was the result of sudden or accidental damage to the engines. Under the eight-corners rule, we turn to J.A.M.\u2019s allegations in its state court petitions to resolve this matter. <em>Zurich, </em>268 S.W.3d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">J.A.M. filed four petitions alleging claims against FSI in state court. Continental argues that none of the language in the four petitions supports FSI\u2019s position that the loss of use to the <em>Betty L </em>was the result of sudden or accidental damage to the engines. In J.A.M.\u2019s first petition, it states that in 2006 it purchased the two engines and that on June 16, 2006, FSI, as an authorized dealer of those engines, installed both of them in the <em>Betty L. </em>Approximately ten months later, the port engine began to \u201cpush water used to cool the engine out of the day tank.\u201d J.A.M. contacted FSI and scheduled repair work three days later. FSI technicians performed diagnostic testing on the engine, but they only discovered an oil leak and replaced two different gaskets. After the technicians left, a separate injector \u201cO\u201d ring began leaking. The vessel was returned to operation, but engine water continued to \u201cpush out of the day tank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Less than a week later, the starboard engine developed a similar problem whereby it \u201cbegan to push its engine cooling water out of the day tank.\u201d An FSI technician responded the next day and determined that the starboard engine\u2019s head gasket needed to be replaced. Service was scheduled for June 7, 2007, and FSI expected that the replacement would take four hours. However, the repair lasted four days \u201cdue to substandard work per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>formed by [FSI\u2019s] technicians!,] which created additional problems requiring repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\">The narratives contained in the Second, Third, and Fourth Amended Petitions are substantially similar. Even when reading the pleadings liberally, <em>see King, </em>85 S.W.3d at 187, it is clear that the engines did not suddenly cease to function. Rather, J.A.M. alleged that the loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>was the culmination of several problems beginning with the negligent installation of the engines in June 2006, and continuing with a series of repairs made to the engines for various problems in May and June 2007. Thus, Exclusion \u201cm\u201d to the CGL coverage applies to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">2. <em>Loss of use of the Betty L resulting from FSI\u2019s negligence in performing diagnostic work and repairs of the engines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">J.A.M.\u2019s petition made the following allegations which form the basis of FSI\u2019s second claim: (1) loss of use of the <em>Betty L </em>due to the failure of the starboard engine less than one week after the port engine had been diagnosed, repaired, and put back to use during May 2007; (2) loss of use of the vessel during the repair period that was extended from four hours to four days in June 2007 due to FSI\u2019s negligence and substandard work; and (3) loss of use of the vessel beginning on June 26, 2007, when the starboard engine failed after having been reinstalled and placed into operation the day before. FSI seeks coverage under both the CGL and the SRL portions of the Policy for (1) and (3), and only under the SRL for (2). Continental argues that Exclusion \u201cm\u201d precludes CGL coverage and Exclusion \u201ce\u201d precludes SRL coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">As previously explained, Exclusion \u201cm\u201d to the CGL coverage precludes coverage for the loss of use to physical property that cannot be used because it incorporates FSI\u2019s defective product or work. Subsections (1) and (3) clearly encompass the loss of use of the vessel due to the failure of the engines following repairs and faulty diagnostic work by FSI on those engines. For the same reasons explained for Claim One, Exclusion \u201cm\u201d applies to Claim Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Turning to the SRL coverage, Exclusion \u201ce\u201d applies. Exclusion \u201ce\u201d to the SRL portion of the Policy states that the Policy does not apply to \u201cdemurrage, loss of time, loss of freight, loss of charter and/or similar and/or substituted expenses.\u201d FSI asserts that Exclusion \u201ce\u201d does not apply because it does not specifically list \u201closs of use damages\u201d or \u201cproperty damages\u201d as items to exclude. It interprets J.A.M.\u2019s petition as alleging the loss of use of property (the <em>Betty L), </em>and it suggests that this loss is separate and distinct from the losses contemplated by Exclusion \u201ce,\u201d which are specific to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>penses. This argument is without merit. The Supreme Court long ago defined demurrage as \u201cthe loss of profits or of the use of a vessel pending repairs or other detention,\u201d commenting that this definition \u201cis too well settled both in England and America to be open to question.\u201d <em>The Conqueror, </em>166 U.S. 110, 125, 17 S.Ct. 510, 41 L.Ed. 937 (1897). Additionally, Exclusion \u201ce\u201d is intentionally expansive, and includes \u201csimilar and/or substituted expenses.\u201d Here, J.A.M.\u2019s four state court petitions make it clear that it is in the business of providing offshore rigs and vessels with fuels and lubricants through the use of its barge and tug boats. Due to the need for further repairs, J.A.M. lost the use of its vessel, including the profits it could obtain by using the vessel to provide other vessels with fuel and lubricants. There is no ambiguity in the Policy on this point, and, by its terms, there is no SRL coverage for Claim Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">3. <em>Damage to JAM.\u2019s property resulting from FSI\u2019s negligent installation of the engines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">J.A.M. alleged that its port engine exhibited mechanical failure ten months after it was installed and that the starboard engine exhibited mechanical failure shortly thereafter. FSI seeks a defense for this claim under CGL coverage. However, CGL Exclusion \u201ck\u201d precludes coverage for \u201c \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018your product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it.\u201d As previously mentioned, the Policy defines \u201cYour product\u201d as \u201c[a]ny goods or products, other than real property, manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by ... You.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Under Texas law, liability policies containing similar exclusions \u201c[do] not insure the policyholder against liability to repair or replace his own defective work or product, but [they do] provide coverage for the insured\u2019s liability for damages to other property resulting from the defective condition of the work, even though injury to the work product itself is excluded.\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Volentine, </em>578 S.W.2d 501, 503-04 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1979, no writ).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> FSI argues that Exclusion \u201ck\u201d does not apply because J.A.M. alleges damage to internal parts of the engines that are not FSI\u2019s \u201cproduct.\u201d However, a plain reading of the Policy shows that the exclusion applies to \u201cany part of\u2019 FSI\u2019s product, which are the engines that FSI handled and distributed. The internal parts of the engine are still components of the engine. Moreover, J.A.M.\u2019s petitions alleged that FSI installed the <em>entire </em>engine. FSI\u2019s attempt to separate the engine components is unavailing, and Exclusion \u201ck\u201d applies to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">4. <em>Damage to J.A.M.\u2019s property resulting from FSI\u2019s negligence in performing diagnostic work and repairs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The fourth claim encompasses J.A.M.\u2019s allegation that the <em>Betty L </em>was damaged as the result of FSI\u2019s diagnostic and repair work on both engines in May and June 2007. This damage necessitated additional repairs and the replacement of an entire engine. FSI argues that there is CGL and SRL coverage for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Since J.A.M. alleged damage to the engine, which constitutes FSI\u2019s \u201cproduct,\u201d for the reasons discussed under Claim Three, Exclusion \u201ck\u201d bars coverage under the CGL portion of the Policy. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>there is no SRL coverage under Exclusion \u201cn,\u201d which applies to \u201cthe expense of redoing the work improperly performed by [FSI] or on [FSI\u2019s] behalf or the cost of replacement of materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\u201d J.A.M. clearly alleged that FSI performed substandard repair work, and, as a result, it \u201cwas forced to pay, out of its own pocket, for what should have been warranty work on the ... engines.\u201d Thus, there is no SRL coverage for this fourth claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Since all of FSI\u2019s claims fall within an exclusion to the CGL and SRL coverage portions of the Policy, Continental has no duty to defend FSI. Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

If the answer to question one is \"Yes\u201d and the contractual liability exclusion is triggered, do the allegations in the underlying lawsuit alleging that the contractor violated its common law duty to perform the contract in a careful, workmanlike, and non-negligent manner fall within the exception to the contractual liability exclusion for \"liability that would exist in the absence of contract)?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-13\"><em>Ewing, </em>690 F.3d at 633.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. Although both engines were installed prior to the beginning of the policy period, FSI argues that under the actual injury rule, the claim is still covered by the Policy because the \"property damage\u201d occurred during the policy period. <em>See, e.g., Don\u2019s Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., </em>267 S.W.3d 20, 25-26 (Tex.2008) (adopting the \"actual injury\u201d rule in which \"the insurer must defend any claim of physical property damage that occurred during the policy term\u201d). Continental does not rebut this argument, so we accept that Claim One occurred during the policy period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-16\">. For all four claims, Continental argues that coverage is barred under a number of exclusions to the CGL and SRL portions of the Policy. Since only one exclusion need apply to each claim, we decline to address the application of all possible exclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. The SRL provision only applies to damage or physical loss that occurs while the vessel is in FSI\u2019s \"care, custody or control.\u201d Continental argues that there can be no SRL coverage for Claim Two since J.A.M.'s state court petitions do not allege that the <em>Betty L </em>was in FSI's care, custody, or control during the course of the May and June 2007 repairs and diagnostic work. FSI relies on <em>Gore Design Completions, Ltd. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>538 F.3d 365, 371 (5th Cir.2008), to argue that, under Texas law, when there is ambiguity in the underlying pleadings as to which party maintains care, custody, or control of the vessel, the court should liberally construe the pleadings in favor of the insured. J.A.M.\u2019s pleadings are silent as to whether the <em>Betty L </em>was in FSI's care, custody, or control during the course of the repair work in 2007. This omission creates ambiguity in the pleadings, and because we must construe any ambiguity in FSI's favor, <em>see Gilbert, </em>327 S.W.3d at 133, we hold that FSI has met its initial burden of establishing coverage under the terms of the Policy, <em>see id. </em>at 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. In <em>Travelers Insurance, </em>the CGL coverage did not apply to \"[p]roperty damage to work performed by or on behalf of the Named insured arising out of the work or any portion thereof, or out of materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\u201d 578 S.W.2d at 503.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
