By moving for IFP status in this court, Taylor is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">Taylor argues that (1) he is indigent; (2) his claims of constitutional violations have merit and are supported by unspecified controlling caselaw from this court and the Supreme Court; and (3) because he did not receive a report of the magistrate judge recommending the denial of IFP, he was unable to file objections and was deprived of de novo review regarding the denial of IFP. Although Taylor references generally his civil rights claims, he has abandoned the claims by failing to brief them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">Taylor has not shown that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Taylor\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Taylor\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). This court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal also counts as a strike. <em>See id. </em>Taylor is cautioned that if he accumulates three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEALS DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
