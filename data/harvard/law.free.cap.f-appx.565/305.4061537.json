He argues that the district court erred in refusing to give the jury a modified version of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Pattern Jury Charge for \u201cWitness\u2019s Use of Addictive Drugs.\u201d He argues that a modified version of the charge was appropriate because his out-of-court admissions that he possessed a firearm were introduced during the trial and because the evidence supported a finding that those admissions were made while he was being treated in the emergency room of a hospital and while he was under the influence of a pain killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">We review a district court\u2019s failure to provide a requested jury instruction \u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard, affording the trial court substantial latitude in describing the law to the jurors.\u201d <em>United States v. Rios, </em>636 F.3d 168, 171 (5th Cir.2011). We will reverse a district court for refusal to give a jury instruction only \u201cif the proposed jury instruction was (1) substantively correct, (2) not substantively covered in the jury charge, and (3) concerned an important issue at trial, such that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the presentation of a defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>132 F.3d 232, 242 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Navarette concedes that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Pattern Jury Charge for \u201cWitness\u2019s Use of Addictive Drugs\u201d was not, in its original form, applicable in his case because he was not a witness during his trial. Moreover, the jury was instructed that, when determining whether Navarette\u2019s out-of-court statements were knowingly and voluntarily made, it should consider the evidence concerning such statements \u201cwith caution and great care\u201d and that it \u201cshould give such weight to the statements]\u201d as it felt it deserved \u201cunder all the circumstances!,]\u201d including Navarette\u2019s \u201cphysical and mental condition ... and all the other circumstances in evidence surrounding the making of the statements].\u201d Accordingly, the substance of Navarette\u2019s requested instruction was already substantially covered by the jury charge. Finally, Navarette was able to adequately present his defense that his out-of-court statements were not reliable because of his physical condition and the medication he was given at the hospital. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to include the requested jury instruction in the jury charge. <em>See Rios, </em>636 F.3d at 171. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
