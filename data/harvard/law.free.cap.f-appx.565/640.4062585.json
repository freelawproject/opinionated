We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing the BIA\u2019s orders for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Oyeniran v. Holder, </em>672 F.3d 800, 806 (9th Cir.2012), we deny both petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The crux of Ehigie\u2019s argument, in both No. 09-73753 and No. 11-72039, is that removal proceedings should be reopened to allow him to apply for asylum, withholding, and relief under the Convention Against Torture in light of what he alleges are recently changed conditions in Nigeria that make him, as a Christian, subject to religious persecution. The BIA twice rejected this argument on the theory that conditions in Nigeria have remained largely the same since 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding to that effect, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in either order. Neither Ehigie\u2019s third motion to reopen, nor his fourth, presents sufficient evidence of changed conditions in Nigeria to qualify him for the regulatory exception to the time and number limitations for filing such motions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">. Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding in both No. 09-73753 and No. 11-72039 that Ehigie did not introduce previously unavailable, material evidence of changed conditions in Nigeria, we need not reach any other issue. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
