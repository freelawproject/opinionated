On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court committed reversible error during Galvez-Berganza\u2019s plea and sentencing hearings. Galvez-Berganza was notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">Because Galvez-Berganza did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea, we review his plea colloquy for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013) (discussing plain error standard). We conclude that the district court substantially complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Galvez-Berganza\u2019s guilty plea. Although the district court failed to ensure that Galvez-Berganza understood the Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ernment\u2019s right to use his statements under oath in a prosecution for perjury, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(A), this minor deviation did not affect Galvez-Berganza\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir.2009) (explaining defendant\u2019s burden to establish effect on substantial rights). Moreover, the court ensured that the plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by a factual basis. We therefore affirm Galvez-Berganza\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Turning to Galvez-Berganza\u2019s sentence, we review it for reasonableness, applying \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review entails appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and discern no procedural error in Galvez-Berganza\u2019s sentence. The district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, and explained its reasons for the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The court sentenced Galvez-Berganza within the Guidelines range, and he fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006). We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Galvez-Berganza.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Galvez-Berganza, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Galvez-Berganza requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Galvez-Berganza. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
