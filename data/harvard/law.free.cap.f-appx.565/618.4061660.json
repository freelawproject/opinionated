We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Brenes was convicted by plea agreement of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) for using a telephone to facilitate a drug trafficking offense, a provision of the Controlled Substances Act that is categorically an aggravated felony, which makes her ineligible for asylum. <em>See Daas v. Holder, </em>620 F.3d 1050, 1053-54 (9th Cir.2010), <em>In re Chang, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 90, 92 (BIA 1977). It is also presumptively a \u201cparticularly serious crime,\u201d which makes Brenes ineligible for withholding of removal unless she rebuts the presumption. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2); <em>Rendon v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 967, 976 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A]n aggravated felony containing a drug trafficking element is presumed to be a particularly serious crime which would make [the applicant] ineligible for withholding of removal.\u201d). Brenes has not rebutted the \u201cextraordinarily strong presumption\u201d that her drug trafficking offense is a particularly serious crime. <em>Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 941, 947 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Brenes failed to show that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if removed to Nicaragua. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he petitioner must show that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that he or she will be tortured, and not simply persecuted upon removal to a given country.\u201d). Brenes claims that the BIA engaged in improper fact-finding by stating, with an erroneous record citation, that she had returned to Nicaragua three times. However, the evidence of record supports the inference even if the citation to the record may have been incorrect. Accordingly, there is no due process violation, and there is no compelling evidence that Brenes will more likely than not be subjected to torture if she returns to Nicaragua. Brenes has not met her burden of proof for deferral of removal under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
