Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Eckert &amp; Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, </em>505 Fed.Appx. 281 (4th Cir.2013). We concluded that Eckert &amp; Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH (\u201cEZN\u201d) was the prevailing party in its litigation against Best Medical International, Inc. and Best Vascular, Inc. (collectively \u201cBest\u201d). However, we vacated that part of the district court\u2019s judgment awarding fees and costs to EZN because that award did not reflect the required analysis under <em>Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974). Accordingly, we remanded the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs portion of the prior judgment to the district court so that it could undertake \u201ca further analysis that [took] into account the applicable <em>Johnson </em>factors.\u201d <em>Best Med., </em>505 Fed.Appx. at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">In a thorough opinion, the district court conducted the Johnson analysis and awarded EZN fees and costs. Best now appeals that decision. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">We need not discuss all the specifics of the underlying litigation, as that matter is fully covered in our prior opinion. <em>See Best Med., </em>505 Fed.Appx. at 282-84. Nonetheless, we briefly summarize certain facts that are useful to understand the context in which the current appeal arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-19\">In 1999, AEA Technology-QSQ GmbH (\u201cQSA\u201d) entered into a manufacturing agreement with one of Best\u2019s predecessors. Under that agreement, QSA was to manufacture \u201csources\u201d or \u201csource trains\u201d of strontium and sell that product to Best\u2019s predecessor. At the end of that contract, Best was obligated to decontaminate and decommission QSA\u2019s manufacturing production lines in Germany used to make these sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">Best failed to decontaminate the manufacturing line as agreed, so QSA sued to enforce the contractual covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">QSA and Best settled QSA\u2019s suit under a 2008 Settlement Agreement that provided Best was to complete its decontamination work by a certain date and post a performance bond. Best was also required to buy minimum orders of \u201csource trains\u201d that met defined specifications. Furthermore, the Settlement Agreement provided that \u201cthe prevailing party [would] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>be entitled to recover ... reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred\u201d in \u201cany litigation\u201d \u201cbrought for breach\u201d of the agreement. (J.A. 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The Settlement Agreement soon unraveled. Best did not timely perform the required decontamination work, which caused EZN (having acquired QSA in 2009) to notify Best in 2010 that it planned to do the work at Best\u2019s expense. Best also did not post the performance bond. For its part, Best complained that EZN was producing strontium sources that did not meet the specifications found in the parties\u2019 original manufacturing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">When the Settlement Agreement broke down, Best initiated a suit raising three principal complaints:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">(1) that EZN was equitably estopped from conducting the decontamination and decommission task and from disposing of the production line in the course of decontaminating and decommissioning the production line; (2) that EZN breached the Settlement Agreement by not cooperating with Best; and (3) that EZN breached the Settlement Agreement by not providing Best with source trains and sources that met the specifications of the original Manufacturing Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\"><em>Best Med., </em>505 Fed.Appx. at 283. Best sought certain injunctive relief (including an injunction to stop EZN from breaking the line down), sought \u201cany monetary damages that [Best] sustained as a result of [EZN]\u2019s actions,\u201d and sought a refund, of payments that it made for the supposedly \u201cnon-compliant\u201d sources. (J.A. 51.) The parties agreed that Best\u2019s requested relief would have been valued at no less than $8 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">In response, EZN filed a four-count compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13, alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">(1) that Best breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to post a performance bond; (2) that Best breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to decontaminate and decommission the production line; (3) that Best fraudulently induced EZN to enter into the Settlement Agreement; and (4) that EZN should be awarded declaratory relief stating that Best had defaulted under the Settlement Agreement and that its default relieved EZN from any obligation to dispose of sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\"><em>Best Med., </em>505 Fed.Appx. at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Upon cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled largely for EZN. <em>See Best Med. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Eckert &amp; Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, </em>No. 1:10-cv-617, 2011 WL 3951675 (E.D.Va. Sept. 7, 2011). The court held that Best had not adequately established any of its claims. Further, the court determined that two of the four EZN counterclaims had not been shown. As to EZN\u2019s second counterclaim, the court concluded that Best had defaulted on its obligation under the Settlement Agreement to decommission and decontaminate the German production lines, but found that any damages claim should be arbitrated \u2014 under an arbitration clause in the Settlement Agreement \u2014 once EZN completed its own cleanup efforts. The district court dismissed the declaratory judgment count as \u201cmoot\u201d because the court had \u201cruled on all points raised\u201d in that count. <em>Id. </em>at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">EZN and Best each moved for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the Settlement Agreement. After determining that EZN was the prevailing party, the district court proceeded to determine an appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The district court began by detailing the appropriate analysis. First, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>recognized that it was to determine the lodestar figure by multiplying the number of reasonable hours by a reasonable fee. The district court acknowledged that it was to assess reasonableness by looking to the twelve factors in <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19. Second, the district court correctly explained that it was to deduct fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims. Third, the district court stated that it was to award some percentage of the remaining fees to account for the degree of success enjoyed by the prevailing party. Applying this analysis, the district court then awarded EZN attorneys\u2019 fees of $584,735.08 and costs of $32,892.61. The district court found those sums reasonable after \u201c[t]aking the Johnson factors into account.\u201d (J.A. 588.) The award also reflected an approximately $38,000 voluntary reduction by EZN for fees related to (1) pre-litigation activity, (2) its unsuccessful fraud claim, and (3) an unsuccessful motion to compel. The district court concluded that no further reduction was necessary to reflect EZN\u2019s lack of success on its counterclaims because \u201cthere was no duplication involved over and above the effort to defend itself against the claims in this case.\u201d (J.A. 589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In the initial appeal, we affirmed all of the district court\u2019s decisions except as to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We concluded that EZN\u2019s fees-and-costs request \u201cmight be unreasonably excessive in the absence of an analysis of the applicable factors,\u201d which the district court had conducted \u201conly in the most conclusory manner.\u201d <em>Best Med., </em>505 Fed.Appx. at 284. Therefore, we vacated the fee and cost award so that the district court could fully consider the <em>Johnson </em>factors on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Following our decision in the first appeal, EZN filed a supplemental petition in the district court requesting an additional fees-and-costs award of roughly $309,036.56, representing amounts incurred after EZN\u2019s original October 2011 fees-and-costs petition. EZN also included an approximately $38,000 voluntary reduction, largely pertaining to its unsuccessful cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The district court discussed EZN\u2019s original fee petition and the supplemental petition in a thorough opinion in April 2013. <em>See Best Med. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Eckert &amp; Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, </em>No. 1:10-cv-617, 2013 WL 1856095 (E.D.Va. Apr. 29, 2013). In that opinion, the district court again identified the correct three-step analysis for determining an appropriate award of fees and costs. The district court then addressed each of the twelve <em>Johnson </em>factors that affect the reasonableness of a fee request and form the basis of the lodestar amount. Specifically, it found that <em>Johnson </em>factors one (time and labor), four (opportunity costs), five (customary fee), eight (results obtained), eleven (length of relationship), and twelve (awards in similar cases), all justified the award. No <em>Johnson </em>factor justified an enhancement of or deduction from EZN\u2019s requested amounts. The district court determined that unsuccessful claims had been accounted for through voluntary reductions by EZN\u2019s counsel, and a further percentage reduction was unnecessary given that all the claims were united by a common set of facts. The district court then awarded EZN all of its requested fees and costs after the voluntary reductions were applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The district court issued an amended order that provided that EZN was to receive $871,414.49 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $55,249.76 in costs. This timely appeal followed, over which we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In an appeal from an award of attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our standard of review is exceptionally deferential, as we apply a \u201csharply circumscribed\u201d version of our traditional abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Robinson v. Equifax Info. Sens., LLC, </em>560 F.3d 235, 243 (4th Cir.2009). Under that standard, \u201cthe fee award must not be overturned unless it is clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, \u201cwe will not ordinarily disturb the award even though we might have exercised th[e] discretion [to award fees] quite differently.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Hugo\u2019s Skateway, </em>974 F.2d 1408, 1418 (4th Cir.1992) (quotation marks omitted). We defer in recognition of the district court\u2019s \u201cclose and intimate knowledge of the efforts expended and the value of the services rendered.\u201d <em>In re A.H. Robins Co., </em>86 F.3d 364, 376-77 (4th Cir.1996) (quotation marks omitted); <em>EEOC v. Great Steaks, Inc., </em>667 F.3d 510, 517 (4th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe fixing of attorneys\u2019 fees is peculiarly within the province of the trial judge, who is on the scene and able to assess the oftentimes minute considerations which weigh in the initiation of a legal action.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201cIt is for the district court in the first instance to calculate an appropriate award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, </em>53 F.3d 626, 628 (4th Cir.1995). The district court, upon remand, has done so in an opinion addressing the <em>Johnson </em>factors. Under our standard of review, Best has a heavy burden to present a case on appeal that warrants our overturning the district court\u2019s determinations. Not only would another reversal continue this long-running dispute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but it would also invite future litigants to transform their attorneys\u2019 fees disputes into standalone pieces of major appellate litigation. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cReviewing fee awards solely for abuse of a district court\u2019s discretion restricts a litigant\u2019s propensity to engage in secondary or satellite litigation.\u201d). Encouraging this sort of never-ending review would conflict with one of the most often repeated maxims in the attorneys\u2019 fee context: \u201c[a] request for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>see also Daly v. Hill, </em>790 F.2d 1071, 1079 n. 10 (4th Cir.1986) (\u201c[A]ppeals from awards of attorney\u2019s fees, after the merits of a case have been concluded, ... must be one of the least socially productive types of litigation imaginable[,] ... [especially] when litigants challenge a district court\u2019s factual findings.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Keeping our deferential standard of review in mind, we turn to the merits of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">As the district court correctly recognized, \u201ccourts evaluate attorney\u2019s fees under a reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>In re Abrams &amp; Abrams, P.A., </em>605 F.3d 238, 243 (4th Cir.2010); <em>accord Chawla v. Burger-Busters, Inc., </em>255 Va. 616, 499 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1998) (explaining that party seeking fees under contractual provision must show that fees are reasonable). \u201cThe proper calculation of an attorney\u2019s fee award involves a three-step process.\u201d <em>McAfee v. Boczar, </em>738 F.3d 81, 88 (4th Cir.2013). \u201cFirst, the court must determine the lodestar figure by multiplying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>number of reasonable hours expended times a reasonable rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). At this step, the court should consider the so-called Johnson factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">(1) The time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised; (3) the skill required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4) the attorney\u2019s opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary fee for like work; (6) the attorney\u2019s expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7) the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in which the suit arose; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship between attorney and client; and (12) attorneys\u2019 fees awards in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 88 n. 5; <em>see also Robinson, </em>560 F.3d at 243 (\u201cIn deciding what constitutes a \u2018reasonable\u2019 number of hours and rate, we have instructed that a district court\u2019s discretion should be guided by the <em>[Johnson </em>] factors.\u201d). Second, the court \u201cmust subtract fees for hours spent on unsuccessful claims unrelated to successful ones.\u201d <em>McAfee, </em>738 F.3d at 88 (quotation marks omitted). Third, and finally, the court \u201cshould award some percentage of the remaining amount, depending on the degree of success enjoyed by the [party].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis to reverse the district court\u2019s determination that the attorneys\u2019 fee award here was reasonable. We affirm the award substantially for the reasons given by the district court in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We observe that the district court applied the correct legal and factual criteria. Best does not raise any objection to half of the lodestar analysis: the reasonableness of the rates of EZN\u2019s counsel. Instead, it directs many of its objections to the reasonableness of EZN\u2019s claimed hours. Yet the district court carefully applied the <em>Johnson </em>factors to measure the reasonableness of those hours and appropriately determined that they reflected an exercise of billing judgment. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s factual conclusions, chronicled in its comprehensive opinion on remand, find support in the substantial evidence submitted by EZN in support of its two fee petitions and the expert testimony attesting to the reasonableness of the claimed fees. Once the district court correctly calculated the lodestar figure, there attached a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that the figure was reasonable. <em>Perdue v. Kenny A., </em>559 U.S. 542, 554, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Many of Best\u2019s contentions on appeal relate to its belief that the district court did not adequately account for the relief EZN actually obtained \u2014 or did not obtain \u2014 on its claims. Whether such arguments are premised on Johnson\u2019s \u201cresults obtained\u201d factor or the third step\u2019s \u201cdegree of success\u201d adjustment, they afford no basis to reverse the district court. The district court specifically held that \u201cthe amount in controversy was substantial and EZN obtained favorable results on the merits throughout the litigation in this Court and at the Fourth Circuit as this Court\u2019s findings and conclusions of law and liability were affirmed.\u201d <em>Best Med., </em>2013 WL 1856095, at *4. The district court\u2019s view of the disposition of the case is accurate given that this dispute centered upon Best\u2019s claims, not those brought as compulsory counterclaims by EZN. EZN was entirely successful in defending Best\u2019s claims. Despite this broad success, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>district court nevertheless applied more than $50,000 in reductions for certain less-than-fully-suecessful claims and appeals. <em>Id. </em>at *5-6. Though the district court refused to make further deductions, it did so because most of the claims were \u201cunited by a common core of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6, *7. In light of that finding, the district court might have in fact committed reversible error by reducing the fees further. <em>See Brodziak v. Runyon, </em>145 F.3d 194, 197 (4th Cir.1998) (reversing lower court judgment that reduced fees and costs by 40 percent, where lower court had not made a finding that the successful and unsuccessful claims were not founded upon a \u201ccommon core of facts\u201d). We also cannot fault the district court\u2019s \u201ccommon core\u201d finding, as many of the facts underlying EZN\u2019s counterclaims also supported its defenses against Best\u2019s initial claims. <em>See, e.g., Parr v. Alderwoods Grp., Inc., </em>268 Va. 461, 604 S.E.2d 431, 435 (2004) (\u201c[T]he first party to materially breach the contract cannot enforce the provisions of the ... contract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Though we do not endeavor to address each of Best\u2019s many other attacks on the district court\u2019s judgment, we note that many of them \u2014 if not all of them \u2014 address matters that fall within the heartland of the district court\u2019s discretion. Compare, e.g., (Opening Br. 8-18 (arguing that the district court awarded fees for hours that were excessive, unnecessary, or duplicative)), <em>with Daly v. Hill, </em>790 F.2d 1071, 1080 (4th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201c[t]he district court was in the best position to determine whether the efforts of the ... attorneys were duplicative [or] ... reasonably necessary under the particular circumstances\u201d). Given that reality, we are not at all left with \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Belk, Inc. v. Meyer Corp., U.S., </em>679 F.3d 146, 161 (4th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">For these reasons, then, the district court\u2019s judgment on attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. Best does not challenge the award of costs to EZN.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-13\">. Indeed, Best\u2019s briefs \u2014 asking us to parse most every line of EZN\u2019s bills on this second trip \u2014 reads as an invitation to turn this case into a nearly interminable dispute over fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
