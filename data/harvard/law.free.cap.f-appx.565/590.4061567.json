An amended disposition is filed concurrently with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">With these amendments, Judge Bea and Judge Restani have voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing. Judge Wallace\u2019s dissent from the denial of panel rehearing is attached hereto. Judge Bea has voted to deny the petition for rehearing en banc, and Judge Restani has so recommended. Judge Wallace recommends en banc rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b612-21\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASh\">dissenting from the denial of the petition for rehearsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">In the amended memorandum disposition, the majority asserts that \u201c[b]ecause no policy from \u2018higher authority specified how SVPs housed in Isolation or the Hole must be treated, a question of material fact exists as to Mims\u2019 authority to affect the conditions afforded to SVPs in those locations.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the majority errs both procedurally and substantively. As to the first, there is no \u201cquestion of material fact,\u201d because Kitchens presented <em>no evidence </em>before the district court as to Mims\u2019s putative \u201cauthority\u201d over these conditions. Consequently, the district court was correct to grant summary judgment to Mims on this issue. As to the second, the panel errs by holding, in effect, that Mims may be held liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>for the actions of jail employees under her supervision. This runs contrary to <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that \u201c[g]overnment officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>duct of their subordinates under a theory of <em>respondeat </em>superior 556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). For both of these reasons, I dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Before the district court, Kitchens made the unsupported assertion that Mims, as Assistant Sheriff, was \u201cempowered with the authority to effectuate policies and procedures within the [jail] facility.\u201d The district court rejected this argument on the ground that Kitchens had \u201coffered no evidence that Sheriff Mims effectuated any policies or procedures related to inmate classification when she was Assistant Sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In its discussion of this issue, the district court considered a <em>pro se </em>pleading filed by Kitchens. In that pleading, which Kitchens made in support of his motion for summary judgment, Kitchens asserted that Mims \u201cwas empowered with the authority to effectuate policies and procedures within the [jail] facility.\u201d This was a verified pleading, insofar as Kitchens signed it and declared that it was true \u201cunder the penalty of perjury.\u201d Mims did not herself present any evidence as to this issue. Instead, she argued that Kitchens had failed to present any evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to this claim, and therefore that summary judgment in her favor was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Because Kitchens did not allege any <em>facts </em>to substantiate his assertion regarding Mims\u2019s authority, the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Mims as to this issue could have been affirmed on that ground alone. <em>See, e.g., Waggy v. Spokane Cnty. Wash, </em>594 F.3d 707, 713-14 (9th Cir.2010) (explaining that the district court \u201cdid not err in granting summary judgment\u201d against a plaintiff who had \u201cfailed to allege any facts supporting [his] claim\u201d that the defendant had a \u201cpolicy, practice, or custom that was violative of his rights\u201d). Under our precedents, a party cannot establish a disputed question of material fact, and thereby avoid summary judgment, by making a \u201cbare assertion\u201d that is devoid of \u201cany legal or factual support.\u201d <em>DeNieva v. Reyes, </em>966 F.2d 480, 486 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">This rule applies to <em>pro se </em>litigants, like Kitchens, just as much as it applies to any other party. Our decision in <em>Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918 (9th Cir.2004), is not to the contrary. In <em>Jones, </em>we held that when a litigant appears <em>pro se, </em>the court \u201cmust consider as evidence ... all of [his] contentions offered in motions and pleadings, where such contentions are based on <em>personal knowledge </em>and set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence, and where [he] attested under penalty of perjury that the contents of the motions or pleadings are true and correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922-23 (emphasis added). It is important to recognize that this is a narrow exception to the general rule that a nonmoving party may survive summary judgment only if he presents evidence of \u201csufficient caliber and quantity\u201d to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., </em>865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir.1989), <em>citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 254, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">In particular, this exception <em>solely </em>applies if the <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s contentions are based on \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d In <em>Jones, </em>we considered a free exercise claim brought by a <em>pro se </em>litigant. The district court had granted summary judgment to the defendants, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to explain how a \u201cgeneral denial of access to religious services\u201d denied him the \u201cability to practice his own religion.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>393 F.3d at 935. We reversed summary judgment as to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>claim, on the ground that the plaintiff \u201cwas pro se and concluded [a pleading] with a signed statement attesting under penalty of perjury to [its] truth,\u201d which meant that his \u201cexplanation of his religious beliefs qualified] as evidence for the purpose of opposing a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><em>Jones </em>cited three cases on behalf of the proposition that a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s verified pleadings may constitute evidence at summary judgment, if they are \u201cbased on personal knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923. First, in <em>McElyea v. Babbitt, </em>we likewise considered a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s free exercise claims regarding practice of his religion in prison. 833 F.2d 196, 197 (9th Cir.1987). There, the evidence considered by the court consisted of the prisoner\u2019s allegations that \u201cregular Sabbath services\u201d were not held in his prison, that he did not receive a kosher diet in prison, that the religious library did not \u201ccontain Jewish reading material,\u201d and that he was \u201crefused permission to attend a special High Holy Day service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198-99. Second, in <em>Johnson v. Meltzer, </em>we considered a litigant\u2019s assertions regarding statements that had been made to him personally by a deputy. 134 F.3d 1393, 1399-1400 (9th Cir.1998). Finally, in <em>Schroeder v. McDonald, </em>we also considered a litigant\u2019s assertions regarding two statements that had been made to him personally by \u201ccorrectional staff members at [his] minimum security facility.\u201d 55 F.3d 454, 460 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Thus, in all four of these cases, the assertions \u201cconsidered] as evidence\u201d by us were things that were truly within the <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s \u201cpersonal knowledge,\u201d either because (1) they were statements about his own religious beliefs; (2) they were statements about facts of his daily life in prison; or (3) they were statements of what he had been told by another person. This makes sense. It is unclear, for instance, what evidence a <em>pro se </em>litigant could offer regarding his own religious beliefs other than a statement, signed under penalty of perjury, of what those beliefs are.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Our cases addressing this \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d exception for <em>pro se </em>litigants derive from earlier cases interpreting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), which \u2014 in a previous version \u2014 stated that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment must \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d in the form of \u201caffidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Lew v. Kona Hosp., </em>754 F.2d 1420, 1423 (9th Cir.1985). As we explained in <em>Lew, </em>a litigant\u2019s verified complaint may be \u201ctreated as an affidavit\u201d for purposes of opposing a motion for summary judgment, so long as \u201cthe complaint is based on personal knowledge and sets forth facts admissible in evidence <em>and </em>to which the affiant is competent to testify.\u201d <em>Lew, </em>754 F.2d at 1423 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Again, this makes sense. If, for instance, the plaintiff in <em>Jones </em>had been called to testify at trial as to his own religious beliefs, he surely would have been competent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">By contrast, if Kitchens were called to testify at trial as to Mims\u2019s \u201cauthority to effectuate policies and procedures\u201d at the Fresno County Jail, what could he possibly say that would be admissible in court? It is clear that Kitchens would not be competent to testify as to Mims\u2019s authority within the jail, because he has no \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of what Mims was \u201cempow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ered with the authority to effectuate\u201d there.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">A <em>pro se </em>litigant may assert any number of things in his pleadings, \u201cverified\u201d or not. He may assert that Freemasons run the country, that the moon is made of green cheese, or that all Cretans are liars. But, because he would lack \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the truth of any of those assertions, we would not treat them as <em>evidence </em>sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. In the same way, Kitchens, as a detainee who was briefly held in the Fresno County Jail, lacks any personal knowledge of that jail\u2019s bureaucratic hierarchy or the \u201cauthority\u201d invested in its various officials. Therefore, his assertions as to this matter cannot be regarded as evidence of sufficient \u201ccaliber and quantity\u201d to create a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">But even if Kitchens had presented admissible evidence of Mims\u2019s authority within the jail, which he has not, he would still not be able to establish liability. In essence, Kitchens\u2019s claim against Mims is based on <em>respondeat superior, </em>because the claim is not based on any action undertaken by Mims, but instead is based on what was done by jail employees under her supervision. Such a claim is necessarily predicated on the theory of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">However, the Supreme Court, in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>has made clear that \u201c[g]overnment officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d </em>556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Iqbal, </em>\u201cvicarious liability is inapplicable\u201d to suits \u2014 like Kitchens\u2019s \u2014 that are brought under section 1983. <em>Id. </em>Instead, a plaintiff bringing a section 1983 action \u201cmust plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official\u2019s <em>own individual actions, </em>has violated the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Our court has been reluctant to apprehend <em>Iqbal\u2019s </em>clear teaching that government officials may not be held liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior. See, e.g., Maxwell v. Cnty. of San Diego, </em>697 F.3d 941, 962-63 (9th Cir.2012) (Ikuta, J., dissenting) (explaining that, under <em>Iqbal, </em>the defendants could not be held liable for the \u201callegedly unconstitutional acts of their subordinates\u201d); <em>OSU Student Alliance v. Ray, </em>699 F.3d 1053, 1079-80 (9th Cir.2012) (Ikuta, J., dissenting) (explaining that \u201cto state a claim under \u00a7 1983 against a government official, a plaintiff must allege that the official\u2019s \u2018own misconduct\u2019 violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Williams v. Cnty. of San Mateo, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 344, 346-47 (9th Cir.2012) (Ikuta, J., dissenting) (explaining that the \u201cSupreme Court has made it clear that government officials are not liable for the misdeeds of their subordinates\u201d); <em>Starr v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, </em>659 F.3d 850, 854-55 (9th Cir.2011) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from the order denying rehearing en banc) (explaining, in a dissent joined by seven other judges, that the majority had erred by effectively \u201cinserting <em>respondeat superior </em>liability into section 1983 despite the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition\u201d to the contrary in Iqbal). I join my voice to this chorus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">. In 2010, Rule 56 was reorganized: some aspects of what was formerly Rule 56(e) were transferred to Rule 56(c), while others were \"relocated or omitted.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Jajeh v. Cnty. of Cook, </em>678 F.3d 560, 567-68 (7th Cir.2012) (discussing the revisions). This reorganization does not affect the issues under consideration here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
