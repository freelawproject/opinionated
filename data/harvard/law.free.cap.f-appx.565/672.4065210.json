We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-25\">Kyle first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Kyle was on probation in California state court for having committed a felony, and his probation agreement contained a broad consent-to-search condition. The district court held a search of Kyle\u2019s residence by his probation officer was justified by reasonable suspicion, regardless of whether this condition permitted a suspicionless search. <em>See United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 120 n. 6, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) (\u201cWe need not address the constitutionality of a suspicionless search [pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ant to a probation condition] because the search in this case was supported by reasonable suspicion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Kyle contends that the district court erred when it based its reasonable suspicion holding on the government\u2019s statement of facts in response to Kyle\u2019s motion. Kyle argues that the government\u2019s rendition of the facts, although not disputed, was an insufficient basis on which to rule that reasonable suspicion existed. Essentially, Kyle argues that the court should have forced the government to prove its proffer, even though he admitted he had no contrary version of the story or additional facts. Rather, his argument at the time was that the facts as proffered by the government did not justify the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The district court\u2019s decision on the necessity of an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 620 (9th Cir.2000). Although Kyle requested an evidentiary hearing, he never questioned or objected to the accuracy of the government\u2019s version at all, much less with the \u201csufficient definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude that contested issues of fact exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the legal issue without an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 621 (\u201c \u2018A hearing will not be held on a defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress merely because a defendant wants one. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that a \u201csignificant disputed factual issue\u201d exists such that a hearing is required.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Harris, </em>914 F.2d 927, 933 (7th Cir.1990) with a citation omitted). Because Kyle \u201cidentified no facts which, if proved, would allow the court\u201d to grant his suppression motion, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>Howell, </em>231 F.3d at 621 (noting that \u201ca boilerplate motion that relied wholly on the fact that the government has the burden of proof\u2019 does not mandate an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Second, the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. The unchallenged facts put forth by the government clearly demonstrated a reasonable suspicion that Kyle was engaged in criminal activity and that evidence of that criminal activity would be found at his home. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 122, 122 S.Ct. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Third, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate Kyle\u2019s Second Amendment right to bear arms. <em>United States v. Vongxay, </em>594 F.3d 1111, 1114 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Fourth, the district court properly granted an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1., which provides for a two-point increase if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Kyle missed two sentencing hearings, absconded from San Diego to Los Angeles, and had a bench warrant issued that took 15 months to execute. <em>See United States v. Petersen, </em>98 F.3d 502, 508 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that willful failure to appear at sentencing supported obstruction of justice enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Kyle argues that his obstruction was not \u201cwillful,\u201d contending that he failed to appear because of the shock of finding out right around the Christmas holidays that his wife wanted a divorce, which led him to take solace with friends in Los Angeles. Willful in this context means a defendant \u201cengaged in intentional or deliberate acts designed to obstruct.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilchrist, </em>658 F.3d 1197, 1206 (9th Cir.2011). Kyle\u2019s difficult family circumstances may provide an explanation for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>obstruction, but it doesn\u2019t render it unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
