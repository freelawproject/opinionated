R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b23-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed July 10, 2013, be affirmed. The district court correctly held it has no authority to order the Clerk of the Supreme Court to accept appellant\u2019s pleadings or to take any other action. <em>See Marin v. Suter, </em>956 F.2d 339 (D.C.Cir.1992) (per curiam). Moreover, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the action because appellant stated no basis for such relief. <em>See Firestone v. Firestone, </em>76 F.3d 1205, 1208-08 (D.C.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
