We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">Chen is a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China. He unlawfully entered the United States in 2012. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security sought to remove Chen. Chen conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection on the ground that he feared persecution based on his resistance to China\u2019s family-planning policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">In his asylum application, Chen stated that he married his wife, Dong Bi Xia, in 2000 and that she gave birth to their first son one year later. Shortly thereafter, Chinese family-planning officials forced Bi Xia to use an Intrauterine Device (IUD) for birth control. Four years later, however, Bi Xia became pregnant after her \u201cIUD fell off.\u201d Chen and Bi Xia left their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>village to go into hiding during the pregnancy. They did not \u201cdare[] to return home\u201d after the birth of their second son because they \u201cwere afraid that [they] would be arrested by the family planning cadres to undergo sterilization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In 2005, Chinese officials discovered their hiding spot. While Chen was not home, the officials \u201cforcibly took [his] wife to the hospital to immediately undergo sterilization.\u201d The hospital\u2019s doctors, however, refused to sterilize Bi Xia because she was suffering from an unspecified gynecological illness. Instead of sterilization, the officials fined Chen and his wife 25,000 Yuan for violating China\u2019s family-planning policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Four years later, officials again \u201crushed into\u201d their home and \u201cdragged\u201d Bi Xia away to be sterilized. This time, Chen was at home when the officials came and he tried to stop them from taking his wife. The officials arrested Chen and took him to the village\u2019s family-planning office, where they detained and beat him. The officials released Chen after Bi Xia had been sterilized and released from the hospital. Chen then began to complain about the family-planning policies to other villagers. Officials arrested and imprisoned him for these comments in April 2012. Chen escaped prison after Bi Xia bribed the gatekeeper. He then went into hiding before fleeing to the United States in June 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">At his hearing before an Immigration Judge, Chen\u2019s story changed in a number of ways. For example, he testified that during the forced sterilization of his wife in 2009, the family-planning officials detained him at the town\u2019s hospital, not the family-planning office as he stated in his asylum application. He also testified that he and his wife returned home to their village two weeks after she had given birth to their second son, and that the officials first attempted to take his wife for forced sterilization from there, not from their hiding spot as he stated in his application. In addition, Chen testified that he had another \u201cproblem\u201d with the Chinese officials in July 2012 even though his asylum application stated that he departed China in June 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Based on these inconsistencies, the IJ found Chen not credible and denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA affirmed. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">As an initial matter, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the only argument that Chen makes in his petition for review: that the IJ and BIA erred in finding Chen not credible because each failed to consider all relevant factors. Specifically, Chen contends that \u201cthe agency erred by ignoring clear indicia of [his] mental difficulties,\u201d and failed to investigate his possible mental incompetence as required by BIA precedent. <em>See Matter of M-A-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 474 (BIA 2011). The government says that Chen could have made that argument before the BIA, but did not; thus, Chen failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">We lack jurisdiction to consider unexhausted issues. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>565 F.3d 971, 978 (6th Cir.2009). An issue has been exhausted only if it was \u201cproperly presented to the BIA and considered on [its] merits[.]\u201d <em>Ramani v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 554, 560 (6th Cir.2004). A petitioner must have \u201creasonably developed\u201d that issue in his brief to the BIA. <em>Khalili v. Holder, </em>557 F.3d 429, 433 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Here, Chen\u2019s brief before the BIA included only one issue that bears any resemblance to the one he raises now in his petition. Before the BIA, Chen argued that the IJ \u201cignored critical contextual realities attending to Chen\u2019s testimony: his virtual lack of any education, as well as the fact that he was testifying from within a detention facility[.]\u201d Based on that argument, Chen contends that he \u201creasonably developed the issue of his mental state in his brief to the board below.\u201d But Chen never argued during the IJ hearing that \u201cChen\u2019s testimony\u201d itself indicated that he might be \u201cmentally challenged.\u201d Nor did he argue that the IJ failed to consider whether Chen was mentally competent to participate in his removal hearing. Nor did he argue that the IJ\u2019s failure to evaluate his mental competence invalidated the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. In short, Chen did not develop before the BIA the mental-competency issue he presents to us now. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review that argument. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lin, </em>565 F.3d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Aside from his unexhausted mental-competency argument, Chen does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determinations that he was not credible and failed to corroborate his testimony with other evidence. Thus, Chen has waived those issues. <em>See Bi Feng Liu v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 485, 489 n. 4 (6th Cir.2009). The BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We dismiss the portion of the petition that raises a mental-competency challenge, and deny the remainder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
