United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). On appeal, Wells contends that his sentence is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2012) and that his appeal waiver does not foreclose review of the issue. The Government contends that Wells waived the right to appeal his sentence, and his appeal should be dismissed. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">\u201cPlea bargains rest on contractual principles, and each party should receive the benefit of its bargain.\u201d <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 173 (4th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cA defendant may waive the right to appeal his conviction and sentence so long as the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>689 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.2012) (citing <em>United States v. Mann, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992)). We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo and \u201cwill enforce the waiver if it is valid and the issue appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-25\">Upon review of the plea agreement and the transcript of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, we conclude that Wells knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and that the issue he seeks to raise on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. Wells waived \u201cthe right to contest either the conviction or sentence in any direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>appeal or post-conviction action.\u201d On appeal, he contends that his waiver does not foreclose review of the issue he seeks to raise, because he was not aware that he would be sentenced to an unreasonable sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and his sentence is illegal because it violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. We conclude that these arguments are without merit. <em>See United States v. Thornsbury, </em>670 F.3d 532, 537-39 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
