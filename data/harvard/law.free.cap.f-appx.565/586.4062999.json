Upon careful review of the record before us and the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding Mit\u00e1n willfully violated the court\u2019s clear and repeated discovery orders, and based on that finding, the court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Mitan\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We also conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying post-judgment relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
