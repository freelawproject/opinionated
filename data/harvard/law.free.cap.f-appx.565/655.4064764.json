Biggs, a former police officer, alleges that his superiors in the Police Department retaliated against him for obtaining a lawyer during an internal investigation of Biggs\u2019 conduct in an off-duty shooting. Biggs contends that his superiors\u2019 allegedly retaliatory actions violated his Fourteenth Amendment right of intimate association with his attorney, under <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). The district court dismissed Biggs\u2019 intimate association claim, holding that the right of intimate association did not protect Biggs\u2019 relationship with his attorney. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment right of intimate association does not extend to Biggs\u2019 relationship with his attorney. We reach this conclusion paying close attention to the unique characteristics of the particular relationship Biggs seeks to protect. <em>See id. </em>at 620, 104 S.Ct. 3244 (explaining that the intimate association inquiry \u201cunavoidably entails a careful assessment of where [a particular] relationship\u2019s objective characteristics locate it on a spectrum from the most intimate to the most attenuated of personal attachments\u201d). In particular, although small and apparently congenial, Biggs\u2019 relationship with his attorney was not enduring;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Biggs\u2019 union, not Biggs, selected the attorney; and the relationship did not serve to \u201ccultivat[e] and transmit[ ] shared ideals and beliefs,\u201d offer \u201cemotional enrichment,\u201d or enable \u201cthe ability independently to define [Biggs\u2019s] identity.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 618-20, 104 S.Ct. 3244; <em>see also Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n for Advancement of Psychoanalysis v. Cal. Bd. of Psychology, </em>228 F.3d 1043, 1050 (9th Cir.2000) (rejecting psychoanalyst-patient association claim); <em>IDK, Inc. v. Clark Cnty., </em>836 F.2d 1185, 1193 (9th Cir.1988) (same for escort-client relationship); <em>cf. Fair Housing Council v. Roommate.com, LLC, </em>666 F.3d 1216, 1220-22 (9th Cir.2012) (indicating as a matter of constitutional avoidance in a statutory interpretation case that roommates would be entitled to constitutional protection because \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine a relationship more intimate than that between roommates, who share living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and even bedrooms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">We express no view on whether the right of intimate association might protect attorney-client relationships in other cases. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Cincinnati, </em>310 F.3d 484, 487-89, 501 (6th Cir.2002) (holding the right of intimate association protected a client\u2019s relationship with his attorney where the client was homeless and could not visit his volunteer attorney without risking criminal punishment for entering the neighborhood in which the attorney had his office). Nor do we hold that any one of the characteristics of Biggs\u2019 relationship is individually dispositive of our analysis. Rather, we hold that under the facts of this case and the combination of factors defining Biggs\u2019 relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>his attorney, the Fourteenth Amendment right of intimate association offers Biggs no protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">. Biggs also asserted a number of other claims in the district court which are not before us. Biggs appeals only his Fourteenth Amendment intimate association claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-13\">. Indeed, Biggs appears to have retained new counsel for his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b679-6\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Agj\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">I concur, but only for the reason that Biggs has not pled sufficient, nonconelusory allegations of retaliation. Like the majority, I express no view as to when or under what circumstances a relationship between an attorney and a client might qualify for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
