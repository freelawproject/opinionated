After exhausting their administrative remedies, the Schrollers brought this case against the United States and the Valley Forge National Park relying for jurisdiction on the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq. </em>The Schrollers allege they suffered damages when, on October 7, 2009, a tree in the Park suddenly and without warning fell on Michele Schroller as she was walking, hitting her and pushing her to the ground. <em>See Schroller v. United States, </em>2013 WL 3878690, at *1 (E.D.Pa. July 26, 2013). Schroller suffered a closed head injury with post-concussive syndrome, a fractured skull, a scalp laceration resulting in scarring and disfigurement, fractured teeth, an acute tear of the right rotator cuff, post traumatic vertigo, and other related injuries. <em>Id. </em>Schroller\u2019s husband suffered loss of consortium. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $150,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The District Court granted dismissal because it found the \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d (\u201cDFE\u201d) to the FTCA, as outlined in our prior precedent <em>Merando v. United States, </em>517 F.3d 160 (3d Cir.2008), controlled and immunized the U.S. from tort liability. We recognize that Michele Schroller alleged to have sustained major injuries after the October 7, 2009, incident. However, after a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s persuasive and well-reasoned conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">We therefore affirm the judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Schroller, </em>2013 WL 3878690.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
