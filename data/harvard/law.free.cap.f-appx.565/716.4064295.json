HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">Petitioner-Appellant Jeffrey Evans, proceeding pro se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>in forma pawperis, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny Mr. Evans\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of the merits of a \u00a7 2254 appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>Davis v. Roberts, </em>425 F.3d 830, 833 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 641, 649, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (citing the \u201cclear jurisdictional language ... in \u00a7 2253(c)(1)\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We will not issue a COA unless \u201cthe applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Harris v. Dinwiddie, </em>642 F.3d 902, 906 (10th Cir.2011) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)) (internal quotation marks omitted). An applicant \u201csatisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude that the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Dulworth v. Jones, </em>496 F.3d 1133, 1136-37 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-22\">Following a jury trial, Mr. Evans was convicted in the district court of Love County, Oklahoma for the May 2006 murder of Calvin Porter. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed his conviction and sentence and subsequently affirmed the state district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief. Mr. Evans is presently serving a life sentence at Oklahoma\u2019s Lawton Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-23\">On April 20, 2010, Mr. Evans filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, pursuant to \u00a7 2254, attacking the validity of his conviction and asserting twenty-one grounds for relief. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge for a proposed dispositional recommendation, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B); thereafter, in a detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>report and recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny habeas relief and dismiss the action \u201cin all respects.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 455 (Report &amp; Recommendation, filed Aug. 1, 2013). On September 24, 2013 (over Mr. Evans\u2019s numerous objections), the district court issued a one-page order affirming and adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and dismissing his petition. <em>Id. </em>at 468 (Order, filed Sept. 24, 2013). The court entered final judgment the same day, and this proceeding followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Pursuant to the analytic framework that the Supreme Court has established, most notably in <em>Miller-El, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed Mr. Evans\u2019s combined opening brief and application for a COA and the record, including the district court\u2019s dismissal order that adopted in full the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Based upon this review, we conclude that Mr. Evans is not entitled to a COA on any of his claims because reasonable jurists would not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision. We likewise conclude that Mr. Evans has not demonstrated that any of the issues he has presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mr. Evans\u2019s request for a COA. This matter is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b739-19\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-25\">. Because Mr. Evans appears pro se, we construe his filings liberally. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam); <em>Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n. 2 (10th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
