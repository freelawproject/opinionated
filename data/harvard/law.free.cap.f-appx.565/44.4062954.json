Wright, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chu Yan Jin, </em>No. A089 200 307 (B.I.A. Dec. 31, 2012), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A089 200 307 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 8, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">For applications such as Jin\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201cconsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of [her] claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Here, the IJ reasonably based the adverse credibility determination on Jin\u2019s vague and implausible testimony, inconsistencies between her testimony and asylum applications, and her non-responsive demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The IJ reasonably found that Jin\u2019s vague testimony affected her credibility given that, despite opportunities to provide more detail, she could not articulate her critique of China\u2019s domestic policy, which she asserted led to her arrest and detention. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that testimonial vagueness may support an adverse credibility determination once the applicant has been asked for more details). The IJ also reasonably relied on the following inconsistencies in finding Jin not credible: (1) Jin\u2019s inarticulate testimony regarding the contents of her essay and letter to the Chinese government, though she provided a detailed, sophisticated explanation of their contents in her asylum applications; and (2) Jin\u2019s testimony that she sent the letter in September 2007, though she stated August 2007 in her application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (providing that an IJ may support an adverse credibility determination with any inconsistency).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Moreover, the IJ reasonably found implausible both: (1) Jin\u2019s testimony that she hid from the police in her home though they knew where she lived; and (2) Jin\u2019s testimony that she did not know the date on which she was to appear in court on the charge that she assaulted an interrogating officer. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that the reasons for an implausibility finding must be evident in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Although Jin explained that she did not remember these details or was not paying attention when she wrote the letter, the IJ reasonably rejected her explanations because she provided these details in her applications. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Jin additionally asserted to the BIA that her post-traumatic stress disorder caused her forgetfulness, but she failed to first provide this explanation or any evidence demonstrating her condition to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Given Jin\u2019s vague and implausible testimony, the inconsistencies, and her demeanor, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Jin argues that she established her eligibility for withholding of removal based on her practice of Christianity because the IJ did not discredit that testimony. However, Jin testified that she feared harm in China only based on her fear of punishment for fleeing criminal prosecution. Thus, her withholding claim relied on the same discredited factual predicate as her asylum and CAT claims. As the only evidence of a threat to Jin\u2019s life or freedom, or that she was likely to be tortured, depended on her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for asylum, as well as withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
