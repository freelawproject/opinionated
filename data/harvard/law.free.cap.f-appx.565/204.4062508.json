Flores contends that the government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by withholding important information about the prosecution\u2019s key witness. Flores appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial and his motion for a new trial on this ground. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">During Flores\u2019s trial for his drug offense, the government planned to call David Kennedy, one of Flores\u2019s co-conspirators, as a key witness. Kennedy had been attending court-mandated counseling sessions at New Beginnings Counseling Center. At the request of Flores\u2019s attorney, the court issued a subpoena to New Beginnings requiring it to turn Kennedy\u2019s mental health records over to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On May 7, 2012, the eve of Flores\u2019s trial, a representative from New Beginnings came to the courthouse to deliver Kennedy\u2019s subpoenaed files. Rather than turning the files over to the Clerk of Court, however, the representative mistakenly handed them to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) who had no involvement in Flores\u2019s case. That AUSA \u2014 who knew nothing about the subpoena\u2019s instruction to turn the file over to the court \u2014 informed the prosecutor in Flores\u2019s case that documents relating to the case had been delivered. The prosecutor working on Flores\u2019s case, however, did not actually see the file that New Beginnings had delivered until the morning after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">At the pretrial conference on the morning of May 8, 2012, Flores\u2019s attorney asked the court to conduct an in camera review of the records subpoenaed from New Beginnings. The judge informed Flores\u2019s attorney that the court had not received the records. At this time, the prosecutor noted that New Beginnings had delivered a package to another AUSA the night before, but that he had not seen the package. This is when the parties and the court first learned of the improper delivery of Kennedy\u2019s New Beginnings records. The prosecutor tried to remedy the situation by 'offering the court and Flores\u2019s lawyer what he was physically carrying at the time \u2014 a copy of Kennedy\u2019s New Beginnings file that he had obtained from Kennedy\u2019s lawyer. Unbeknownst to the prosecutor, Flores\u2019s attorney, or the judge, these records were incomplete and not identical to those that New Beginnings had improperly delivered the previous afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The trial began immediately after this conference. On the trial\u2019s second day, Kennedy took the stand to testify. During his cross-examination, Flores\u2019s attorney impeached him at length with his extensive history of heavy drug use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kennedy also testified that he was undergoing drug counseling and treatment for anxiety and depression. Because the New Beginnings records used by both parties were incomplete, however, Flores\u2019s attorney was unaware of additional information that could have affected Kennedy\u2019s credibility, including the full extent of his drug use, his auditory hallucinations, and that he had been hospitalized for his drug use and mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">The trial concluded on its second day, May 9, 2012, and the jury began its deliberations. On May 10, 2012, as the jury continued its deliberations, the judge held the post-trial conference. At this time, the prosecutor informed the court and Flores\u2019s attorney that the New Beginnings file he had offered at the pretrial conference was incomplete. He then turned over Kennedy\u2019s complete file, which New Beginnings had misdelivered. The judge and Flores\u2019s attorney reviewed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Later in the post-trial conference, the parties submitted several motions in response to the revelation that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>had proceeded without Kennedy\u2019s full' mental health records. After reviewing the contents of the New Beginnings records, Flores\u2019s attorney orally moved for a mistrial with prejudice and requested a hearing to reveal possible governmental misconduct. Flores\u2019s attorney, in the alternative, moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). The government orally moved for a mistrial without prejudice, which Flores\u2019s attorney opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The district court ultimately rejected each motion and allowed the jury to reach a verdict, as \u201cthis evidence came in ... after the jury was out.\u201d J.A. 528. The district court also rejected any notion that the government\u2019s nondisclosure was anything other than inadvertent. It noted that the mistake was \u201cnot the government\u2019s fault\u201d because \u201c[t]he person that screwed up is the person that didn\u2019t follow [the subpoena\u2019s directions] over there at the New Beginnings.\u201d J.A. 506, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The jury returned a guilty verdict. Flores\u2019s attorney filed a written motion for a mistrial and a new trial, again requesting a hearing to determine if the prosecutor intentionally withheld information from the defense. After full briefing by both sides, the district court rejected Flores\u2019s motions. Flores appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We review each of the district court\u2019s denials for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chong Lam, </em>677 F.3d 190, 203 (4th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>515 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\"><em>Brady </em>requires that the government disclose material evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal proceeding. <em>United States v. McLean, </em>715 F.3d 129, 142 (4th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194). A <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when evidence favorable to the accused has been suppressed by the state, and the defendant is prejudiced. <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). A <em>Brady </em>violation can occur \u201cirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). However, \u201ca defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the <em>Brady </em>doctrine\u201d when the exculpatory information \u201cis not only available to the defendant but also lies in a source where a reasonable defendant would have looked.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>570 F.3d 557, 573 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>901 F.2d 378, 381 (4th Cir.1990)). That is indisputably the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Flores cannot benefit from <em>Brady </em>because Kennedy\u2019s mental health records fall squarely within the exception set forth above. Flores\u2019s attorney had equal access to the information sought: the very subpoena obtained by Flores\u2019s attorney ensured that Kennedy\u2019s complete New Beginnings records were available to Flores. Therefore, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Flores\u2019s motions for a mistrial and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. For example, during his cross-examination, Kennedy called himself a \u2018\u2018[v]ery heavy\u201d drug user and admitted that he had been fired from his previous job for drug use. J.A. 282. Kennedy went on to say that he used cocaine \u201d[a]ll day\u201d on a daily basis during the time that he interacted with Flores. J.A. 283-84. Kennedy also admitted that his drug use \"[cjertainly\u201d resulted in memory loss. J.A. 291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\">. Flores also appeals his sentence, claiming that he has a constitutional right for a jury to determine drug weights used in sentencing. Flores acknowledges that his position is not the law in this circuit. We recognize that he seeks to preserve this issue for a possible future challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
