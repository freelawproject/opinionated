After the jury awarded $1.00 in nominal damages for their underlying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, the Fireses requested attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $57,225. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approved a reduced fee award of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">The Fireses brought this lawsuit against the Heber Springs School District and various school officials after their daughter was suspended from school and required to perform community service. This punishment was the consequence of a prank phone call that the Fireses\u2019 daughter and other students placed while on a school trip on April Fools\u2019 Day in which they fabricated a story about a school bus accident. The Fireses alleged that their daughter had been punished without due process, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and claimed violations of federal and state law. The Fireses\u2019 complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as permanent injunctive relief. Shortly before trial, the Fireses voluntarily dismissed the individual-capacity claims against two of the school officials. After a four-day trial, the jury found for the Fireses on their \u00a7 1988 claim and awarded them $1.00 as nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the Fireses requested $57,225 in attorney\u2019s fees. The district court concluded that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was appropriate because the Fireses were the prevailing party under \u00a7 1988 and because their victory was not merely technical or <em>de minimis. </em>Although the district court accepted as reasonable the hourly rate that the Fireses\u2019 counsel proposed, the court determined that the attorney\u2019s fee award sought by the Fireses was unreasonable in light of the case\u2019s lack of complexity and the minimal relief obtained by the Fireses. The district court also provided three examples of excessive time that counsel expended on this matter. After weighing these considerations, the district court awarded the Fireses $10,000 for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201cAttorney\u2019s fees are within the broad discretion of the district court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hanig v. Lee, </em>415 F.3d 822, 825 (8th Cir.2005). Under \u00a7 1988, a district court may award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in an action brought under \u00a7 1983 if the plaintiff is the prevailing party. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). A plaintiff is the prevailing party \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). This \u201cgenerous formulation\u201d includes a plaintiff who wins nominal damages. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 112, 113 S.Ct. 566; <em>see Piper v. Oliver, </em>69 F.3d 875, 876 (8th Cir.1995). But being the prevailing party does not mean that a plaintiff who recovers nominal damages is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 877. Indeed, \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief, the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.\u201d <em>Milton v. Des Moines, </em>47 F.3d 944, 945 (8th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566). In order to receive attorney\u2019s fees, a plaintiff who recovers nominal damages must achieve more than a technical or <em>de minimis </em>victory. <em>Piper, </em>69 F.3d at 877 (setting forth three factors relevant to whether a plaintiff has achieved more than a technical or <em>de minimis </em>victory).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">If a plaintiff who receives nominal damages achieves more than a technical or <em>de minimis </em>victory, a district court should award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the plaintiff. <em>See id.; Ollis v. HearthStone Homes, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 570, 576-77 (8th Cir.2007); <em>Lowry ex rel. Crow v. Watson Chapel Sch. Dist., </em>540 F.3d 752, 764-66 (8th Cir.2008). The \u201cmost useful starting point\u201d for determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is the lodestar, which is the product of a reasonable hourly rate and the number of hours reasonably expended on the matter. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). When calculating the lodestar, a district court need not accept counsel\u2019s submission of hours as conclusive but should exclude from that total those hours that were not reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 103 S.Ct. 1933. A district court also may weigh other considerations to determine whether an attorney\u2019s fee should be adjusted upward or downward from the lodestar. <em>Id. </em>at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933. The \u201cmost critical\u201d of these additional factors is the degree of success achieved by the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 114-15, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The Fireses assert that the district court abused its discretion by failing to follow the lodestar-based method from <em>Hensley. </em>We disagree. The district court expressly analyzed both of the inputs for calculating the lodestar \u2014 a reasonable hourly fee and the number of hours reasonably expended. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933. The court accepted the Fireses\u2019 counsel\u2019s proposed hourly rate of $250 as reasonable. And after reviewing counsel\u2019s submission detailing the hours she expended on the matter, the court concluded that some of the hours she billed were excessive. The district court also provided three examples of excessive hours included in counsel\u2019s hourly total: time for travel during trial; time spent preparing a motion for voluntary dismissal; and time expended on the matter generally in light of the limited discovery and motion practice conducted in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The Fireses correctly point out that the district court did not expressly identify all of the hours that it deemed to be excessive. This omission, they contend, means that the district court failed to calculate the lodestar. <em>Cf. Quigley v. Winter, </em>598 F.3d 938, 957 (8th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s failure, under the circumstances here, to analyze [the plaintiffs] entitlement to attorney fees under the lodestar approach was an abuse of discretion.\u201d). The district court\u2019s explicit consideration of both of the inputs into the lodestar is sufficient for us to conclude that the district court performed the lodestar calculation. <em>See Corbett v. Sullivan, </em>353 F.3d 628, 631 (8th Cir.2003) (affirming attorney\u2019s fee award where the district court \u201cimpliedly, if not explicitly\u201d determined the lodestar); <em>Padrta v. Ledar Transport, Inc., </em>116 Fed.Appx. 36, 38 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (affirming attorney\u2019s fee award where it was \u201cobvious the district court engaged in the lodestar analysis\u201d even though the district court \u201ccould have been more clear with regards to which precise bills it found to be excessive\u201d). The Fireses further contend that even if the district court calculated the lodestar, it nonetheless abused its discretion by classifying certain hours as excessive. However, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s unique understanding of the legal and factual issues implicated by this matter and counsel\u2019s handling of them, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision to classify as excessive the three categories of hours discussed above amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Polacco v. Curators of Univ. of Mo., </em>37 F.3d 366, 370 (8th Cir.1994); <em>Winter v. Cerro Gordo Cnty. Conservation Bd., </em>925 F.2d 1069, 1074 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Fireses also object to the downward adjustment of their attorney\u2019s fees based on the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the minimal relief that they obtained and the case\u2019s lack of complexity. The Fireses claim that other considerations weigh against the downward adjustment, including their attorney\u2019s experience, reputation, and ability; the undesirability of the case and the skill required to litigate it; the nature of the attorney-client relationship; and awards in similar cases. Although the <em>Hensley </em>Court acknowledged that a district court may consider these factors in determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, 461 U.S. at 429 n. 3, 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1933, it emphasized that \u201cmany of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <em>see also Hardman v. Bd. of Educ. of Dollarway, </em>714 F.2d 823, 825 (8th Cir.1983) (per curiam). The <em>Hensley </em>Court also held that the decision to adjust attorney\u2019s fees from the lodestar amount to account for limited success is an equitable judgment for which \u201c[t]here is no precise rule or formula.\u201d 461 U.S. at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933. The district court\u2019s reliance on the limited complexity of this matter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the minimal relief obtained by the Fireses did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The Fireses\u2019 counsel admits that this was a run-of-the mill case with issues that were neither novel nor difficult, and the chasm between the Fireses\u2019 requested relief and the relief that they obtained is vast. The Fireses\u2019 complaint requested compensatory and punitive damages and permanent injunctive relief. Though the Fireses prevailed before the jury, they were awarded only $1.00 in nominal damages. As such, the district court was well within its discretion to reduce the Fireses\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees to $10,000. <em>See id.; Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 114-15, 113 S.Ct. 566.
