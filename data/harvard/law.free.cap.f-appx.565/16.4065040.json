Straus, which denied Hengqing Weng\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Where the BIA does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but closely tracks its reasoning, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Because the agency did not make an explicit credibility determination, we assume Weng\u2019s credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">To establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant must show persecution, or fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42); 1231(b)(3). In certain cases, opposition to government corruption may constitute a political opinion, and retaliation for expressing that opinion may amount to political persecution. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 547-48 (2d Cir.2005). In considering whether opposition to corruption constitutes a political opinion, we consider (1) \u201cwhether the applicant\u2019s actions were directed toward a governing institution, or only against individuals whose corruption was aberration<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>al,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the persecutor was attempting to suppress a challenge to the governing institution, as opposed to isolated, aberrational acts of greed or malfeasance.\u201d <em>Rodas Castro v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2010) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). To be sure, \u201c[a]nswering these questions necessarily involves a complex and contextual factual inquiry into the nature of the asylum applicant\u2019s activities in relation to the political context in which the dispute took place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Wong\u2019s fear of harm does not amount to a fear of retaliation based on his political opinion. The record shows that Weng co-signed, with three other people, one of whom was Wong\u2019s friend, a single letter to the district attorney objecting to corrupt actions by the city\u2019s vice-mayor. Wong\u2019s friend sent the letter to the city department that dealt with allegations of corruption, in the hopes that the vice-mayor would be arrested. Neither Weng nor the other co-signers told anyone else that they had written and sent the letter. This single action, against a single government official, more closely resembles a challenge to \u201cisolated, aberrational acts\u201d of malfeasance by an individual, rather than a challenge to a governing institution, even within the context of evidence of widespread corruption by government officials in China, particularly since there is also evidence that the government does in some cases prosecute corrupt officials. <em>See Rodas Castro, </em>597 F.3d at 101. The agency also reasonably concluded that the evidence presented to the IJ was insufficient to show that the government imputed a political opinion to Weng. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Because Weng did not demonstrate that he suffered past persecution or that any future harm he might encounter would be on account of a protected ground, the agency did not err in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), 1231(b)(3); <em>Kone v. Holder, </em>596 F.3d 141, 152 (2d Cir.2010). To the extent that Weng raises a CAT claim, he did not raise that category of relief before the BIA and we thus lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
