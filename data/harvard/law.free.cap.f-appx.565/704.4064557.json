BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">Ruben Beltran-Rubio, a native and citizen of Mexico, challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA\u2019s) decision upholding the denial of his application for cancellation of removal and ordering him to depart the United States. As explained below, we conclude that Beltran-Rubio\u2019s application was properly denied and that he is deportable because he committed a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). Thus, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-25\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b727-26\">Beltran-Rubio entered the United States without inspection in 1994. Twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>years later, he was convicted in Colorado state court of criminal impersonation to gain a benefit, Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-5-118(1)(e) (2006), a felony carrying a one-year minimum prison sentence. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings on the grounds that Beltran-Rubio had entered the country illegally and had committed a crime involving moral turpitude. In response, Beltran-Rubio applied for cancellation of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DHS filed a motion to pretermit Beltran-Rubio\u2019s application, arguing that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his Colorado conviction was a CIMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">An Immigration Judge (IJ) found Beltran-Rubio removable as charged, granted DHS\u2019s motion, denied Beltran-Rubio\u2019s application, and ordered him to depart the country within two months. Beltran-Rubio appealed. The BIA dismissed his appeal, concluding that Colorado\u2019s criminal-impersonation statute establishes a CIMT because the statute inherently '\u201crequires fraud in knowingly using a falsehood, with the attempt to obtain a benefit.\u201d R. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\u201cIn our review of the agency\u2019s decision, we decide purely legal questions <em>de novo.\u201d Karki v. Holder, </em>715 F.3d 792, 800 (10th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we review de novo the BIA\u2019s legal determination that Beltran-Rubio\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 18-5-113(1)(e) qualifies as a CIMT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">\u201cTo determine whether a state conviction is a [CIMT], we ordinarily employ the categorical approach.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Heredia v. Holder, </em>639 F.3d 1264, 1267 (10th Cir.2011). Under that approach, \u201cthis court looks only to the statutory definition of the offense and not to the underlying facts of the conviction to determine whether the offense involves moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Efagene v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 918, 921 (10th Cir.2011). \u201cMoral turpitude refers to conduct which is inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the accepted rules of morality and duties owed between man and man, either one\u2019s fellow man or society in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Section 18-5-113 resides in the Colorado criminal code as one of many \u201cOffenses Involving Fraud.\u201d <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat., Title 18, Article V. The Colorado Court of Appeals describes \u201cthe criminal impersonation statute [a]s one provision of the Criminal Code invoking a portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>state\u2019s police power to criminalize certain types <em>oi fraudulent </em>impersonation.\u201d <em>People v. Van De Weghe, </em>312 P.3d 231, 235 (Colo.Ct.App.2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The statute provides: \u201c(1) A person commits criminal impersonation if he knowingly assumes a false or fictitious identity or capacity, and in such capacity he ... (e) [d]oes any ... act [not specified in subclauses (a) through (d) ] with intent to unlawfully gain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or defraud another.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-5-113(1)(e). Beltran-Rubio contends that the statute is not categorically a CIMT because \u201cit prohibits conduct that is both morally turpitudinous and conduct that is not.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 7. He acknowledges that this court recognizes a crime as a CIMT if, for instance, it has \u201cfraud []as an ingredient.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Heredia, </em>639 F.3d at 1268 (internal quotation marks omitted). He then points out that fraud is mentioned in sub-clause (e) as only one of three possible intended goals: (1) intent to benefit; (2) intent to injure; or (3) intent to \u201cdefraud.\u201d Thus, Beltran-Rubio contends, a person could commit an act with the intent to benefit and, despite violating the statute, would not have committed a CIMT because there is no fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We disagree with Beltran-Rubio\u2019s interpretation of the statute, as he ignores the statute\u2019s introductory clause. That clause requires the \u201cknowing[ ] assumption of] a false or fictitious identity or capacity,\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-5-113(1) \u2014 or, stated succinctly, deceit. And when that deceit is used with any of the intended goals in subclause (e) \u2014 whether to benefit, injure, or defraud \u2014 there is fraud, as that term is commonly understood. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 731 (9th ed. 2009) (defining fraud as \u201c[a] knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment\u201d); <em>cf., e.g., Lagunas-Salgado v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 707, 712 (7th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cthat knowingly selling false official identification documents involves inherently deceptive conduct and is, therefore, a crime involving moral turpitude\u201d). Thus, by knowingly assuming a fake identity or capacity, a person can be guilty of a CIMT under \u00a7 18-5-113(1)(e) even if he or she employs that deceit with only the intent to benefit or injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Beltran-Rubio asserts that \u201c[i]f intent to defraud could truly be read into the entire statute, the legislature had no reason to include \u2018intent to defraud\u2019 as a possible element of the crime separate from \u2018intent to gain a benefit.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 18. We disagree. The fact that fraud can be implied from the statute\u2019s introductory clause for the purpose of assessing morally turpitudinous conduct does not mean that there are duplicative fraud intents. Specifically, the Colorado Supreme Court has stated that the statute has two distinctly different mental states: (1) the \u201cknowing utilization of a false or fictitious identity or capacity\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe intent to unlawfully gain a benefit for one\u2019s self or another, or to injure or defraud another.\u201d <em>Alvarado v. People, </em>132 P.3d 1205, 1208 (Colo.2006). While the first mental state, in conjunction with using a fake identity or capacity to accomplish one of three intended goals, supplies the fraud that renders the statute\u2019s violation a CIMT, there are still two separate mental states \u2014 knowing and intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Beltran-Rubio also contends that viewing \u00a7 18-5-113(1)(e)\u2019s introductory clause as supplying a fraud requirement would mean that fraud inheres in \u201cany crime ... in which a falsehood is used to gain a benefit without regard to the materiality of the fact, the knowledge or lack of knowledge on the part of the other party, the intent that someone act on the misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>sentation, malevolence of intent or, of considerable importance here, damages.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 15. But he cites no authority showing that the perceived shortcomings in the statute are relevant to whether a crime actually involves moral turpitude. <em>See Rodriguez-Heredia, </em>639 F.3d at 1268-69 (stating that the absence in Utah\u2019s identity-theft statute of a requirement that the fraudster procure something of value \u201cappears irrelevant to whether fraud crimes are crimes of moral turpitude\u201d). Moreover, as the BIA has explained, \u201cwhere fraud is inherent in an offense, it is not necessary that the statute prohibiting it include the usual phraseology concerning fraud in order for it to involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Matter of Flores, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 225, 228 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Finally, Beltran-Rubio argues that Colorado\u2019s criminal impersonation statute has been used to convict individuals for conduct that does not qualify as a CIMT. For instance, he cites <em>People v. Bauer, </em>80 P.3d 896 (Colo.Ct.App.2003), which upheld a conviction under \u00a7 18 \u2014 5\u2014113(1)(e) for an attorney practicing law with a suspended license. Beltran-Rubio contends that but for the \u201cregulatory scheme for licensing lawyers, [Bauer] would have done nothing wrong.\u201d Aplt. Reply Br. at 8. As the Colorado Court of Appeals observed, however, Bauer deceived clients and unlawfully obtained money from them. <em>Bauer, </em>80 P.3d at 898. Beltran-Rubio provides no convincing argument that such conduct is not morally turpitudinous.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Beltran-Rubio also cites cases upholding impersonation convictions for giving a false name to police in order to avoid arrest. <em>See, e.g., People v. Borrego, </em>738 P.2d 59 (Colo.Ct.App.1987). He asserts that such conduct cannot be a CIMT because the defendants \u201care people who suffer from high anxiety or ... fail to think things through quickly,\u201d Aplt. Reply Br. at 9, and are only playing a \u201cgame of cat-and-mouse\u201d with the police, Aplt. Opening Br. at 20. To support his assertion, he cites an unpublished decision by this court holding that a violation of Utah\u2019s obstruction-of-justice statute is not a CIMT. <em>See Vaquero-Cordero v. Holder, </em>498 Fed.Appx. 760, 762 (10th Cir.2012) (defendant pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by \u201capplying force to his front door to keep it closed while officers attempted to enter\u201d). But <em>Vaquero-Cordero </em>is not at all helpful to Beltran-Rubio, as that case did not involve Colorado\u2019s impersonation statute and even observed that Vaquero-Cordero\u2019s obstruction of justice was not similar to crimes involving dishonesty or a false statement, which are CIMTs. <em>See id. </em>at 765 (citing <em>Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>397 F.3d 1016, 1019 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cknowingly furnishing false information\u201d to police to prevent apprehension is a CIMT)).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Beltran-Rubio\u2019s attempts to undermine the categorical nature of criminal impersonation as a CIMT are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The fraud that renders \u00a7 18 \u2014 5\u2014113(1)(e) a CIMT is inherent in knowingly assuming a fake identity or capacity to achieve an intended goal. We conclude, therefore, that there is no \u201crealistic probability ... that [Colorado] would apply its statute to conduct that\u201d is not morally turpitudinous, <em>Rodriguez-Heredia, </em>639 F.3d at 1267. Accordingly, we deny Beltran-Rubio\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-17\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the c\u00e1se, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. An alien may be eligible for cancellation of removal if he meets certain requirements, including that he has not been convicted of a CIMT. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. Because a single member of the BIA entered a brief affirmance order under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final order of removal, but \"we may consult the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent that the BIA relied upon or incorporated it.\" <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 790 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">To the extent the government urges that we defer under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), to the BIA\u2019s view of \u00a7 18 \u2014 5\u2014113(1)(e) as a CIMT, we decline. <em>Chevron </em>deference does not apply, where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision is unpublished and does not rely on \"prior BIA precedent addressing the same question.\u201d <em>Efagene v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 918, 920 (10th Cir.2011). Moreover, \"the BIA is owed no deference to its interpretation of the substance of the state-law offense at issue, as Congress has not charged it with the task of interpreting a state criminal code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921. But insofar as the BIA\u2019s decision has \"the power to persuade,\u201d it is \"entitled to respect.\u201d <em>Christensen v.
