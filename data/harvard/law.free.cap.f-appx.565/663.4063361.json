Quist, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b685-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">Appellants Rickey Egberto, Natalie Egberto, and Sara Smith appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Appellees E.K. McDaniel and Howard Skolnik on Appellants\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-24\">Appellants contend that Appellees\u2019 ban on prison visitation by inmate Rickey Egberto\u2019s wife, Natalie, and daughter, Sara, violates Appellants\u2019 First Amendment, due process, and equal protection rights. Finding that \u201ca reasonable prison official could have believed terminating an inmate\u2019s right to receive visits from his child and wife was lawful,\u201d the district court granted qualified immunity based on the second step of the two-step inquiry: whether the constitutional right is clearly established such that a reasonable government official would have known that \u201chis conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Reviewing de novo, <em>Crowe v. County of San Diego, </em>608 F.3d 406, 427 (9th Cir.2010), we agree that Appellants\u2019 alleged right to resume visits with Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Egberto was not clearly established according to Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">At most, <em>Kentucky Department of Corrections v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 465, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring), and <em>Overton v. Bazzetta, </em>539 U.S. 126, 134, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003), imply that a permanent ban on all visitation by all persons to a particular inmate <em>might </em>be unconstitutional; but these cases do not suggest, much less clearly establish, that a permanent ban on visitation by a particular individual is unconstitutional. Appellees are entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b685-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-15\">. At oral argument, Appellants raised the issue of declaratory relief. Because declaratory relief is discretionary, <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 282, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995), and a request for such relief was neither presented to the district court nor briefed to this court, and it appears that any declaratory judgment would be premature, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
