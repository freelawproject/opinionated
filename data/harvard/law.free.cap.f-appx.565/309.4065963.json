Connery-Hazelwood appeals the judgment of the district court dismissing her state law claims against John L. Norsworthy for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because she does not address the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked diversity, supplemental, or federal question jurisdiction over the claims, she has abandoned any challenge to the jurisdictional ruling. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">To the extent Connery-Hazelwood seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of her copyright claim against Norsworthy, we previously affirmed that decision. <em>Real Estate Innovations, Inc. v. Houston Assoc. of Realtors, Inc., </em>422 F.App\u2019x 344, 351-52 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 249, 181 L.Ed.2d 143 (2011). Our determination that the dismissal was proper is law of the case. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir.2002). Although Connery-Hazelwood contends that Norsworthy was not a party to the case at the time because the district court administratively closed the case in June 2008 due to the automatic stay in a bankruptcy case filed by Norsworthy, her argument is not supported by the record or the law. The automatic stay lifted in August 2008 when the bankruptcy court granted a discharge, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(c)(2), and the district court had the authority to reinstate the case against Norsworthy on its own motion. <em>See Mire v. Full Spectrum Lending, Inc., </em>389 F.3d 163, 167 (5th Cir.2004). More than a year after the bankruptcy stay was lifted, the district court expressly dismissed the copyright claim against Norsworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
