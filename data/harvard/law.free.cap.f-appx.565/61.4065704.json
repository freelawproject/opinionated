We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, a defendant bears a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Reifler, </em>446 F.3d 65, 94-95 (2d Cir.2006). We \u201cmust credit every inference that could have been drawn in the [Gjovernment\u2019s favor, and affirm the conviction so long as, from the inferences reasonably drawn, the jury might fairly have concluded guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94 (internal citations omitted). \u201c[T]he task of choosing among competing, permissible inferences is for the [jury], not for the reviewing court.\u201d <em>United States v. McDermott, </em>245 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">To establish a conviction under \u00a7 2422(b), the Government must prove that an individual: (1) used a facility of interstate commerce; (2) to knowingly persuade, induce or entice, or to attempt to persuade, induce or entice; (3) any individual who is younger than eighteen-years old; (4) to engage in sexual activity of a criminal nature. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); <em>see United States v. Brand, </em>467 F.3d 179, 201-02 (2d Cir.2006). A conviction \u201crequires a finding only of an attempt to entice or an intent to entice, and not an intent to perform the sexual act following the persuasion.\u201d <em>Brand, </em>467 F.3d at 202. To prove an attempt to commit the crime, the Government must show that the defendant had the intent to commit the crime and engaged in conduct amounting to a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards its commission, which must involve more than \u201cmere preparation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find D\u2019Amelio guilty of violating \u00a7 2422(b). The Government\u2019s evidence showed that he initiated contact with \u201cMary,\u201d who told him that she was a 12-year-old girl, in a chatroom entitled \u201cI Love Much Older Men.\u201d <em>See Brand, </em>467 F.3d at 202 (evidence sufficient to sustain conviction under \u00a7 2422(b) when Government showed that defendant initiated contact with a girl claiming to be 13 years old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>in a chatroom entitled \u201cI Love Older Men\u201d). D\u2019Amelio also frequently suggested that he \u201cliked\u201d her, and that he performed sexual acts on women he \u201cliked.\u201d He also \u201ccontinuously steered the conversation in the direction of sexual contact,\u201d which we have recognized can constitute \u201cclassic \u2018grooming\u2019 behavior in preparation for a future sexual encounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. Moreover, by meeting with \u201cMary\u201d at a designated location, D\u2019Amelio took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward the completion of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 204 (defendant took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward violating \u00a7 2422(b) when he went to the meeting place that he had established \"with the underage individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Although D\u2019Amelio offered a different theory as to why he engaged in such interactions, the jury was required to make a credibility determination, which we rarely disturb. <em>See United States v. Roman, </em>870 F.2d 65, 71 (2d Cir.1989). Moreover, it is the role of the jury to choose among competing, permissible inferences, which it did. <em>McDermott, </em>245 F.3d at 137. Although he argues that he was aware that \u201cMary\u201d was an adult, the evidence viewed most favorably to the prosecution, indicates otherwise. Specifically, D\u2019Amelio showed his concern about getting \u201cinto trouble\u201d and about laws that prohibited sexual activity between adults and underage individuals. When he met \u201cMary\u201d in person, he suggested that she create an alternate screenname indicating that she was 16 years old instead of 12 years old. The jury could have drawn a reasonable inference from such behavior that he did in fact believe she was only 12 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">D\u2019Amelio also challenges the Government\u2019s use of internet communications and audio-recordings as evidence instead of \u201cphysical, in-person\u201d evidence. However, we have held that \u201cthe [Gjovernment has no duty to employ in the course of a single investigation all of the many weapons at its disposal,\u201d and that \u201cfailure to utilize some particular technique ... does not tend to show that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Saldarriaga, </em>204 F.3d 50, 53 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">D\u2019Amelio also argues that, because \u00a7 2422(b) requires that his conduct be directed toward an <em>actual </em>minor, the district court erred by instructing the jury that it could convict him if it found that he subjectively believed that \u201cMary\u201d was a minor. We have previously rejected that argument, as the statute \u201cexplicitly proscribes <em>attempts </em>to entice a minor,\u201d meaning that a defendant may be found guilty even if the victim he believes to be underage is in fact an adult. <em>United States v. Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d 140, 145-46 (2d Cir.2007) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">As for D\u2019Amelio\u2019s argument that his prosecution violated the First Amendment, \u00a7 2422(b) \u201cpunishes the <em>act </em>of enticing or attempting to entice a minor when it is knowingly done,\u201d which \u201cdoes not implicate speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148 (emphasis in original). Moreover, speech is not protected by the First Amendment \u201c \u2018when it is the very vehicle of the crime itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Rowlee, </em>899 F.2d 1275, 1278 (2d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">With respect to D\u2019Amelio\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, that claim must be made in the first instance to the district court in order that there be a full factual record on review. <em>United States v. Matos, </em>905 F.2d 30, 32 (2d Cir.1990). Although we may decide such a claim raised for the first time on appeal when its resolution is \u201cbeyond any doubt\u201d or in the interest of justice, D\u2019Amelio has not made such a showing. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we prefer to hear claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>365 F.3d 150, 152 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>We have considered D\u2019Amelio\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
