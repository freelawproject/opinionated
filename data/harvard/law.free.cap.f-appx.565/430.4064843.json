The state trial court sentenced Tapke to life in prison. This appeal presents one question from Tapke\u2019s habeas petition attacking his conviction: did the admission of a report containing double hearsay violate Tapke\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights? The state appellate court analyzed only the out-of-court statements made by the initial declarant, who testified at trial, and found no violation. Because there could be fairminded disagreement about whether the statements made at each level of hearsay were testimonial, the state court\u2019s decision was not an objective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ly unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying Tapke\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In March 2005, twelve-year-old D.S. told her mother that Craig Tapke had raped and molested her for several years. Tapke had lived with the two for a few years before March 2003 and spent time with D.S. on a couple of occasions after that. The next day, D.S.\u2019s mother called the police and took D.S. to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center. At the hospital\u2019s emergency room, a social worker recorded a detailed history of D.S.\u2019s sexual abuse, and a physician examined D.S. The physician referred D.S. to the hospital\u2019s Mayerson Center, a unit that specializes in caring for child-sex-abuse victims. At the Mayerson Center the following day, the social worker again interviewed D.S. to record a detailed history of the abuse, and the center\u2019s medical director examined her.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The social worker summarized each interview in separate reports. The first day\u2019s report described the portion of the interview about events on November 20, 2004, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Pt states the abuse started again when she would go on weekend visits [with] her younger sister. Pt stated Craig is her younger sister\u2019s dad. Pt states the same thing would happen; Craig would put his fingers in her privates, then put his private in her private. Pt states she recalls times that when \u201cCraig lived [with] his mom he had jelly stuff that he would put on his fingers before putting in my privates.\u201d Pt states many times her privates would hurt and she felt like she had to pee. Pt states when she would go pee her legs would be wet. Pt states the last incident happened about 6 [months] ago when she went on a visit [with] her sister. Pt states she was in the bed [with] her sister, Craig was on the floor. Pt states Craig woke her up and put his hands in her privates. Pt stated she heard a wrapper[,] Craig went to the bathroom, came back and told pt \u201cdon\u2019t worry it\u2019s just a condom.\u201d Pt stated she was able to wedge herself between the wall and her sister and \u201cnothing else happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The second day\u2019s report described statements D.S. made during the second interview about these events in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">Pt reports they moved out of Cheviot and Craig moved in with his mother. Pt reports she would go on weekend visits with her sister, [redacted], to visit Craig. Pt states he would do the same thing to her at this house too. Pt clarified by stating he would put his fingers in her crotch, and put his penis in her crotch and butt. Pt states the last incident was about 6 months ago. Pt states she was sleeping in the bed with her sister [redacted], Craig was on the floor. Pt states her sister was sleeping, and Craig pulled pt towards him. Pt described that Craig put jelly on his fingers then put his fingers in her crotch. Pt reports she then heard a wrapper, Craig got up and went [to] the bathroom, and when he returned he told her not to worry it was a condom. Pt states she wedged herself between the wall and her sister and nothing else happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Both reports also contained descriptions of D.S.\u2019s statements about abuse that occurred before 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The police questioned Tapke a few days later. At the Hamilton County Sheriffs Office, Tapke signed a waiver and made a tape-recorded statement about the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Tapke [stated] that on November 20, 2004, D.S. and his daughter had visited him at his residence. During the afternoon, he had agreed to take a nap with D.S. He stated that they had gone upstairs to his room and lain down on his bed, and that then he had put his hand on her belly region. He said that she had scooted up so that his hand had gone down her pants and touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d He said that \u201cprivates\u201d meant vagina. He also said that she had touched his penis. He admitted to having an erection. He then stated that he went to the bathroom and put on a condom because he was afraid that his body fluids would get on D.S. He said that he lay back down on the bed but became uncomfortable and left. He denied any penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><em>State v. Tapke, </em>No. C-060494, 2007 WL 2812810, at *2 (Ohio Ct.App. Sept. 28, 2007). Tapke was indicted on five counts: (1) rape for conduct occurring between January 2000 and March 2003; (2) rape for conduct occurring on August 7, 2003; (3) rape for conduct occurring on November 20, 2004; (4) gross sexual imposition for conduct occurring on November 20, 2004; and (5) gross sexual imposition for conduct occurring on November 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">At trial, D.S. testified about the sexual abuse she suffered from Tapke while he lived with her and her mother before March 2003. She also testified about an alleged rape by Tapke on August 7, 2003. D.S. testified that she could not remember, however, whether Tapke had sexual contact with her on November 20, 2004. The state tried to refresh her recollection by having D.S. review a portion of the social worker\u2019s reports summarizing her statements, but D.S. still could not recall whether Tapke had sexually touched her on November 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Later at trial, the Mayerson Center\u2019s medical director testified and authenticated D.S.\u2019s medical records, which included the social worker\u2019s reports. The state also called D.S.\u2019s mother and two detectives as witnesses, and it played the audio recording of Tapke\u2019s statement. At the close of the state\u2019s case, the court admitted the social worker\u2019s reports into evidence over Tapke\u2019s general objection. Tapke, an expert social psychologist, Tapke\u2019s mother, and Tapke\u2019s sister testified in Tapke\u2019s defense. The social worker did not testify at trial, and Tapke had no prior opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">A jury convicted Tapke of all counts but the second, which had charged Tapke for a rape that allegedly occurred on August 7, 2003. Tapke directly appealed to the Ohio First District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the convictions on September 28, 2007. <em>Tapke, </em>2007 WL 2812310, at *17. The Supreme Court of Ohio declined to accept Tapke\u2019s appeal for review. <em>State v. Tapke, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1509, 880 N.E.2d 484 (2008) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Tapke filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. The magistrate judge recommended denial of the petition in its entirety. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on five of the six claimed grounds for relief, but the court wrote to explain its distinct views on Tapke\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim, which it still ultimately denied. On this issue, however, the court granted Tapke a certificate of appealability, and Tapke timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction to hear his appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Tapke\u2019s habeas petition is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions on issues of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Montgomery v. Bobby, </em>654 F.3d 668, 676 (6th Cir.2011) (en banc). Relevant to this appeal, AEDPA requires us to deny habeas relief with respect to any federal constitutional claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d unless the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or involved an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Identifying clearly established federal law is the \u201cthreshold question under AED-PA.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). For purposes of \u00a7 2254(d), clearly established federal law includes only \u201cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 74, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant state-court decision is the last state-court adjudication on the merits. <em>Greene v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 38, 43-44, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d occurs when \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The central inquiry is whether the state court decision was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d and not simply erroneous or incorrect. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \u201cEven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Rather, habeas relief is warranted only when a prisoner shows that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786-87. Nevertheless, \u201cdeference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review\u201d nor \u201cby definition preclude relief.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">B. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">We may evaluate the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 decision only by looking to the clearly established federal law as of September 2007, when the court rendered its decision. <em>See Carey, </em>549 U.S. at 74, 127 S.Ct. 649. At that time, the Supreme Court\u2019s relevant Confrontation Clause precedents were <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). <em>Crawford </em>held that the Confrontation Clause bars \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d 541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The holdings of <em>Davis </em>identified, \u201c[without attempting to produce an exhaustive classification,\u201d types of statements that are testimonial and non-testimonial. 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266. \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Statements \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It is clear that the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d the holdings of <em>Crawford </em>or <em>Davis </em>because the present case does not involve facts materially indistinguishable from those of <em>Crawford </em>or <em>Davis. See Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Nor, given the Supreme Court\u2019s habeas jurisprudence, was the state court\u2019s decision an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 the holdings of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. </em>The Court recently explained that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cprovides a remedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably <em>applies </em>this Court\u2019s precedent; it does not require state courts to <em>extend </em>this Court\u2019s precedent or license federal courts to treat the failure to do so as error.\u201d <em>White v. Woodall, </em>572 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 1700, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014). In other words, \u201cif a habeas court must extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand, then by definition the rationale was not clearly established____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1700 (quoting <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 666, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). While \u201cthe difference between applying a rule and extending it is not always clear,\u201d \u201c[cjertain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 666, 124 S.Ct. 2140. \u201cThe critical point is that relief is available under \u00a7 2254(d)()\u2019s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no \u2018fairminded disagreement\u2019 on the question.\u201d <em>White, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1700 (quoting <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">It is not \u201cso obvious\u201d that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>required the state court to find that admission of the social worker\u2019s report violated Tapke\u2019s right to confront \u201cthose who bear testimony\u201d against him. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The report contained double hearsay: D.S.\u2019s out-of-court statements to the social worker, and the social worker\u2019s out-of-court statements summarizing D.S. (D.S. to the social worker) are testimonial. On direct review, we might agree. <em>See Tapke v. Brunsman, </em>No. 1:09-cv-77, 2013 WL 1315032, at *5, 7 n. 2 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (S.D.Ohio Mar. 29, 2013) (likening this case to <em>United States v. Bordeaux, </em>400 F.3d 548 (8th Cir.2005), and <em>Bobadilla v. Carlson, </em>575 F.3d 785 (8th Cir.2009), which applied <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>to find that a child abuse victim\u2019s statements to a forensic interviewer were testimonial). But under habeas review, we cannot find the state court in error. In <em>Davis, </em>the statements found to be testimonial were only those in which \u201cthe primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266. The state court found D.S.\u2019s statements to be nontestimonial because, in its view, the primary purpose of the social worker\u2019s interview was to assist doctors in their medical examination of D.S. <em>See Tapke, </em>2007 WL 2812310, at *12. The holdings of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>do not compel a contrary conclusion. Moreover, as the state court recognized, D.S. was available for cross-examination at trial, so her out-of-court statements present no Confrontation Clause problem. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Whether the second-level hearsay statements (the social worker\u2019s summaries of D.S.\u2019s statements) are also nontestimonial is a closer question and complicated by the fact that the state court erroneously decided that it could \u201creview the sentences in the report that begin with \u2018Patient states\u2019 as out-of-court statements made by D.S., not by the social worker.\u201d <em>Tapke, </em>2007 WL 2812310, at *11. The state court did not cite any authority for its conclusion, and we doubt that any exists. The fact that the social worker prefaced each sentence with \u201cPatient states\u201d means little; the report summarizes, edits, and interprets the child\u2019s statements, meaning that it bears the testimony of the social worker. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Any novice student of evidence would know that the social worker qualifies as a declarant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(b) (defining a declarant as \u201cthe person who made the statement\u201d); Ohio R. Evid. 801(B) (defining a declarant as \u201ca person who makes a statement\u201d); <em>cf. Reynolds v. Green, </em>184 F.3d 589, 596 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201c \u2018[H]earsay within hearsay\u2019 is inadmissible unless both levels of hearsay fall within an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d). Thus, the state court was wrong to analyze only whether the child\u2019s statements were testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">This mistaken understanding of basic evidentiary law by itself, however, is not enough to trigger a violation of the Confrontation Clause. The state court\u2019s decision offends the Constitution only if the social worker\u2019s report was testimonial. Even though the state court provided no direct analysis on this question, under AEDPA we must entertain and accept any reasonable argument that supports the state court\u2019s conclusion that the primary purpose of the report was not \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <em>see also Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 784. In this case, the state court found that the primary purpose of the report was to assist the doctors in providing D.S. with medical care. Again, on a direct appeal, we likely would agree with Tapke and the district court that the evidence supports a different finding and that these statements are testimonial. <em>See Tapke, </em>2013 WL 1315032, at *7 n. 4. But we cannot say that the evidence supports only a contrary conclusion. There can be \u201cfairminded disagreement\u201d about whether the second-level statements are testimonial. Such disagreement alone precludes habeas relief. <em>White, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1700.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Tapke also makes arguments relying in various ways on <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011); <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009); <em>Jones v. Basinger, </em>635 F.3d 1030 (7th Cir.2011); and <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>707 F.2d 381 (9th Cir.1983). We may not consult these cases in assessing Tapke\u2019s habeas claim. The first two occurred after the relevant state-court decision, and thus do not constitute \u201cclearly established federal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Carey, </em>549 U.S. at 74, 127 S.Ct. 649. With respect to the last two, we \u201cmay not consult [our] own precedents, rather than those of [the Supreme] Court, in assessing a habeas claim governed by \u00a7 2254,\u201d so it is unlikely that we may consult the precedents of our sister circuits. <em>White, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1700 (quoting <em>Parker v. Matthews, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2148, 2155, 183 L.Ed.2d 32 (2012)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The appropriate inquiry under AEDPA is \u201cnot whether a federal court believes a state court\u2019s determination ... was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable-a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). Tapke has not cleared this threshold: the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was not \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">III.
