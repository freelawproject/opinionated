Three days after the district court entered judgment, US-CIS issued a Notice to Appear commencing removal proceedings. Because the commencement of removal proceedings forecloses any plausible relief on Peters\u2019 APA claim, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-21\">Under <em>Cabaccang v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, </em>627 F.3d 1313, 1315-17 (9th Cir.2010), a district court loses subject-matter jurisdiction of an APA claim challenging USCIS\u2019s denial of an application for adjustment of status once removal proceedings have begun and the same relief may be pursued before the immigration court. Peters concedes that if we were to find error in the district court\u2019s resolution of the claim, the district court could not enter a judgment for Peters on remand. And even assuming we could remand directly to USCIS, such a remand would be \u201cfutile at this point\u201d because now \u201cthe immigration judge has exclusive jurisdiction over [Peters\u2019] adjustment of status application[.]\u201d <em>Ibarra v. Swacina, </em>628 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">As for her challenge to the decision of USCIS, the commencement of removal proceedings has left Peters without a \u201clegally cognizable interest in the outcome,\u201d <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496-97, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969), and reduced her appeal of the agency\u2019s resolution to an abstract exercise. \u201cIt has been long settled that a federal court has no authority to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u201d <em>Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). When \u201can event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>court to grant any effectual relief!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
