Barnes appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendants on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) claims of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and his claims that Defendants violated the Americans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 (2006), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (2012). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error with regard to Barnes\u2019 \u00a7 1983 and Rehabilitation Act claims. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Barnes v. Young, </em>No. 7:12-cv-00067-NKM-RSB, 2013 WL 5151376 (W.D.Va. Sept. 13, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">With regard to Barnes\u2019 ADA claims, we note that \u201cTitle II of the ADA ... [does not] provide[ ] for individual capacity suits against state officials.\u201d <em>Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Ctr., </em>280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2001) (collecting cases). As a result, such a suit may only be brought against a defendant in an official capacity. \u201c[A] suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official\u2019s office. As such, it is no different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (internal citation omitted). Under the Eleventh Amendment, States are immunized from suits brought in federal court, absent a waiver from the State or a clear, constitutionally permissible Congressional exercise of its power under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304. The ADA creates an exception to this prohibition, however, where the ADA violations at issue also violate the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Georgia, </em>546 U.S. 151, 153, 159, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). Because we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Barnes\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims, we conclude that Barnes\u2019 ADA claims are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We deny Barnes\u2019 motion to appoint counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
