The district court sentenced Partin to concurrent 120-month sentences on each count. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate Partin\u2019s sentence on both counts and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">The appeal waiver in Partin\u2019s plea agreement does not bar his appeal because the applicable waiver provision was never mentioned during the plea colloquy, and the district court misstated the scope of the provision it did mention. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N); <em>United States v. Arellano-Gallegos, </em>387 F.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir.2004) (finding plain error under Rule 11 where \u201cthe plea waiver was never mentioned in open court prior to the acceptance of the plea\u201d). We note that neither the government nor defense counsel, who were present at the colloquy and knew the terms of the plea agreement, brought these mistakes to the district court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">The district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines range for Par-tin\u2019s child pornography offense. The government did not have to prove that Partin controlled the images of child pornography found in his computer cache, shadow volume, and unallocated space. Unlike the defendant in <em>United States v. Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d 853 (9th Cir.2006), who was convicted of possessing child pornography, <em>id. </em>at 856, Partin pled guilty to accessing with intent to view child pornography. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>fore, for Partin\u2019s offense to have \u201cinvolved ... 600 or more images,\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D), Partin need only have accessed with intent to view those images. Partin\u2019s arguments that this renders the Sentencing Guidelines nonsensical are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Partin accessed with intent to view 600 or more images of child pornography. Partin visited about 2,000 individual pages on a website containing child pornography. Each page contained twenty-one thumbnail images, some of which were images of child pornography and some of which were not. The government\u2019s expert testified that every image was immediately viewable at the top of each page. The government\u2019s expert also testified that each of the more than 1,800 images of child pornography on Partin\u2019s computer must have appeared on a page that Partin actually visited. The government thus established that every image on Partin\u2019s computer appeared at the top of his computer screen. It was not clear error to find that Partin accessed with intent to view 600 or more of those images.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The district court did not strictly comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 because it referenced disputed facts at sentencing without resolving the dispute. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B) (\u201cAt sentencing, the court ... must \u2014 for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter \u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing....\u201d); <em>United States v. Fernandez-Angulo, </em>897 F.2d 1514, 1516 (9th Cir.1990) (en banc) (requiring \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with Rule 32). The district court referenced the disputed fact that Partin transported drugs in five-gallon buckets, implying that his crime involved an enormous quantity of drugs. Further, the district court referenced Partin\u2019s intent to sell the drugs when he had denied such an intent, contending instead that he intended merely to distribute them. We cannot be confident that the district court did not rely on these disputed facts in weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, deciding what weight \u2014 if any \u2014 to give the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and calculating Partin\u2019s overall sentence. <em>See United States v. Bay, </em>820 F.2d 1511, 1514 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that a sentence depends on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d and is not \u201ctied inextricably\u201d to any one crime of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Because it is a common and commendable practice for district judges to consider sentences holistically, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we vacate Partin\u2019s sentence on both counts and remand for resentencing on an open record, even though the district court did not err in imposing sentence on the accessing child pornography count. See <em>Fernandez-Angulo, </em>897 F.2d at 1516 n. 2; <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
