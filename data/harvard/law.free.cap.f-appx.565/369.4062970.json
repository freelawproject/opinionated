We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">Many aspects of this case stem from allegations that MKP and its principals engaged in a variety of fraudulent schemes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The three insurers\u2019 declaratory judgment actions sought rulings that certain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance policies that had been issued to MKP were void ab initio because, claimed the insurers, the policies had been fraudulently procured. In the meantime, IberiaBank and Chase were independently pursuing remedies against MKP in separate civil actions predicated on MKP\u2019s conduct in obtaining loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>from their respective financial institutions. IberiaBank filed a fraud action against MKP, but its claims against MKP remain pending and have not been reduced to a judgment. Chase, by contrast, obtained a civil judgment against MKP and filed a creditor\u2019s bill lawsuit against MKP, asserting an interest in MKP\u2019s assets, including MKP\u2019s interests in the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">After the insurers filed their declaratory judgment actions, IberiaBank and Chase moved to intervene in the insurers\u2019 actions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 24(a) and (b). According to the banks, MKP\u2019s rights in the insurance policies were its sole assets. In the banks\u2019 view, their participation in the defense against the insurers\u2019 actions was necessary to protect their interests in MKP\u2019s receipt of the proceeds because if the insurers\u2019 actions were successful, any judgment that the banks had obtained or could obtain against MKP would be worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The district court denied the banks\u2019 motions to intervene, holding that they had failed to demonstrate a substantial legal interest in the subject matter of the insurers\u2019 declaratory judgment actions, that any residual interest of the banks in the actions was adequately represented by MKP\u2019s participation in the lawsuits, and that the banks had failed to assert a common question of law or fact that would support permissive intervention. The banks filed this appeal. <em>See Purnell v. City of Akron, </em>925 F.2d 941, 944-45 (6th Cir.1991) (noting that an order denying a motion to intervene is an appealable order).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The banks first argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a). In pertinent part, a district court \u201cmust\u201d permit intervention if the proposed intervenor timely \u201cclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\u2019s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2). We have explained this rule as requiring a proposed intervenor to show that \u201c(1) the application was timely filed; (2) the applicant possesses a substantial legal interest in the case; (3) the applicant\u2019s ability to protect its interest will be impaired without intervention; and (4) the existing parties will not adequately represent the applicant\u2019s interest.\u201d Blo<em>unt-Hill v. Zelman, </em>636 F.3d 278, 283 (6th Cir.2011). This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s determination of intervention as a matter of right, except that we review the district court\u2019s determination of the timeliness of an application for intervention only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The banks spend much effort attempting to counter the district court\u2019s ruling that neither of them possessed a substantial legal interest in the insurers\u2019 actions against MKP. We are skeptical that they succeed. To be sure, this circuit \u201csubscribe[s] to a rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke intervention of right,\u201d <em>Grutter v. Bollinger, </em>188 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201can intervenor need not have the same standing necessary to initiate a lawsuit in order to intervene in an existing district court suit where the plaintiff has standing.\u201d <em>Providence Baptist Church v. Hillandale Comm., Ltd., </em>425 F.3d 309, 315 (6th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). But our case law\u2019s requirement that the proposed intervenors possess \u201ca significant legal interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>in the subject matter of the litigation\u201d is not without meaning. <em>Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, </em>904 F.2d 336, 341 (6th Cir.1990). Instead, the applicant for intervention \u201cmust have a direct and substantial interest in the litigation,\u201d <em>Grubbs v. Norris, </em>870 F.2d 343, 346 (6th Cir.1989), such that it is a \u201creal party in interest in the transaction which is the subject of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Providence Baptist Church, </em>425 F.3d at 317 (quoting <em>Mich. State AFL-CIO v. Miller, </em>103 F.3d 1240, 1246 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">For example, a putative intervenor does not possess the requisite interest where its \u201cprimary interest\u201d in the litigation is to preserve a party\u2019s financial viability in order to protect the intervenor\u2019s own economic interests in the party\u2019s continued solvency. <em>Blount-Hill v. Bd. of Educ. of Ohio, </em>195 Fed.Appx. 482, 486 (6th Cir.2006) (rejecting as insufficient an applicant\u2019s interest in \u201cpreserving] the constitutionality of the community school\u2019s funding structure so that [the applicant] might continue to contract with community schools\u201d). Thus, an applicant is not due intervention as a matter of right where the applicant seeks only to protect the assets of a party to the litigation in order to ensure that its own contingent claims to those assets remain valuable in the future. <em>See United States v. Tennessee, </em>260 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir.2001) (rejecting as insufficient the proposed intervenor\u2019s \u201ceconomic interest in assuring adequate funding for implementation of the settlement agreements and its contractual rights in agreements\u201d). <em>See also Med. Liab. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Alan Curtis LLC, </em>485 F.3d 1006, 1008-09 (8th Cir.2007) (applicant\u2019s interest in \u201censuring] that the defendants in her state lawsuit have sufficient resources to satisfy any judgment she might obtain against them\u201d was insufficient to support intervention as a matter of right); <em>Mothersill D.I.S.C. Corp. v. Petroleos Mexicanos, S.A., </em>831 F.2d 59, 62-63 (5th Cir.1987) (same principle).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">IberiaBank admits that it does not possess a judgment against MKP, yet it insists that it is entitled to intervene in the insurers\u2019 actions in order to protect its contingent interests in the policy proceeds because they are the only assets that could potentially be applied to a future judgment that IberiaBank might obtain against MKP. IberiaBank, in other words, seeks to protect its own future economic interests by warding off the insurers\u2019 challenge to the value of MKP\u2019s pool of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">But the \u201ccircuits have generally concluded that a party may not intervene in support of a defendant solely to protect judgment funds that the party wishes to recover itself.\u201d <em>Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. F.D.I.C., </em>717 F.3d 189, 195 (D.C.Cir.2013). And for good reason: construing Rule 24(a) as barring intervention as of right where the proposed intervener\u2019s \u201csole interest in the present action is in the prospective collectability of a debt\u201d avoids the significant practical implications of an opposite interpretation. <em>United States v. Alisal Water Corp., </em>370 F.3d 915, 920 (9th Cir.2004). If \u201can allegedly impaired ability to collect judgments arising from past claims\u201d sufficed to confer a right to intervention, then \u201cvirtually any creditor of a defendant [could] intervene in a lawsuit where damages might be awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Stretching Rule 24(a) to apply to IberiaBank\u2019s circumstances here would permit intervention as a matter of course by even a contingent creditor of almost any defendant. We decline to adopt such an expansive view of the Rule, which would broadly extend the right of intervention to anyone who \u201cmight anticipate a benefit from a judgment in favor of one of the parties to a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Flying J, Inc. v. Van Hollen, </em>578 F.3d 569, 571 (7th Cir.2009). <em>See also id. </em>(\u201cThe reason [for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>narrowly construing intervention as a matter of right] is practical, and also obvious: the effects of a judgment in or a settlement of a lawsuit can ramify throughout the economy, inflicting hurt difficult to prove on countless strangers to the litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Chase\u2019s argument shares similarities with IberiaBank\u2019s, with the added wrinkle that it has already obtained a judgment against MKP and has filed a creditor\u2019s bill lawsuit that, claims Chase, gave it an equitable interest in MKP\u2019s interests in the insurance policies. It is an open question whether, for purposes of Rule 24(a), Chase\u2019s circumstances or interests are fundamentally different than those of Iberia-Bank. At bottom, Rule 24(a) does not entitle creditors to intervene in unrelated litigation merely to protect the assets of those who owe them debts, and it is not evident that a creditor\u2019s lien alters that analysis. <em>See Alisal, </em>370 F.3d at 920 n. 3 (\u201cA mere interest in property that may be impacted by litigation is not a passport to participate in the litigation itself. To hold otherwise would create a slippery slope where anyone with an interest in the property of a party to a lawsuit could bootstrap that stake into an interest in the litigation itself\u2019). On the other hand, to the extent that Chase has obtained an equitable interest in the policies that were issued to MKP, its intervention arguably may be purposed to defend a direct, \u201clegally protectable\u201d interest rather than a contingent one \u2014 its own property interests rather than those of MKP. <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., </em>732 F.2d 452, 464 (5th Cir.1984) (citing <em>Donaldson v. United States, </em>400 U.S. 517, 531, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971)). <em>See also Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Treesdale, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 216, 222-23 (3d Cir.2005) (noting that property interests that are enforceable in equity may be sufficient to support intervention as of right); <em>Diaz v. S. Drilling Corp., </em>427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.1970) (\u201cInterests in property are the most elementary type of right that Rule 24(a) is designed to protect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">But we do not need to decide this issue in this case. Even if Chase\u2019s equitable lien places it in somewhat of a stronger position than IberiaBank on the \u201csubstantial legal interest\u201d prong, we agree with the district court that both banks\u2019 interests in the insurers\u2019 declaratory judgment actions are adequately represented by MKP and that the banks are therefore not entitled to intervene as a matter of right. \u201cApplicants for intervention bear the burden of proving that they are inadequately represented by a party to the suit.\u201d <em>United States v. Michigan, </em>424 F.3d 438, 443 (6th Cir.2005). Although it is true that a proposed intervenor must show only \u201cthat there is a <em>potential </em>for inadequate representation,\u201d <em>Grutter, </em>188 F.3d at 400, a presumption of adequate representation arises when a putative intervenor \u201cshare[s] the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit.\u201d <em>Michigan, </em>424 F.3d at 444. An applicant for intervention as of right \u201cfails to meet his burden of demonstrating inadequate representation\u201d if he cannot show \u201ccollusion ... between the representatives and an opposing party,\u201d pursuit by the representative of an interest adverse to the interests of the proposed intervenor, or a representative\u2019s failure \u201cin the fulfillment of his duty.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Milliken, </em>828 F.2d 1186, 1192 (6th Cir.1987); <em>see Jansen, </em>904 F.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The banks have not overcome the presumption here. The banks and MKP share the same ultimate objective in the insurers\u2019 declaratory judgment actions; namely, to defeat the insurers\u2019 attempt to rescind the policies and avoid a payout. The banks insist that MKP does not share their interests in securing the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the policies in order to apply them against the banks\u2019 present and potential judgments against MKP. But this argument misses the point. The banks\u2019 interest in the lawsuits in question \u2014 the insurers\u2019 declaratory judgment actions \u2014 is identical to MKP\u2019s interest in those lawsuits. And while the respective interests do not need to be \u201cwholly\u201d adverse in order to support intervention, they must at least be different. <em>Purnell, </em>925 F.2d at 950. The banks have not identified any difference between their desired resolution to the declaratory judgment actions and the outcome desired by MKP in those actions. Regardless of the fact that MKP and the banks may have different designs for the policy proceeds if the insurers ultimately are forced to pay upon the policies, their interests in the resolution of the pending declaratory judgment actions are exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">For the most part, the banks wish to intervene in order to enter into the pending lawsuits on MKP\u2019s behalf, which in their view would give MKP a better chance of defeating the insurers\u2019 claims against it. At this stage, then, the banks\u2019 interests are wholly aligned with those of MKP. Contrary to the banks\u2019 argument, these circumstances do not pose the potential of competing claims that would suggest that intervention is appropriate. <em>See Purnell, </em>925 F.2d at 950 (representative did not adequately represent proposed intervenor\u2019s interests where the respective interests \u201care in competition in the sense that both want full recovery from what may be limited damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">And there is nothing to support the banks\u2019 assertion that MKP cannot fend for itself or will only litigate the insurers\u2019 action half-heartedly. <em>See B. Fernandez &amp; Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., </em>440 F.3d 541, 546 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that a proposed intervenor bears a relatively higher burden of proving inadequacy of representation where it does not possess unique interests). The banks contend that MKP has no assets and is unable or unwilling to fully defend against the insurers\u2019 actions, especially because any proceeds of the policies may ultimately flow to the banks rather than be retained by MKP. But the banks have not cited anything in the record to substantiate their conclusory assertions that MKP, which is represented by counsel and is defending itself in the insurers\u2019 actions, is failing to fulfill its duties in protecting the interests that it and the banks share. <em>See Bradley, </em>828 F.2d at 1192. They have therefore failed to show that their participation in the insurers\u2019 actions against MKP is necessary. The district court did not err in refusing to grant the banks\u2019 motions to intervene as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The banks also contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion to intervene under Rule 24(b), under which the court \u201cmay\u201d permit intervention by anyone who \u201chas a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(1)(B). <em>See Michigan, </em>424 F.3d at 445 (district court\u2019s denial of permissive intervention is reviewed for an abuse of discretion). \u201cTo intervene permissively, a proposed intervenor must establish that the motion for intervention is timely and alleges at least one common question of law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If these two requirements have been established, the district court must \u201cbalance undue delay and prejudice to the original parties, if any, and any other relevant factors to determine whether, in the court\u2019s discretion, intervention should be allowed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The district court here found that the banks had failed to articulate a common question of law or fact inasmuch as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>requested leave to intervene based solely on their interests in the proceeds of the insurance policies. Our review of the district court\u2019s ruling and the parties\u2019 arguments convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the banks\u2019 motions for permissive intervention. We therefore decline to disturb its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\">. We grant the parties' pending motions requesting that we take notice of certain materials filed in related civil and criminal cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
