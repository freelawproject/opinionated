The IJ and the BIA found that Murad\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that even if it were timely, Murad failed to establish eligibility for asylum. The IJ and the BIA also found that Murad was not entitled to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), or under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">On appeal, Murad argues that the BIA erred in affirming the denial of his application for asylum, but he does not address the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s findings that his application was time-barred. He also fails to address the denial of his claim for withholding of removal under the INA, arguing only that he is entitled to withholding or deferral of removal under CAT because he established that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Bangladesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and briefly articulated its reasons for doing so. Thus, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA, and after careful consideration, we dismiss in part and deny in part Murad\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), an asylum application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>must be filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B); <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\u201cThe determination of whether an alien can apply for asylum, however, is left exclusively to the Attorney General, and \u2018[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u2019 regarding timeliness of the asylum application.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)); <em>see also Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Here, although the BIA discussed various grounds for affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Murad\u2019s application for asylum, it expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Murad\u2019s asylum application was untimely and therefore time-barred, having been filed over a decade after Murad\u2019s arrival in the United States. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the decision as to the timeliness of Murad\u2019s asylum application, and because the untimeliness of the application provides an independent and sufficient ground for the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s denial of the application, we dismiss Murad\u2019s petition for review as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">II. Withholding of Removal Under the INA</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">As to Murad\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under the INA, we note that Murad has not raised any argument regarding the denial of that claim in his briefs on appeal. We therefore find that he has abandoned the issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">An appellant adequately raises an issue on appeal when he specifically and clearly identifies the issue in his opening brief and plainly and prominently indicates that he is raising the issue for review, such as by dedicating a discrete section of his argument to that issue. <em>Cole v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>712 F.3d 517, 530 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 158, 187 L.Ed.2d 40 (2013). Here, Murad only mentioned the denial of his claim for withholding of removal under the INA in his Statement of the Case, and he failed to even address the issue in his argument, much less dedicate a discrete section of his argument to the issue. Moreover, he challenged the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s factual findings only in the context of his claims for asylum and CAT relief. Murad has therefore abandoned the issue of the denial of withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIf the party mentions the issue only in his Statement of the Case but does not elaborate further in the Argument section, the party has abandoned that issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">III. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">As to Murad\u2019s claim for withholding or deferral of removal under CAT, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s finding that Murad failed to establish eligibility for CAT protection. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">We review legal determinations de novo, <em>Cole, </em>712 F.3d at 523, but we review factu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>al findings, including credibility determinations, under the highly deferential substantial evidence test. <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4e\">Under the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.... In sum, findings of fact made by administrative agencies, such as the BIA, may be reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARb\"><em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">To be eligible for CAT relief, an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>Cole, </em>712 F.3d at 532. For purposes of CAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). Furthermore, \u201c[t]orture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture\u201d and \u201cdoes not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Here, substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Murad failed to meet his burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of Bangladesh public officials if removed. The IJ found that Murad did not demonstrate that he would be persecuted, much less tortured, upon removal to Bangladesh and that in any event he offered no conclusive evidence that any mistreatment he might receive would rise to the level of severe pain or suffering. In addition, the IJ found that various aspects of Murad\u2019s testimony regarding prior isolated instances of physical abuse at the hands of the police was incredible and uncorroborated. Moreover, the IJ noted that any pain or suffering Murad might endure as a result of his arrest and prosecution for his alleged involvement in the 1989 assassination attempt on the current prime minister would not constitute torture under CAT, as such treatment would be incidental to lawful sanctions. We cannot say that the record compels reversal of these findings, and we therefore agree that Murad failed to meet his burden of establishing that he would more likely than not be tortured at the hands of or with the acquiescence of public officials upon removal to Bangladesh. Accordingly, we deny Murad\u2019s petition as to his claim for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Upon review of the record on appeal and after careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss Murad\u2019s petition in part and deny his petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
