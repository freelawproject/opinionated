Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The district court did not err in denying Ground One of Canete\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The same claim was raised on Canete\u2019s direct appeal in state court. The state appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the police officer\u2019s warnings were sufficient, under <em>Miranda, </em>to inform Canete of his right to have counsel present during questioning was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
