On appeal, Zhang argues that the IJ\u2019s decision \u2014 that Zhang failed to meet her burden of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution because she did not show an objectively reasonable possibility of undergoing forced sterilization on her return to China \u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">As an initial matter, Zhang has not raised any argument in her brief regarding relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Consequently, she has abandoned that claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that the failure to argue an issue on appeal constitutes abandonment). Additionally, we cannot adjudicate Zhang\u2019s CAT claim because she did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (noting that we lack jurisdiction to hear claims when a petitioner fails to exhaust her administrative remedies by raising an issue before the BIA). As a result, we only address Zhang\u2019s arguments regarding asylum and withholding of removal based on her fear of forced sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">We review administrative factual determinations regarding eligibility for asylum under the highly deferential substantial-evidence standard, and \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch\u201d and will reverse a finding of fact made by the BIA only when the record compels reversal, not when it merely supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and added its own discussion. Accordingly, we review both opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">An alien who is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). Asylum may be granted if the alien establishes that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). \u201cA refugee is defined as one who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An applicant may establish a well-founded fear of persecution by showing \u201ca fear of persecution in his country of nationality on account of a protected ground, a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 of suffering persecution if the applicant returns to that country, and that he is unable or unwilling to return because of his fear.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i)). Applicants who fear being forced to undergo involuntary sterilization are deemed to have a fear of persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">After review, we cannot say that the record compels reversal. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision that Zhang did not establish a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of future persecution, as she did not establish that the Chinese government would view her children \u2014 all of whom were born in the United States \u2014 as a violation of its family planning policies or that there was a reasonable possibility that any enforcement of the policies against her would rise to the level of persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See In re J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 197-98 (B.I.A.2007) (noting that a Chinese alien can establish refugee status by showing a violation of local family planning policies and that current enforcement efforts of such policies created a well-founded fear of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zhang\u2019s children would not be counted for purposes of birth limitation policies so long as they are not registered as Chinese permanent residents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zhang has not provided evidence that any similarly situated individuals \u2014 Chinese citizens with American-born children \u2014 have been deemed to violate the family planning policies. Additionally, the 2007 village committee letter Zhang offers to prove that she would be in violation of the policies and subject to involuntary sterilization was appropriately discredited by the IJ because, in addition to being unsigned and unauthenticated, <em>see Li Shan Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>672 F.3d 961, 964 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam), it was inconsistent with and undermined by other facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Even assuming that Zhang would be considered to have violated family planning policies, the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zhang failed to show enforcement would rise to the level of persecution. Notwithstanding evidence of \u201cstructural incentive[s] for officials to employ coercive measures to meet population goals,\u201d the record indicates that, in actuality, enforcement was more likely to come in \u201cthe form of economic benefits or sanctions.\u201d Moreover, there was no evidence of \u201cany cases of physical force employed in connection with abortion or sterilization in [Zhang\u2019s province] in the past ten years.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Upon review of the entire administrative record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition for review. .</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">. Because Zhang is unable to satisfy the standard for asylum, she necessarily fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1010-11 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Zhang argues that the IJ\u2019s finding \"ignores the possibility\u201d that Zhang could seek cheaper access to \"education, health care, and other social benefits\u201d by registering her children as permanent Chinese residents. Because Zhang failed to offer any evidence that she intended to register her children or would be unable to provide for their well-being without doing so, we cannot say that the record compels reversal of the IJ\u2019s findings on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
