Currently before the court is Pendleton\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We grant Pendleton\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and summarily affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">Pendleton is civilly committed at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (USMCFP) in Springfield, Missouri. Pendleton sued Warden Linda Sanders of the USMCFP, asserting that Sanders had failed to pay Pendleton $465 million as a result of a non-existent Supreme Court ruling. The district court dismissed Pendleton\u2019s frivolous complaint preservice under the authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). Section 1915A allows a district court to dismiss \u201ca complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental .entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity\u201d when the prisoner asserts a frivolous claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Pendleton\u2019s complaint is frivolous; however, the district court erroneously invoked the authority of \u00a7 1915A as the vehicle for dismissal. For purposes of \u00a7 1915A, \u201cprisoner\u201d is defined as \u201cany person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(e). We have previously determined that a civilly committed plaintiff does not qualify as a \u201cprisoner\u201d under the PLRA. <em>Perkins v. Hedricks, </em>340 F.3d 582, 583 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (\u201cPerkins appears to be civilly committed and is thus not a prisoner within the meaning of the PLRA.\u201d); <em>Kolocotronis v. Morgan, </em>247 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">Nonetheless, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Pendleton\u2019s complaint preservice because any error in invoking the authority of \u00a7 1915A was harmless. <em>See Michau v. Charleston Cnty., S.C., </em>434 F.3d 725, 728 (4th Cir.2006) (affirming a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a civilly committed plaintiffs complaint under \u00a7 1915A because the district court also invoked the authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), rendering any error \u201charmless\u201d). Section 1915(e)(2)(B) al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>lows the district court to dismiss an in forma pauperis plaintiff\u2019s complaint at any time if the action is frivolous. Pendleton proceeded in forma pauperis before the district court, so the district court could have relied alternatively on \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) to dismiss Pendleton\u2019s complaint. Because the district court would certainly do so immediately upon remand, the district court\u2019s erroneous reliance on \u00a7 1915A is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
