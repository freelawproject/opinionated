We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the single issue presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">We review a tax court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Diebold Found., Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>736 F.3d 172, 182 (2d Cir.2013); <em>see also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-16\">Our independent review of the record and relevant case law confirms that the Tax Court did not clearly err by finding that Wright received his 1994 refund. The Commissioner presented prima facie evidence of Wright\u2019s receipt of the refund in the form of a Certificate of Assessments and Payments and a Certificate of Official Record confirming a $960 refund for the 1994 tax year. <em>See United States v. Josephberg, </em>562 F.3d 478, 488-89 (2d Cir.2009) (tax assessment certificates considered prima facie evidence of tax owed by defendant in tax evasion ease). Wright did not submit any documentary or testimonial evidence in opposition. Although he argued that the evidence did not prove that his refund was mailed to him or that he actually received it, the \u201cpresumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., </em>272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Archives &amp; Records Admin, v. Favish, </em>541 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>U.S. 157, 174, 124 S.Ct. 1570, 158 L.Ed.2d 319 (2004) (\u201c[W]here the presumption is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Although Wright argues that the issue of his 1994 refund had already been decided, his argument is based on prior Tax Court findings regarding <em>his 1993 refund, </em>which is a separate, settled issue no longer before our Court. Indeed, we remanded this matter to the Tax Court in 2012 for the limited purposing of resolving \u201cthis last issue,\u201d that is, the determination of \u201cwhether the 1994 refund ... was sent to him.\u201d <em>Wright v. Comm\u2019r, </em>471 Fed.Appx. 21, 23 (2d Cir.2012). While Wright asserts that the Tax Court ignored a \u201cfactual pattern\u201d of mistakes by the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax Court accurately explained why it found the reliability of the evidence supporting the receipt of his 1994 refund distinct from the circumstances surrounding his 1993 refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Wright\u2019s argument that the Tax Court improperly shifted the burden to him is without merit. The court explained to Wright that the Commissioner had submitted its evidence, and that Wright had the opportunity to submit whatever factual evidence he had. Ultimately, the court relied on the only evidence before it, rebutted only by Wright\u2019s arguments regarding the unreliability of the evidence. The record also reflects that the Tax Court specifically asked Wright if he wished to testify. Wright made clear that he did not want to testify, but only to \u201crespond\u201d to the Commissioner\u2019s evidence. The record does not reflect that Wright intended for his statements to be taken as testimony or as factual evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Finally, Wright\u2019s argument that the court improperly denied his motion for summary judgment is unavailing, as summary judgment is not appropriate when there remain disputes of material fact, as was the case here. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">We have considered Wright\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Tax Court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
