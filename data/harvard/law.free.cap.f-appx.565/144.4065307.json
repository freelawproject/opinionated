(\u201cAEI\u201d), and its corporate officer, Martin Morley (together, \u201cAppellants\u201d), appeal the denial by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of Morley\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, which AEI joined. We agree with the District Court that Appellants waived any right to compel arbitration, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On April 30, 2012, SuperMedia L.L.C. (\u201cSuperMedia\u201d), an advertising agency, filed one of the two lawsuits involved in this appeal, Civil Action No. 12-2329. It sought to recover damages from AEI for an alleged breach of contract, namely AEI\u2019s alleged failure to pay for advertising services that SuperMedia provided. The contract was executed by Morley, who SuperMedia says \u201cheld himself out ... as the \u2018owner\u2019 and/or \u2018President\u2019 of AEI\u201d with the \u201cauthority to bind AEI to contracts with SuperMedia.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 2 (quoting App. at 44a).) After the Court denied AEI\u2019s motion to dismiss, AEI answered the Complaint and alleged as a defense that Morley had no authority to bind it to the contract. Notably, AEI did not mention the contract\u2019s arbitration provision in its answer or cite it as an affirmative defense. <em>See </em>No. 12-2329, AEI Answer, ECF No. 18. The District Court then set March 1, 2013, as the deadline for submission of written discovery. No. 12-2329, Order, Jan. 7, 2013, ECF No. 21. After exchanging interrogatories, both parties filed motions to strike interrogatory objections and compel interrogatory answers. Each also filed their responses to those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Meanwhile, SuperMedia brought a second action, Civil Action No. 13-176, against Morley in the same court, this time for breach of warranty based on the representations he made in forming the advertising contract. The Court consolidated the two proceedings. After SuperMedia and AEI filed their discovery motions and responses, Morley filed a motion to dismiss, which included a motion to compel arbitration. He also argued that SuperMedia had failed to sufficiently allege fraud and negligent misrepresentation and that those claims were time-barred under Texas law. In a footnote in his motion, Morley stated that AEI joined him in seeking to compel arbitration of SuperMedia\u2019s claims. Morley also characterized the motion as \u201ca motion for judgment on the pleadings, which AEI requests.\u201d (App. at 68a n. 2.) AEI filed nothing to dispute Morley\u2019s claims about its legal positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The District Court subsequently disposed of SuperMedia\u2019s and AEI\u2019s various discovery requests and Morley\u2019s motion to dismiss and compel arbitration in a single order. Relevant here, it denied Morley\u2019s motion to dismiss. Although it did not address his arguments concerning the sufficiency of the pleadings, it ruled on the statute-of-limitations issue that he had raised. It also denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding that arbitration was barred because \u201cMorley and AEI have been vigorous litigants, participants in discovery by serving Interrogatories and Document Requests on SuperMedia as well as objecting broadly and voluminously to SuperMedia\u2019s discovery requests.\u201d (App. at 12a.) Morley and AEI have timely appealed that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">SuperMedia argues that Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>waived arbitration,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Appellants of course argue they did not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cConsistent with the strong preference for arbitration in federal courts, waiver is not to be lightly inferred, and waiver will normally be found only where the demand for arbitration came long after the suit commenced and when both parties had engaged in extensive discovery.\u201d <em>Nino v. Jewelry Exch., Inc., </em>609 F.3d 191, 208 (3d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. Faragalli, </em>61 F.3d 1063, 1068-69 (3d Cir.1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under that principle, the parties rely on our nonexclusive, list of factors, known as the <em>Hoxworth </em>factors, to determine whether prejudice, the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for evaluating an asserted waiver of the right to compel arbitration, exists. <em>Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson, &amp; Co., </em>980 F.2d 912, 926-27 (3d Cir.1992). Those factors are (1) the timeliness of the motion to compel arbitration; (2) \u201cthe degree to which the party seeking to compel arbitration has contested the merits of its opponent\u2019s claims\u201d; (3) whether the moving party provided sufficient notice to the nonmoving party of its \u201cintention to seek arbitration\u201d; (4) the extent of the moving party\u2019s \u201cnon-merits motion practice\u201d; (5) whether the moving party has assented to the court\u2019s pretrial orders; and (6) the degree of discovery engaged in by the parties. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We need not discuss all of the factors to explain that Appellants have waived any right to arbitration. Regarding AEI, it waited more than 11 months from the Complaint\u2019s filing to say anything about arbitration \u2014 around the same amount of time as the period at issue in <em>Hoxworth, </em>in which we found waiver to apply. <em>See id. </em>at 925-26. Furthermore, AEI had already tested the merits of SuperMedia\u2019s Complaint in its own motion to dismiss and had failed at that time to raise the issue of arbitration. Also, AEI never notified SuperMedia of its intent to request arbitration. Just as it failed to mention the issue in its motion to dismiss, it did not cite the arbitration provision or mention the matter at all in its answer to the Complaint. In fact, AEI\u2019s request is a change in its litigation position; it challenged the enforceability of the arbitration provision in a related state-court proceeding that included SuperMedia\u2019s pre-bankruptcy entity, Ideare Media L.L.C. (\u201cIdeare\u201d). The Bucks County Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>docket indicates that AEI\u2019s assertion may have played a role in the state court judge\u2019s determination denying Idearc\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Attempting to invoke the arbitration provision after arguing that it is without effect would certainly qualify as a surprise tactic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, as the District Court noted, AEI has been a \u201cvigorous litigant[ ]\u201d in the underlying proceeding, engaging in significant discovery activity prior to joining Morley\u2019s motion. (App. at 11a.) AEI points to nothing of significance to rebut those considerations weighing for waiver. Therefore, it has waived arbitration under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Morley\u2019s case is a closer call \u2014 unlike AEI, he filed his motion to compel arbitration just over two months after the filing of the Complaint. He also did not engage in significant discovery. But an application of the factors to his litigation activities also points to waiver, for three reasons. First, Morley, along with AEI, elected to engage in litigation on the merits by filing a third-party complaint against SuperMedia and two of its employees. Morley filed that complaint prior to filing his motion to compel arbitration and even replied to the third-party answer. Second, in his reply to the third-party answer, Morley expressly \u201cdenied there is a contract and/or that there is any binding agreement or term of the Third Party Plaintiff to arbitrate disputes.\u201d (Supp.App. at 193.) As with AEI\u2019s change of position, Morley\u2019s midstream about-face on the applicability of a contracted-for arbitration provision supports the conclusion that he provided no notice to SuperMedia that he intended to seek arbitration. Third, Morley complied with pretrial orders, including participation in the pretrial conference and acquiescence in the consolidation of the two cases, types of activities that are \u201cinconsistente ] with an intent to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Gray Holdco, Inc. v. Cassady, </em>654 F.3d 444, 460 (3d Cir.2011). The factors thus weigh in favor of applying waiver to Morley, and the District Court did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm that portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying the motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>jurisdiction pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) as the appeal is from a denial of a motion to compel arbitration. \"We ... exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s determination of whether [Appellants], through [their] litigation conduct, waived [their] right to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>Nino v. Jewelry Exch., Inc., </em>609 F.3d 191, 200 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellants also appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of Morley\u2019s motion to dismiss, which AEI joined. Because the portion of the order that disposed of their failure-to-state-a-claim and statute-of-limitations arguments is not ripe for interlocutory appeal \u2014 it has nothing to do with the issue of arbitration \u2014 we do not have pendent appellate jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Rhone Poulenc Fiber &amp; Resin Intermediates, </em>S.A.S., 269 F.3d 187, 204 (3d Cir.2001) (\"Where ... [the unappealable order] is not \u2018interrelated\u2019 or \u2018intertwined\u2019 with the merits of the immediately appealable order, Courts of Appeals exercise restraint and forego review until the unrelated issue is appealable in its own right.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">. SuperMedia also contends that Appellants are not entitled to invoke the arbitration provision because Morley was not a party to the contract and because the provision exempts collection claims from arbitration. Because we determine, as discussed below, that Appellants waived any alleged right to arbitration under the provision, we need not review the provision itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\">. Appellants also argue that the District Court and SuperMedia were estopped from, respectively, denying and opposing the motion to compel arbitration. We summarily reject those arguments as meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-5\">. Neither party included in the record the state court order denying Idearc\u2019s motion to compel arbitration; SuperMedia only provided the docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-20\">. Although likely relevant, we need not determine whether Appellants are judicially es-topped from arguing that they are entitled to arbitration under the provision because we affirm the District Court\u2019s order on the grounds upon which that Court relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
