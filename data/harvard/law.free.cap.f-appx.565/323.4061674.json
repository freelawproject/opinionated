He concedes that sentences imposed within the Guidelines are presumptively reasonable but argues that he has rebutted the presumption because the district court made a clear error of judgment in balancing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors and imposed a sentence that was greater than necessary to meet those factors. He contends that his sentence overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense because, in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court gave too much weight to old convictions. He argues further that the district court failed to give proper weight to his beneficent reason for re-entering the country unlawfully or to the likelihood that he will not recidivate. Vallejo also argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data, but he concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Vallejo acknowledges that this court reviews for plain error when a defendant fails to object to the reasonableness of the sentence but contends that it should review for an abuse of discretion. Because he did not object to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The district court considered Vallejo\u2019s request for a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and ultimately determined that a sentence in the middle of the range was appropriate under the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Vallejo\u2019s arguments that that \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and that his sentence overstates the seriousness of his criminal history and fails to take into account his personal history and characteristics are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Vallejo has failed to show that his 41-month within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable, and there is no reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
