We have reviewed the administrative record and find no abuse of discretion in the denial of relief on Zurita-Espinoza\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.28(b)(1) (2013). We therefore deny the petition for review in part for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Zurita-Espinoza, </em>(B.I.A. May 31, 2013). We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Zurita-Espinoza\u2019s claim that the Board erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s refusal to invoke the immigration court\u2019s sua sponte power to reopen his proceedings. See <em>Mosere v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 397, 400-01 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
