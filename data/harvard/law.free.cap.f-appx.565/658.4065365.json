R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Plaintiff-Appellant Gregory Brown brought this action against his former employer, Defendant-Appellee County of Riverside, alleging racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and California state law. Brown appeals from a jury verdict in the County\u2019s favor. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">In May 2006, Brown was terminated from his employment with the Riverside County Waste Management Department, a subdivision of the County of Riverside, after allowing his minor child to ride a motorcycle at a waste dump facility owned and operated by his employer. Brown brought racial discrimination and retaliatory discharge claims related to his employment and subsequent termination. Brown\u2019s lawyer voluntarily dismissed his retaliation claims before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Brown raises numerous claims on appeal, including (1) that the district judge was biased, (2) that the district court improperly allowed extensions, (3) that prospective jurors were challenged on account of their race in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and (4) that the district court improperly excluded certain testimony. Brown also brings what appear to be claims challenging the litigation strategy of his trial counsel. Finally, Brown claims that the evidence warrants reversal of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-18\">Brown provides little in the way of factual or legal support for his claims. Brown\u2019s allegation of bias on the part of the district judge is wholly unsupported by the record. He does not identify any particular extensions as improper, and it does not appear from the record that the court granted an inordinate number of extensions or continuances.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">Brown\u2019s trial counsel failed to raise any objection to defense counsel\u2019s peremptory challenges, and the record on appeal does not indicate which jurors were stricken as a result of defense counsel\u2019s challenges. We therefore cannot say that the district court plainly erred in allowing these challenges. <em>See United States v. Contreras-Contreras, </em>83 F.3d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir.1996) (applying plain error analysis to a <em>Batson </em>claim where no objection was raised at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of an unrelated incident involving Brown\u2019s former supervisor and two County of Riverside employees. Nor did it abuse its discretion in excluding testimony relating to an alleged incident of misconduct by County personnel that occurred after Brown\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Brown\u2019s remaining claims are similarly unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Brown appears to be dissatisfied with his trial counsel\u2019s decision to voluntarily dismiss his retaliation claims. Because those claims were not presented to the trial court, we cannot review them here. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 986 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Finally, the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence. \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence.\u201d <em>Landes Constr. Co. v. Royal Bank of Can., </em>833 F.2d 1365, 1371 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">County of Riverside asserts that Brown\u2019s appeal was frivolous, and seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction. Although we have discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction against frivolous appeals, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38, \u201cwe are reluctant to impose penalties against any litigant, particularly one appearing pro se.\u201d <em>Wood v. McEwen, </em>644 F.2d 797, 802 (9th Cir.1981) (per curiam). We decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
