Woods filed a motion to suppress evidence found during a search of his residence. The district court denied the motion. On appeal, Woods challenges only the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Woods argues that the district court erred in finding that it was reasonable for officers to conduct a protective sweep of his residence. Woods argues that, when the officers conducted the protective sweep, he was handcuffed and secured in a police vehicle. He contends that the sweep was conducted after any objective threat to the officers\u2019 safety had been removed, and the sweep was in fact a post hoc rationalization to validate the seizures after execution of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the motion to suppress for clear error, and the court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Burgess, </em>684 F.3d 445, 452 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 490, 184 L.Ed.2d 308 (2012); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>666 F.3d 877, 882 (4th Cir.2011). When, as here, a motion to suppress has been denied, we view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>676 F.3d 385, 391 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">We have reviewed the joint appendix, including the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to suppress, and the parties\u2019 briefs. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of conducting a protective sweep, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court on that basis. <em>United States v. Woods, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00157-1 (S.D.W.Va. Apr. 8, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
