We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We review dismissals under Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to timely serve process for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gerena v. Korb, </em>617 F.3d 197, 201 (2d Cir.2010). A district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or clearly erroneous findings of fact, or if its decision \u201ccannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Lynch v. City of N.Y., </em>589 F.3d 94, 99 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Pursuant to Rule 4(m):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">If a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court \u2014 on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff \u2014 must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A district court also has discretion to enlarge the 120-day period for service, even in the absence of good cause. <em>See Zapata v. City of N.Y., </em>502 F.3d 192, 196 (2d Cir.2007). Ordinarily, we will not overrule a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of service unless the appellant \u201cadvance[s] some colorable excuse for neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Frankenberger\u2019s complaint, based on its conclusion that he had not been diligent in his efforts to effect service in a timely manner. We affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned order.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">We have considered Frankenberger\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
