Lytle challenges the district court\u2019s sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">On July 14, 2005, officers from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department (MNPD) were patrolling a local public housing facility. (PSR at 4.) The patrolling officers approached several individuals standing outside the housing complex and the individuals ran from them. <em>(Id.) </em>Officers observed one individual, later identified as Lytle, enter a vacant apartment and pursued him. <em>(Id.) </em>MNPD Officer Daniel Alford, dressed in uniform, entered the apartment and announced his presence in a loud voice. (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 749; PSR at 4.) Before proceeding upstairs, he again announced: \u201cMetro Police Department, if you are in here, come on down.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at Pg. ID 750.) As Officer Alford entered an upstairs bedroom, Lytle, who was hiding in a closet, shot him in the chest, left arm, and stomach. <em>(Id. </em>at Pg. ID 752-53; PSR at 4.) Officer Alford returned fire and struck Lytle in his right arm. (PSR at 4.) Officer Alford continues to have a bullet lodged in his buttocks, and he has lost feeling in a portion of his stomach. (PSR at 5.) At the time of the arrest, officers found a partially loaded .40 caliber pistol on the floor near Lytle. <em>(Id.) </em>Officers also seized $1,400.00 in cash, 59 grams of marijuana, 8.7 grams of cocaine, and 0.3 grams of cocaine base. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">After he received hospital treatment, Lytle was released into state custody. <em>(Id.) </em>Lytle admitted that he had previously been convicted of a felony and confirmed that after he saw the police at the public housing facility, he ran into an abandoned building and fired the pistol at the officer. <em>(Id.) </em>Lytle added that he wanted the police to kill him, that he wanted to die, and that he was tired of life. <em>(Id.) </em>He also acknowledged that he possessed $1,400.00 in cash, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>marijuana, and cocaine, but denied possessing any cocaine base. <em>(Id.) </em>On August 17, 2005, the Tennessee Department of Corrections (\u201cTDOC\u201d) transferred Lytle to federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum. </em>(Dkt. # 171, Pg. ID 647; PSR at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On August 31, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Lytle for: 1) being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924; 2) possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); and 3) using, carrying, and discharging a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). (Dkt. # 13, Pg. ID 18-19.) On July 21, 2006, the district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion for a competency hearing, (Dkt. # 52, Pg. ID 218), and subsequently, on August 3, 2006, committed him to the custody of the Attorney General for psychiatric and psychological evaluation (Dkt. # 56, Pg. ID 224-25). Approximately six years later, after two evaluations and two competency hearings, the district court declared Lytle competent to stand trial. (Dkt. # 119, Pg. ID 350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">On March 14, 2013, Lytle pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Dkt. # 164, Pg. ID 549-53.) At the May 29, 2013, sentencing hearing, the district court rejected Lytle\u2019s objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and adopted the PSR\u2019s findings in full. (Dkt. # 186, Pg. ID 701.) The PSR first calculated Lytle\u2019s guidelines under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)-(b), which, after applying the appropriate enhancements, yielded an adjusted offense level of thirty-two. (PSR at 7.) However, as the PSR found, the cross-reference located in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A) applied because Lytle used and possessed the firearm in conneetion with another offense, \u201cat a minimum, attempted second-degree murder.\u201d (PSR at 6.) Pursuant to the cross-reference, the PSR then calculated Lytle\u2019s guidelines under \u00a7 2X1.1, which, after applying the appropriate enhancements, yielded an adjusted offense level of thirty-five. (PSR at 8.) Because the cross-reference resulted in a greater adjusted offense level, thirty-five, compared to thirty-two, guideline \u00a7 2X1.1 was the appropriate starting point. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(c) (\u201cIf the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, apply ... \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\u201d). The PSR also recommended that, pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(a)-(b), Lytle should receive a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility. (PSR at 9.) Together, this produced a total offense level of thirty-two. <em>(Id.) </em>Finally, the PSR calculated Lytle\u2019s criminal history as category IV. (PSR at 12.) As a result, the advisory sentencing range for Lytle was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. (PSR at 15.) However, because the statutory maximum for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2), the advisory sentencing range became 120 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(a). <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The district court sentenced Lytle to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to any state sentence, and three years\u2019 supervised release. (Dkt. # 185, Pg. ID 694, 696.) At the time of sentencing, as a result of the same conduct that gave rise to this case, Lytle also faced state charges for attempted first-degree murder, possession of cocaine for resale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and resisting arrest. (PSR at 12.) Further, at the time of the instant offense, Lytle was on probation for a 2003 state-court conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver. (PSR at 11.) Following his July 14, 2005, arrest for the instant federal offense, on September 2, 2005, the state court revoked Lytle\u2019s probation and increased his sentence from eight years to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment. (PSR at 1, 11.) Lytle\u2019s state sentence expired on January 17, 2014. (PSR at 11.) Therefore, from August 17, 2005, when the TDOC transferred Lytle to federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum, </em>until his May 29, 2013, sentencing, Lytle was in federal custody earning credit against his state sentence. (Dkt. # 171, Pg. ID 647; PSR at 1.) The judgment in the instant case states, \u201cthe Court recommends that the Defendant receive credit for any time served in federal custody.\u201d (Dkt. # 185, Pg. ID 695.) Lytle filed a timely notice of appeal, and now challenges his sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Seymour, </em>739 F.3d 923, 929 (6th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">A. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Lytle argues that the district court improperly calculated his guidelines range because it relied upon clearly erroneous facts and failed to address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\n<em>1. Calculation of the Guidelines Range</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">A procedural reasonableness review includes determining whether the district court properly calculated a defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>Seymour, </em>739 F.3d at 929 (citation omitted). When calculating a sentence, judicial fact-finding is permitted so long as the facts are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Stafford, </em>721 F.3d 380, 402 (6th Cir.2013). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines when that application involves mixed questions of law and fact ... [and w]e review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact in connection with the sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). A factual finding is clearly erroneous when, after reviewing the entire record, we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Moon, </em>513 F.3d 527, 540 (6th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Lytle argues that the district court improperly applied a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) and a six-level enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">\n<em>a. Section 2K2.1(b) (6) (B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Assuming that Lytle is correct and the district court improperly applied a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), his guidelines range would have remained the same. The PSR first calculated Lytle\u2019s guidelines under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)-(b), and found that pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), Lytle\u2019s base offense level was twenty because he had already sustained a felony conviction for a controlled substance offense. (PSR at 6.) Next, the PSR applied a two-level increase because the firearm was stolen under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), a four-level increase because Lytle used the firearm in connection with another felony offense, \u201cat a minimum ... attempted sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ond-degree murder,\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), and a six-level increase because Lytle assaulted a person during the course of the offense, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the person was a law enforcement officer under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1). (PSR at 7.) Together, this yielded an adjusted offense level of thirty-two. However, the PSR noted the cross reference located in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, or possessed or transferred a firearm or ammunition with knowledge or intent that it would be used or possessed in connection with another offense, apply ... \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Because Lytle used and possessed the firearm in connection with another offense, \u201cat a minimum, attempted second-degree murder,\u201d the PSR calculated his adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2X1.1 and found that it was thirty-five. (PSR at 8.) Accordingly, the PSR determined that \u00a7 2X1.1, not \u00a7 2K2.1(a)-(b), was the proper starting point. (PSR at 9.) If, as Lytle contends, the PSR, and the district court in adopting the PSR, improperly applied \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(B), the adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)-(b) would have been twenty-eight, as opposed to thirty-two. Therefore, \u00a7 2X1.1 would still have generated a greater adjusted offense level than \u00a7 2K2.1(a)-(b), and would have remained the appropriate guideline. Accordingly, even if Lytle is correct and the district court improperly applied a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), his advisory sentencing range would still have been 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>b. Section 3Al.2(c)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1) \u2014 known as the official-victim enhancement \u2014 the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendation and applied a six-level increase for assaulting a police officer in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. The official-victim enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2 applies \u201c[i]f, in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, the defendant ... knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement officer, assault[s] such officer during the course of the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1). Lytle argues that he did not <em>intend </em>to shoot the officer but instead intended suicide \u2014 he claims he wanted Officer Alford to kill him, an act sometimes referred to as \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">As Lytle argues in his brief, the official-victim enhancement requires only that the defendant acted recklessly, not intentionally. <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>664 F.3d 1047, 1051 (6th Cir.2012). In <em>Coleman, </em>we explained, \u201c \u00a7 3A1.2(c) requires only that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2018creat[e] a substantial risk of serious bodily injury\u2019 to people that he knew or should have known were law enforcement officers. This phrasing evokes the common law definition of recklessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (citation omitted). Upon entering the apartment where Lytle was hiding, Officer Alford, dressed in uniform, announced his presence in a loud voice. (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 749; PSR at 4.) Before proceeding upstairs, he again announced: \u201cMetro Police Department, if you are in here, come on down.\u201d (Dkt.# 190, Pg. ID 750.) As he entered the bedroom where Lytle was hiding in a closet, Lytle shot Officer Alford at least three times, hitting him in the chest, stomach, and left arm. (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 752-54; Dkt. #170-1, Pg. ID 576; PSR at 4.) The district court found \u201cthat while [Lytle] may have made statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>about wanting to die ... I don\u2019t think it carries by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Dkt. #190, Pg. ID 740.) The district court also observed that, \u201c[t]he officer was shot in the areas of the body that are suggestive of an intentional shooting.\u201d (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 811.) Regardless of whether Lytle intended to shoot Officer Alford, and regardless of whether he actually hoped his shooting would provoke Officer Alford to return fire and end his life, it is indisputable that shooting a person multiple times creates a \u201ca substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\u201d Similarly, given that Officer Alford was dressed in uniform and announced his presence twice, Lytle had \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that he was shooting a law enforcement officer. Finally, we have approved a district court\u2019s rejection of just such a defendant\u2019s mitigating theory in a very similar situation. <em>See United States v. Ingle, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 598, 596 (6th Cir.2012) (referring to these circumstances as \u201can act commonly referred to as \u2018suicide by cop\u2019 \u201d and affirming trial court\u2019s determination that evidence of assaultive motive outweighed that of suicidal motivation). Here, the district court did not err when it found that Lytle acted with the requisite intent to support application of the official-victim enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We conclude that even if Lytle is correct and the district court improperly applied a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), his advisory sentencing range would still have been 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and the district court properly calculated Lytle\u2019s guidelines in applying a six-level enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>2. Consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable where the district court fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Although a district court \u201cneed not engage in a \u2018ritualistic incantation\u2019 of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, its reasoning must be \u2018sufficiently detailed to reflect the considerations listed in \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019 and to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Mayberry, </em>540 F.3d 506, 518 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Moon, </em>513 F.3d at 539). A district court is required to consider a defendant\u2019s non-frivolous argument that seeks a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>597 F.3d 794, 803 (6th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Lytle contends that the district court intended for him to receive federal credit for the time he served in federal custody, but did not address the statutory hurdle contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). Under the statute, Lytle would only receive federal credit for the time he served in federal custody if he was not already receiving credit for the federal time against another sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). And, in not addressing \u00a7 3585(b), Lytle argues that the district court failed to address his argument for a time-served sentence. Lytle\u2019s arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Review of the district court record reveals that the district court recommended to the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) that Lytle receive federal credit for the time he served in federal custody. Shortly after MNPD arrested Lytle, on August 17, 2005, the TDOC transferred him to federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum. </em>(Dkt. # 171, Pg. ID 647; PSR at 1.) Lytle remained in federal custody until his May 29, 2013, sentencing hearing \u2014 a span of approximately 92 months. While in federal custody, he received credit against his state-court conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver, which was set to expire on January 17, 2014. (PSR at 1, 11.) Although the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>cite \u00a7 3585(b) at sentencing, the district court acknowledged Lytle\u2019s argument that he should receive federal credit for the time he spent in federal custody, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">[T]he Court will recommend that you be given sentence credits for the time you were in actual federal custody. The Court record reflects that you were in custody, on August 17, 2005, and you were \u2014 but you were here \u2014 and there was a writ from the [TDOC]. But I\u2019m uncertain as to all of the calculations, but in any event, that\u2019s a decision that the [BOP] will have to make the ultimate decision on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">The court will recommend that you get credit for any time in which you were in federal custody under a federal order or a federal writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>(Id.) </em>The judgment also reflects the district court\u2019s recommendation, stating, \u201cthe Court recommends that the Defendant receive credit for any time served in federal custody.\u201d (Dkt. # 185, Pg. ID 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The district court\u2019s recommendation to the BOP is consistent with \u00a7 3585(b), which permits credit against a federal sentence only for time \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). However, only the BOP and the Attorney General, and not the district court, are authorized to grant credit for time served under \u00a7 3585(b). <em>United States v. Crozier, </em>259 F.3d 503, 520 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992)). Moreover, at the time of sentencing in the instant federal case, Lytle\u2019s state-court sentence had yet to expire and he was therefore continuing to receive credit against his state sentence. Time which has been credited towards service of a state sentence may not be \u201cdouble counted\u201d against a federal sentence. <em>See Nguyen v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>173 F.3d 429 (6th Cir.1999) (unpublished table decision) (holding that time spent in federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum, </em>while serving a state sentence, cannot be applied to a federal sentence because the time has been credited to the state sentence); <em>see also Broadwater v. Sanders, </em>59 Fed.Appx. 112, 113-14 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201cBecause Broadwater received credit toward his state sentence for the time period in question, he may not receive credit for this time toward his current federal sentence.\u201d). The district court correctly left the determination of whether Lytle was entitled to federal sentencing credits to the BOP.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Recognizing that, in light of \u00a7 3585(b), the district court lacked power to give Lytle federal credit for the time he served in federal custody, Lytle proposed a time-served sentence to the district court. Because Lytle was receiving credit against his state sentence for his time in federal custody, granting his request for a time-served sentence would have allowed him to avoid any imprisonment for his federal conviction. The district court implicitly rejected Lytle\u2019s argument for a time-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>served sentence in its explanation of dual sovereignty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">Now, the federal interest in this matter is that felons who possess firearms represent a danger to the community and pose the prospect for danger to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">The Court believes that the federal government has a distinct interest that\u2019s separate and apart from the state government, that has an interest in the drug convictions, violation of its probation laws, and also the state\u2019s interest in the attempted first [-] degree murder[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] charge of the officer. Those are interests that the state has. We are dual sovereigns. We have separate interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9j\">(Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 811.) Upon imposing Lytle\u2019s sentence, the district court reiterated that \u201cbecause there are separate policy concerns for the different sovereigns,\u201d Lytle\u2019s federal sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment would be \u201cconsecutive to any state sentence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at Pg. ID 813.) In imposing a consecutive sentence, the district court rejected Lytle\u2019s argument for a time-served sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Although the district court did not specifically cite \u00a7 3585(b), it is clear from the record that it considered Lytle\u2019s arguments and rejected them. The district court\u2019s \u201cexpress sentencing rationale was logically responsive\u201d to Lytle\u2019s arguments. <em>United States v. Chiolo, </em>643 F.3d 177, 184 (6th Cir.2011). Further, that rationale reflected the district court\u2019s consideration and rejection of those arguments, \u201cmaking it unnecessary for the [district] court to expressly confirm this with magic words like T have considered [Lytle\u2019s] arguments and I reject them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the district court properly considered and rejected Lytle\u2019s arguments that he receive federal credit for the time he spent in federal custody and for a time-served sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that Lytle\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">B. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Having determined that Lytle\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable, we will next consider its substantive reasonableness. \u201cThe essence of a substantive-reasonableness claim is whether the length of the sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Tristan-Madrigal, </em>601 F.3d 629, 632-33 (6th Cir.2010)., In our review, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A sentence may be substantively unreasonable \u201cif the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Camiscione, </em>591 F.3d 823, 832 (6th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Sentences that fall within the properly calculated guidelines range are presumptively considered reasonable. <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 389-90 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc). This presumption applies to a statutory maximum sentence that falls below the advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>393 Fed.Appx. 327, 333 (6th Cir.2010). Lytle argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a consecutive sentence, failed to consider Lytle\u2019s personal history, and placed undue weight on a letter Lytle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>wrote. Lytle also argues, generally, that the circumstances of his offense did not warrant the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\n<em>1. Imposition of a Consecutive Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">At the outset we note that, \u201c[a] challenge to a district court\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence is not easily classified as \u2018substantive\u2019 or \u2018procedural\u2019 because an evaluation of the substantive reasonableness of a decision to impose a consecutive sentence depends heavily upon an evaluation of the procedural reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Albers, </em>489 Fed.Appx. 78, 77 (6th Cir.2012) (citing <em>United States v. Berry, </em>565 F.3d 332, 342 (6th Cir.2009)). As we concluded in the preceding section, the district court adequately explained its reasoning for imposing a sentence \u201cconsecutive to any state sentence.\u201d (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 813.) As for substantive reasonableness, Lytle argues that \u201cany state sentence\u201d refers to any future sentence the state court might impose in the state prosecution \u201cfor attempted murder and a drug offense\u201d arising out of the same conduct that gave rise to this action. (Appellant Br. at 32.) This is not an accurate depiction of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A district court may not impose a federal sentence consecutive to a potential state sentence, <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>433 Fed.Appx. 364, 365-66 (6th Cir.2011), but it may take note of and consider other pending charges against a defendant. <em>United States v. Alford, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 275, 284-85 (6th Cir.2009) (finding that the district court \u201cdid not err in considering the pending charges while selecting a sentence within the advisory guideline[s] range.\u201d). At the time of sentencing, Lytle was serving a state sentence for his conviction of possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver. (PSR at 11.) However, the district court noted the state government\u2019s interest in \u201cdrug convictions, violation of its probation laws, and ... in the attempted first[-]degree murder charge of the officer.\u201d (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 811.) At the time of sentencing, the only state sentence that Lytle was serving was for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver, and hence, it is the only state sentence the district court could have been referring to when it imposed a sentence \u201cconsecutive to any state sentence.\u201d We do not accept Lytle\u2019s reading of the record that by saying \u201cany state sentence\u201d the district court meant any potential state sentence imposed in the future. It is clear from the record that the district court imposed a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, consecutive to Lytle\u2019s state sentence for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\n<em>2. Lytle\u2019s Personal History and Letter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Lytle contends that the district court did not sufficiently consider Lytle\u2019s personal history and that it placed undue weight on a letter in which Lytle \u201cstated words to the effect of, I shot the pig, but he didn\u2019t die.\u201d (Dkt. # 190, Pg. ID 798.) The record demonstrates otherwise. At sentencing the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">Well, the court has considered all of the factors under [\u00a7] 3553(a). The court has also considered all of the proof submitted, both through witnesses and through documents. I think this is a case in which it\u2019s \u2014 on the issue of sentencing, in which it\u2019s first important to remember the circumstances of the offense. Although there are references to the defendant\u2019s personal childhood history and his experience with depression, the facts of this case reveal that at the time of the offense, he was armed, he was dealing in drugs, multiple types of drugs.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The court is not unmindful of his efforts at rehabilitation. But it is disturbing that he would refer to the officer, after all this legal history, refer to the officer as a pig. The court finds that disturbing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><em>(Id. </em>at Pg. ID 810-12; see also Dkt. # 186, Pg. ID 703.) Our review of the sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the district court acknowledged Lytle\u2019s difficult past including his traumatic childhood and struggles with depression but also noted the severity of Lytle\u2019s conduct as well as his reference to the officer he shot as a \u201cpig.\u201d We conclude that the district court neither failed to take into account Lytle\u2019s personal history, nor placed undue weight on Lytle\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>3. Circumstances of the Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">Lytle argues that the circumstances of his offense did not warrant the sentence imposed. \u201cA ten-year sentence,\u201d he argues, \u201cis simply unreasonably long given the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d (Appellant Br. at 36.) In support, he briefly discusses <em>United States v. Sanford, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 614 (6th Cir.2006) and <em>Ingle, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 593 \u2014 two unpublished cases with roughly similar facts, in each of which we affirmed sentences of less than 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Lytle\u2019s argument, though, is unavailing. First, as the Government argues in its brief, the cited cases are factually distinguishable. Although in both <em>Sanford </em>and <em>Ingle </em>the defendant fired a gun in the direction of a police officer, the officers were not injured. In the present case, Officer Alford continues to have a bullet lodged in his buttocks, and he has lost feeling in a portion of his stomach. (PSR at 5.) Second, without reasoned explanation, these cases provide no more than anecdotal examples, and there is an ample supply of anecdotal counter-examples. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, </em>257 Fed.Appx. 981 (6th Cir.2007) (affirming sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment after defendant pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm where district court found that the firearm was \u201crecently stolen\u201d); <em>United States v. Olson, </em>646 F.3d 569 (8th Cir.2011) (affirming sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment after defendant pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm where his conduct during arrest \u201camounted to an assault on the arresting officers\u201d); <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>321 Fed.Appx. 762, 763 (10th Cir.2009) (affirming a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment after a jury convicted defendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm where he pointed a gun at the officer pursuing him). Just as with <em>Sanford </em>and <em>Ingle, </em>these cases rest on their own sets of facts; the sentence in each was justifiably determined to be within the range of reasonableness available to the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Most importantly, in reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness our role is not to substitute our discretion for that of the district court. <em>United States v. Oglesby, </em>210 Fed.Appx. 503, 510 (6th Cir.2007). Even \u201c[t]he fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Lytle points to no facts that explain, objectively, how his sentence is longer than necessary to effectuate the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Oglesby, </em>210 Fed.Appx. at 510 (citing <em>United States v. Yopp, </em>453 F.3d 770, 774 (6th Cir.2006)). He has therefore failed to persuade us that it is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Indeed, it seems to us that a ten-year sentence for possessing a firearm with which a person intentionally shoots and injures a responding police officer, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>circumstances such as these, is in no wise unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">. Although there was no plea agreement, the Government agreed to dismiss counts two and three after sentencing. (PSR at 15.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">. Lytle\u2019s argument in his reply that the 92 months he served in federal custody for his state sentence prevented him from receiving time reduction credits available under Tennessee law and from being paroled from his Tennessee sentence earlier does not impact our analysis. Lytle has no \"constitutional or inherent right\u201d to parole. <em>See Broadwater, </em>59 Fed.Appx. at 114 (quoting <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979)). Further, Lytle\u2019s argument is speculative because \"eligibility to earn sentence credits does not equate with entitlement to sentence credits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And we have previously held that Tennessee state law does not create a liberty interest in parole. <em>Wright v. Trammell, </em>810 F.2d 589, 590-91 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">. The district court classified the potential attempted murder charge as first-degree whereas the PSR classified the potential attempted murder charge as \"at a minimum, second-degree,\u201d <em>(see, </em>e.g. PSR at 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
