Zinni and Marco S. D\u2019Alonzo appeal pro se the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>order dismissing for failure to state a claim their action against Defendants Jackson White, PC, et al., and denying them leave to amend their complaint; the order denying their motion to set aside the trustee\u2019s sale; and the order denying their motion for recusal. The district court had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) claim, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d), and over their claims arising under Arizona law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">1. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. Plaintiffs offer no theory of district court error, nor do they argue that they met the standard to amend. Therefore, the issue is waived on appeal. <em>Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.2003). Even were it not, we would affirm. Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants had aided and abetted the tortious conduct of M &amp; I Bank. But all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against M &amp; I Bank were dismissed at summary judgment in a prior related case, <em>Zinni v. M &amp; I Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank, </em>No. CV-09-2035-PHX-FJM, 2011 WL 1792552 (D.Ariz. May 11, 2011) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cZinni I\u201d),</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and so there was no principal tortfeasor as required by Arizona law, <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Ariz. Laborers, Teamsters &amp; Cement Masons Local No. 395 Pension Trust Fund, </em>201 Ariz. 474, 38 P.3d 12, 23 (2002). The proposed amendment was futile on the merits, so the district court properly denied Plaintiffs leave to amend. <em>Saul v. United States, </em>928 F.2d 829, 843 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">2. The district court did not err in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, construing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., </em>691 F.3d 1152, 1159 (9th Cir.2012). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must state a cognizable legal theory and \u201cplead[ ] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Plaintiffs allege seven counts against Defendants. The district court properly dismissed Count 1 (violations of the FDCPA). Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that Defendants fall within the statutory definition of \u201cdebt collectors\u201d because they \u201cregularly collect! ] or attempt! ] to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). But the \u201ccomplaint makes no factual allegations from which we could plausibly infer that [Defendants] regularly collect! ] debts owed to someone other than [Defendants].\u201d <em>Schlegel v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, </em>720 F.3d 1204, 1209 (9th Cir.2013). As substituted trustees, Defendants were not collecting the debt \u201cowed ... [to] another,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the complaint alleges no facts from which to infer that Defendants \u201cregularly\u201d engage in the business of debt collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The district court properly dismissed Count 2 (violations of Arizona\u2019s deed of trust statutes). To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of events flowing from the 2009 default and notice of sale, they are barred by claim preclusion because they arise from the same claim\u2014 M &amp; I Bank\u2019s attempt to foreclose on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 loan \u2014 that was finally adjudicated on the merits by the district court in <em>Zinni I, Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979), and because the claims \u201cwere or could have been raised in that action,\u201d <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). For the purposes of that action, Defendants, as M &amp; I Bank\u2019s counsel and successor trustee, are in privity with M &amp; I Bank, which was party to <em>Zinni I. See, e.g., United States v. Schimmels (In re Schimmels), </em>127 F.3d 875, 881 (9th Cir.1997) (collecting cases and noting that courts have found privity \u201cwhere the nonparty had a significant interest and participated in the prior action\u201d or \u201cwhere the interests of the nonparty and party are so closely aligned as to be virtually representative\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The only claim on Count 2 not barred by claim preclusion is that the 2011 notice of sale failed to comply with Arizona\u2019s deed of trust statutes. But all of the specific failures alleged are violations of Arizona\u2019s <em>mortgage </em>foreclosure and forfeiture statutes, Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 33-721 to 33-750, which apply only to \u201c[m]ortgages ... and deeds of trust of a type not included in the definition of deed of trust provided in \u00a7 33-801,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 33-721. Defendants allege no facts from which to infer that their deed of trust is covered by the mortgage statutes, rather than by the deed of trust statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The district court properly dismissed Count 3 (tortious interference) because, under Arizona law, a lawyer acting as an agent of his client cannot tortiously interfere with the client\u2019s contract with a third party. <em>Pasco Indus., Inc. v. Talco Recycling, Inc., </em>195 Ariz. 50, 985 P.2d 535, 547 (Ct.App.1998); <em>see also Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Zavala, </em>302 F.Supp.2d 1108, 1121 (D.Ariz.2003) (collecting cases). The only portion of Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct that plausibly could be read to stand outside the agency relationship is an allegedly improper assumption of a power of attorney. But that claim fails as well, because it is predicated on a witness requirement that does not apply where, as here, the principal is not a natural person. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14-5501(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The district court properly dismissed Counts 4 (abuse of process), 5 (intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress), and 6 (libel). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on these counts turn on the argument that they were not in default. But the district court in <em>Zinni I </em>already considered that issue, rendering a final judgment on the merits against Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are therefore precluded from raising the same issue for a second time here. <em>Wolfson v. Brammer, </em>616 F.3d 1045, 1064 (9th Cir.2010). Because Plaintiffs were in default, the bank\u2019s counterclaim to foreclose was not an improper use of the judicial system, and there was no abuse of process. <em>Joseph v. Markovitz, </em>27 Ariz.App. 122, 551 P.2d 571, 574 (1976). Similarly, on the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Defendants\u2019 alleged actions are normal steps to foreclose that do not constitute \u201c \u2018extreme and outrageous\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Watts v. Golden Age Nursing Home, </em>127 Ariz. 255, 619 P.2d 1032, 1035 (1980), in light of Plaintiffs\u2019 default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And any statements that Plaintiffs were in default were true, barring a libel claim. <em>Godbehere v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., </em>162 Ariz. 335, 783 P.2d 781, 787-88 &amp; n. 3 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>On appeal, Plaintiffs do not argue that the district court erred by dismissing Count 7 (violations of Arizona\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act), and so any such argument is waived. <em>Indep. Towers, </em>350 F.3d at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">3. Plaintiffs offer no theory of district court error on the order denying their motion to set aside the trustee\u2019s sale, and so the issue is waived on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Plaintiffs\u2019 recusal motion. <em>Jorgensen v. Cassiday, </em>320 F.3d 906, 911 (9th Cir.2003). A prior adverse ruling is not sufficient cause for recusal, <em>United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 939 (9th Cir.1986), and nothing in the record suggests that the district court displayed favoritism or antagonism toward any of the parties, <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">5. Because we do not remand this case for further district court proceedings, we need not rule on Plaintiffs\u2019 request for disqualification of the district court judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
