The district court sentenced Guess to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment for the wire fraud conviction and a concurrent thirty-six months for the false tax return convictions. Prior to sentencing, the Government objected to Guess\u2019 presentence investigation report, asserting that the report incorrectly grouped the wire fraud conviction with the false tax return convictions and that the multiple count adjustment pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 3D1.4 therefore applied. On appeal, Guess argues that the Government\u2019s non-grouping objection constituted a breach of the plea agreement. The Government responds that no such breach occurred and that Guess\u2019 appeal should be dismissed based on the waiver of appellate rights included in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">\u201c[A] party\u2019s waiver of the right to seek appellate review is not enforceable where the opposing party breaches a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>257 F.3d 336 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, we must address Guess\u2019 allegation of breach, the sole issue he raises on appeal, and decline the Government\u2019s invitation to enforce the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">A party alleging that the Government breached the plea agreement bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a breach occurred. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000). Because Guess did not properly preserve this claim in the district court, our review is for plain error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-36, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(2009) (holding plain error rule applies to claim of breach of plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">To establish plain error on appeal Guess must establish that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (8) the error affected his substantial rights. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013). Even if Guess establishes each of these prerequisites, we exercise our discretion to correct the error only if we are convinced that the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1126-27 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the Government did not plainly breach the plea agreement. The language Guess relies on in his claim of breach does not clearly support his interpretation. In any case, the district court, in imposing sentence, suggested that it would have reached the same result regardless of the applicable Guidelines range; therefore, Guess is unable to establish an adverse impact on his substantial rights. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-19\"> We reject Guess' contention that he properly preserved this issue for appeal in light of counsel\u2019s failure to raise a claim of breach in the district court, <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>659 F.3d 339, 348 (4th Cir.2011) (\"[T]he defendant is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\u201d), and because Guess' own assertions of a breach were made only in the context of his request for a continuance of the sentencing hearing to retain substitute counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
