The district court sentenced him principally to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Poupart challenges his conviction on the grounds that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>A. <em>The Sixth Amendment Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Poupart first argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court allowed him to file a pro <em>se </em>motion to withdraw his guilty plea without first conducting a proceeding pursuant to <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">1. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to allow a defendant to waive his federal constitutional rights <em>de novo. See United States v. Carmenate, </em>544 F.3d 105, 107 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cWhile the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to competent court-appointed counsel in criminal cases,\u201d <em>United States v. Culbertson, </em>670 F.3d 183, 192 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted), defense \u201c[c]ounsel certainly is not required to engage in the filing of futile or frivolous motions,\u201d <em>United States v. Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d 1294, 1322 (2d Cir.1987). In cases where \u201cthe court has already replaced counsel more than once ... it is reasonable for the court to require an intractable defendant either to proceed with the current appointed lawyer, or to proceed pro <em>se.\u201d Culbertson, </em>670 F.3d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">When a defendant elects to represent himself, a defendant \u201cmust be given a full and fair opportunity to consider his options before waiving his Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] in a knowing and voluntary manner.\u201d <em>Culbertson, </em>670 F.3d at 193; <em>see also Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (\u201c[T]o represent himself, the accused must knowingly and intelligently forgo\u201d the benefits associated with the right to counsel, (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">2. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The district court was not required to conduct an inquiry pursuant to <em>Faretta </em>because Poupart was never without representation. After defense counsel informed the district court'that she would be ethically prohibited from complying with Poupart\u2019s requests, the district court allowed Poupart leave to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pro <em>se. </em>Poupart\u2019s attorney continued to represent him for all other purposes, however, and the district court even appointed an additional lawyer to act as stand-by counsel on the pro <em>se </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Indeed, Poupart has not cited any case law for the proposition that when a defendant has representation but files a motion pro <em>se </em>a trial court must conduct a proceeding under <em>Faretta. </em>Rather, we note that it is a common and simple solution for a district court to accept pro <em>se </em>motions from a defendant with representation when his counsel cannot file such motions in good faith. Accordingly, we find no violation of Poupart\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">B. <em>The Reasonableness Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Poupart\u2019s challenge to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">1. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Cavern, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189-90 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">A district court procedurally errs when it does not consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 190. Unless the record suggests otherwise, however, \u201cwe presume ... that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">A sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable only if it \u201ccannot be located -within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we will set aside sentencing decisions only in \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d <em>id., </em>as we will not substitute our judgment for that of the district court, <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">2. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The record does not support Poupart\u2019s argument that the district court \u201cmerely imposed the maximum guideline sentence.\u201d The district court explicitly considered the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In so doing, it determined, among other things, that the seriousness of Poupart\u2019s offense could \u201chardly be overstated,\u201d and Poupart\u2019s conduct was \u201cdevastating for the victims.\u201d (App. at 225). The district court discussed Poupart\u2019s history and characteristics, including the hardships he suffered as a child and his poor health, but concluded that protection of the public and Poupart\u2019s lack of remorse warranted a \u201clengthy sentence.\u201d (App. at 226-27). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court \u201cdischarged [its] duty to consider the statutory factors,\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30, and find no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Nor do we find any merit in Poupart\u2019s claim that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. Poupart\u2019s guidelines range was 262-327 months of imprisonment, but the statutory maximum penalty for the offense of conviction was 240 months. Here, especially in light of Poupart\u2019s history of sexually abusing children, including forcing a 13-year old victim to perform oral sex on him, sexually assaulting two 14-year old victims, and creating some of the child pornography that he possessed, the district court was well within its discretion to impose the statutory maximum penalty. Hence, the sentence was \u201cwithin the range of permissible decisions,\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted), and we therefore find no substantive error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">We have considered Poupart\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
