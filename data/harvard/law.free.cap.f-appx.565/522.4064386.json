We affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">At trial the parties offered two versions of the events surrounding Favela\u2019s arrest. Favela testified that he was standing outside of a nightclub, the Playpen Lounge, when four police officers arrived and attacked him for no reason. Favela said that the officers swung at him, slammed him to the ground, and kicked him in the stomach. He was arrested and brought to the police station where, Favela testified, officers beat him for 30 minutes, leaving him with a cut above his eyebrow, black eyes, scrapes on his elbows, and the imprint of a boot on his back. During cross-examination Favela admitted that he was \u201cvery drunk that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The police, however, characterized Fave-la as the aggressor. The nightclub\u2019s bouncer (who, as an auxiliary police officer, knew that Favela was wanted for questioning) notified the police department that Favela was standing outside. Officer Robert Vicari went to the scene and was pushed to the ground by Favela, who promptly fled. Vicari and Sergeant Ron Fabiani gave chase and tackled him to the ground. Favela resisted. During the struggle to place him in handcuffs, Fabiani \u201cstruck limbs\u201d and \u201cused pressure points\u201d on Favela\u2019s thumb and behind his ear to subdue him. The officers escorted- Favela to the police station, and 10 minutes after being placed in a holding cell, Favela was taken to the emergency room to be treated for a bleeding cut above his eyebrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The magistrate judge, presiding over a bench trial with the parties\u2019 consent, ruled for the officers. The judge credited the officers\u2019 testimony, found that all they did was \u201cpursue, subdue, and handcuff\u2019 Favela, and concluded that the force they used was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d when arresting Favela and taking him into custody. The judge disbelieved Favela\u2019s account, characterizing his testimony as \u201cutterly incredible\u201d and \u201cso internally inconsistent and implausible on its face that no reasonable factfinder could credit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">On appeal Favela argues that the evidence at trial of bruises, contusions, and lacerations on his face undermines the district court\u2019s conclusion that he was not subjected to excessive force. But the magistrate judge rested his ruling largely on his finding that the testifying officers were credible and Favela was not. Favela has given us no reason to disturb this finding, which is not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6); <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). To the extent that Favela suggests that his injuries necessarily reflect excessive force, that is not the standard; rather, force is excessive only when it is applied \u201cmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992); <em>see Cyrus v. Town of Mukwonago, </em>624 F.3d 856, 864 (7th Cir.2010); <em>McAllister v. Price, </em>615 F.3d 877, 882 (7th Cir.2010). Here, given the court\u2019s finding that Favela struck an officer, fled, and resisted arrest, the magistrate judge did not err in concluding that the officers\u2019 use of force was not excessive. <em>See Padula v. Leimbach, </em>656 F.3d 595, 603 (7th Cir.2011) (force not excessive where officers forcibly removed intoxicated driver from car and, when he resisted by kicking and flailing arms, officers used batons and mace to subdue him); <em>Catlin v. City of Wheaton, </em>574 F.3d 361, 367 (7th Cir.2009) (force not excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>where police tackled and kneeled on suspected drug kingpin who resisted arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Lastly, Favela in his reply brief challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that he failed to sustain his burden of proof to show intentional infliction of emotional distress. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, however, are waived. <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>726 F.3d 968, 974 n. 3 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund, </em>704 F.3d 522, 527 (7th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
