AstenJohnson, Inc., </em>740 F.3d 457, 462 (9th Cir.2014) (en banc). Four of the five declarants merely authenticated documents already in the record. The City\u2019s nondisclosure of these witnesses was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1); <em>Beauperthuy v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., </em>772 F.Supp.2d 1111, 1120 (N.D.Cal.2011). The City\u2019s failure to disclose the fifth contested declarant \u2014 who did provide substantive testimony \u2014 was harmless because (1) his testimony was cumulative, and (2) the relevant claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Similarly, the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion when she denied Appellants\u2019 request to compel further testimony from the City\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 30(b)(6) deponent. <em>See Quinn v. Anvil Corp., </em>620 F.3d 1005, 1015 (9th Cir.2010). Nor was the district court\u2019s implicit affirmation of that order \u201c \u2018clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Osband v. Woodford, </em>290 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A)). Appellants contend that the City\u2019s deponent did not provide specific information regarding disciplinary actions taken against San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department (\u201cJPD\u201d) employees from 2005-2011. But this argument ignores that the City ultimately handed over all available records outlining the number and types of disciplinary actions and the ethnicity of the employees involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Many of Appellants\u2019 discrimination claims are time-barred. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(Z) (setting a 300-day limitations period for Title VII claims); <em>Bonneau v. Centennial Sch. Dist. No. 28J, </em>666 F.3d 577, 579 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201c[A] state\u2019s residual personal injury statute of limitations ... should be applied to \u00a7 1983 claims____\u201d); <em>see also </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 335.1 (establishing a two-year statute of limitations in California for civil actions for \u201cinjury to ... an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another\u201d). We review those that are timely under the familiar burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">We assume without deciding that Appellants\u2019 timely claims establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113-14 (2000). But we conclude, as did the district court, that Appellants have not raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether the City\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its promotion and disciplinary practices were a \u201cmere pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Hawn, </em>615 F.3d at 1155; <em>see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Stated another way, Appellants have offered neither direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, nor \u201cspecific and substantial\u201d circumstantial evidence of pretext. <em>Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., </em>658 F.3d 1108, 1112-13 (9th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Appellants\u2019 \u201csubjective belief that the challenged employment action was unnecessary or unwarranted\u201d is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact, <em>see Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, </em>439 F.3d 1018, 1028-29 n. 6 (9th Cir.2006), the district court properly granted summary judgment to the City on the Title VII claims. Here, there was a failure of proof from Appellants on the key issue of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The same is true on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 equal protection claims, for which Appellants offered the same evidence as on their Title VII disparate treatment claims. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506 n. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <em>Surrell v. Cal. Water Serv. Co., </em>518 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir.2008). Finally, because California Government Code section 12940 tracks federal law under Title VII, <em>see Cook v. Lindsay Olive Growers, </em>911 F.2d 233, 241 (9th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Mixon v. Fair Emp\u2019t &amp; Hous. Comm\u2019n, </em>192 Cal.App.3d 1306, 1316, 237 Cal.Rptr. 884 (1987)), the district court properly granted summary judgment to the City on Appellants\u2019 state law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-21\">. Appellants did not brief their harassment and retaliation claims on appeal; those claims are therefore waived. <em>See Hall v. City of L.A., </em>697 F.3d 1059, 1071 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
