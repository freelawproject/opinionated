The August 27th order denied the City\u2019s post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial brought pursuant to Rules 50 and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Trial in this action resulted in a jury award of $3.2 million to Gregory Mulholland for claims he brought under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104. Mulholland\u2019s claims were based on injuries that he suffered in the course of his employment on July 2, 2009. On appeal, the City argues that the jury could not have concluded, as a matter of law, that at the time of this injury Mulholland was a seaman for the purposes of the Jones Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The question of whether an employee is a seaman for the purposes of the Jones Act is often, as it was in this case, a factual question left for the determination of the jury. <em>Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. Papai, </em>520 U.S. 548, 554, 117 S.Ct. 1535, 137 L.Ed.2d 800 (1997). To qualify as a seaman, an \u201cemployee\u2019s duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission,\u201d and \u201ca seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or to an identifiable group of such vessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.\u201d <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u201cA district court may set aside a jury\u2019s verdict pursuant to Rule 50 only where there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor'of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.\u201d <em>Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist, </em>691 F.3d 119, 127-28 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 50 motion <em>de novo, </em>[and] we are bound by the same stern standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, \u201c[w]e review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">The evidence in this case does not support the conclusion that the jury\u2019s determination that Mulholland was a seaman was \u201cthe result of sheer surmise and conjecture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127. The jury heard from Mulholland, for example, that his duties onboard the <em>Rosemary Miller </em>were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">[W]e did the bridges. We hooked the vessel up to the bridges. We chocked the cars like we did on the City Island Ferry. We handle lines.... We helped with navigation, because to come into the City Island or Hart Island docks, we have to be in the end of the boat and tell the master whether he\u2019s coming in too fast or he\u2019s going to be higher or lower than the bridge.... And when the ves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sel is unhooked from the bridge, it was always my job, as the number one deck hand \u2014 it was a navigational aide to waive him off that he was cleared from the dock, and that he could go proceed to his next landing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The jury was entitled to credit this testimony as to Mullholland\u2019s responsibilities in assuring the \u201caccomplishment of [the] mission\u201d of the <em>Rosemary Miller. Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172. Further, because of the identical missions of the <em>Rosemary Miller </em>and the <em>Michael Cos-grove, </em>it would not have been sheer surmise, nor unreasonable, for the jury to have concluded that Mulholland\u2019s work had a connection to an identifiable group of vessels in navigation. <em>See id. </em>We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50. For the same reasons, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant the City\u2019s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59, and affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s order as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We have examined the remainder of the City\u2019s arguments, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment and order of the district court hereby are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
