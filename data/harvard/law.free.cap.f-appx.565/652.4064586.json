We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-23\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Anderson v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 1121, 1122 (9th Cir.1990). We must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to waive an overpayment of benefits if it is supported by substantial evidence and if the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-24\">Substantial evidence supported the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that Manitsas was \u201cnot without fault\u201d and therefore did not qualify for a waiver of overpayment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.507. <em>See McCarthy v. Apfel, </em>221 F.3d 1119, 1126 (9th Cir.2000). Manitsas applied for a waiver, but she did not in addition request reconsideration of the initial overpayment determination pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.502a(f)-(h). Accordingly, the ALJ applied a correct legal standard in not considering the validity of the overpayment determination itself. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.905 (providing that initial determination is binding if individual does not request reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-25\">Manitsas contends that the ALJ erred in denying her request to reopen the overpayment determination because she was entitled to tolling under Social Security Ruling 91-5p. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>consider the merits of the ALJ\u2019s denial. The denial of the request to reopen was a non-reviewable administrative action. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.903(7); <em>Klemm v. Astrue, </em>543 F.3d 1139, 1144 (9th Cir.2008). In addition, Manitsas did not present a colorable due process claim. <em>See Klemm, </em>543 F.3d at 1144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
