The district court did not proeedurally err. We need not decide whether to review for abuse of discretion or plain error. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>United States v. Waknine, </em>543 F.3d 546, 551 (9th Cir.2008). We would affirm under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-20\">a. The district court adequately considered \u201cthe need to provide restitution to [the] victims of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(7). As required, the district court made \u201can individualized determination based on the facts.\u201d <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991. To obtain restitution funding, Ray negotiated a $2.5 million loan. However, the potential lender would only loan the money if Ray received a non-custodial sentence. Given this condition on the loan, choosing between a custodial and non-custodial sentence would effectively disapprove or approve the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">The district court also explained that it needed to give weight to \u00a7 3553(a) factors other than restitution, discussing the need to provide punishment and deterrence and to protect the public from a financial fraud repeat offender. Thus, the district court adequately considered and explained why it rejected Ray\u2019s position that her sentence should leave her free to work during the day. <em>See id. </em>at 992-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">Contrary to Ray\u2019s contention, the district court considered Ray\u2019s attempt to provide restitution as a mitigating factor, not an aggravating factor. The district court discussed other mitigating factors\u2014 Ray\u2019s husband\u2019s health and Ray\u2019s abusive childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-23\">b. The district court also adequately explained why it varied above the Guidelines range, <em>see id., </em>discussing several aggravating factors at length, including: (i) Ray\u2019s prior financial fraud convictions, which were not part of the Guidelines calculation; (ii) the manner in which Ray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>carried out her scheme; and (iii) the extent of harm her victims suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The district court did not \u201cselect[] a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Regarding obstruction of justice, the record reflects Ray bribed a victim to not consult the FBI and threatened another with deportation. With respect to her leadership role, Ray\u2019s sentencing papers and the government\u2019s exhibits identify several individuals who recruited investor-victims for Ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">2. Under abuse of discretion review, <em>United States v. Autery, </em>555 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2009), the district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993. A \u201csentence outside the Guidelines [range] carries no presumption of unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 714, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Given the aggravating factors, a sentence ten months above the high end of the advisory Guidelines calculation was reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The district court applied facts independent from those underlying the Guidelines calculation (e.g., two earlier financial fraud convictions and Ray\u2019s management role in the Ponzi scheme). Moreover, a district court may rely on \u201csome of the [same] facts ... already taken into account by the Guidelines\u201d to support a variation above the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Lichtenberg, </em>631 F.3d 1021, 1027 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">3. Ray waived her claim that the district court improperly imposed restitution as a condition of her custodial sentence, because she provided no argument in this court on the issue. <em>See Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1057, 1069 n. 18 (9th Cir.2000). In any event, the law allows the district court to impose restitution as a condition of a custodial sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
