His counsel has moved for leave to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Manzo\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because (1) the 100-month prison term was in the middle, not at the bottom, of Manzo\u2019s Guidelines range as recalculated by the court after granting the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 downward-departure motion, and (2) the court recommended that Manzo\u2019s prison term be ordered to run consecutively to certain anticipated state prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-24\">We first conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in selecting Manzo\u2019s term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Zauner, </em>688 F.3d 426, 429 (8th Cir.2012) (substantive reasonableness of sentence based on both \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and district court\u2019s consideration of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors is reviewed for abuse of discretion). We further conclude that the district court\u2019s recommendation regarding consecutive prison terms did not result in an unreasonable sentence. <em>Cf. Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1473, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012) (noting that it was within district court\u2019s discretion to order that defendant\u2019s sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-27\">Finally, having reviewed the record independently in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Manzo about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-21\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
