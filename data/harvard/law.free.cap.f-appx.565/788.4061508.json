Sampedro-Blanco, a Cuban citizen, was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), because he \u2014 after his admission into the United States as a lawful permanent resident \u2014 was convicted of conspiracy to import more than one kilogram of cocaine. On appeal, Sampedro-Blanco argues that the IJ and BIA improperly considered facts outside of his record of conviction to assess the nature of his criminal conduct and that, in denying his application, unfairly relied on his own testimony before the IJ on his importation of 400 kilograms of cocaine. He also argues that the IJ and BIA failed to make an explicit finding on the record that his removal was better for the United States than allowing him to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision of the Attorney General, including a decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 212(c) waiver application. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). But the REAL ID Act of 2005 restored our jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges and questions of law arising out of the alien\u2019s removal proceedings, regardless of the jurisdictional bars imposed by \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B) or (C). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Arias, </em>482 F.3d at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Because Sampedro-Blanco was convicted of conspiracy to commit a drug-trafficking crime, and because he sought discretionary relief in the form of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, we have jurisdiction only to address his arguments that raise either constitutional challenges or questions of law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), (D). His argument that the IJ and BIA erred by considering evidence outside of his record of conviction is a question of law; and, therefore, we have jurisdiction to review it. <em>See A\u00f1as, </em>482 F.3d at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). A motion to reconsider must specify the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s decision and must be supported by pertinent authority. <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of statutes if the interpretation is reasonable. <em>Al Najjar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Before 1996, an alien who had accrued seven years of lawful permanent residence in the United States could request that the Attorney General waive the alien\u2019s basis for excludability or deportation pursuant to former \u00a7 212(c). <em>Ferguson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>563 F.3d 1254, 1260 &amp; n. 12 (11th Cir.2009). In 1996, Congress repealed this relief under the INA, replacing it with a procedure referred to as \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260 &amp; n. 13. In <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that, despite the repeal of the underlying statute, \u00a7 212(c) waivers \u201cremain[ed] available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d 533 U.S. 289, 325-26, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Here, the BIA properly denied Sampedro-Blanco\u2019s motion for reconsideration, as Sampedro-Blanco did not cite relevant controlling authority prohibiting the BIA from considering his testimony about the nature of his criminal conduct in making a decision regarding his \u00a7 212(c) waiver. The evidence was used to consider the seriousness of his prior criminal conduct: not a matter of guilt or innocence of a specific offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">A petitioner is required to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing a petition for review. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Consequently, where a petitioner advances an argument that he did not bring before the BIA, we have no jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">In this case, Sampedro-Blanco did not exhaust his argument that the IJ and BIA were required to make an explicit finding that his removal would be in the \u201cbest interest of this country.\u201d Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to consider his unexhausted argument; and we dismiss his petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we deny in part and dismiss in part Sampedro-Blanco\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
