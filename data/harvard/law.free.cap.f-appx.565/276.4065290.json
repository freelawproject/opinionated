The district court sentenced him to a total of 100 months in prison and four years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel for Pardue filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning the reasonableness of the sentence. Pardue has not filed a supplemental pro se brief, despite notice of his right to do so. We affirm Pardue\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">In reviewing a sentence, we must first ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006), but \u201cmust place on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the case before it\u201d that is sufficient to permit appellate review. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">If the defendant did not argue for a sentence different than the one imposed, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578 (4th Cir.2010). But \u201c[i]f a party repeats on appeal a claim of procedural sentencing error ... which it has made before the district court, we review for abuse of discretion\u201d and will \u201creverse unless we conclude that the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. In assessing the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009). Only if we find the sentence procedurally reasonable can we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 328. We apply a presumption of reasonableness to a within \u2014 Guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">At sentencing, Pardue argued that his role in the offense was minor such that he was entitled to a reduction in his total offense level. We conclude that the district court did not err in overruling the objection. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(b) &amp; cmt. n. 5 (describing two level reduction available for minor participant); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>680 F.3d 350, 359 (4th Cir.) (observing that \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in assessing \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment is whether defendant\u2019s conduct is essential to commission of offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 376, 184 L.Ed.2d 222 (2012). Furthermore, the district court provided an adequate, individualized explanation to support the sentence. <em>See Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330. Our review of the record therefore leads us to conclude that Pardue\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (presumption of reasonableness rebutted only upon showing that sentence is unreasonable when measured against \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Pardue, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Pardue requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Pardue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
