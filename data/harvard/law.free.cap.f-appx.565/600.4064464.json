In response, Appellee raises a number of challenges to the proceedings below, styled as a \u201ccross-appeal.\u201d We dismiss both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">1. The district court correctly concluded that Appellants\u2019 Motion For Summary Judgment or Partial Summary Judgment offered no arguments regarding qualified immunity on Appellee\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 of alleged violations of his substantive due process rights. Rather, qualified immunity was first requested in Appellants\u2019 Motion For Reconsideration and Clarification of Order and Judgment\u2014 an improper vehicle for such a request. <em>See Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir.2000). Because Appellants\u2019 arguments were never properly presented to the district court, Appellants were never denied qualified immunity on Appellee\u2019s substantive due process claim \u2014 rather, the district court merely denied Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, reasoning that it could not reconsider an issue that had not previously been adjudicated. As such, we lack jurisdiction over Appellants\u2019 appeal under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Rodriguez v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>627 F.3d 1259, 1264 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">2. We cannot consider the other issues raised by Appellants on appeal and Appellee in his \u201ccross-appeal\u201d because the district court\u2019s adjudication of the remaining issues does not constitute an immediately appealable final order. <em>See Mueller v. Auker, </em>576 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir.2009) (discussing the attributes of an immediately appealable final order); <em>Williamson v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>160 F.3d 1247, 1250 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cOrders granting partial summary judgment are, absent special circumstances, not appealable final orders.... \u201d). Pendent appellate jurisdiction is similarly unavailable. <em>See Cunningham v. Gates, </em>229 F.3d 1271, 1285 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-20\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b623-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
