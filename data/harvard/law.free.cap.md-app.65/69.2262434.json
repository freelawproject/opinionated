BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">John Joseph Sibiga, appellant, was found guilty by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of hindering a police officer in the performance of his duty and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was sentenced to two concurrent one year sentences. On appeal, he attacks his convictions on four bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>I. The lower court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that they were the judges of the law and were not bound by the court\u2019s instructions on the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">II. The lower court erred by allowing the prosecutor, in his closing argument to the jury, to compare appellant to A1 Capone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">III. The lower court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgments of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">IV. The lower court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">On the morning of September 1, 1983, law enforcement officers of the Baltimore County Police and Sheriff\u2019s Departments went to appellant\u2019s home to execute a writ of possession which had been issued by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and which authorized appellant\u2019s eviction. After some delay, appellant responded to the officers\u2019 knocking and, at their request, opened the door. The writ of possession was shown to him and the purpose of the officers\u2019 presence explained. When appellant attempted to close the door a struggle between appellant and the officers ensued. As a result, appellant having been removed from the house was pinned on the ground and subdued. During the struggle, appellant yelled to his 11 year old son, Patrick, \u201cgo get it\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When officers approached the house, they found Patrick, standing in the living room pointing a shotgun at them demanding that his father be left alone. When their attempts to convince the boy to put the gun down failed, they requested appellant to tell his son to put the gun down. He refused, stating \u201che knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Other attempts to get appellant to cooperate, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ing a request that he tell them his son\u2019s name, failed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, the gun was put down and appellant was arrested. His son was detained by the juvenile authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">On August 18, 1983, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in a civil action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to foreclose the mortgage on appellant\u2019s home, the mortgagee\u2019s petition for issuance of a writ of possession was granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At his criminal trial, appellant testified that following the court\u2019s oral decision, he advised the court of his intention to appeal and, on the next day, ordered the transcript from the court reporter. According to appellant, he also gave the court reporter a written notice of appeal and paid $50.00, for both of which he received a receipt. He was not told about the need to file a supersedeas bond.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Upon his release from custody on September 1, 1983, appellant testified that, his motion to stay the writ of possession in the civil action was granted. Also he filed a notice of appeal. Some time later, appellant filed a supersedeas bond in the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Following the close of the evidence, the trial judge met with counsel and appellant in chambers to discuss requested jury instructions. The trial judge, believing them to be correct statements of the law, informed counsel that he intended to give the hindering and contributing to the delinquency of a minor instructions requested by the State. Both appellant and his attorney explicitly agreed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>hindering instruction correctly stated the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither, however, commented with respect to the proposed instruction on contributing to the delinquency of a minor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court later denied appellant\u2019s jury instruction requests Nos. 1 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">... those requests are contrary to the law of the State of Maryland as stated in <em>Stevenson v. State </em>and <em>Montgomery v. State. Stevenson </em>is 289 Md. 167 [423 A.2d 558 (1980) ]. <em>Montgomery </em>is 292 Md. 84 [437 A.2d 654 (1981) ]. I don\u2019t see any dispute as to the law in this case and I will instruct the jury in the absence of such a dispute as to the law of the crime my instructions are binding on them as to the law. I will so instruct the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Although neither the appellant nor his attorney objected, at that time, to the court\u2019s refusal of these requests, appellant did so later, prior to the end of the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The trial court instructed the jury consistent with its expressed intention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following the court\u2019s instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the following colloquy occurred at the bench, out of the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">MR. KING: Your Honor I am again going to renew my objection as to the fact that in the State of Maryland the jury is both the judge of law and the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">Also, number two, the jury shall be told that they are the judges of the law and the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">THE COURT: Mr. King, is there anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Let me just address those two. As I indicated to you in our chambers\u2019 conference when I reviewed your request for instructions, my reading of the <em>Montgomery v. State </em>and <em>Stevenson v. State </em>indicates that the instruction that I have given to the jury, with respect to their role as judges of the law, is a proper instruction. I have your exception, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Although the court gave no instructions on such issues and, except for appellant\u2019s request No. 10a, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> none requested, both appellant and the State argued to the jury concerning the effect of the writ of possession and of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>appeal of the circuit court\u2019s judgment pursuant to which the writ was issued. The State argued that the writ of possession issued as a result of appellant\u2019s failure to make required mortgage payments, was a lawful court order and that, absent a supersedeas bond, neither appellant\u2019s attempted appeal prior to eviction nor his perfection of that appeal following eviction, could legally have prevented that eviction. Appellant, on the other hand, noting that he ordered the transcript of the proceedings and gave a notice of appeal to the court reporter, contended that he attempted in good faith to appeal. Further, he pointed out that he filed an appeal on September 1st, prior to the expiration of the appeal period and that on the same day on which he perfected his appeal, the trial judge stayed the effect of the writ of possession pending his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Appellant now argues that there was a dispute between the parties about the law applicable to the case; therefore, the court erroneously instructed that its instructions on the law were binding. The dispute, he asserts, concerned \u201cthe legal scope and effect of the writ of possession\u201d and \u201cwhether appellant had the right to resist a removal from his home.\u201d He reasons that \u201cbecause he acted in good faith without criminal intent, on the reasonable assumption that he was entitled to remain in his home and to resist being moved from his home\u201d, his actions were not criminal. With specific reference to the hindering charge, appellant urges that since it involves interfering with the performance of an officer\u2019s \u201clawful\u201d duties, \u201cif appellant was correct in his legal argument that Officer Windsor and others had no legal right to move him from his house, then appellant could not have been convicted of hindering Officer Windsor.\u201d Similarly, regarding contributing to the delinquency of a minor, he says, \u201cIf the jury had been allowed to fulfill their role as judges of the law, they may have concluded that appellant and his son lacked the necessary criminal intent to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for that charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Maryland Courts have consistently held that the trial judge must give requested instructions that correctly state the applicable law and have not been fairly covered in the instructions actually given. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984); <em>Lansdowne v. State, </em>287 Md. 232, 412 A.2d 88 (1980); <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 603, 490 A.2d 763 (1983). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A trial judge must be afforded the opportunity to correct any misstatement of law, clarify any ambiguity, or correct any inaccuracies which may exist in his instructions. <em>Leatherwood v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 683, 435 A.2d 477 (1981). Therefore, in order to preserve a point for appellate review, the party, in addition to a request for instructions, must object, stating distinctly the grounds for his objection, to the instructions actually given prior to the retirement of the jury. Maryland Rule 4-325(e). <em>See also Lyles v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 376, 492 A.2d 959 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Appellant has preserved for appellate review the correctness of the court\u2019s instructions as to the jury\u2019s law-judging function. The question that must be resolved is, what is it that appellant has preserved?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Unless the issue preserved involves a dispute of law of the kind, the resolution of which is entrusted to the jury, there is nothing for us to review and, in any event, this assignment of error is meritless. The jury\u2019s law-judging function is limited to resolving disputes as to the substantive \u201claw of the crime,\u201d which occurs \u201cwhen an instruction culminates in a dispute as to the proper interpretation of the law of the crime for which there is a sound basis.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 89, 437 A.2d 654 (1981); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We pointed out in <em>Allnutt v. State, </em>59 Md. 694, 702, 478 A.2d 321 (1984),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>A distillation of <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>leads us to conclude that it will be a rare case indeed where there is <em>\u201ca </em>dispute or sound basis for a dispute\u201d as to the \u201claw of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We concluded that \u201cinstances of dispute of the law of the crime are an endangered species rapidly approaching extinction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703, 478 A.2d 321. We continue to adhere to this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant may not now dispute the court\u2019s instructions defining hindering and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Both he and his counsel conceded that the definition of hindering given to the jury correctly stated the law and no exception to that definition was taken. Although neither affirmatively and explicitly agreed with the definition of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, neither expressed disagreement and, again, no exception was taken. Moreover, the record does not reflect that there is any sound basis for a dispute as to the definition of those crimes. Appellant did except to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it was the sole judge of the law; however, that exception did not create a dispute as to the law of the crime where none existed. Furthermore, it could not preserve an issue which had already been waived. We conclude that no issue as to the law of the crime has been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The issues which appellant designates as disputes of law involve the sufficiency of the evidence and the jury\u2019s fact-finding function. In order to resolve them, the jury had to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and determine the weight of the evidence and apply the law to the facts found. Its choice was between the \u201cfacts\u201d, including the inferences deducible therefrom, presented by the State and those presented by the defense, and not between conflicting interpretations of the law. The court correctly instructed the jury that it was the sole judge of the facts and that the court\u2019s instructions in that regard were advisory only and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>[y]ou are instructed that if you find, after hearing all of the evidence, that the defendant lacked the intent to commit any of the crimes for which he is charged, then you must find him not guilty of such crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Appellant was entitled to no more. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">During his closing argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">Now, if you were to accept Mr. Sibiga\u2019s way of thinking I think we\u2019d be in a little bit of a turmoil. Mr. Sibiga wants to interpret the law as whichever way he thinks proper, forgetting what the appellate courts and the courts have said in cases. He wants to interpret it the way he wants the law to be. A1 Capone could go around and rob banks as easily as anyone if A1 Capone made the decision that carrying a gun in your hand is proper. This is what Mr. Sibiga has done. Mr. Sibiga has made the decision that his interpretation of the law is the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Appellant now asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comparison of him to A1 Capone was inaccurate, irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Conceding that no objection was made to the argument at trial, he nevertheless contends that the lower court\u2019s failure, <em>sua sponte, </em>to grant a mistrial or to give a curative instruction was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201chighly improper.\u201d They were not fair comment upon the substantive evidence in the case, nor on appellant\u2019s credibility as a witness. \u201cThey were designed solely to instill in the jury a general antipathy towards appellant, and thus, in intent, exceeded the proper bounds of argument.\u201d (citations omitted) <em>Beard v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 276, 289, 399 A.2d 1383 (1979), <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 265, 250 A.2d 904 (1969). Having determined that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, we must determine whether they \u201cappear likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d <em>Curry v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 250, 257, 458 A.2d 474 (1983). To do so, we must consider the closeness of the case; the centrality of the issue affected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the error; and the steps taken by the trial judge to mitigate the remarks\u2019 effect on the jury. <em>Wilhelm, v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), citing <em>Gaither v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 1061 (D.C.Cir.1969). We also must give due consideration to the unique position of the trial judge to evaluate and assess the context in which the remarks were made and to determine whether they were, in this case, prejudicial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge took no action, <em>sua sponte. </em>But neither was the issue affected by the error central to the decision of the case, nor the case describable as close. In addition, the comments of the prosecutor were a \u201cquick passing reference in the context of the overall argument.\u201d <em>Beard v. State, supra. </em>[42 Md.App.] at 290, 399 A.2d 1383. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not so inflammatory as to create a real likelihood of prejudice. We find no abuse of discretion. <em>Wilhelm, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Appellant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of hindering and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The standard of review when the issue is the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 424 A.2d 720 (1981); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The crime of obstructing or hindering a police officer consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">(1) a police officer engaged in the performance of a duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">(2) an act, or perhaps an omission, by the accused which obstructs or hinders a police officer in the performance of that duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>(3) knowledge by the accused of facts comprising element (1); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(4) intent to obstruct or hinder the officer by the act or omission constituting element (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>Cover v. State, </em>297 Md. 398, 466 A.2d 1276 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">There was ample evidence that Sgt. Windsor was a police officer engaged in the performance of a duty and that appellant had knowledge of those facts. Appellant\u2019s argument that, \u201cin view of appellant\u2019s difficulty in speaking after he had been removed from the house, it cannot be said that he was even uncooperative by being unable to tell Patrick Sibiga to put the gun down\u201d, calls into question elements (2) and (4). His argument overlooks, however, the testimony of Sgt. Misc. that, in response to their request that he tell his son to put the gun down, appellant said, \u201cHe knows what to do\u201d as well as Sgt. Windsor\u2019s testimony that appellant refused to cooperate. Such testimony provides ample evidence of the existence of elements (2) and (4). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Appellant also complains that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The only complaint he has as to the sufficiency of the evidence is that it did not indicate or show that he told Patrick to get or use the shotgun. Again, appellant overlooks the testimony of one of the State\u2019s witness, in this instance, Chief Deputy Weirs. The trial transcript reveals the following colloquy between the State and Chief Deputy Weirs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">Q. Did he say, Patrick, or did he just say, go get it, or do you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">A. My memory is he told Patrick to go get it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Although this testimony contradicts appellant\u2019s testimony and, arguably, is inconsistent with other portions of Chief Deputy Weirs\u2019 own testimony, the jury was free to consider it and arrive at a verdict consistent therewith. The evidence, therefore, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Appellant finally contends that it was error to deny his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor because the charging document omitted from the charge itself the allegation that appellant was an adult and thus did not allege a cognizable offense. Although no pretrial motion to dismiss the charging document was filed and, notwithstanding that sufficient evidence to show that he was an adult was presented at trial, appellant argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted because of this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Appellant was charged by means of a statement of charges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The case was captioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">STATE OF MARYLAND VS.

Noting that implicit in the words, \u201cdid wilfully and deliberately, with premeditation, kill and slay\u201d is that the killing was unlawful, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">Although defective under \u00a7 616, we think these averments were sufficient, for jurisdictional purposes, to invest the circuit court with power to proceed to trial on the then unchallenged indictment \u2014 as it reasonably apprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>Chaney, </em>consistent with the notice requirements of Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that he was charged with unlawful homicide and specifically, by its reference to \u00a7\u00a7 407-410 of Art. 27, with first degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 26, 497 A.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant concedes that the only allegation missing from the statement of charges was one that appellant was an adult. Reference to the caption of the statement of charges makes clear, from appellant\u2019s date of birth, that he was an adult. Because, \u201cin ascertaining the existence of jurisdiction in the circuit court, we consider the [statement of charges] in its entirety,\u201d for jurisdictional purposes, the charge was sufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Just as a defect in an indictment which might have subjected the. indictment to dismissal on timely pretrial motion does not affect the court\u2019s jurisdiction to try the offense charged, such a defect in this statement of charges does not render insufficient otherwise competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>There was clearly sufficient evidence presented at trial specifically, that appellant had lived at his home for 23 years, to show that appellant was an adult. The unseasonably challenged defect in the statement of charges does not negate this evidence. The trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">.
