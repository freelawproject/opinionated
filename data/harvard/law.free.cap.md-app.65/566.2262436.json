Prior to trial on the merits, Payne moved to suppress the physical evidence on the ground that it was seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">At trial the State introduced into evidence a Ruger .357 Magnum handgun, eight cartridges', and a marijuana ciga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>rette, all of which had been seized from Payne by Baltimore City Police Officer Richard T. Grissom.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the handgun, cartridges, and marijuana cigarette were unconstitutionally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officer Grissom testified that on July 18, 1984, while on routine patrol in a high crime area of Baltimore City, he observed a vehicle \u201cdouble-parked and impeding the free flow of vehicular traffic____\u201d According to Grissom, the vehicle bore Virginia license plates. Grissom further related to the court that when he \u201cpulled behind the vehicle to effect a stop, ... the driver of the vehicle [Payne] was bending over as if picking-up or putting something on the floorboard.\u201d As Grissom approached the vehicle, he saw Payne \u201cquickly jam a black [leather] bag down to the floorboard ... concealing it from view.\u201d Grissom asked Payne for the latter\u2019s operator\u2019s license and vehicle registration. During this brief encounter, Grissom noticed that the passenger in the vehicle grew increasingly nervous. Grissom said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201cThe passenger in the vehicle was sitting very rigidly like he was scared ... he kept shifting his hands and he kept looking out of the corners of his eyes____[h]e\u2019d look at me and he\u2019d look at the direction of the bag____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Officer Grissom further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">\u201c[In contrast, Payne] appeared to be ... [nervous only] ... when he shoved the bag [on to the floor mat]. I thought that it was very out of context with the way he acted after that. Everything he said after that was very cool, very deliberate____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">His suspicion aroused, Grissom stepped away from the vehicle and, upon seeing another patrol unit in the vicinity, signaled for assistance. After the other unit arrived at the scene, Grissom requested Payne to step out of the vehicle in which Payne was sitting. Upon Payne\u2019s compliance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>officer reached into the vehicle and removed the black leather bag. Grissom told the judge that he patted the exterior of the bag and \u201cfelt ... the outline of a handgun.\u201d Having felt what he believed to be a handgun, Grissom opened the bag. There he found a Ruger .357 Magnum handgun, eight cartridges, and a marijuana cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Recognizing the need to afford some flexibility to police in their never ending fight against crime and at the same time protect the citizenry from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d the Supreme Court, in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), attempted to strike a balance between the two interests. <em>See also Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968); <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 230, 306 A.2d 587, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 759 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In <em>Terry </em>the Supreme Court said that although both the \u201cstop and the frisk\u201d of an individual are sufficiently intrusive to necessitate Fourth Amendment review, they are not so invasive so as to require the predicate of the standard of \u201cprobable cause.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 16-20, 88 S.Ct. at 1877-1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 903-905. \u201c[T]he central inquiry\u201d is always \u201cthe reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19, 88 S.Ct. at 1878-1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The measure of \u201creasonableness\u201d for the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d is variously referred to as \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d \u201creason to believe.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md.App. at 237, 306 A.2d at 591, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 759. <em>Terry </em>makes crystal clear that \u201csuspicion\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d must be founded upon \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences,\u201d properly deducible therefrom, \u201creasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906. It is equally clear that the officer \u201cmust be able to articulate specific facts justifying both the stop and, quite independently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u2018frisk/ \u201d inasmuch as the two are separate and distinct intrusions. <em>Gibbs, </em>18 Md.App. at 239, 306 A.2d at 592, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In the matter <em>sub judice </em>there is no challenge to the propriety of Officer Grissom\u2019s conduct in \u201cstopping\u201d Payne since Payne was double parked \u2014 a violation of Md.Trans.Code Ann. \u00a7 21-1003(c)(7) (1984 Repl.Vol.). Payne\u2019s attack is not directed at the \u201cstop\u201d; he assails the \u201cfrisk,\u201d which he asserts was an unlawful invasion of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\"><em>Terry, </em>as we have previously said, requires that a police officer possess a \u201csuspicion\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d that would reasonably warrant the intrusion. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. at 64, 88 S.Ct. at 1903, 20 L.Ed.2d at 935, made clear that because the purpose undergirding the \u201cfrisk\u201d is the protection of the officer effecting the \u201cstop,\u201d the officer\u2019s suspicion must be based on \u201cparticular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d Phrased another way, a police officer may conduct a \u201cfrisk\u201d of an individual only when the officer perceives conduct which reasonably leads him to believe that the person whom he has confronted may be presently armed and dangerous. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 29-30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-1885, 20 L.Ed.2d at 910-911.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Notwithstanding that the establishment of a sufficiently individualized and articulable suspicion to believe a person is armed and dangerous may serve to justify a \u201cfrisk,\u201d there remains the problem of the scope of the frisk. Chief Justice Warren penned for the majority in Terry<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that because a frisk is designed exclusively to detect the presence of offensive weapons, a police officer \u201cis entitled ... to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of ... [persons whom he believes to be armed and dangerous] in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>assault him.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-1885, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911. Some courts interpreted <em>Terry </em>as authorizing only limited frisks of the <em>person.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The Supreme Court, however, has gradually expanded <em>Terry\u2019s </em>scope with respect to a protective frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Four years after <em>Terry, </em>the Court in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), held that the police, acting on information supplied by a known informant, may reach into the passenger compartment of an automobile so as to remove a gun from the driver\u2019s waistband, even though the gun was not apparent from outside the vehicle and the police knew of its existence only because of the tip. The <em>Adams </em>decision rested in part on the growing concern over the danger faced by police officers in automobile situations. The Court warned that such a \u201csearch\u201d was not to be used to discover evidence of crime but was limited to its \u201cprotective purpose.\u201d <em>Terry </em>manifests that \u201cthe sole justification of [such] search is the protection of ... police officers] and others nearby, and ... [the search] must be confined ... to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments [which could be used] for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>assault ... [on] the police officer.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We are cognizant of the fact that whenever a police officer approaches a person seated in an automobile, the officer has no way of foretelling whether the individual in the vehicle is armed. The risks to the officer\u2019s life and limb are considerable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those risks were the basis for the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977). There the Court concluded that police officers may order persons to alight from a motor vehicle during a stop for a traffic violation. Furthermore, the Court held that the officer may then \u201cfrisk\u201d those persons for weapons if there is reasonable belief that the persons were armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The holding of <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983), fully extended the reach of <em>Terry, Sibron, Adams, </em>and <em>Mimms. </em>Citing its concern for the \u201cespecially hazardous\u201d nature of roadside encounters,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court explicitly rejected the idea that <em>Terry </em>permitted only limited pat-down searches of persons. <em>Long </em>declared that when an individual is properly stopped while in or beside an automobile, the entire passenger compartment of that automobile is within the \u201cfrisk\u201d perimeter. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In permitting the \u201cfrisk\u201d of the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle, the Court relied upon <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). <em>Chimel </em>held that an arresting officer must be allowed \u201cto remove any weapons that the (arrestee) might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape.\u201d 395 U.S. at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694. To achieve that objective the officer is, of necessity, permitted to conduct a \u201csearch of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019 \u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon.\u201d <em>Chimel, </em>395 U.S. at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694. Twelve years after <em>Chimel, </em>the Court in the case of <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 clarified what it meant by the phrase, \u201carea within the immediate control of the arrestee.\u201d <em>Belton </em>made clear that: Whenever a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a motor vehicle, the officer may make a contemporaneous search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle as well as any container found therein. 453 U.S. at 460, 101 S.Ct. at 2864, 69 L.Ed.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Notwithstanding that both <em>Chimel </em>and <em>Belton </em>were concerned with deciding whether searches were supported by probable cause, the <em>Long </em>court held that because the purpose of a search incident to arrest is identical to the aim or goal of the \u201cfrisk\u201d <em>(ie., </em>the self-protection of the officer), it would allow under certain circumstances a \u201cfrisk\u201d of the interior of parts of the vehicle. The Court then declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A38\">\u201c[T]he search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible <em>if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u2019 the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons. </em>(Footnote omitted).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1049, 103 S.Ct. at 3480, 77 L.Ed.2d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The record before us discloses absolutely no \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that Payne was armed and dangerous. All Grissom saw was a car double parked, a motion by Payne during which Payne either placed something on or took something from the floor, a jamming of a \u201cblack bag ... to the floorboard,\u201d and \u201cfurtive\u201d glances by a person who was a passenger in Payne\u2019s car. How anyone can reasonably deduce from those facts that Payne had a gun totally eludes us, unless Grissom was clairvoyant. Grissom might just as easily have concluded that Payne had placed on the floor of the car narcotics, or pornographic matter, or receipts of a \u201cnumbers\u201d pickup, or money or jewelry. The list is innumerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Based upon our independent constitutional review, we must conclude that the officer did not articulate specific facts from which a rational inference could be drawn that Payne was armed and dangerous. We conclude that the motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">.
