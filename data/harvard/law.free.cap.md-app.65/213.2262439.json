State, </em>304 Md. 281, 498 A.2d 655 (S.T.1985); <em>Berry v. State, </em>287 Md. 491, 413 A.2d 557 (1981). There is hardly anything new or startling about that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Where the basis of an alleged violation is a subsequent criminal act \u2014 a failure to \u201cobey all laws\u201d or to refrain from the illegal possession or use of drugs or other contraband\u2014 it should normally be a simple matter for the State to prove the date of the violation, especially when the probationer has been arrested for and convicted of the subsequent offense. There are police reports, charging documents, witnesses \u2014 all manner of evidence sufficient to establish when the violation occurred. Because the State failed to produce this readily available evidence in this case, we find it necessary to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City revoking appellant\u2019s probation and directing execution of a six-month term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">On April 16, 1984, appellant was convicted of theft; the court found that she had fraudulently signed and cashed social service checks payable to her dead father. On May 29, 1984, the court imposed a sentence of one year but suspended execution in favor of three years probation, two conditions of which were that she \u201cobey all laws\u201d and \u201cnot illegally possess, use, or sell any narcotic drug, \u2018controlled dangerous substance\u2019 or related paraphernalia____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The record shows that on June 6, 1984 \u2014 eight days after having been placed on probation \u2014 appellant was arrested and charged with three violations of the controlled dangerous substance laws. On January 10, 1985, as part of a plea bargain, the State nol prossed two of those charges and appellant pled guilty to one \u2014 possession with intent to distribute marijuana. For that offense, she again received a prison sentence which was suspended in favor of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Following, and as a result of, that conviction, the State moved to revoke the first probation, alleging a violation of the two conditions above noted. The \u201cNotice of Violation of Probation,\u201d which served as the basis for a warrant, alleged in connection with the failure to \u201cobey all laws\u201d that appellant was \u201carrested on 6/6/84 and convicted on 1/18/85 in B.C.C.C.\u201d As to the other condition, the notice alleged simply that appellant \u201cwas charged and convicted of possession of Marijuana, Narcotic conspiracy.\u201d Nothing was said in the notice as to when the offense was committed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A hearing on the State\u2019s petition was held on March 11, 1985. Two items of evidence were presented \u2014 the testimony of appellant\u2019s probation agent and a copy of the Circuit Court\u2019s docket entries in the subsequent case. The first docket entry is dated June 7, 1984, and deals with a $5,000 bail bond being secured in District Court. The next entry is dated July 18, 1984; it shows that appellant, on that day, was charged by criminal information. Nowhere do the docket entries show the date of the offense. The probation agent testified that appellant was arrested on June 6 for \u201cNarcotic conspiracy, possession of marijuana [and] nuisance\u201d and that she was convicted on January 10, 1985 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>possession of marijuana, but he also gave no indication of when the offense occurred. Appellant elected not to testify-</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Apparently assuming that the offense occurred on the date of arrest, the court found appellant \u201cguilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty,\u201d stating that \u201cwithin the week of probation, you got yourself involved again, and [were] convicted of a later offense.\u201d From the judgment entered, appellant has brought this appeal, complaining that \u201cit is impossible to say on the record before the trial court whether the marijuana possession and consequential violation of law occurred at a time when Appellant was on probation.\u201d The State concedes the lack of any direct evidence establishing the date of the violation, but argues that the court could \u201cinfer\u201d that appellant was arrested on the date of the offense and that appellant \u201chad an opportunity to testify and establish that she had not yet been placed on probation when the offense occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We are unpersuaded by the State\u2019s response. Although the State need not establish the alleged violation beyond a reasonable doubt, the burden is upon it to show with at least \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that the condition was violated at a time when appellant was subject to it. <em>See Herold v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 295, 302, 449 A.2d 429 (1982). The probationer has no obligation to prove a negative \u2014 to establish that something the State fails to allege didn\u2019t occur. At least one of the charges made against appellant was conspiracy, which is not a simple crime. On this record, we see no basis for an inference that the offense occurred on the date of arrest, or at a time after May 29, 1984. It may well be that the arrest was, in fact, contemporaneous with the commission of the offense, but there is no evidence in this record to show it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">. Attached to the Notice, as it appears in the court file, is a Division of Parole and Probation Supervision Summary, which, under the heading \u201cSpecification of Conditions Violated\u201d essentially repeats what is contained in the Notice. Under the heading \u201cReason for Report\u201d is the statement, \u201cThe main purpose of this report is to request a summons. As mentioned Ms. Cornish has now been convicted of a new drug related offense with <em>[sic </em>] occurred on 6/6/84.\u201d The Supervision Summary was never placed into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
