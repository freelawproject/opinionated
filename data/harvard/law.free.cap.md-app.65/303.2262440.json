He was sentenced to the jurisdiction of the Division of Correction for a period of five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>on the housebreaking charge, a consecutive term of four years on the theft charge, and a concurrent term of one year on the malicious destruction charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">At the trial, Mr. Gordon Rinehart testified that he was at home on February 20, 1984, at approximately 4:30 p.m., when he noticed appellant and another man alight from a blue Buick, place a rag over the rear license plate, and walk into the apartment building where he (Mr. Rinehart) resided. A short time later, Mr. Rinehart heard \u201ctwo loud booms\u201d and went back to the window. He advised the jury that he then \u201cwatched the defendant and a shorter individual come out of the apartment complex with James\u2019s (the victim, James Flood) 25-inch color TV set, put it in the back seat, jump in the automobile and speed off.\u201d Another neighbor, Mr. Jerome Cook, testified that he \u201cheard a big commotion\u201d and looked out his window. He observed two individuals, one of whom he identified as the appellant, carrying a television and placing it in a blue Buick before it sped off. Mr. Cook further stated this his neighbor\u2019s apartment (Mr. Flood\u2019s) appeared to have been ransacked and left in disarray. He explained that \u201cyou could see where the TV was missing at because he had cable hooked up to it and they broke the cord off of that to get the TV set.\u201d Without objection, both Mr. Rinehart and Mr. Cook positively identified the appellant as one of the individuals involved in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The victim, Mr. James Flood, testified that the door to his apartment had been pried open and the lock seat splintered off. He found his apartment to have been ransacked and his color television set, which he valued at approximately $420, missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Prior to the sentencing, the trial court granted a new trial on the grounds that on discovery the State had failed to disclose a statement the appellant had made to the victim. Four and one-half months later, still prior to sentencing, the trial court rescinded its order granting a new trial. The basis of the reconsideration was the holding in <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 481 A.2d 201 (1984). The Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>therein that \u201cthe State is not required to produce a copy of a statement by the defendant unless it was made to a State agent and is one which the State intends to use at a hearing or trial.\u201d 300 Md. at 733, 481 A.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We are asked to review the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">1. Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to rescind its order granting a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">2. Whether the court erred in allowing the owner of a stolen television set to testify as to its value without first laying a foundation as to his knowledge of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">3. Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">4. Whether the trial judge erred in failing to merge malicious destruction of property with that of the breaking and entering charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">5. Whether a court reporter failed to transcribe portions of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">I. <em>Revocation of New Trial Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Appellant contends that the trial judge lacked power to revise his new trial order. The State argues, as the court below decided, that the court had power to revoke its new trial order, and that such authority was confirmed in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>25 Md.App. 338, 333 A.2d 653 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">In <em>Williamson, </em>the defense counsel had argued for a new trial on the basis that a judgment of acquittal should have been granted. The trial judge became somewhat upset when a newly assigned assistant state\u2019s attorney was unprepared to discuss the matter. Apparently, the prosecutor who had actually tried the case was no longer with the office. The judge thereupon declared that \u201cI will grant your motion for a new trial____\u201d After the State strongly protested, the judge acquiesced and allowed a two-day continuance on the motion. At the hearing, the judge determined not to grant a new trial and proceeded to impose sentence. Williamson thereupon appealed and contended that the judge had improperly revised his new trial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In considering that set of facts, we purposefully refrained from making a broad declaration of the revisory power of courts over new trial orders. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">Appellant acknowledges that the majority of jurisdictions permit reconsideration of the grant of a motion for new trial, 24 C.J.S., <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 1510, 58 Am.Jur.2d, <em>New Trial, </em>\u00a7 217, but argues that the Maryland rule should be that once the motion is granted, reconsideration is prohibited. Although there may be situations where reconsideration of the grant or denial of a new trial is arguably inappropriate, the present case is clearly not such a situation. Sentencing had not taken place, thus judgment had not been entered. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 333 A.2d 653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiN\">On the basis of the trial judge\u2019s actions and expressions in <em>Williamson, </em>we interpreted his original declaration as a mere expression of future intention to grant the motion, rather than a present order. Writing on our behalf, Judge Lowe observed: \u201cEven if the motion had been granted, the reversal of that decision was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion under the circumstances indicated. Annot., 145 A.L.R. 400.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We hold that in a criminal matter, whenever there is a conviction, there is no final judgment until sentencing, and that prior thereto, a judge may reconsider his order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">II. <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">A. <em>Owner\u2019s Testimony as to Value</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">Appellant next contends that the trial judge should not have admitted the owner\u2019s valuation of the stolen property. He avers that the State failed to establish a sufficient foundation to qualify the owner to express such an opinion. Specifically, the owner of the property testified that the television set had a value of approximately $420.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">It is well settled in this State that an owner of personal property in common use may express an opinion as to its value without qualification as an expert____ The rule applies in criminal as well as civil cases. <em>Jewell v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>216 Md. 110, 112 [139 A.2d 707] (1958); <em>Shipley v. State, </em>220 Md. 463, 466 [154 A.2d 708] (1959); <em>Benton v. State, </em>228 Md. 309, 311 [179 A.2d 718] (1962). The rule is almost universally recognized. <em>See </em>Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>(5th ed.) \u00a7 603, p. 1474; Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed.) \u00a7 176; 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>(12th ed.) \u00a7 550. The cases are collected in an exhaustive note, 37 A.L.R.2d 967. Wigmore, in an often quoted passage, seems to take the position that an owner is qualified <em>per se </em>and that any lack of knowlege goes only to the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>Barber v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 655, 657, 329 A.2d 760, <em>cert. denied </em>274 Md. 725 (1974), quoting from <em>Cofflin v. State, </em>230 Md. 139, 142, 186 A.2d 216 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Within <em>Barber, supra, </em>we further discussed modifications of these rules. Specifically, in quoting from <em>3 Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 716 (1970), we noted that \u201cthe general test, that <em>any one familiar </em>with the values in question may testify, is liberally applied, and with few attempts to lay down detailed minor tests.\u201d 23 Md.App. at 658, 329 A.2d 760 (emphasis supplied). The jury was thus free to find the value of the television set to be as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">We hold that Mr. Flood, the owner of the television set, could properly testify as to its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">B. <em>Merger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Appellant next claims that the trial judge improperly failed to merge the malicious destruction charge with that of breaking and entering. As appellant correctly notes, \u201cIf each offense required proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and do not merge.\u201d <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 268, 373 A.2d 262 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">We need go no further than an examination of the first element, the required intent, to distinguish the offenses. Malicious destruction requires proof that the accused had a specific intent to destroy, injure, deface or molest the real or personal property of another. The crime of breaking and entering requires proof of the accused\u2019s specific intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>break and enter the dwelling house of another. Clearly, the intent to break and enter is different from an intent to destroy, injure, deface or molest the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">C. <em>The Jury\u2019s Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant further avers that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of conviction. Specifically, he contends that, because one of the State\u2019s witnesses observed three perpetrators and the other saw only two, the evidence lacked probative force. Such a determination, however, is a matter within the sole province of the jury. The conflicting testimony was a factual issue for the jury to weigh. <em>McLaughlin v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 515, 526, 240 A.2d 298 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">D. <em>Transcribing Discrepancies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Finally, appellant alleges that the court reporter failed to transcribe portions of the record. We are unable to discern any deficiencies in the record as alleged. The record appears complete. At worst, any such failure would appear to be harmless error. <em>See, e.g., Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
