The theft conviction was merged with the robbery conviction, and appellant was sentenced to three concurrent terms of nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Appellant raises three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">I. Was the accomplice\u2019s testimony sufficiently corroborated by evidence of an extrajudicial identification?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, assault with intent to rob, and a handgun violation?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">III. May an accused be convicted of unlawfully wearing a handgun when the uncontradicted testimony showed that the accused possessed only a BB gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">At approximately 6:30 p.m. on February 28, 1984, two men entered a Baskins Robbins ice cream store and demanded and obtained money from employees Susan Bowersox and a co-worker. One of the men, later identified as appellant, lifted his shirt to reveal what Bowersox said was the \u201cwooden handle to a hand pistol\u201d but she did not know what kind. The night of the robbery, Bowersox assisted police in creating a composite drawing of one of the men. Approximately one and a half months later, at the request of the police, she reviewed a photograph array and identified a photograph of the appellant as one of the men who robbed her. In connection with the identification, she gave a summary statement in which she stated she was \u201csixty percent sure\u201d that the individual in the photograph was the same person who, during the robbery, displayed the handle of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Bowersox testified why she said she was \u201csixty percent sure\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Why I chose sixty percent? I chose sixty percent because I don\u2019t want to be a witness in front of a Court. To my belief, that is the guy that robbed me and, yes, I am more sure than sixty percent. No, I don\u2019t want to be doing this and that\u2019s why I put sixty percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Antonio Grant, a State\u2019s witness who had pled guilty to participation in the robbery, made an in-court identification of appellant. He also testified that the handle displayed by appellant and seen by Bowersox was the butt of a BB gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The State produced several other witnesses including an individual who drove the getaway car, several police investigators, and the policeman who assisted Bowersox in the preparation of the composite drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Over objection, the State was permitted to recall Bowersox to the stand in order to have the composite drawing admitted into evidence. Thereafter, appellant was permitted to recall State\u2019s witness Officer Zelenka who testified that, during the robbery investigation, he had made a notation that the composite drawing looked like Leroy Johnson, the driver of the getaway car. Appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We will supply additional facts as they pertain to our discussions of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">\n<em>Corroboration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Appellant argues that the only corroboration of accomplice Grant\u2019s testimony was the \u201csixty percent sure\u201d extrajudicial identification of appellant by Bowersox and that this is not sufficient corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">A person may not be convicted of a crime on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. <em>Turner v. State, </em>294 Md. 640, 641-42, 452 A.2d 416, 417 (1982). <em>See also Brown v. State, </em>281 Md. 241, 378 A.2d 1104 (1977) (rejecting contention that the rule should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>abandoned). The Court set out the reasons for the rule in <em>Turner v. State, </em>294 Md. at 642, 452 A.2d at 417:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">Our cases have expressed two reasons for the necessity of this rule: (1) the witness offering the testimony is admittedly contaminated with guilt, <em>see, Watson v. State, supra, </em>208 Md. [210] at 217, 117 A.2d 549 [(1955)], and (2) the possibility of an ulterior motive on the part of the accomplice who seeks to curry favor with both the prosecutor and the police in the hope of obtaining a lesser sentence or a reduced charge. <em>See, Luery v. State, supra, </em>116 Md. [284] at 293, 81 A. 681 [(1911)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 244, 378 A.2d at 1107, Chief Judge Murphy wrote for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">Not much in the way of evidence corroroborative of the accomplice\u2019s testimony has been required by our cases. We have, however, consistently held the view that while the corroborative evidence need not be sufficient in itself to convict, it must relate to material facts tending either (1) to identify the accused with the perpetrators of the crime or (2) to show the participation of the accused in the crime itself. <em>See Wright v. State, </em>219 Md. 643, 150 A.2d 733 (1959). If with some degree of cogency the corroborative evidence tends to establish either of these matters, the trier of fact may credit the accomplice\u2019s testimony even with respect to matters as to which no corroboration was adduced. <em>McDowell v. State, </em>231 Md. 205, 189 A.2d 611 (1963). That corroboration need not extend to every detail and indeed may even be circumstantial is also settled by our cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Moreover, in <em>Turner, </em>294 Md. at 642, 452 A.2d at 417, the Court stated that while \u201cthe rule requiring corroboration presumes that the accomplice\u2019s testimony, by itself, is untrustworthy[,] ... as a safeguard against depriving the fact finder of evidence from a source intimately connected with the crime, we have said that only <em>slight </em>corroboration is required.\u201d (emphasis supplied). The <em>Turner </em>Court then went on to quote the above from <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Appellant attempts to convince us that <em>Brown\u2019s </em>\u201csome degree of cogency\u201d and <em>Turner\u2019s </em>\u201cslight corroboration\u201d tests translate into a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard for the evidence necessary to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice. At least 14 times since <em>Brown </em>in 1977, appellate courts of this State have applied the foregoing standards and not a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in weighing the sufficiency of evidence corroborative of accomplice testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Appellant\u2019s \u201ccogency\u201d argument, based on a dictionary definition of the word as the quality of being \u201cforceful and to the point, as a reason or agreement; compelling; convincing,\u201d completely overlooks the context in which the word is used in <em>Brown. </em>First, \u201cnot much in the way of evidence\u201d is required; second, the evidence must \u201ctend to establish\u201d certain material facts with \u201csome degree of cogency\u201d which <em>Turner </em>interprets to require only \u201cslight corroboration.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 244, 378 A.2d at 1107; <em>Turner, </em>294 Md. at 642, 452 A.2d at 417. We, therefore, find that the test for weighing the sufficiency of evidence to corroborate accomplice testimony is the \u201csome degree of cogency\u201d standard set forth in <em>Brown </em>and construed by <em>Turner </em>to require only \u201cslight\u201d corroboration. 294 Md. at 642-43, 452 A.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We hold that the Bowersox identification was more than sufficient to meet this test for the corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\n<em>Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Appellant argues that assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the corroborative evidence was sufficient to substantiate the accomplice testimony, the evidence as a whole was insufficient to form the basis for a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">In <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 109-10, 472 A.2d 953, 964, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984) the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">When this Court is required to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, we follow the standard enunciated in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). <em>Tichnell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>State, </em>287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). The critical inquiry on review is to \u201cdetermine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.S. at 318, 99 S.Ct. at 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573. However, the Court is not required to \u201c \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citations omitted]. Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Based on our review of the record, in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and assault with intent to rob; however, we reverse the handgun conviction based on the following reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\n<em>The 1SB Gun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Although we are convinced that the victims believed appellant had a handgun in his possession at the time of the robbery, the evidence, nevertheless, supports the conclusion that the weapon was in fact a BB gun which we hold is not a handgun within the meaning of Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 36F(a) (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) We must, therefore, reverse appellant\u2019s conviction under art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">A BB gun is defined as \u201ca smooth-bore air gun actuated by a spring-loaded plunger that upon release from the cocked position compresses the air behind the pellet and propels it from the tube \u2014 compare air rifle 1.\u201d Air rifle is defined as \u201c1: a rifle from which a projectile is propelled by air or carbon dioxide compressed usually by a lever and pump system 2: BB gun.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971) at 189 and 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In <em>Douglas v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 557, 378 A.2d 189 (1977) this Court held that a CO2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pellet gun having the appearance of a pistol was not a handgun within the meaning of Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b) (1976 Repl.Vol.). 37 Md. App. at 558, 378 A.2d at 190. We specifically overruled <em>Todd v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 127, 343 A.2d 890 (1975) which held that a CO2.22 caliber pellet gun was a handgun within the meaning of the statute. <em>Douglas, </em>37 Md.App. at 558-59, 378 A.2d at 190. Relying on <em>Howell v. State, </em>278 Md. 389, 364 A.2d 797 (1976), we pointed out in <em>Douglas </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgJ\">the Court of Appeals stated the following rule as to what constitutes a handgun within the meaning of the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8_\">\u201c... [F]or this device to be a handgun it must be a firearm or it must be readily or easily convertible into a firearm. We further conclude that to be a firearm it must propel a missle by gunpowder or some such similar explosive____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">37 Md.App. at 558, 378 A.2d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In <em>Douglas, </em>we found no evidence that CO2 was an explosive similar to gunpowder or that the weapon was easily convertible into a firearm and we reversed the conviction for carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the evidence supports the conclusion that appellant carried a BB gun in the commission of the robbery. A BB gun uses compressed air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>to propel its missle, much the same as compressed C02 is used in a pellet gun. We reverse because there is nothing in the record to show either that the BB gun was easily convertible into a firearm or that compressed air constitutes an explosive similar to gunpowder. <em>Douglas, </em>37 Md.App. at 559, 378 A.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We hasten to add that our reversal of the conviction for the handgun violation does not affect appellant\u2019s conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. \u201cIt is not necessary that a gun be capable of discharging a lethal bullet to be a deadly weapon. Intimidation produced by the use of a weapon coupled with the apparent ability to execute the implied threat to use the weapon if resistance is offered, are sufficient.\u201d <em>Crum and Dunbar v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 132, 134, 227 A.2d 766, 767 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>246 Md. 755 (1967) (.22 caliber gas starter pistol incapable of firing a bullet was sufficient to support robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.) <em>See also, Claybrooks v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 295, 314-15, 374 A.2d 365, 375-76 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 735 (1977) (four or five inches of a gun barrel visible under the assailant\u2019s shirt when he accosted the victims, accompanied by an aggressive entry into their vehicle while commanding \u201cget over\u201d was sufficient to constitute the offense of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Bowersox, one of the victims, testified that appellant told her \u201cI\u2019m totally serious this is for real, I want everything given to me now.\u201d He then lifted his shirt to show the handle of a gun tucked into his pants and said \u201cDon\u2019t set off any alarms.\u201d After giving appellant the money from the cash register the victims followed appellant\u2019s instructions and got down on the floor. Bowersox testified that although she did not know what kind of a gun it was, she was \u201cscared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">This evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that the victim was intimidated by the weapon and complied with appellant\u2019s requests out of fear that he could and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>would use it if she failed to perform, and therefore, supports appellant\u2019s conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. The fact that the weapon used in the commission of the robbery was not a handgun within the purview of art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d) is thus irrelevant to appellant\u2019s conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">JUDGMENTS AS TO COUNTS I, IV AND VI AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT UNDER COUNT VII REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID TWO-THIRDS BY APPELLANT AND ONE-THIRD BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. <em>Turner v.
