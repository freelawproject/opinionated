The Commission denied the application, an action affirmed when Doctors\u2019 Hospital appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Doctors\u2019 Hospital now appeals to us raising, as we see it, four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">1. Whether the Commission\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">2. Whether the Commission imposed an illegal moratorium on the issuance of CONs and miscounted bed need;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">3. Whether the Commission arbitrarily discriminated against Doctors\u2019 Hospital; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>4. Whether the Commission engaged in \u201creview by ambush.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court. Before explaining our reasons for doing so, we summarize the regulatory and factual context within which the issues are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Regulatory and Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In an attempt to stem the rising tide of health care costs across the country, Congress passed the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300k et seq. (1982). This law provided financial incentives for each state to implement its own health plan and fashion the necessary administrative and regulatory machinery. The Act encouraged states to look at the problems of costly maldistribution and excess supply of certain health services and facilities, including hospital beds. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300k-2(a)(12), (b)(1) (1982) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.201 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Maryland\u2019s statutory effort at health care regulation can be found in Md. Health-General Code Ann. \u00a7 19-101 et seq. (1982 &amp; Cum.Supp.1985). This legislation provides for a systematic, statewide approach to the planning and development of new health care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">As a general rule, a health care facility (including a hospital) that desires to increase its bed capacity must first obtain a CON from the Commission. Health-General Art. \u00a7 19-115(h). The Commission must make certain that its decisions on CON applications are consistent with the State health plan as provided for by \u00a7 19-114, and with the COMAR regulation outlining the Commission\u2019s own review criteria.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-118(c)(l). Also relevant to this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the Commission was obligated to consider. COMAR 10.24.01.-06B(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The Commission found that Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s CON application was consistent with all pertinent standards in the State health plan that were not included in the Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan. Thus the field of conflict is narrowed to two documents: the health systems plan and the COMAR list of criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">At the times pertinent to this case, the applicable Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan identified \u201ca bed need projection for Prince George\u2019s County of 37 additional medical/ surgical beds for 1987.\u201d It also provided that \u201cadditional beds should be certified in Prince George\u2019s County only after ... the above analysis has been completed.\u201d The \u201canalysis\u201d referred to was a study to determine \u201cwhere any additional beds [in Prince George\u2019s County] could be located.\u201d The study had not been completed when the Commission denied the instant application, although it had been finished by the time this case reached the circuit court. In addition to the 37-bed projection for the Southern Maryland service area, referred to as the availability standard, the Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan contained other area-wide standards with which a CON applicant had to prove itself compatible. Two pertained to the accessibility of medical/surgical units to the majority of the area\u2019s population (the accessibility standard) and the overall occupancy rate of units in the area (the cost standard). The Commission found that appellant had failed to meet the availability standard and that the CON project was not necessary for the Southern Maryland area to satisfy the accessibility and cost standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The second set of regulations pertinent to this case is that which the Commission promulgated in accordance with \u00a7 19-115(c) and which is found at COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2). Listed are some 13 criteria that must be considered before a CON is granted. The Commission found that appellant\u2019s application was inconsistent with seven. These concerned the relationship of the project to the applicable health systems plan; the need for the proposed health service of the population to be served, including the elderly (need criterion); the availability of less costly or more effective alternative methods of providing the proposed health services; the immediate and long-term financial feasibility of the proposal (feasibility criterion); the proposal\u2019s relationship to the existing health care system; the relationship to ancillary or support services; and the proposal\u2019s contribution in meeting the health needs of the medically underserved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Appellant\u2019s failures to meet the health systems plan standards and the COMAR criteria collectively brought into dispute the four issues before us and a host of subsidiary questions that will be discussed in their proper places.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The procedural history of this case can be sketched as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On September 30, 1982, the Commission received Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application for a CON for 100 additional beds. The application was formally docketed on December 6, 1982.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At various subsequent times the number of beds requested was reduced to 63, then to 53, and then (it seems) to 37; that, at least, is how the Commission viewed the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It appears that the Commission wished to \u201cbatch\u201d Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application with one or more other requests for additional hospital beds in Prince George\u2019s County, so it could review all of the applications together. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-118(e). For whatever reasons, that procedure was not acceptable to Doctors\u2019 Hospital. The Commission had not acted on the application within the period prescribed by law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Hospital sought relief in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Baltimore City.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On July 14, 1983, that court ordered the Commission \u201cto act without delay\u201d on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Pursuant to this judicial mandate, the Commission staff on August 5, 1983, filed a report in the form of \u201cProposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.\u201d Consistent with all information the Commission had received from outside sources, and with the staffs view of the State health plan and the relevant criteria, the report recommended denial of a CON. Doctors\u2019 Hospital submitted a lengthy response to these recommendations, and addressed the Commission briefly at a public meeting, although it did not request the full evidentiary hearing authorized by \u00a7 19-118(f). Its efforts were to no avail; on September 27, 1983, the Commission adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law to the effect that Doctors\u2019 Hospital had failed to meet the requirements in seven different areas. It passed an order rejecting the application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we have seen, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Hammerman, J.) affirmed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Our power to review the decision of the Commission, a State executive branch agency, emanates from the Administrative Procedure Act, which in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">(2) affirm the decision of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Code, State Govt. Article, \u00a7 10-215(g) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The assignments of error in these cases concern both factual findings and legal determinations of the Commission. Our scope of review shifts accordingly. When deciding whether any factual finding is in violation of \u00a7 10-215(g), Maryland courts have used the substantial evidence test. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Hospital v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>302 Md. 193, 486 A.2d 744 (1985) and <em>Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Crowder, </em>43 Md.App. 276, 405 A.2d 279, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 745 (1979). Under this test, our judicial review is narrow in scope and the decision of the administrative agency carries a presumption of validity. We must examine all inferences and factual conclusions drawn by the agency to make sure that they reasonably follow from facts. We must also examine all facts found by an agency to insure that there was evidence to support them. We may not, however, reweigh the evidence or reject any reasonable or supportable inference, fact or factual conclusion merely because conflicting or questionable evidence exists. <em>See Crowder, </em>43 Md.App. at 280-82, 405 A.2d 279. This, then, is the scope of review to be used for Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Much broader, however, is the scope of review to be used for Issues 2, 3, and 4. No factual findings made by the Commission are disputed here; rather the legal principles that it espoused come under challenge. Conclusions of law made by an agency are not presumptively favored, as illegal acts are not based on substantial evidence and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>be corrected. <em>See Snowden v. Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 168 A.2d 390 (1961). The appropriate standard of review is \u201csubstitution of judgment.\u201d <em>See Comptroller of the Treasury v. Shell Oil Co., </em>65 Md.App. 252, 500 A.2d 315, 318 (1985) and cases cited therein (review of Tax Court decision). If we have a view as to the applicable legal principle that is different from that of the Commission and the trial judge, we are duty-bound to make the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">\n<em>The Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">1. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We are cognizant of these well-established principles concerning scope of review and with them in mind proceed to examine the hospital\u2019s \u201csubstantiality\u201d arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">a. The \u201cAccessibility\u201d and \u201cCost\u201d Standards of the Health Systems Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">On two of them we need not pause long. The Commission concedes that the hospital met the \u201caccessibility\u201d and the \u201ccost\u201d standards.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This concession, however, does not mandate reversal. As the hospital has admitted, its burden was to demonstrate compliance with <em>all </em>the standards and criteria. If, therefore, there is substantial evidence to support <em>any one </em>of the Commission\u2019s findings, we must affirm. <em>Cf. Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978) (where inconsistent inferences from same evidence can be drawn, it is for agency to draw the inferences). As we shall see, the Commission\u2019s order readily passes this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">b. The Need Criterion: COMAR 10.24.01.06(B)(2)(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The need criterion states that the Commission should consider \u201c[t]he need for the proposed health services of the population served or to be served, including an analysis of present and future utilization and demographic patterns ____\u201d This is what the Commission considered. Doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tors\u2019 Hospital objects that the Commission paid too much attention to present utilization factors. It argues that the Commission\u2019s role merely is to lay the groundwork for determining future need \u2014 in this case 37 beds \u2014 and then drop out of the analysis once that number is fixed. This reading, however, is not supported by the plain words of the regulation; nothing in COMAR directs how much or how little weight the Commission must give to present utilization. Further, under the hospital\u2019s interpretation, the words \u201cpresent ... utilization\u201d become surplusage because such an analysis perforce would be incorporated in an analysis of future utilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Moreover, the Commission is responsible for promoting an entire health care system in which the efficiency and appropriateness of existing facilities must be considered. <em>See </em>Code, Health-General Art. \u00a7 19-102 and COMAR 10.24.-01.06F(l)(a)(i). Among the conclusions in the health systems plan applicable to Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s CON application was that \u201c[B]eds should not be located in areas with underutilized or unused hospital capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Thus, the Commission exercised proper discretion in weighing present utilization factors, including Doctors\u2019 high length of stay rate and the present unused capacity in other facilities in the Southern Maryland area. It found that four of them in 1982 operated at below the 85% medical/surgical occupancy rate set as the minimal standard by the health systems plan. These facts and others made the proposed expansion unjustified in the mind of the Commission. A more attractive alternative, it stated, would be to increase the utilization of the other facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The Commission also sifted through other data, including some concerning the service needs of Prince George\u2019s County residents over 65. If we understand appellant correctly, it argues that the mere fact that it is located in an area with a high elderly population is sufficient to satisfy this component of the need criterion. But as the Commission pointed out in its decision, Doctors\u2019 Hospital serves a much smaller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>percentage of patient days generated by elderly residents than do surrounding facilities, and the proposed additional beds are not geared specifically to the needs of the elderly. Moreover, there was evidence before the Commission showing that Prince George\u2019s General Hospital could better serve the elderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In sum, the Commission properly weighed both present and future utilization factors in its need analysis. Substantial evidence supported its conclusion that the need criterion was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">c. The Less Costly Alternatives and Relationship to Existing Health Care Systems Criteria: COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(d) and (f)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding these two criteria are merely reprises of the debate concerning need. Doctors\u2019 Hospital avers that because the health systems plan declares a 37-bed need in Prince George\u2019s County, Doctors\u2019 automatically meets these two criteria. This analysis obscures the fact that COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(d) and (f) are criteria independent of the need criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The interpretation placed on (d) and (f) by Doctors\u2019 Hospital would render them superfluous. Another jurisdiction has held that a showing of need for a number of beds is insufficient in itself for issuance of a CON; a showing that the proposal is consonant with the State health plan is also necessary. <em>Princeton Community Hospital v. State Health Planning, </em>328 S.E.2d 164 (W.Va.1985); <em>cf. Irvington General Hospital v. Department of Health, </em>149 N.J. Super. 461, 374 A.2d 49 (1977) (CON request for additional beds cannot properly be rejected solely on the basis of bed need statistics).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The Commission\u2019s finding that increasing utilization at existing facilities would be a less costly alternative was based on a staff report and comments at a public meeting. The Commission learned that two neighbors of Doctors\u2019 Hospital, the 152-bed Greater Laurel Beltsville Hospital and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the 340-bed Prince George\u2019s General Hospital had the low occupancy rates of 60% and 78% respectively. The daily room rates of both these facilities, the Commission found, were about $50 below that of Doctors\u2019 Hospital. In addition, the Commission noted that Doctors\u2019 Hospital failed to provide data to demonstrate its future relationship to the health care delivery system. There is substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that the criterion was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">d. The Financial Feasibility Criterion: COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We will elsewhere dispose of Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s argument that the Commission\u2019s review of this criterion was flawed by \u201creview by ambush\u201d and that it engaged in disparate treatment of appellant in this regard. The only remaining contention appellant raises in this category is that there was no substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s vague offer to provide investor funding if necessary because appellant\u2019s statement in that regard was \u201cuncontradicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital argues that the Commission was required by law to believe the unrebutted statement by Doctors\u2019 Hospital that if necessary, individual investors would raise the cash necessary to finance the project. Doctors\u2019 Hospital cites <em>Blackmer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>70 F.2d 255 (2d Cir.1934) to support its assertion, but <em>Blackmer </em>states that unchallenged testimony may not be arbitrarily disregarded so far as it is <em>factual. </em>A fact is a \u201cthing done; an action performed or an incident transpiring; an event or circumstance, an actual occurrence.\u201d <em>Bonner v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 518, 524, 406 A.2d 646 (1979) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 531 (5th ed. 1979)). The statement that investors will contribute to the project, of course, is a projection. Projections are not factual. Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s projection is not rebutted, but statements foretelling the future can rarely be rebutted conclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>A better rule for our purposes as to the probative value of this unchallenged testimony is found in 5 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 29:26 at 456 (2d ed.1984). Surveying the current law, Davis concludes: \u201cUncontradicted evidence may be rejected for adequate reasons that are sufficiently explained.\u201d The Commission pointed out that Doctors\u2019 assertion was unsupported by descriptions of the availability or the costs of funds provided through the hypothetical investors. Judge Hammerman also noted that the identity of the investors and the sources of their funds were left open to question. We believe that in this situation the bald projection stated by Doctors\u2019 Hospital could reasonably be seen as lacking credibility. It need not be deemed conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Moreover, the Commission staff reviewed Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s financial statements and operating projections. That review produced evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that the proposed equity funding by savings accrued through increases in patient rates would result in unreasonably high costs to the entire health care system.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">e. The Ancillary Services Criterion: COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(h)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Code, State Government Article 10-208(h) states that an agency \u201cmay use its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of evidence.\u201d On this issue, the agency used those skills to find that Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application was deficient in describing both its proposed volume changes in ancillary services and the effect its project would have upon community ancillary services. A review of Doctors\u2019 application and its response to the Commission\u2019s staff report shows that the Commission\u2019s decision on this issue was a reasonable one. Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s discussion of these topics consists of hardly more than a few conclusory statements. For example, Doctors\u2019 Hospital declared that although its requested 53-bed addition would require more space and more personnel, the space allotment for ancillary services would not increase \u201cbecause we are dealing in volume changes rather than in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>changes which require additional space such as new equipment or new services.\u201d But exactly how these increases would be absorbed without increasing storage space was not explained. Additionally, nowhere did Doctors\u2019 discuss the impact upon support services in the surrounding community. The cursory treatment Doctors\u2019 Hospital gave this criterion is substantial evidence that supports the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">f. The Medically Underserved Criterion: COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(m)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">This criterion addresses the question of how well the proposed project will meet the health related needs of groups who historically have been medically underserved, including poor people, minority groups and the handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s argument that it never has refused admission on account of inability to pay may be a necessary factor in satisfying this requirement, but we think the Commission was correct in finding that this alone was insufficient. The State health plan and COMAR 10.24.01.-06B(2)(m) strongly imply that health care facilities are expected by the State to assume substantial responsibility for their communities. An affirmative duty to act is involved here. This means that the Commission was obliged to inquire not only about the number of medically underserved being refused treatment at Doctors\u2019 Hospital but also about how many of them were being treated there. The question, then, before the Commission was this: What effort was Doctors\u2019 Hospital making in meeting the needs of the underserved in its community, and would that effort be strengthened by its proposed project? Medicaid, charity and bad debt statistics are valuable data for answering this question, especially when they are compared with those from comparable facilities. In such a comparison, Doctors\u2019 Hospital fares poorly.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">For example, even though during the time pertinent to this case, Southern Maryland Hospital Center treated only those Medicaid patients that it deemed could not safely be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>transported to other hospitals (a policy criticized by the Commission during Southern Maryland\u2019s own CON review), its Medicaid patient revenue percentage was more \u2022 than twice as much as that for Doctors\u2019 Hospital. Additionally, Southern Maryland\u2019s bad debt allowance was 4.3% and 3.8% of total patient services revenues in 1981 and 1982 respectively, while the figures for Doctors\u2019 Hospital were 2.2% and 2.9%. Moreover, the Commission heard a Bowie Health Center board member testify that nearly twice as many indigent, charity, and bad debt patients were served at Prince George\u2019s General Hospital and Medical Center than at Doctors\u2019 Hospital. A reasonable inference from these facts would be that while Doctors\u2019 Hospital does not refuse admission to any indigent patient, it does not have to do so \u2014 physicians achieve the desired result by steering indigents away from Doctors\u2019 Hospital in the first place and directing them to other facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Deliberating on this information, the Commission concluded that Doctors\u2019 Hospital has been laggard in doing its share to meet the needs of the medically underserved and that its proposed project would do nothing to change this behavior. This conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">2. <em>Illegal Moratorium</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Having dealt with the objections of Doctors\u2019 Hospital collected under the evidentiary issue, we now turn our attention to the issues dealing with the Commission\u2019s conclusions of law, keeping in mind that we proceed under the substitution of judgment standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">a. The Availability Standard of the Health Systems Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">As we have noted, one component of the State health plan considered by the Commission was the Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan. It was a provision of that plan that identified a need for 37 additional beds in Prince George\u2019s County by 1987. As we have also observed, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>health plan (incorporating the local health systems plan) contemplated that no additional beds be authorized in Prince George\u2019s County until the completion of a study (the subarea study) pertaining to the appropriate location of the additional beds. Location is an important factor. As the Commission pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">The [health systems plan] standard concerning availability of inpatient medical/surgical services states that inpatient medical/surgical services should be available in sufficient <em>but not excessive </em>quantities based on projected medical/surgical utilization and minimum occupancy rates [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The underlying concept here is that excessive, unused beds tend to drive up hospital costs. For that reason, additional beds should be approved only when there is a projected need for them and when they are placed in locations at which they will receive maximum use. To authorize additional beds, even though there is a projected need for them, would be counterproductive if the new beds would be placed in a location already well-served with available beds. Because of this location problem, the plan, although it foresaw the need for 37 additional beds, prohibited their authorization until the location study had been finished. Relying on this portion of the plan, the Commission found \u201cthat additional beds should not be certified until this analysis is completed____\u201d For that reason it further found that the availability standard (quoted above) had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">It is this that Doctors\u2019 Hospital says constituted an illegal moratorium that violated Article 9 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. That Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">That no power of suspending Laws or the execution of Laws, unless by, or derived from the Legislature, ought to be exercised, or allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">We perceive no illegal moratorium in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The Commission suspended no law; it suspended the execution of no law. It did not decline to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application; it gave it a reasoned and thorough review, albeit after some judicial prodding. It simply decided that it lacked some information \u2014 that dealing with bed location \u2014 necessary to the making of a favorable decision. The burden, of course, was on Doctors\u2019 Hospital to produce evidence sufficient to support the application. That it insisted on a Commission decision before critical information was available did not change the fact that it failed to supply the missing data. The Commission was entitled to consider that lack of data \u2014 a lack that was supplied shortly after its decision \u2014 in acting on the application. To await the receipt of necessary information is not to suspend a law or to impose an illegal moratorium, especially when the <em>onus </em>for supporting an application is on the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital argues that Ch. 102, Laws of Maryland 1985, demonstrates that legislation is required to justify this basis for the Commission\u2019s rejection of the application. That Act, emergency legislation approved by the Governor on April 9, 1985, prohibited the Commission from receiving or acting on any CON application (subject to certain exceptions) until October 1, 1985. Among the legislature\u2019s concerns were excess hospital capacity <em>(i.e., </em>too many beds) and the need to develop \u201can institution specific capacity plan in order to rationally address the reduction in hospital utilization and the resultant increase in excess capacity\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the need to obtain better information about, <em>inter alia, </em>the appropriate allocation of beds).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Chapter 102 does not support Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s contention. What it manifests is substantial legislative concern about the very matter that concerned the Commission \u2014 undesirable growth in bed capacity fostered by lack of hard information as to, <em>inter alia, </em>geographic (or institution specific) need for additional capacity. That the legislature took the rather drastic step of generally prohibiting the handling of CON applications during a specific period does not mean that the Commission could not, for similar rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>sons, decline to approve applications until the receipt of information from a pending study.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Our own research has unearthed one case in which a \u201cmoratorium\u201d imposed by an agency like the Commission was held to be arbitrary and capricious. In <em>United Hospital Center, Inc. v. Richardson, </em>328 S.E.2d 195 (W.Va.1985), the West Virginia Health Cost Review Agency received United\u2019s application for a CON for a Mobile Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit (MRI). The Agency then decided it would not conduct a preliminary completeness review of the application because the State health plan was silent as to MRI\u2019s and because it needed time to develop standards concerning them. The effect of this action was to prevent any further processing of United\u2019s application, since under West Virginia law, as under Maryland law, completeness review is a prerequisite to docketing and full review of an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Supreme Court of West Virginia held that the Agency was not authorized to abandon the statutory requirement that completeness of a CON application be determined within 15 days of its receipt. What is more significant, it held that the \u201cmoratorium\u201d was unnecessary because, on the record before the court, the Agency could have taken measures to obtain the information it needed after the completeness review and within the time allowed for consideration of the application on its merits. As a consequence, the \u201cmoratorium\u201d was arbitrary and capricious. The Agency was ordered to proceed with the processing of United\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>United Hospital Center </em>differs from the case before us in a number of respects. First, the Commission did not suspend all processing of the instant application; it accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>plished the preliminary completeness determination and it considered the application on its merits. Second, the record before us does not show that the Commission could have obtained the bed availability it needed during the review period. Third, the Commission denied Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application for a number of reasons, only one of which was the alleged \u201cmoratorium.\u201d Since, as we have held, those reasons were a sufficient basis for the denial, even if the \u201cmoratorium\u201d was arbitrary (and we do not think it was) the result would be unchanged. Although in <em>United Hospital Center </em>the arbitrariness could be remedied by a direction to process the application, that could not be done here. In short, <em>United Hospital Center </em>is not apposite, and for that reason, as well as the others we have explained, we hold that Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s \u201cillegal moratorium\u201d contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">b. \u201cPaper Beds\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Another error of law that Doctors\u2019 Hospital alleges was committed by the Commission concerned the method it adopted in arriving at the additional bed need projected for Prince George\u2019s County by 1987, the planning horizon in use at the time of its application. First, \u201cpaper beds,\u201d that is, beds that merely had been certified but not yet put into service, were added to beds in actual use. This sum was then subtracted from the total number of beds projected to be needed. This resulted in an additional bed need figure of 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital says this calculation was arbitrary and capricious. It argues it was unrealistic for the Commission to have counted 164 paper beds for which Bowie Health Center had acquired certification in 1974, along with beds in actual use, because of the small chance that they would ever be built. If we accept Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s contention, then the additional bed need would jump to 201, and the Hospital would have a strong argument that its entire 53-bed CON request (or even the original 100-bed request) should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The analysis of Doctors\u2019 Hospital overlooks the fact that paper beds were included in the bed inventory of the Southern Maryland Health Systems Plan. Indeed, the Commission adopted its analysis from the plan, which identified an additional need of 37 beds. The health systems plan is a factor that must be considered in a CON review, <em>see </em>CO-MAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(a). Appellee, Community Hospital &amp; Health Care Systems, Inc., also argues that the paper beds were specifically taken into account in the inventory of the State health plan, a charge Doctors\u2019 Hospital does not deny. Code, Health-General \u00a7 19-118(c)(1) mandates that except in emergencies all CON decisions be consistent with the State health plan. The Commission\u2019s analysis, then, was not in error. In fact, if the Commission had acted in the way Doctors\u2019 Hospital urges, one of two undesirable consequences could have resulted. On the one hand, such an action might arbitrarily have rendered Bowie\u2019s CON a nullity without affording Bowie a decertification hearing or any other form of due process. On the other hand, the act would have left the status of Bowie\u2019s CON unaffected, thus opening the door to area-wide overbedding if Bowie ever proceeded with its project.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">3. <em>Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In <em>Aspen Hill Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>265 Md. 303, 317, 289 A.2d 303 (1972), the Court of Appeals reversed a denial of rezoning because it was \u201cpatently arbitrary and discriminatory\u201d for the District Council to deny Aspen Hill\u2019s request for commercial rezoning when it had granted another applicant\u2019s such request \u201con basically the same evidence____\u201d <em>See also Whittle v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>211 Md. 36, 45, 125 A.2d 41 (1956) (\u201c[I]t would be arbitrary for the board to arrive at opposite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>conclusions on substantially the same state of facts and the same law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Interwoven throughout Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s brief are vark ous charges that the Commission arbitrarily discriminated against it and thus violated the strictures of these cases. Many of these complaints seem to be generated by general unhappiness, because on February 14, 1984, less than five months after rejecting Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application, the Commission granted Southern Maryland Hospital Center a conditional CON for 37 additional beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">At the outset, we observe that this action in and of itself falls far short of what <em>Aspen Hill </em>proscribes. <em>Aspen Hill </em>involved two properties, similarly situated, located within 1,500 feet of each other. It was under these circumstances that the Court of Appeals found arbitrary and discriminatory action when rezoning for one property was granted while it was denied for the other. The two requests, the Court noted, had been presented <em>\u201con </em>basically the same evidence____\u201d 265 Md. at 317, 289 A.2d 303. Here we have, it is true, two for-profit hospitals, both located in Prince George\u2019s County. But they are located miles apart, and we glean from the record that there are differences as to their proximity to other health facilities and as to other pertinent factors. We also note that in Southern Maryland\u2019s case, the long-awaited study (sometimes referred to as the subarea <em>study </em>\u2014 see discussion, pp. 674-675, <em>supra) </em>was available; it was not at hand while Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s application was under Commission review. But the fundamental problem with Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s contention is that we can make no determination that the evidence in this case was \u201cbasically the same\u201d as the evidence in that case. Southern Maryland went before the Commission with a full evidentiary hearing \u2014 a procedure that Doctors\u2019 Hospital eschewed. What evidence that hearing revealed we do not know, and thus we can make no general evidentiary comparisons between that case and this.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Turning to the specifics of Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s discrimination arguments, we are told, first, that it and Southern Maryland were treated disparately under the \u201caccessibility\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d standards applied by the Commission. In Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s case the Commission found that both standards were met \u201cwithout the addition of the [Doctors\u2019 Hospital] project.\u201d It denied the application. In Southern Maryland\u2019s case it found that the cost standard was met \u201cwithout the addition of the [Southern Maryland] project.\u201d It granted a conditional CON. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this shows disparate treatment, it is an issue we need not address. On appeal, the Commission concedes that Doctors\u2019 Hospital met the \u201caccessibility\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d standards. Because, as we have shown, there are other bases for upholding the Commission\u2019s decision in this case, its error in application of these standards is not a basis for reversal on the basis of disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">As to the \u201cneed\u201d criterion, Doctors\u2019 Hospital claims disparity because as it reads the record one reason for rejection of its application was the lack of <em>present </em>need for 37 additional beds, whereas in Southern Maryland\u2019s case, a basis for granting the CON was a <em>present </em>need for 37 additional beds. Doctors\u2019 Hospital misreads the Southern Maryland decision. The mention there of bed need was clearly tied to the 1987 forecast of the health systems plan. Moreover, in the Southern Maryland case, the Commission was focusing substantially on bed need in a particular area of Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 an area far removed from Doctors\u2019 Hospital \u2014 and on the problem of unused capacity as affected by geographical location and the proximity of other health care facilities. No arbitrary discrimination appears here, and for essentially the same reasons, we reject the claim that there was disparate treatment under the \u201cless costly alternatives\u201d criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital also claims that one reason for rejecting its application was its failure to address \u201cvolume changes in ancillary services.\u201d According to the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>sion\u2019s Southern Maryland decision, that hospital did not address this standard either, but instead of denying the CON, the Commission granted it subject to a condition that Southern Maryland supply additional information showing it met the criterion. Once again, we do not have the full Southern Maryland record. We cannot tell to what extent this subject may have been covered at the evidentiary hearing, or how the reduction of Southern Maryland\u2019s original request for 120 beds to a conditional CON for 37 beds may have affected the matter. But it does not seem unreasonable that an application found acceptable in many respects (unlike Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s) should be granted subject to a condition that it supply additional information in one respect. We see no improper discrimination here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Another charge of discrimination arises in connection with the \u201cfinancial feasibility\u201d criterion. Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s offer to fund its project through equity financing was rejected; an opposite result was reached in Southern Maryland\u2019s case. We. shall have more to say about this criterion when we consider the \u201creview by ambush\u201d contention and have already touched on it in our substantial evidence review. For present purposes, without access to the full record in the Southern Maryland case, we cannot say that the different results were arbitrarily discriminatory because, absent that information, we cannot say that they were based on \u201cbasically the same evidence.\u201d This is also true as to Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s assertion that improper disparity exists in the treatment of this criterion as between it and yet another hospital, Suburban Hospital Association. Whether equity funding is financially feasible depends on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the evidence before the tribunal making that decision in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital raises another and more general allegation of discrimination. It is that the Commission discriminates against for-profit hospitals because it thinks \u201cthat the way proprietary hospitals are reimbursed for their investments in hospital projects is unreasonable.\u201d There is nothing in the record to support this indictment, unless it be a table showing the outcome of CON applications from 1973 through 1983. Doctors\u2019 Hospital says this table shows that with the exception of the Southern Maryland application we have discussed, \u201cevery single application by a for-profit hospital had been disapproved\u201d while \u201cevery application for more beds by a non-profit hospital was approved.\u201d Even assuming that this characterization of the information portrayed in the table is correct, this table is not helpful to Doctors\u2019 Hospital. We are given a sparse listing of outcomes; we know nothing about factors that may have affected those outcomes and rendered each of them perfectly appropriate. Once again, we cannot conclude arbitrary discrimination because we cannot say that all these cases were decided on \u201cbasically the same evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In summary, we reject Doctors\u2019 Hospital\u2019s discrimination contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">4. <em>\u201cReview by Ambush </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Although Doctors\u2019 Hospital has charged \u201creview by ambush\u201d in several contexts, its principal argument under that heading is directed to application of the \u201cfinancial feasibility\u201d criterion. Why the contention is without merit in that context demonstrates its general unpersuasiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">In its CON application, the hospital proposed various ways of funding the construction and equipment acquisitions required in connection with the additional beds. The estimated capital outlay was over three million dollars. It said that, if necessary, its present investors would contribute to the project. The Commission found that \u201cadequate equity funds for this project are not available if only limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>to future operational savings\u201d and that \u201cthe Hospital\u2019s liquid assets, alone, or in combination with operating surpluses, are not adequate to support a project of this scope.\u201d It further found that with respect to \u201cthe applicant\u2019s statement that, if necessary, the Hospital\u2019s present investors will contribute to the project ... neither the availability nor the costs of funds provided through such investors has been described.\u201d The Commission concluded that \u201cthe criterion at COMAR 10.24.01.06B(2)(e) is not met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Doctors\u2019 Hospital says that in the administrative review process \u201c[t]he right to a hearing means the right to a meaningful hearing with the awareness of what must be countered,\u201d 2 Am.Jur.2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 417 (1962) and that a hearing should not be \u201cconducted on the level of a game of blindman\u2019s bluff,\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 397, 405, 75 S.Ct. 397, 99 L.Ed. 453 (1955). This is all very well, but the principles cited by the hospital have no bearing on the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Put aside the fact that the hospital itself declined to request a hearing at which it might have enlarged on its position as to contributions from investors. Put aside the fact that by virtue of the COMAR regulations the hospital was aware of what it had the burden of showing in order to obtain a CON. What remains is the fact that the initial staff recommendations to the Commission raised the very problem now under consideration. Doctors\u2019 Hospital, as we have seen, responded at length to that document. But it supplied no additional information on the subject of investors\u2019 contributions. There is no review by ambush here. The hospital was told that information it had supplied was in insufficient detail; it elected not to supply additional information. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Because we conclude that significant portions of the Commission\u2019s decision were supported by substantial evidence, and because we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>as to the existence of errors of law, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
