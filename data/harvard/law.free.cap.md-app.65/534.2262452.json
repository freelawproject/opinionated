BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The issue presented for decision on this appeal is whether an employee who parks in an area of a shopping center parking lot, which is neither owned, maintained nor controlled by her employer, and who is injured by the intentional acts of a third party, is entitled to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits? We hold that under the facts of this case, she is and, therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The facts are largely not in dispute. Muriel E. Harry-man, appellee, an employee of the May Department Stores Company, d/b/a the Hecht Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant, was injured when she was accosted by a mugger on a shopping center parking lot. The portion of the parking lot on which the mugging occurred was under the arcade, a covered portion of the parking lot surrounding the Golden Ring Mall where appellee had been parking for approximately two years. Moreover, it was across from the Hecht Company\u2019s employee entrance, through which the Hecht Company employees were required to enter for work. On this day, appellee arrived for her scheduled noon shift at approximately 11:45 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The Golden Ring Mall parking lot provided the only parking for the shopping center. Thus, employees of the Hecht Company and other businesses located in the mall parked their cars there while at work. Customers of the mall stores also used the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">At the hearing before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, testimony as to the ownership of the mall parking lot was presented by appellee. That evidence tended to prove that, although apparently part of the parking lot was jointly owned by Montgomery Ward, Hechts and the Golden Ring Management Company, the portion of the lot on which appellant was injured was owned solely by the Mall Management Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission determined that appellant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment. Upon Hecht\u2019s appeal, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and thereby affirmed the action of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Although on its appeal to this Court, Hecht\u2019s presented two questions, we need only consider the first:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT7\">Is ownership of a parking lot a material fact in a workmen\u2019s compensation claim filed by an employee who was assaulted in the parking lot?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">A motion for summary judgment is not a substitute for trial or a vehicle to decide disputed facts. <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Company, Inc., </em>291 Md. 241, 247, 434 A.2d 564 (1981), <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 304, 413 A.2d 170 (1980), <em>Sterry v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation, </em>64 Md.App. 175, 188, 494 A.2d 748 cert. granted 304 Md. 362, 499 A.2d 191 (1985). Rather, it permits the trial judge to determine if there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501; <em>Kletz v. Nuway Distributors, </em>62 Md.App. 158, 161, 488 A.2d 978 (1985); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rairigh, </em>59 Md.App. 305, 313, 475 A.2d 509 (1984). Even when there are no disputes of facts, but more than one inference may be drawn from the facts, such inferences being resolved against the moving party, summary judgment is inappropriate. <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Company, </em>285 Md. 216, 231, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979), <em>Fenwick Motor Company v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138, 265 A.2d 256 (1970). The function of appellate review of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment is to decide whether disputed issues of material fact exist, not to decide those issues or determine their credibility. <em>James v. Tyler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>269 Md. 48, 54, 304 A.2d 256 (1973), <em>Howard Cleaners v. Perman, </em>227 Md. 291, 296, 176 A.2d 235 (1961); <em>Sanitary Facilities, II, Inc. v. Blum, </em>22 Md.App. 90, 100, 322 A.2d 228 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Hecht\u2019s proffers that the evidence concerning the ownership of the mall parking lot, viewed in the light most favorable to appellee, gave rise to a genuine dispute as to a material fact. Therefore, it contends that appellee was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Ordinarily, an employee who sustains injuries going to or returning from his place of employment is not entitled to receive compensation under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md., 200, 206, 373 A.2d 613 (1977); <em>Kendall Lumber Co. v. State, </em>132 Md. 93, 100, 103 A. 141 (1918); <em>Miller v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>57 Md.App. 135, 138, 469 A.2d 466 (1984). Such injuries do not arise \u201cout of or in the course of\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> employment, <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d 613, because, as we said in <em>Miller v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., 57 </em>Md.App. at 138, 469 A.2d 466, \u201c[gjoing to or from work is not the same as being on the job____\u201d On the other hand, injury caused by the willful or negligent act of a third person directed against the employee, even though not arising out of employment, is compensable if the injury was sustained \u201cin the course of\u201d employment. Md. Code Ann. Art. 101, \u00a7 67(6),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 169, 225 A.2d 431 (1966). \u201cCourse of employment\u201d refers to the \u201ctime, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred.\u201d <em>Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Miller, </em>23 Md.App. 271, 272, 326 A.2d 186 (1974). <em>See Proctor-Silex v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 480, 252 A.2d 800 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Thus, the rule is not absolute. The courts have fashioned several exceptions to this general rule, most notably, the \u201cproximity rule\u201d and the \u201cpremises rule.\u201d <em>Miller v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>57 Md.App. at 138, 469 A.2d 466. The \u201cproximity rule\u201d, a geographical extension of the \u201cpremises rule,\u201d applies to injuries which \u201coccur at a point where the employee is within range of dangers peculiarly associated with the employment,\u201d <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d 613, or where \u201cthe risks incurred by the employee [are] incidental to the employment and [are] annexed as an implied term\u201d of that employment. <em>Miller v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>57 Md.App. at 140, 469 A.2d 466, quoting <em>Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, </em>276 U.S. 154, 159, 48 S.Ct. 221, 222, 72 L.Ed. 507 (1928). On the other hand, an employee injured on the premises of the employer while going to or from his or her job may invoke the \u201cpremises exception.\u201d <em>Id., </em>57 Md.App. at 138, 469 A.2d 466. <em>See, Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d 613, <em>Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In ruling on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">There is no question in the Court\u2019s mind that the motion for summary judgment should be granted in the case. I don\u2019t think there is any dispute that the employee had, in fact, gone to that lot to park her car as she did everyday she had to go to work. <em>She was on the parking lot where she is normally permitted to park by the employers. She is on the employer\u2019s business from the moment she is on that lot, and she gets mugged as she is going from her car to her job. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>This ruling undoubtedly relied upon the \u201cpremises rule\u201d, the focus of the parties\u2019 arguments both below and in this Court. Consequently, we too will confine our analysis to the application of that rule<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the facts <em>sub judice. </em>That analysis necessarily involves determining what constitutes the \u201cpremises\u201d of the employer and considering when an employee is \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">An employee, when he \u201chas arrived on his employer\u2019s premises as usual, in preparation for beginning his day\u2019s work, is considered to be on the premises and therefore covered by workmen\u2019s compensation even though his actual employment has not begun,\u201d <em>Salomon v. Springfield Hosp., </em>250 Md. 150, 155, 242 A.2d 126 (1968). Such an employee may be said to be \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d \u201cPremises\u201d are broadly defined as including the entire area devoted by the employer to the industry with which the employee is associated and to include parking lots owned, controlled or maintained by the employer. 1 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 15.41, <em>Department of Correction v. Harris, </em>232 Md. 180, 186, 192 A.2d 479 (1963). Although recognizing that they do not necessarily include all property owned by the employer, <em>Salomon v. Springfield Hosp., </em>250 Md. at 155, 242 A.2d 126, premises have been held in Maryland to include parking lots owned, maintained or provided by employers. <em>Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. at 479, 252 A.2d 800; <em>Giant Food v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. at 162, 225 A.2d 431; <em>Smith v. General Motors Assembly Division, </em>18 Md.App. 478, 480, 307 A.2d 725 (1978) <em>Pappas v. Modern Mfg. Co., </em>14 Md.App. 529, 531, 287 A.2d 798 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In <em>Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, </em>an employee was injured when she slipped and fell on an icy sidewalk as she proceeded from the employer\u2019s leased parking lot to the plant in which she worked. The Court of Appeals, in finding that the employee\u2019s injuries were compensable, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Where ... the claimant had arrived on the premises of her employer and was proceeding without deviation of any kind directly to her work, it would be unreasonable to hold that injuries sustained by her on the parking lot or between the building entrance and the time clock would be compensable, but injuries sustained between the parking lot and the building entrance would not be compensable. Therefore, we hold the injuries sustained by Mrs. DeBrick to have arisen out of and in the course of her employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><em>Id., </em>253 Md. at 489, 252 A.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In <em>Giant Food v. Gooch, </em>an employee, a parking lot attendant, arrived early for work. Before starting work, but while on the employer owned parking lot, he was assaulted and shot by an individual who believed him to be the paramour of that individual\u2019s wife. Finding the injuries thus incurred to be compensable because arising in the course of employment, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">We think it clear that the commission and the reviewing court could have found that the injury occurred in the course of Gooch\u2019s employment. He was on the parking lot on which he regularly worked and was but minutes away from actually engaging in regular duties, when he was interrupted by Jones. \u201cAn employee is in the course of his employment where he is injured before the hour of work while on the premises for the purpose of engaging in the day\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Rice v. Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc., </em>186 Md. 561, 566, 48 A.2d 166 [1946]. <em>See also Maryland Paper Products Co. v. Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 139 A.2d 219 [1958].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\"><em>Id. </em>245 Md. at 162, 225 A.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\"><em>Pappas v. Modern Mfg. Co., </em>even though decided under the proximity rule, is helpful. There, the employer arranged with its landlord for the landlord to furnish a parking lot and for the employer to obtain first preference of spaces for its employees. The parking arrangement, including payment of the rental, was handled directly between the landlord and the employer. The employer re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>quired its employees to pay only a portion of the monthly rental for a space, the employer paying the balance. Those employees who opted to park on the parking lot were issued a sticker by the employer. Pappas had parked on the parking lot for six months before her injury. She was injured, while still on the parking lot, when she slipped on ice and fell, fracturing her arm. Disagreeing with the trial court\u2019s finding and reasoning that the employer did not have sufficient control over the parking lot to bring it within the proximity rule, this Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">It is apparent that since the employer had first preference to all spaces on the parking lot, he had control over who might or might not use the parking spaces. From the ... facts, we are of the opinion that the parking lot was, within the contemplation of the proximity rule, located on land under the control of the employer, on adjacent property with the express or implied consent of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><em>Id., </em>14 Md.App. at 535, 287 A.2d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Although it has not been so held by an appellate court of this state, 1 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 15.41 informs us that \u201cpremises\u201d, for purposes of the workmen\u2019s compensation law, may include parking lots which are not owned, controlled or maintained by the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">This rule is by no means confined to parking lots owned, controlled or maintained by the employer. The doctrine has been applied when the lot, although not owned by the employer, was exclusively used, or used with the owner\u2019s special permission, or just used by the employees of this employer,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFG\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">... if a shopping center parking lot is used by employees of businesses located in the center, the [\u201cpremises\u201d] rule is applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15.42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\"><em>Frishkorn v. Flowers, </em>26 Ohio App.2d 165, 270 N.E.2d 366 (1971) and <em>Berry v. Gertz, </em>21 A.D.2d 708, 249 N.Y.S.2d 285 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(S.Ct.1964), both cited in <em>Larson, </em>are instructive as well as persuasive on this latter point.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In <em>Frishkorn v. Flowers, </em>the claimant, a part-time employee, was injured when his motor bike was struck by a motor vehicle on the shopping center parking lot as he was proceeding to his employer\u2019s place of business, one of forty-three retail outlets in the shopping center. The employer had no control or ownership over the shopping center parking lot, which was provided for the convenience of the shoppers, employers and their employees. The Court noted that the \u201czone of employment\u201d concept, followed in Ohio, traditionally and necessarily implied actual ownership or control by an employer over that zone. Nevertheless, it recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">It would be impractical and illogical to apply this principle to a shopping plaza consisting of multiple independent businesses, each of which would have to be an owner in common with all the other tenants in order to share a nebulous control over its geographical confines and simulate a joint zone of employment. Such concept is too narrow and restrictive and is as outmoded as holding that an accident sustained by an employee going to or leaving work by means of an elevator or stairway in a building shared in common by different tenants, did not occur in the course of or arise out of the employment because the elevator or stairway was not part of the premises over which the employee\u2019s particular employer exercised any control at the time and place of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 368. Next, the Court observed that \u201c[t]he premises idea has been expanded by some courts to include areas of a common right of passage which are closely associated with the employer\u2019s premises to be considered in effect a part thereof, even where those areas are not owned, leased or in any way controlled by the employer\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 368-69 (citations omitted), and commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">In the instant case, the parking area was appellant\u2019s normal and customary means to and from his employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>premises to which such passageway was an indispensable appurtenance. In reality, the employer and the other tenants of the Great Northern Shopping Center, having reciprocal rental rights and privileges, were also accorded the common use and access of the parking area. Logically, to that extent, this was tantamount to an essential expansion of their respective premises for the purpose of adequately serving and furthering their business interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 869. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Although the parking area was not owned or controlled by Pick-n-Pay, the necessities of its business contemplated the use of such space by its employees and customers and required appellant to be where his accident occurred. He was injured while doing what he was normally expected to do \u2014 going to the premises to render service to his employer, in so doing, he was traversing a way so closely associated with the premises as to be part thereof, performing a \u201crequired duty done directly or incidentally in the service of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The claimant in <em>Berry v. Gertz </em>an employee of a department store located in a shopping center, was injured when she fell on the shopping center parking lot while alighting from her car. As in <em>Frishkorn, </em>her employer had no ownership interest or control over the parking lot. As in this case, the argument was made by the employer that since the parking lot was not owned, maintained or controlled by it, the injuries suffered were not compensable. The Court rejected this argument and affirmed the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, which had held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH0\">The parking facilities are open to use by the buying public and persons employed at the shopping center, and while it may be said that the parking facilities are primarily for the convenience of the shoppers, they are likewise a convenience to the employers and employees doing business at the shopping center. Its use by such employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ees furthered the interests of their respective employers and the accident having occurred within the parking area, it is the opinion of the Board that the occurrence was a reasonable incident of the employment, and arose out of and in the course thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 286-87. In the court\u2019s words, .. the parking lot was part of the employer\u2019s precincts although not under the employer\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We are persuaded that where a sufficient nexus exists between the injury sustained, the place where it is sustained, without regard to its ownership, control or maintenance, and the incidents of employment, the injury occurs on the \u201cpremises\u201d of the employer and is therefore compensable. Relevant to the determination of the sufficiency of the nexus is the extent to which the nature of the business and its location contemplated or required the employee to be where the injury occurred. We hold that a shopping center parking lot over which the employer has no ownership interest or right of control is part of the \u201cpremises\u201d of the employer for purposes of the workmen\u2019s compensation law when the parking lot is provided without restriction for the convenience of the public, the employees and the employer and is the \u201cnormal and customary means to and from [the] employer\u2019s premises to which such [parking lot is] an indispensable appurtenance\u201d. It follows that an employee injured on such parking lot while coming to or from his or her place of employment is \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d Under these circumstances, the fact of ownership or control of the parking lot is not material; the only material issue is the limits of the employer\u2019s premises. And in this case that issue was a question of law. We discern no error in the grant of the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">.
