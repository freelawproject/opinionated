Those serials may have been the inspiration for the instant case, <em>William R. Greco v. State of Maryland, </em>because in one form or another this matter has appeared in the appellate courts at least nine times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>This appeal had its genesis in the attorney general\u2019s investigation into Medicaid fraud at a Prince George\u2019s County hospital, as well as a closely related nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In what may prove to be the final chapter in this serial, we are asked to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">I. Whether the prosecution for the offense of Medicaid fraud was barred by the passage of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">II. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to enter a judgment of acquittal despite Greco\u2019s claim that the State failed to prove that the alleged offense occurred in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">III. Whether the trial court erred in entering an order of restitution, notwithstanding Greco\u2019s acquittal on all counts of unlawful receipt of money, goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Before deciding the issues put to us by Greco, we shall first relate the factual predicate from which this case arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The newly created Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of The Attorney General began an investigation in August 1981 concerning suspected large-scale fraud on the part of a closely related hospital and nursing home, and its employees, owners, and administrators. Dr. William R. Greco, the administrator and co-owner of the nursing home, was the target of the probe. The direct result of the percontation was that Dr. Greco was indicted by the Grand Jury of Baltimore City. The indictment as handed up consisted of six counts of Medicaid fraud, three counts of obtaining money under false pretenses, and one count of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Prior to trial, Greco moved to dismiss the indictment on two grounds: 1) improper venue; and 2) that prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. A pretrial hearing was held on the motion challenging venue. The Chief of Management and Services for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), the agency which administers the Medicaid program in this State, testified concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>procedures for filing and processing statements of reimbursable cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We glean from the record that the system entails ongoing reimbursement based on the health care provider\u2019s estimate of total reimbursable cost for a given year, with a subsequent adjustment based on the actual cost incurred during that year. In order for the system to function properly, the health care provider must submit two annual cost reports: an Interim Rate Calculation (IRC), and a Statement of Reimbursable Cost (SRC). An IRC is a statement of projected reimbursable cost, while the SRC is a statement of actual cost incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">During the period covered by the indictment, both the IRC and the SRC were to be filed with Hospital Cost Analysis Services (HCAS) located in Baltimore County. HCAS is or was a private business that contracted with the State to audit IRCs and SRCs that were submitted by nursing homes. Its function was to collect and review the information submitted by certain health care providers and to recommend to DHMH a per diem payment rate per patient. It was DHMH\u2019s responsibility to conduct a patient census at the various health care facilities and to enter that information, along with the payment rate, into its computer so as to determine the amount of money payable to each facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">After considering the testimony adduced at the hearing, the trial judge determined that venue was proper in Baltimore City. He denied Greco\u2019s motion. The judge also ruled that the action brought against Greco was not barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Following a nonjury trial, Greco was convicted on six counts, namely: a false statement in SRCs for the years 1977 (Count 1), 1978 (Count 2), and 1979 (Count 3); a false statement in IRCs for the years 1978 (Count 4), 1979 (Count 5), and 1980 (Count 6). Dr. Greco was acquitted of the remaining counts which included three charges of obtaining money by false pretenses and one count of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The doctor was sentenced to concurrent five year terms of imprisonment on each of the six counts of Medicaid fraud. All but eighteen months of the sentence were suspended. Dr. Greco was also required to perform eighteen months of community service, and was fined $60,000. Additionally, the doctor was ordered to pay to the State $50,000 as restitution. Aggrieved by the convictions and resulting sentences, Greco noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Any additional facts necessary for a better understanding of a particular issue will be supplied during the course of the particular discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">I. <em>Is the prosecution barred by statute of limitations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Dr. Greco contends that his convictions on the Medicaid fraud counts must be reversed because the prosecution for those offenses was not initiated within three years of the crimes. The statute upon which Greco bottoms his argument is Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-106. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\u201cProsecution for misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">(a) One year. \u2014 Except as provided by this section, a prosecution for a misdemeanor not made punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute shall be instituted within one year after the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">(b) Two years. \u2014 A prosecution under the vehicle code shall be instituted within two years after the offense was committed if the charge is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">(1) Unlawfully using a driver\u2019s license; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">(2) Fraudulently using a false or fictitious name when applying for a driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\">(c) Thirty days. \u2014 A prosecution for Sabbath breaking or drunkenness shall be instituted within 30 days after the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\">(d) Same. \u2014 Prosecution for selling alcoholic beverages in Allegany County. \u2014 In Allegany County, a prosecution for selling alcoholic beverages to a person under the legal age for drinking such alcoholic beverages or for selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>alcoholic beverages after hours shall be instituted within 30 days after the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">(e) Offenses under election laws or conflict of interest laws, criminal malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance. \u2014A prosecution for the commission of or the attempt to commit a misdemeanor constituting: (1) a criminal offense under the State election laws; or (2) a criminal offense under the State conflict of interest laws; or (3) criminal malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office committed by an officer of the State, or of an agency of the State, or of a political subdivision of the State, or of a bicounty or multicounty agency in the State shall be instituted within two years after the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">(f) Conspiracy to commit offenses enumerated in subsection (e). \u2014 A prosecution for conspiracy to commit any of the offenses enumerated in subsection (e) shall be instituted within two years after the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">(g) Welfare fraud. \u2014 A prosecution for a welfare offense under Article 27, \u00a7 230A of the Code shall be instituted within three years after the offense was committed ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">(h) Medicaid fraud. \u2014 A prosecution for the offense of Medicaid fraud under Article 27, \u00a7 230B of this Code shall be instituted within 3 years after the offense was committed. (1980, ch. 97.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Greco maintains that although the statute as a whole appears to apply only to misdemeanors, subsection (h) is applicable to felonies. Proceeding from that premise, Greco states that even though he was charged with six counts of <em>felony </em>Medicaid fraud, prosecution of those offenses was barred by limitations. To reach that conclusion, one has to divorce subsection (h) from the statute as a whole and consider it as an independent provision totally unrelated to the purported subject of \u00a7 5-106, \u201cProsecution for misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The caption to \u00a7 5-106 takes on particular significance inasmuch as that caption was a part of the original enactment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 386-87 n. 2, 444 A.2d 1024, 1026 n. 2 (1982), made crystalline that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cCode (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.) Art. 1, \u00a7 18, as enacted by Ch. 196 of the Acts of 1961, providing that \u2018[t]he captions or headlines of the several sections of th[e] Code which are printed in bold type, and the captions or headlines of the several subsections ... which are printed in italics ..., are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and subsections\u2019 and 'are not to be deemed or taken as titles of the sections and subsections, or as any part thereof,\u2019 <em>is not applicable in this instance since the captions are found in the original enactment of \u00a7 5f3 by Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">When \u00a7 5-106 is read in the light of <em>Smelser, </em>it is perspicuous that the statute was intended to apply to misdemeanors and only to misdemeanors. It has no application whatsoever to felonies. Consequently, the passage of the three years between the last fraudulent act and the return of the indictment does not bar prosecution. Generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>there is no statute of limitations on felonies committed in and contrary to the laws of this State. <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 463, 467, 443 A.2d 1003, 1006 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The amendment to \u00a7 5-106 by the enactment of Ch. 97 of the Laws of 1980 does not, as Greco asserts, alter the application of <em>Smelser </em>to the instant case. Indeed, Ch. 97 declared that it was,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cFOR the purpose of <em>amending </em>the statute of limitations for medicaid fraud; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">BY <em>adding </em>to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">Article \u2014 Courts and Judicial Proceedings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt\">Section 5-106(h)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">Annotated Code of Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">(1974 Volume and 1979 Supplement)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">We think it beyond question that subsections (b) through (h) of \u00a7 5-106 are statutorily created exceptions to the one year statute of limitations generally applicable to commencement of prosecution for misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">If, as we herein hold, Courts Art. \u00a7 5-106 does not bar prosecution for felony Medicaid fraud, what, if any, period of limitations applies? The answer, of course, is none. Maryland, as we said in <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md.App. at 467, 443 A.2d at 1006, does not recognize a period of limitations in felony cases. In this State a prosecution for a felony \u201cmay be instituted anytime during the life of the offender.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md.App. at 468, 443 A.2d at 1006, quoting Hochheimer, <em>Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 87 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The trial judge did not err in rejecting Greco\u2019s attempted interposition of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>II. <em>Was venue proper in Baltimore City?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Greco vigorously attacks the trial judge\u2019s ruling that Baltimore City was the proper venue for the trial of this case. Counsel for Greco strenuously asseverated that Greco\u2019s convictions must be reversed because the State failed to demonstrate that the offenses occurred in Baltimore City. The attorney for Greco argued that the SRCs and IRCs were sent for auditing to HCAS, which is or was located in Baltimore County. Hence, it is contended that it was where the SRCs and IRCs were audited that the crimes, if any, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cVenue,\u201d Judge Thompson wrote for this Court in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 346, 348, 319 A.2d 621, 622 (1974), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Md. 258, 340 A.2d 290 (1975), \u201crefers to a particular place or county in which a court of appropriate jurisdiction may properly hear and determine the case in the first instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u201cAt common law criminal offenses were tried by a jury of the county where the offense was committed.\u201d <em>Kisner v. State, </em>209 Md. 524, 529, 122 A.2d 102, 105 (1956), citing 4 Blackstone\u2019s <em>Commentaries </em>* 303. Although the Constitution of Maryland is silent as to venue, Maryland follows the common law rule that the proper venue of a crime is the county where it was committed. <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 371 A.2d 129 (1977). \u201cIt is widely recognized ... that in the absence of any limitation by constitutional provision, the power of the legislature to fix the venue of criminal prosecution in a county other than that in which the crime was committed is unrestricted.\u201d <em>McBurney, </em>280 Md. at 32, 371 A.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The Maryland General Assembly has not seen fit to specify any particular venue with respect to Medicaid fraud cases. Therefore, the common law rule prevails. Having said that, we now turn to the question of where was the offense committed: Prince George\u2019s County, Baltimore County or Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Greco, as we have said, was indicted on six counts of Medicaid fraud (Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 230C); three counts of obtaining money under false pretenses (Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 140); and one count of theft (Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The crux of Greco\u2019s argument relative to venue is that because the offenses proscribed by \u00a7 230C took place wholly outside Baltimore City, venue was not proper in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Greco was accused of Medicaid fraud as specifically defined by Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 230B(b)(1) and (2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201c(1) Knowingly and wilfully making or causing to be made any false statement or representation of a material fact in any application for any benefit or payment under a State plan established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1939;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">(2) Knowingly and wilfully making or causing to be made any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining rights to those benefits or payments____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">This Court, in <em>Roderick v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 120, 125, 262 A.2d 783, 786 (1970), said that a crime perpetrated by fraud is a specific intent crime irrespective of whether the word \u201cintent\u201d is embraced within the definition of the offense. <em>See </em>Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d ed. 1969), p. 765. Courts have been reluctant to define fraud with any degree of preciseness. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that fraud includes the knowing and wilful making of a false statement or false representation of a material fact with the intent and for the purpose of having another rely upon that false statement or false representation to his or her detriment. <em>Suburban Properties Management, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>236 Md. 455, 460, 204 A.2d 326, 329 (1964); <em>Appel v. Hupfield, </em>198 Md. 374, 84 A.2d 94 (1951). That is the precise situation in the instant case. With the intent of defrauding the State, Greco caused to be prepared SRCs and IRCs that he knew, or should have known, contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>false material statements. When Greco forwarded the SRCs and IRCs to HCAS in Towson, Baltimore County, it was with the continuing intent to defraud the State. HCAS\u2019s approval of the SRCs and IRCs and transmittal to DHMH in Baltimore City for payment were in furtherance of Greco\u2019s fraudulent scheme to defraud the State. We think it patent that Greco\u2019s fraudulent endeavor began in Prince George\u2019s County, continued into Baltimore County, and persisted in Baltimore City. The fraud by Greco was a continuing offense that could have been tried in either county or in Baltimore City. <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 371 A.2d 129 (1977). That the State opted to prosecute in Baltimore City instead of either of the two counties was its prerogative and furnishes no reason for Greco to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">III. <em>Was restitution properly ordered?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Greco\u2019s final contention is that the trial court improperly ordered restitution because the judge acquitted Greco of all counts of unlawfully obtaining money from the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Notwithstanding that the trial judge found that the State had failed to prove that appellant unlawfully received any monies from the Medicaid program, he ordered Greco to make restitution to the State in the amount of $50,000. The judge apparently relied on \u00a7 230D(a)(l), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1u\">\u201c(a) Every person convicted of the crime of Medicaid fraud in which the value of the money, services, or goods involved is $500 or more is guilty of a felony, and shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">(1) Make full restitution of the money, services, or goods, or the value of those services or goods <em>unlawfully </em>received____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The trial judge\u2019s entry of a verdict of not guilty as to all counts alleging unlawful receipt of money is obviously inconsistent with the order of restitution under \u00a7 230D(a)(1). The language of \u00a7 230D(a)(1) is clear. Resti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tution shall be ordered for money, services, or goods \u201cunlawfully received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u201cRestitution,\u201d according to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(5th ed. 1979), is the \u201c[a]ct of restoring ... making good or giving equivalent for any loss, damage or injury----\u201d An order of restitution is a means of making the injured party whole, <em>i.e., </em>restoring him, her or it to the <em>status quo. </em>Restitution is not a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The judge, having found as fact that Greco did not unlawfully receive monies from the State in violation of \u00a7 230D(a)(l), should not have ordered restitution. We vacate that part of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED, EXCEPT AS TO THE ORDER TO MAKE RESTITUTION, WHICH IS VACATED.
