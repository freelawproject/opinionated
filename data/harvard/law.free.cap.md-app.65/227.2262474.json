In 1981, the appellees, McKendree and Mildred Fulks, transferred about 33 acres of land to Kettler Brothers, Inc., for $335,950. Pursuant to Montgomery County Code \u00a7 52-21(e), the Fulkses paid a 6 percent Montgomery County rezoning transfer tax on the transaction; but, due to a mix-up, the county did not at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tempt to collect the 2 percent State agricultural transfer tax imposed by Md.Ann.Code, Art. 81, \u00a7 278F.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In 1982, appellant Montgomery County, Maryland, sued appellees in the circuit court for that county. Montgomery County filed the action as the collector of the 2 percent State agricultural transfer tax. Its goal was to recover that tax from Mr. and Mrs. Fulks. The appellees defended on the ground that \u00a7 278F(j) imposes a 6 percent ceiling on aggregate State and local transfer taxes that arise from a single transaction. Because they had already paid a county transfer tax of 6 percent, they argued that they owed nothing further. Two other parties, Smart Ltd. and Route Limited Partnership, were permitted to intervene in the action, both as defendants and as counterclaimants. In the latter capacity, the intervenors sought to recover local rezoning transfer taxes they had paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When this case went before Circuit Court Judge Cave the first time, the court found for the principal defendants, holding that the Montgomery County rezoning transfer tax was subject to the 6 percent cap of \u00a7 278F(j). This court dismissed the appellant\u2019s subsequent appeal because the intervenors\u2019 counterclaim was not disposed of; hence, a final judgment in the case was never rendered. <em>Montgomery County v. Fulks, </em>No. 1132, Sept.Term, 1983 (unreported; filed June 19, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">On January 30, 1985, the circuit court entered a final order in which it vacated the order permitting Smart Ltd. and Route Limited Partnership to intervene, granted the appellees\u2019 request for summary judgment, and ordered that the 6 percent rezoning transfer tax be offset against the 2 percent State \u201cagricultural transfer tax\u201d under \u00a7 278F(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Whether the Montgomery County <em>rezoning </em>transfer tax is subject to the 6 percent cap imposed by \u00a7 278F(j) as the circuit court found, or whether \u00a7 278F(j) places a ceiling only on the county <em>agricultural </em>transfer tax is the principal question presented to us. We conclude that the circuit court correctly construed \u00a7 278F(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>As prelude to a discussion of this tax ceiling issue, however, we consider appellees\u2019 contention that this appeal is barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The appellees argue that our decision in <em>Montgomery County v. Johnston, </em>No. 1486, Sept.Term, 1983 (filed June 19, 1984) bars this appeal by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Johnston </em>involved a now-repealed statute, but a legal issue virtually identical to the principal issue in this case. Appellant says that Md.Rule 1085 invalidates appellees\u2019 argument and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Johnston </em>was filed on June 19, 1984, the same date on which our first <em>Fulks </em>was filed. The judgment now on appeal was not entered until January 30, 1985. During that interval of over seven months, no issue of collateral estoppel was raised below and, obviously, the issue was not decided below. As a general principle, Rule 1085 bars raising the issue of collateral estoppel for the first time on appeal. <em>Huester v. Clements, </em>252 Md. 641, 250 A.2d 855 (1969); <em>City of Frederick v. Quinn, </em>35 Md.App. 626, 371 A.2d 724 (1977). We see no reason not to apply that principle here.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>Tax Ceiling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">To place the tax ceiling issue in context, it is necessary to outline certain State and local tax statutes and to explain the status of the appellees vis a vis those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\n<em>The Tax Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">By Chapter 633, Laws of 1968, the General Assembly authorized the county council for Montgomery County \u201cto levy and impose ... a tax to be paid and collected on the transfer ... of any fee simple interest in real property----\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Montgomery County Code (1977 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 52-20(a). This transfer tax may not exceed \u201c[s]ix percent of the ... consideration for any transfer of land ... which, while owned by the transferor, has been assessed at any time during the five years preceding transfer on the basis of being actively devoted to farm or agricultural use.\u201d \u00a7 52-20(a)(l). Nor may it exceed \u201c[s]ix percent of the ... consideration for any transfer of real property which, after the effective date of any such rate of tax has been rezoned to a more intensive use____\u201d \u00a7 52-20(a)(2). <em>See Vournas v. Montgomery County, </em>53 Md.App. 243, 246, 452 A.2d 1263 (1982), <em>aff'd, </em>300 Md. 123, 476 A.2d 705 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Section 52-21 of the county code levies the transfer tax. Subsection (d) implements \u00a7 52-20(a)(l) by providing for a tax ranging from <em>2xh </em>percent to 6 percent on the transfer of agricultural property. Subsection (e) implements \u00a7 52-20(a)(2) by providing for a tax of 6 percent on the transfer of rezoned property. If a transfer is taxable under both subsections (d) and (e) of \u00a7 52-21, only the subsection (e) (rezoning) rate is collectible. Section 52-21(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">It is the interplay between these county laws and Art. 81, \u00a7 278F that produces the problem in this case. Section 278F was enacted by Ch. 808, Laws of 1981, entitled \u201cagricultural Transfer Tax\u201d and declared to be \u201cFOR the purpose of repealing the agricultural development tax; imposing a tax on the transfer of agricultural land under certain circumstances; ... [and] providing certain restrictions on local agricultural transfer taxes____\u201d The section establishes \u201can agricultural transfer tax ... on every written instrument conveying title to real property\u201d subject to exceptions not relevant here. Section 278F(a). The maximum rate of tax is 5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer for land (20 acres or more) assessed for agricultural use and 4 percent of the consideration for land (less than 20 acres) assessed on the basis of its agricultural use or on the basis of unimproved land. \u201cThe full tax ... shall be reduced by 25 percent for each consecutive year in which real property taxes were paid on the basis of a nonagri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>cultural use assessment.\u201d Section 278F(b). At the heart of the instant controversy, however, is \u00a7 278F(j) which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">A county may not impose a local transfer tax on the transfer of land subject to the provisions of this section at a rate that is greater than the local transfer tax applicable to improved residential property in that county____ A county may not impose a local transfer tax to a rate, or increase a local transfer tax to a rate, above the rate imposed as of July 1, 1979, on any land subject to the provisions of this section. <em>Furthermore, in any county that has imposed a transfer tax at a rate in excess of the rate of transfer tax levied on improved residential property, the combination of the state and local transfer tax rates may not exceed 5 percent plus the rate applicable to improved residential </em>property.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <em>If the combined rates exceed the maximum allowable rate, the tax imposed by this section shall be collected in full, and the local tax shall be reduced as required </em>[emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Upon What Does \u00a7 278F(j) Impose a Ceiling?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The parties agree that on the facts of this case, \u00a7 278F(j) imposes a 6 percent ceiling on local transfer taxes. They disagree on whether that ceiling applies to the total local tax imposed on a transfer of property or only to the agricultural land portion of such a tax. If Montgomery County is right in its argument that the latter construction is correct, then the Fulkses owe the full State agricultural tax and must pay this in addition to the local transfer tax they have already paid. If the opposite construction of \u00a7 278F(j) is correct, then the Fulkses owe the State tax but since their total transfer taxes may not exceed 6 percent, the amount collected from them by Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>should be reduced by 2 percent \u2014 the amount of the State tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The issue before us, then, is one of statutory construction. \u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n For Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980). That intent is normally to be sought from the language of the statute itself. <em>Pineland Lumber Co. v. Miles, </em>228 Md. 584, 587-88, 180 A.2d 870 (1962). If that language \u201cis plain and free of ambiguity and has a definite and sensible meaning, such is conclusively presumed to be the meaning of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Preissman, </em>22 Md.App. 454, 459, 323 A.2d 637, <em>cert. den., </em>272 Md. 747 (1974). It is only where the statutory language is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning that we venture beyond that language to consider such extrinsic aids to construction as legislative history, <em>Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, </em>294 Md. 183, 189, 448 A.2d 353 (1982), the relationship between various portions of a statute and the purpose to be accomplished by the statute, <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 245-46, 465 A.2d 1126 (1983), long-standing administrative interpretations, <em>Holy Cross Hospital v. Health Services Cost Review Comm., </em>283 Md. 677, 684, 393 A.2d 181 (1978), and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Maryland courts should be cautious in this area and avoid creating ambiguity where none exists. <em>See Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 237 A.2d 35 (1968). Also courts should be wary of inserting words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning. <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 224 A.2d 677 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The case before us involves a tax issue, and in tax matters in particular, Maryland courts often have been strict constructionists, relying heavily on the plain meaning of the words. They have also tended to favor the interpretation proffered by the taxpayer when the meaning of the statute is in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Scoville Service, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>269 Md. 390, 306 A.2d 534 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">In interpreting a tax statute, we may not extend its provisions by implication beyond the clear import of the language employed; and even where there is doubt as to the scope of the statute, although we find none here, it should be construed most strongly in favor of the citizen \u2022 and against the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Scoville Service, </em>269 Md. at 396, 306 A.2d 534 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Two tax cases deserve special mention. In <em>Maryland National Bank v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation, </em>57 Md.App. 269, 469 A.2d 907, <em>cert. den., </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1344 (1984), this court interpreted the words \u201cincome taxes.\u201d This court found that the plural use of the term compelled the determination that it included any taxes based on income imposed by the State. \u201cHad the legislature intended that only \u2018the\u2019 income \u2018tax\u2019 was intended, it certainly would have interposed that article, \u2018the,\u2019 or even \u2018an,\u2019 to so specify.\u201d <em>Maryland National Bank, </em>57 Md.App. at 273, 469 A.2d 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Also, in <em>Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation, </em>252 Md. 173, 249 A.2d 180 (1969), the court refused to narrow the scope of a tax exemption for aircraft engaged in commerce by tacking restrictive language onto the word \u201caircraft.\u201d \u201cThe General Assembly could have added these words,\u201d the court stated, \u201cbut the plain fact is that it chose not to add such qualifying language.\u201d <em>Atlantic, </em>252 Md. at 181, 249 A.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">In support of its position, Montgomery County asserts that the phrases \u201clocal transfer tax,\u201d \u201clocal transfer tax rates,\u201d and \u201clocal tax\u201d are ambiguous as used in Art. 81, \u00a7 278F(j). It then offers a melange of legislative history and other aids to construction to demonstrate that those phrases should really read \u201clocal <em>agricultural </em>transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tax,\u201d \u201clocal <em>agricultural </em>transfer tax rates,\u201d and \u201clocal <em>agricultural </em>tax.\u201d As the authorities cited in the previous paragraphs teach, however, before we resort to extrinsic aids to construction we must first find that the language in question is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">To persuade us to that conclusion, the county points out that \u201cin determining the meaning of a particular provision or section, even where its language appears to be clear and unambiguous, it is necessary to examine that provision or section in context.\u201d <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. at 245, 465 A.2d 1126. It then notes that the title to Ch. 808, Laws of 1981 (the Act that adopted \u00a7 278F) states that one purpose of the Act is \u201cproviding certain restrictions on local agricultural transfer taxes.\u201d Additionally, the county directs our attention to subsections (h) and (i). The former provides that \u201c[t]wo-thirds of the money collected by the tax collecting authorities of the various subdivisions, and in Montgomery County one-third of the money collected as long as that county continues to impose a transfer tax similar to that imposed by Montgomery County Code section 52-21(d) (1979)\u201d shall be paid into the Maryland Agricultural Preservation Fund. The latter, using similar language as to Montgomery County, provides for local use of the remaining portion of the tax collected. According to Montgomery County, these provisions render it at least doubtful whether subsection (j) places a ceiling on the full local transfer tax or merely on the agricultural portion of it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On its face, the language of subsection (j) is clear and free from doubt. There is no ambiguity in the phrase \u201clocal transfer tax on the transfer of land\u201d or in the similar terms used in the subsection. It is apparent that this language refers to what \u00a7 52-20(a) of the Montgomery County Code itself designates <em>\u201ca </em>tax ... on the transfer ... of any fee simple interest in real property____\u201d [emphasis supplied]. Section 52-20 appears under the heading \u201cReal Property Transfer Tax\u201d as does \u00a7 52-21 which levies that single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>property transfer tax at various rates depending on the prior history of the land involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The earlier provisions of \u00a7 278F do not make subsection (j)\u2019s language ambiguous. The portion of the purpose clause of the title stressed by the county was not in the original bill (Senate Bill 991). It was added by amendment, as were the specific references to Montgomery County contained in subsections (h) and (i). When those amendments were added, the bill contained a version of subsection (j) which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">A subdivision of the state may not impose a local transfer tax upon the transfer of agricultural land subject to this section at a rate that is greater than the local transfer tax imposed on improved residential property in that subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This was deleted and the language of present subsection (j) was substituted by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We think that the title amendment referred to the concurrent amendments to subsections (h) and (i) \u2014 both of which demonstrate that the legislature was well aware of the Montgomery County Code and could make specific reference to it when it so desired. That it did not do so in subsection (j) displays an intent that the tax ceiling imposed by that subsection is intended to mean exactly what its plain language states \u2014 the ceiling applies to the local transfer tax and all its varying rates. <em>See Maryland National Bank v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation, </em>57 Md.App. 269, 469 A.2d 907, <em>cert. den., </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1344 (1984). This interpretation both accords the words of \u00a7 278F(j) their ordinary and natural meaning, and does not render any portion of \u00a7 278F surplusage or meaningless. <em>Mazor v. State Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360-61, 369 A.2d 82 (1977). The legislative intent plainly expressed is to place a cap on the total tax that may be exacted when land is transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In short, Judge Cave correctly held that \u00a7 278F(j) is unambiguous and that it imposes a ceiling on a local trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>fer tax regardless of the rate imposed on the transfer by \u00a7 52-21 of the county code.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
